2:27:1260:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Relying upon a standard New Keynesian DSGE, we propose an explanation for two empirical findings
2:28:1356:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:in the international finance literature. First, the unbiasedness hypothesis – the proposition that expost
2:29:1461:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:exchange rate depreciation matches interest differentials – is rejected much more strongly at short
2:30:1560:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:horizons than at long. Second, even at long horizons, the unbiasedness hypothesis tends to be rejected
2:31:1662:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:when one of the currencies has experienced a long period of low interest rates, such as in Japan and
2:32:1762:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:Switzerland. Using a calibrated New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we
2:33:1856:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:show how a monetary policy rule can induce the negative (positive) correlation between depreciation
2:34:1955:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:and interest differentials at short (long) horizons. The tendency to reject unbiasedness for Japan and
2:35:2057:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:Switzerland even at long horizons we attribute to the interaction of the monetary reaction function
2:36:2156:14:42:72:197:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:and the zero lower bound.

3:68:3662:52:30:71:175:250:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:1  Introduction
3:69:3677:30:13:71:541:220:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:One of the most enduring empirical regularities in the internationalfinance literature is the rejection
3:70:3780:13:14:71:542:207:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of the joint hypothesis of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) and rational expectations. According
3:71:3880:14:13:71:541:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to the unbiasedness hypothesis, the interest rate differential between two countries should be an
3:72:3977:13:14:71:543:180:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:unbiased predictor of the change in the exchange rate between them. Chinn and Meredith (2004)
3:73:4070:14:16:71:544:166:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:document the continued failure of the unbiasedness hypothesis tohold for horizons of up to a year.

4:80:4737:0:13:71:542:693:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:But they also document that at horizons of greater than a year, the unbiasedness hypothesis holds
4:81:4834:13:19:71:421:680:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:better, so that at the ten year horizon, the hypothesis cannot be rejected.
4:82:4909:19:14:88:541:661:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Chinn and Quayyum (2013) update the results in Chinn and Meredith, using data ranging up to
4:83:5000:14:19:71:525:647:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:2012. They confirm the finding that unbiasedness holds better at longer horizons than at short.
4:84:5095:19:14:88:544:628:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Chinn and Meredith attribute their finding to the greater endogeneity of the short term rate,
4:85:5188:14:13:72:544:614:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:given a Taylor-rule type central bank reaction function. They demonstrate that a Keynesian model
4:86:5284:13:14:72:541:601:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:incorporating sticky prices and model consistent expectations and importantly a random shock in
4:87:5379:14:19:72:501:587:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the uncovered interest parity relation can replicate the pattern ofunbiasedness rejections.
4:88:5470:19:14:88:542:568:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:One key difference between the findings using the shorter and longersample periods is that in the
4:89:5567:14:13:72:542:554:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample encompassing the Great Recession, and the encounter with thezero lower bound (ZLB), the
4:90:5661:13:14:72:542:541:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:tendency to reject the unbiasedness, even at the long horizon, increases. Even before the onset of the
4:91:5763:14:13:72:543:527:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:financial crisis, several countries had short term interest rates near the zero interest bound. Perhaps
4:92:5866:13:14:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:more importantly for our results, long term interest rates were particularly quite low in Japan and
4:93:5965:14:19:72:405:500:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Switzerland, two currencies for which the estimated is noticeably low.
4:94:6035:19:14:88:541:481:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:At first glance, there is no particular reason why the unbiasedness hypothesis should not hold
4:95:6129:14:13:72:542:467:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:when short and/or long term rates strike the zero interest bound, as expected exchange rate changes
4:96:6228:13:14:72:541:454:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:could adjust to make the parity condition hold. However, it seems worthwhile to investigate the
4:97:6323:14:13:72:541:440:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sensitivity of the estimates to inclusion of the low-interest rate period. We arbitrarily define 1996Q1
4:98:6426:13:14:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:as the low interest rate period for these two countries. Estimating the Fama regression on long horizon
4:99:6529:14:13:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:data, allowing for a slope break at 1996Q1, indicates that post-1996 the unbiasedness relationship
4:100:6627:13:20:72:526:400:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:breaks down, with the slope coefficient significantly different and negative in the latter period.
4:101:6725:20:13:88:542:380:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The advent of low long term interest rates in Japan and Switzerland is associated with the
4:102:6815:13:14:72:543:367:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attenuation of evidence for the unbiasedness hypothesis at the long horizon  for currency pairs
4:103:6910:14:13:72:541:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:involving these countries.  However, it is not an explanation, as uncovered interest parity is an
4:104:7007:13:19:72:163:340:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:arbitrage condition.
4:105:7027:19:14:88:538:321:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:There are two key motivations for this paper.  The first is to show that aconventional New
4:106:7117:14:14:72:543:307:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model can yield the implication that
4:107:7209:14:13:72:542:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:under normal conditions, the long horizon Fama coefficient is positive,and greater than the short
4:108:7306:13:14:72:542:280:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:horizon coefficient (which is typically negative) with only a minor modification. The second is to
4:109:7404:14:13:72:544:266:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:demonstrate that when there is a substantial likelihood of encountering the zero lower bound (ZLB),
4:110:7503:13:19:72:294:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the long horizon Fama coefficient will be lower.
4:111:7551:19:14:88:541:234:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In the next section we briefly review unbiasedness hypothesis andnew empirical results.  In
4:112:7642:14:14:72:542:220:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Section 3, the model derivation is presented, and summarized in Section 3.11.  In Section 4, the
4:113:7738:14:13:72:542:206:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:model calibration is shown. Sections 5 and 6 present, respectively, the calibration results without
4:114:7837:13:40:72:319:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and with the zero lower bound. Section 7 concludes.

4:116:7912:30:14:71:542:123:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The UIP hypothesis states, if investors are risk neutral, and there are no barriers to cross-border
4:117:8011:14:13:71:541:109:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:capital flows, then the return from investing a unit amount in a riskfree bond in the home currency

5:122:8389:30:14:88:542:625:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Obviously, this hypothesis is difficult to test since the market’s subjective expectation of the
5:123:8485:14:13:71:543:611:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:exchange rate is unobservable. The typical recourse adopted by researchers is to adopt the rational
5:124:8584:13:14:71:543:598:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:expectations hypothesis, so that the subjective market expectation equals the mathematical (condi-
5:125:8682:14:13:71:543:584:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:tional) expectation. Under the rational expectations hypothesis, the actual value of the future spot

5:129:8966:14:13:71:98:508:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:yields:
5:130:8973:13:20:239:543:495:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f6:A:st+k−st= (it,k−i∗t,k) +εt+k(3)
5:131:9003:20:14:72:541:475:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The resulting unbiasedness hypothesis is usually tested usingthe following specification, often referred
5:132:9107:14:24:72:261:461:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to as the Fama regression (Fama, 1984):

5:134:9178:25:13:72:542:412:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:where the expected value ofβaccording to the hypothesis is 1. The maintained hypothesis is the
5:135:9272:13:14:72:541:399:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:null hypothesis, and under the unbiasedness null, the errorζt+kis merely the expectations error, and
5:136:9372:14:14:72:542:385:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is orthogonal to the interest rate differential,it,k−i∗t,k. (Under the alternative,ζt+kcould be an error
5:137:9476:14:13:72:544:371:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:term that does not fulfill the rational expectations criteria, and/or a time varying risk premium,
5:138:9574:13:14:72:543:358:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:possibly correlated with the interest differential.) In the regressions reported in this paper, the exact
5:139:9679:14:19:72:319:344:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:formulas are used instead of the log approximations.
5:140:9731:19:13:88:540:325:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Note that the interceptαmay be non zero while testing for UIP using equation (4).  A non

5:145:10125:19:14:88:542:252:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Most of the studies fall into the category employing the rational expectations hypothesis; in our
5:146:10222:14:13:72:542:238:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lexicon, that means they are tests of the unbiasedness hypothesis. Estimates of equation (4) using
5:147:10320:13:14:72:542:225:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:values for k that range up to one year typically reject the unbiasednessrestriction on the slope
5:148:10416:14:13:72:543:211:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:parameter. The widely cited 1990 survey by Froot and Thaler finds an average estimate forβof
5:149:10508:13:14:72:543:198:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:-0.881. Bansal and Dahlquist (2000) provide more mixed results, when examining a broader set of
5:150:10603:14:14:72:542:184:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:advanced and emerging market currencies. They also note that the failure of unbiasedness appears
5:151:10699:14:15:72:541:170:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to depend upon whether the US interest rate is above or below the foreign2. Frankel and Poonawala
5:152:10796:15:15:84:543:155:6:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f9:F:1Similar results are cited in surveys by MacDonald and Taylor (1992) and Isard (1995). Meese and Rogoff (1983)
5:153:10906:15:11:72:543:140:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:show that the forward rate is outpredicted by a random walk, which isconsistent with the failure of the unbiasedness
5:154:11022:11:7:72:114:129:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:hypothesis.
5:155:11033:7:15:84:542:122:6:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f9:F:2Flood and Rose (1996, 2002) note that including currency crisesand devaluations, one finds more evidence for the

6:157:11171:0:13:71:543:693:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(2010) show that for emerging markets more generally, the unbiasedness hypothesis coefficient is
6:158:11267:13:19:71:188:680:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:typically more positive3.
6:159:11292:19:14:88:541:661:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The earliest studies that explored the UIP hypothesis over long horizons include Flood and
6:160:11382:14:14:71:541:647:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Taylor (1997) and Alexius (2001). Flood and Taylor (1997) explores the UIP relationship at three
6:161:11478:14:13:71:542:633:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:year horizon pooling 21 currencies of mostly developed countries, with the U.S. Dollar as the base
6:162:11576:13:14:71:543:620:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:currency. They estimateβto be 0.596 with a standard error of 0.195. However, the bond yields
6:163:11668:14:13:71:543:606:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:used are heterogeneous, with varying maturities, so are difficult to interpret. Alexius (2001) finds
6:164:11768:13:14:71:541:593:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:evidence of UIP holding at long horizon using 14 long term bonds of varying maturities, using a
6:165:11863:14:13:71:544:579:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample from 1957-97. As the sample encompasses the Bretton Woods era and the associated capital
6:166:11958:13:20:71:422:566:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:control regime, those findings are perhaps not applicable in current times.
6:167:12033:20:13:88:541:546:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Chinn and Meredith (2004) tested the UIP hypothesis at five year and ten year horizons for the
6:168:12127:13:14:71:541:533:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Group of Seven (G7) countries, and found greater support for the unbiasedness hypothesis holding
6:169:12223:14:13:71:542:519:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:at these long horizons than in shorter horizons of three to twelve months. The estimated coefficient
6:170:12323:13:14:71:541:506:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on the interest rate differentials were positive and were closer to the value of unity than to zero in
6:171:12425:14:13:71:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:general. The sample used in that paper extended up to 2000. Figure 1 depicts the indicated pattern

6:187:13550:14:11:72:542:173:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:Chinn and Frankel (1994) document that it is difficult to reject UIPfor a broad set of currencies when using survey
6:188:13665:11:11:72:542:162:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:based forecasts. Similar results are obtained by Chinn (2014), when extending the data up to 2009. These results echo
6:189:13782:11:11:72:543:151:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:early findings by Froot and Frankel (1989). While we do not pursue this avenue in this paper (long horizon expectations
6:190:13901:11:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:being difficult to obtain), it is useful to recall these findings when interpreting rejections of the joint hypothesis of UIP
6:191:14026:11:7:72:174:129:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:and rational expectations.

12:547:22519:13:14:71:541:547:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:expectations is not systematic. Evidence that market expectations are not unbiased comes from a

15:745:26654:30:14:72:543:364:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:In this section, we calibrate the model and show that the calibrated New Keynesian model captures
15:746:26751:14:13:72:544:350:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the pre-ZLB (1975Q1-1995Q4) volatility of Japanese 3-month T-bill rate and depreciation of nominal
15:747:26849:13:14:72:541:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:exchange rate (with U.S. dollar as the base currency). We focus on interest rate and depreciation
15:748:26946:14:13:72:542:323:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of nominal exchange rate because this paper is about whether interest rate ZLB would affect the
15:749:27041:13:35:72:223:310:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:coefficient of Fama regression10.
15:750:27074:35:27:72:213:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:4.1  Empirical Moments
15:751:27096:27:13:72:542:248:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The Japanese data come from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. We use
15:752:27191:13:14:72:542:235:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:quarterly observations on Japanese 3-month T-bill rate and depreciation of(log) nominal exchange
15:753:27287:14:13:72:542:221:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:rate, starting from 1975Q1 to 1995Q4. The motivation for choosing such sample period is that it
15:754:27382:13:14:72:542:208:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:starts from the flexible exchange rate regime, and ends before the advent of the ZLB interest rate
15:755:27480:14:13:72:541:194:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:regime11. We also use U.S. 3-month T-bill rate from Federal Reserve Board’s H.15 release as the
15:756:27575:13:32:71:510:181:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:world interest rate. The variance and 90% confidence intervals are summarized as follows12:
15:757:27666:32:16:259:355:149:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:[Table 1 about here.]
15:758:27687:16:15:80:543:133:6:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f9:F:10We can also match the moments for other macroeconomic variables, e.g., output by imposing habit persistence
15:759:27796:15:11:72:542:118:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:structure. We do not impose such structure because it brings unnecessary complication without helping us understand
15:760:27911:11:7:72:145:107:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:the nature of ZLB.
15:761:27929:7:11:80:360:100:6:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f9:A:11Following Chinn and Meredith (2004), Chinn and Quayyum (2013).
15:762:27993:11:0:80:497:89:6:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f9:A:12Both the depreciation rate and the interest rate are expressed at annual rate, i.e., percent per annum.
16:763:28100:0:26:71:234:693:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:4.2  Theoretical Predictions
16:764:28128:26:31:71:301:667:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We impose the following additional assumptions:
16:765:28175:31:22:85:508:636:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:1. There is no structure change during the period under consideration (1975Q1-1995Q4).
16:766:28261:22:13:85:542:614:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:2. Without loss of generality, foreign/world economic variables (output, interest rate, etc.) are
16:767:28358:13:23:99:211:601:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:assumed to be constant.
16:768:28381:23:24:85:462:578:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:3. All shocks are assumed to be either white noise or stationary AR(1) process:
16:769:28460:24:16:269:364:554:11:g_d0_f10:8:g_d0_f11:?:uit=ρiuit−1+eit

16:772:28505:24:13:99:543:497:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:whereρi= 0. That is, the interest parity shockuitis an i.i.d white noise, which is consistent
16:773:28598:13:31:99:266:484:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:with our assumption in Section 3.6.
16:774:28633:31:13:88:542:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In our open-economy New Keynesian model, one period is defined as one quarter. We calibrate
16:775:28724:13:14:71:541:440:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and summarize the parameter values in Table 213. The parameter values are standard and mostly
16:776:28817:14:13:71:543:426:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:follow Sanchez (2005), and Braun and K ̈orber (2011). For instance, we set Calvo-pricing parameter
16:777:28915:13:14:71:540:413:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f6:B:ω= 0.89, indicating that Japanese firms reset prices every 9 quarters, which is consistent with
16:778:29010:14:30:71:394:399:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Sanchez (2005)’s estimation that Japan’sωvaries from 0.58 to 0.92.

16:780:29097:31:14:88:544:338:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The variances of the exchange rate depreciation and interest differential implied by the theoretical

16:782:29295:13:40:71:540:311:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:from the actual data (Table 1), and are quite close to the variance estimated from the actual data.

16:785:29464:27:13:71:540:214:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Given the VAR system summarized in Section 3.11 and 4.2, our model has a closed-form solution

16:787:29650:14:24:71:340:187:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Without loss of generality, we shall write the solution as:

17:806:30600:13:14:72:541:359:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:maturities. All the impulse response functions are intuitive. A positive cost shockectindicates a
17:807:30697:14:14:72:543:345:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:decrease in Home productivity. Home output decreases and inflation increases - this is the well-
17:808:30793:14:13:72:544:331:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:known phenomenon of stagflation. After trade-off between inflation and unemployment, the central
17:809:30889:13:14:72:541:318:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:bank will set a higher interest rate to eliminate inflation. This alsobrings an expected depreciation
17:810:30990:14:13:72:541:304:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of Home currency. A positive monetary shockemthas a similar effect. It implies the central bank
17:811:31085:13:14:72:541:291:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:increases interest rate unexpectedly. Obviously it increases interest rate and expected depreciation

19:956:35048:13:14:99:542:176:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:household intertemporal substitution decisions, and determines demand, which in turn, affects
19:957:35141:14:13:99:541:162:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:inflation, output and the exchange rate. However, if the ZLB is binding, such a transmission
19:958:35233:13:14:99:547:149:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:mechanism is shut down. When the shocksuit,uct, andumtenter in the determination ofit,
19:959:35319:14:22:99:373:135:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f6:A:itwill remain at zero, and these disturbances are blocked.

20:962:35524:13:14:99:543:680:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The households are able to anticipate this situation ahead of time, so they will adjust their

20:964:35668:28:14:88:541:638:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:With these changes, a closed-form solution no longer exists, and we cannot deriveplimˆβas in

20:969:36098:16:14:71:542:565:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is large, then ZLB does not bind very often. When it does bind, it is most likely triggered by a

20:971:36292:14:13:71:542:537:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by “Random ZLB”. However, if ̄iis small, then ZLB binds more frequently. When it binds, it is
20:972:36385:13:14:71:543:524:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:often triggered by a negativeuct(ect) orumt(emt), and the interest rate series are segmented. i.e.,
20:973:36484:14:13:71:541:510:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ifit= 0, then it is very likely that its adjacent leads and lags are also zero. Ifit>0, then it is very
20:974:36587:13:14:71:543:497:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:likely that its adjacent leads and lags are also positive. This is determined by the different degree of
20:975:36691:14:19:71:512:483:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:persistence and volatility of different shocks. This approach is denoted by “Persistent ZLB”.
20:976:36784:19:13:88:540:464:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Again, we perform stochastic simulations for our model with ZLB constraint. Our simulation
20:977:36874:13:14:71:541:451:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(with ZLB) method follows Holden and Paetz (2012), as well as Erceg and Lind ́e(2014).  Each
20:978:36966:14:14:71:541:437:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:simulation was performed over a 100 periods. This process was repeated 1000 times to generate a
20:979:37061:14:13:71:542:423:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:hypothetical population of 1000 such draws. In our simulation, about half thetime (49.99%) the
20:980:37155:13:14:71:542:410:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:interest hits ZLB. Figure 13 is one such random draw of 100-period simulation, where the interest
20:981:37252:14:13:71:541:396:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ZLB constraint follows “Persistent ZLB” approach. This indicates our simulation is consistent with
20:982:37350:13:14:71:544:383:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the fact that Japan (starting from 1996) set their short term interest rate(close to) zero for several
20:983:37452:14:31:71:153:369:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:consecutive years.
20:984:37470:31:31:254:360:338:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:?:[Figure 13 about here.]
20:985:37493:31:14:88:543:307:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f11:A:With “Persistent ZLB”, most binding ZLB periods are triggered by a negativeuct(ect) orumt
20:986:37582:14:13:71:543:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(emt). That is, the shocksuct(ect) andumt(emt) are suppressed under ZLB constraints. Recall
20:987:37673:13:14:71:541:280:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in Section 5.2, we showed volatility ofuct(ect) andumt(emt) are critical to offset the endogeneity
20:988:37771:14:13:71:541:266:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:caused byuit(eit). Onceuct(ect) andumt(emt) are suppressed by ZLB constraints, the endogeneity
20:989:37865:13:14:71:542:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:problem deteriorates, hence we would expect the constrained Fama regression coefficient to be less
20:990:37963:14:13:71:541:239:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:positive. That is, unbiasedness hypothesis holds worse when interest rate is near ZLB. Such property
20:991:38063:13:32:71:529:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is summarized in Figure 14, and it is consistent with Figure 2, and Chinnand Quayyum (2013).

20:993:38178:16:15:80:547:178:6:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f9:A:20A common mistake is to write the solution asit−i∗t=max{0, c1uit+c2uct+c3umt}andEtst+1−st=it−i∗t−uit.
20:994:38280:15:11:71:544:163:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:This is wrong because it does not take into account the fact thatthe households are able to anticipate ZLB ahead of
20:995:38395:11:7:71:426:152:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:time. Actually, a closed-form solution does not exist when theinterest rate is near ZLB.

21:1000:38692:30:13:71:543:663:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Two empirical findings underpin the exercises conducted in thispaper. First, interest differentials
21:1001:38791:13:14:71:542:650:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:at longer horizons tend to correlate positively with exchange rate depreciation, while those at short
21:1002:38892:14:13:71:542:636:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:horizons tend to correlate negatively. Second, long horizon interest differentials tend to reject the
21:1003:38993:13:14:71:543:623:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:unbiasedness hypothesis more strongly for exchange rates that involve acurrency that has experi-
21:1004:39089:14:13:71:541:609:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:enced low interest rates for an extended period. To the extent that low interest rates are likely to
21:1005:39189:13:14:71:541:596:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:be a part of the global economic landscape for some time, it is of interest toknow why this finding
21:1006:39288:14:19:71:106:582:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:obtains.
21:1007:39296:19:14:88:544:563:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Using a standard New Keynesian DSGE, incorporating sticky prices, weshow how these empirical
21:1008:39388:14:13:71:541:549:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:findings can be rationalized. The long horizon/short horizon dichotomy stylized fact is shown using
21:1009:39487:13:14:71:540:536:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:a random (non-persistent) shock to the UIP relationship, along with persistent aggregate supply and
21:1010:39586:14:13:71:543:522:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:monetary policy shocks. The attenuation in the long horizon unbiasedness in the era of low interest
21:1011:39685:13:52:71:479:509:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:rates is replicated by simulating the NK DSGE in the presence of a zero lower bound.
