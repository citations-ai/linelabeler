2:29:1557:24:32:273:338:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:?:ABSTRACT
2:30:1565:32:14:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Although theoretical models of household behavior often emphasize fiscal foresight, empirical studies
2:31:1666:14:14:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:of household consumption have yet to document the role of news about tax changes. Using novel high-frequency
2:32:1774:14:14:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:bond data, I develop a model of the term structure of municipal yield spreads as a function of future
2:33:1875:14:14:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:top income tax rates and a risk premium. Testing the model using the presidential elections of 1992
2:34:1974:14:14:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:and 2000 as two quasi-natural experiments shows that financial markets forecast future tax rates remarkably
2:35:2081:14:14:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:well in both the short and long run. Combining these market-based tax expectations with data from
2:36:2178:14:14:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:the Consumer Expenditure Survey, I find that spending of higher-income households increases by
2:37:2272:14:14:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:close to 1% in response to news of a 1% increase in expected after-tax lifetime (permanent) income.
2:38:2371:14:14:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:These findings imply that by ignoring anticipation effects, previous estimates of the total effect of
2:39:2472:14:42:72:276:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:a tax change could be substantially biased.

3:47:2654:0:18:75:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper addresses two related questions:  How predictable are personal income tax rates in
3:48:2747:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the U.S., and does household spending respond to news about future taxes even before the rates
3:49:2841:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change?  These are classic questions with broad implications both for policy makers and for applied
3:50:2940:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economists.  For instance, our assessment of the effectiveness of fiscal policy as a tool to stabilize
3:51:3042:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business cycles depends crucially on our ability to capture all behavioral responses to a specific tax
3:52:3144:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reform, including any anticipation effects.  Such anticipation effects in turn depend on whether the
3:53:3244:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax policy is forecastable and whether and to what extent households take such information into
3:54:3339:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account in their decision making.  A major source of disagreements among economists concerning
3:55:3433:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these issues has been the difficulty to credibly identify both the timing and the magnitude of changes
3:56:3535:18:18:57:457:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in expected taxes, and to estimate the household response to such fiscal news.
3:57:3613:18:17:75:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This study tackles these issues as follows:  First,  I measure expected future taxes using novel
3:58:3709:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high-frequency data of municipal bond yields with different maturities.  Second,  I combine these
3:59:3806:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market-based expectations with micro-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to
3:60:3899:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quantify the degree of fiscal foresight by estimating the effect of the tax news shocks on household
3:61:3999:18:18:57:106:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending.
3:62:4008:18:18:75:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In order to identify news about future taxes, I exploit the differential tax treatment of two types
3:63:4107:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  bonds.   Interest  on  municipal  bonds  is  tax-exempt  (including  state  bonds),  while  interest  on
3:64:4215:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Treasury bonds is subject to federal income taxes.  Thus, relative price changes between municipal
3:65:4313:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Treasury bonds reflect changes in expected future tax rates, holding fixed other risk factors.  I
3:66:4414:18:18:57:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:go beyond identifying the timing of news to directly measure the entire path of expected tax rates
3:67:4512:18:18:57:562:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comparing pairs of bonds of different maturities.  The tax news shocks used in this paper therefore
3:68:4611:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measure not onlywhenhouseholds receive information, but alsohow muchinformation they receive.
3:69:4704:18:18:75:562:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Identifying the entire expected path of expected taxes in turn is important when assessing the
3:70:4798:18:17:57:562:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:degree of forward-looking household spending behavior.  Combining the market-based tax news with
3:71:4894:17:18:57:562:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data from the CEX, I calculate changes in expected after-tax lifetime income for each household in
3:72:4992:18:18:57:562:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the survey.  Models with forward-looking households predict that consumption should respond to
3:73:5086:18:18:57:431:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:news aboutallfuture after-tax income, not just current taxes or income.
3:74:5157:18:18:75:562:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Focusing on the sample of higher-income households, for which the identified news shock is most
3:75:5252:18:18:57:562:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly  related  to  changes  in  expected  after-tax  lifetime  income,  I  find  that  household  spending
3:76:5362:18:18:57:562:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responds strongly to the bond-based tax news.  The hypothesis that higher-income households are
3:77:5457:18:18:57:562:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not forward-looking is strongly rejected.  Interpreting the estimated response through the lens of a
3:78:5557:18:18:57:562:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standard life-cycle consumption model,  spending on nondurables and services increases by about
3:79:5652:18:18:57:562:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1% in response to news of a 1% increase in after-tax lifetime income, i.e., with changes in permanent
3:80:5753:18:23:57:96:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income.
3:81:5760:23:18:75:562:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The idea behind the identification approach can be illustrated using a particular short-term and
3:82:5856:18:18:57:562:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:long-term  municipal  yield  spread,  say  a  2-year  and  a  15-year  spread.   All  else  equal,  the  2-year
3:83:5967:18:18:57:562:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spread  reflects  the  bond  market’s  expectation  of  marginal  tax  rates  over  the  next  2 years,  while
3:84:6077:18:0:57:562:66:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 15-year spread contains tax expectations over the next 15 years.  Suppose that new information
4:85:6176:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arrives about a potential tax change in 3 years from today.  This would affect the 15-year but not
4:86:6274:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 2-year yield spread.  Hence, the two yield spreads are informative aboutwhenthose tax changes
4:87:6371:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are expected to occur.  Alternatively,  suppose that market participants learn about a tax reform
4:88:6468:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is expected to be implemented within a year from today.  Such information would have a large
4:89:6565:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:effect  on  the  2-year  spread.   However,  the  effect  on  the  15-year  spread  depends  on  theexpected
4:90:6673:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:persistenceof the reform.  If the reform is expected to be only temporary, then it would not affect
4:91:6772:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this long-run yield spread much.  Hence, the term structure of municipal yield spreads allows us to
4:92:6871:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:infer both the timing and the expected persistence of a tax shock.  Using new data on high-quality
4:93:6969:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:municipal bond yields going back to the late 1970s, I infer the entire path of expected tax rates over
4:94:7071:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a forecasting horizon of up to 30 years at any given point in time and compare it to the subsequent
4:95:7170:18:17:57:260:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evolution of the corresponding tax rate.
4:96:7210:17:18:75:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Of course, there are other factors than expected tax rates that affect municipal yield spreads.
4:97:7305:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  fact,  most  models  of  the  term  structure  of  municipal  yield  spreads  abstract  from  changes  in
4:98:7414:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected tax rates and instead focus on other determinants.  I therefore begin by providing graph-
4:99:7512:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ical,  non-parametric evidence that changes in expected tax rates are indeed an important deter-
4:100:7608:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:minant  of  municipal  yield  spreads,  especially  at  lower  frequencies.   I  then  use  two  quasi-natural
4:101:7718:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiments—the presidential elections in 1992 and 2000—and daily election probabilities from a
4:102:7813:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:political prediction market to formally estimate the degree of fiscal foresight in bond prices during
4:103:7914:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the elections and to identify which marginal tax rate is reflected in the yield spreads.  Changes in
4:104:8014:18:18:57:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  election  probabilities  provide  an  alternative  measure  of  changes  in  expected  future  tax  rates
4:105:8124:18:18:57:562:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because each of the major presidential candidates had a very different tax reform proposal during
4:106:8221:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both  elections,  and  tax  reforms  were  a major  part  of  the  candidates’  election  platforms.   I  show
4:107:8331:18:18:57:562:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the municipal yield spreads indeed respond strongly to changes in the election probabilities
4:108:8428:18:17:57:562:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during both elections, both statistically and economically, and with the expected sign, positively
4:109:8526:17:18:57:562:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with Bill Clinton’s and negatively with George W. Bush’s betting contract, respectively.  Moreover,
4:110:8625:18:18:57:562:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quantitative response in both cases is consistent with differences in the candidates’ proposals
4:111:8724:18:18:57:246:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the top personal income tax rate.
4:112:8761:18:18:75:562:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These quasi-natural experiments allow the yield spreads to be decomposed into tax expectations
4:113:8855:18:18:57:562:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and other factors, but are not available over most of the sample period.  As an alternative approach
4:114:8955:18:18:57:562:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to decomposing the yield spreads, I extend the traditional model of municipal yield spreads to allow
4:115:9055:18:18:57:562:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for changes in expected future tax rates.  The model also takes into account factors other than tax
4:116:9154:18:18:57:562:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:news that can affect the yield spread, such as liquidity and default risk or tax uncertainty.  In order
4:117:9257:18:18:57:562:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to minimize the influence of these other factors in the empirical analysis,  I use taxable and tax-
4:118:9356:18:18:57:562:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exempt bonds that are as similar as possible on all pricing dimensions other than their tax status.
4:119:9455:18:18:57:562:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For  instance,  I  only  use  the  most  liquid  municipal  bonds  with  the  lowest  credit  risk  to  measure
4:120:9566:18:18:57:562:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the tax-exempt yield curve, specifically AAA-rated general obligation state bonds.  For the taxable
4:121:9665:18:18:57:363:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield curve, I use the less liquid off-the-run Treasury bonds.
4:122:9727:18:17:75:562:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:I first use this model to interpret the reduced-form estimates of the two quasi-natural exper-
4:123:9821:17:0:57:562:54:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:iments.  The structural model shows that the reduced-form coefficients are remarkably consistent
5:124:9918:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the evolution of the effective marginal tax rate of the top 1% of the income distribution over
5:125:10017:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the subsequent 30 years or so following the election, both in terms of the timing and persistence
5:126:10114:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the path of top tax rates.  Therefore, bond markets have strong fiscal foresight with respect to
5:127:10213:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both the timing and the magnitude of the shocks.  I then use the model to decompose the term
5:128:10305:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structure into tax news and other risk factors for the entire sample.  I show that the decomposition
5:129:10405:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:performs well for the remaining large tax changes in the sample period for which we do not have
5:130:10500:18:18:57:466:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quasi-natural experiments, in particular the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980s.
5:131:10580:18:18:75:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:I directly address concerns that these other risk factors that affect the yield spreads could also
5:132:10678:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affect household spending.  First, I show graphically that the low-frequency component of the term
5:133:10776:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structure of yield spreads reflects changes in expected tax rates, while high-frequency movements
5:134:10873:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are driven by other risk factors such as liquidity and credit risk.  Consistent with this fact I find that
5:135:10979:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending of higher-income households only responds to low-frequency changes of the yields, but not
5:136:11077:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the high-frequency component.  Moreover, I show that failing to decompose the yield spreads into
5:137:11176:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low- and high-frequency components attenuates the spending response substantially.  This attenu-
5:138:11272:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ation is consistent with the high-frequency component introducing noise from the econometrician’s
5:139:11369:18:18:57:382:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perspective, i.e., spending-irrelevant innovations in bond yields.
5:140:11435:18:18:75:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  I  show  that  the  results  are  robust  to  directly  controlling  for  such  risk  factors  with
5:141:11543:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standard measures used in the literature.  Both the results from the two quasi-natural experiments
5:142:11641:18:18:57:556:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the household spending response are robust to directly controlling for such bond risk factors.
5:143:11739:18:18:75:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, consistent with the hypothesis that those other risk factors introduce noise in the house-
5:144:11836:18:18:57:562:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hold spending analysis, I find that during periods of bond market stress, when the yield spreads are
5:145:11936:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dominated by other risk factors rather than expected taxes, household spending does not respond
5:146:12031:18:18:57:562:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  fiscal  news  measure  based  on  these  bond  yields.   On  the  other  hand,  household  spending
5:147:12139:18:17:57:562:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strongly responds to the yield-based tax news measure when restricting the sample only to periods
5:148:12236:17:18:57:190:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prior to large tax reforms.
5:149:12263:18:18:75:562:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Fourth, I control flexibly for other factors that could simultaneously drive both household spend-
5:150:12361:18:18:57:562:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing and expected tax rates or bond yields.  In particular, I use time fixed effects (i.e., year-by-month
5:151:12465:18:18:57:562:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dummies) to flexibly control for macroeconomic shocks, and household income and demographics to
5:152:12560:18:18:57:562:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control for other factors such as life-cycle effects and intertemporal substitution.  Moreover, I focus
5:153:12663:18:18:57:562:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on post-1980 tax reforms for which the extensive narrative analysis of historical records byRomer
5:154:12760:18:18:57:562:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Romer(2010) reveals that they are not driven by countercyclical motives or by contemporaneous
5:155:12857:18:24:57:226:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in government spending.
5:156:12888:24:18:75:562:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:WhileRomer and Romer(2010) label these tax changes that are orthogonal to the current state
5:157:12979:18:17:57:562:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the economy and to current government spending as exogenous, forward looking households might
5:158:13075:17:18:57:562:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also care about future changes in government spending, which in the extreme case of an infinitely-
5:159:13173:18:18:57:562:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lived or dynastic representative agent with rational expectations leads to Ricardian equivalence and
5:160:13273:18:18:57:562:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no effect on current consumption as shown byBarro(1974).  However, note that the focus of this
5:161:13367:18:0:57:562:66:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper is on higher-income households.  It seems reasonable that many cuts in future government
6:162:13462:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending or transfers, such as the welfare reforms in the 1990s which partially financed the tax cuts of
6:163:13566:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 1980s, affected higher income households much less than the previous tax cuts.  Consistent with
6:164:13665:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this hypothesis I find no difference in behavior between households with and without mortgages,
6:165:13760:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even though the former might fear a repeal of the mortgage interest deduction which mostly benefits
6:166:13859:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher-income households.  Similarly, I do not find a difference in the response of families with and
6:167:13960:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without  children.   Hence,  higher-income  parents  do  not  factor  in  potentially  lower  government
6:168:14064:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:services  more  than  households  without  children  even  though  their  children  would  most  likely  be
6:169:14171:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affected by those changes.  Finally I show that younger households tend to respond slightly more to
6:170:14270:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the tax changes than older households despite the fact that they are more likely to be affected by
6:171:14368:18:18:57:407:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:any potential off-setting government spending changes in the future.
6:172:14436:18:17:75:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although I do not find empirical evidence in favor of Ricardian equivalence, it is possible that
6:173:14532:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  tax  changes  have  effects  on  future  pre-tax  income,  say  through  supply-side  effects  such  as
6:174:14640:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher economic growth, wages and labor supply.  The tax reforms in the sample affected marginal
6:175:14736:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates substantially and are not the lump-sum tax changes required to derive Ricardian equivalence.
6:176:14834:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence,  higher-income households today might respond to the combined net effects of changes in
6:177:14928:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected future tax rates on future after-tax income.  Consistent with this possibility I find that the
6:178:15031:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax reforms in the 1980s, which lowered marginal tax rates the most, elicit the largest consumption
6:179:15130:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response with an elasticity of−1.4, although the precision is too low to statistically reject that the
6:180:15232:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response  is  the  same  as  over  the  entire  sample  period  1980-2001.   Nevertheless,  we  can  strongly
6:181:15341:18:18:57:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reject the hypothesis that higher-income households do not take into account the (net) effects of
6:182:15438:18:18:57:389:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected future tax rates in their current consumption decisions.
6:183:15503:18:18:75:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, consistent with the hypothesis that the expected tax changes do affect higher- and lower-
6:184:15601:18:18:57:562:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income  households  differently,  I  show  that  only  higher-income  households  that  are  substantially
6:185:15707:18:17:57:562:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affected by the expected tax changes captured in the municipal yield spreads do indeed respond to
6:186:15804:17:18:57:562:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the fiscal news.  Specifically, households in the top income tax brackets strongly respond to news
6:187:15902:18:18:57:562:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about future top income tax rates, while households in lower tax brackets whose tax rates exhibit
6:188:15999:18:24:57:510:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low correlation with the top tax rate do not respond to the same measure of fiscal news.
6:189:16087:24:18:75:562:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper touches on several strands of literature.  To the best of my knowledge, it provides
6:190:16181:18:18:57:562:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the first direct evidence of the effect of news about future after-tax income on consumption at the
6:191:16280:18:18:57:562:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household-level.  The household consumption response to a well identified news shock estimated in
6:192:16377:18:18:57:562:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this paper therefore fills an important gap in the large literature that estimates the life-cycle model
6:193:16480:18:18:57:459:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of consumption; see e.g.,Jappelli and Pistaferri(2010) for an excellent survey.
6:194:16559:18:18:75:562:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper also relates to a more recent literature in macroeconomics, which uses aggregate time
6:195:16655:18:17:57:562:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series variation to quantify the role of news and uncertainty shocks in explaining business cycles;
6:196:16754:17:18:57:562:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seeLorenzoni(2011) for a survey of the macroeconomics of news shocks,  andBloom(2009) and
6:197:16843:18:18:57:562:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Baker,  Bloom and Davis(2016) and the literature therein for studies of the effect of uncertainty
6:198:16940:18:18:57:562:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shocks on the macro economy.  This study contributes to the news shock literature by identifying the
6:199:17040:18:0:57:562:66:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:news component of an important observable shock—changes in top personal income tax rates.  The
7:200:17135:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous literature instead focuses mostly on news about future Total Factor Productivity (TFP),
7:201:17231:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which is not directly observable.  Hence, a particular advantage of this approach is the fact that the
7:202:17333:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:performance of the news measure can be visually assessed by comparing it to the evolution of the
7:203:17429:18:24:57:219:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding realized tax rate.
7:204:17461:24:18:75:562:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The paper proceeds as follows.Section 1first provides non-parametric evidence of fiscal foresight
7:205:17558:18:17:57:562:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contained in bond prices and then extracts forward tax rates from a model of the term structure
7:206:17653:17:18:57:562:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of municipal yield spreads.Section 2uses two quasi-natural experiments to quantify the degree of
7:207:17749:18:18:57:562:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fiscal foresight in bond prices and to assess the models ability to relate subsequent legislated tax
7:208:17849:18:18:57:562:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes to the observed reduced-form responses of the yield spreads.Section 3uses the identified
7:209:17945:18:18:57:562:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax  news  shocks  to  estimate  the  spending  response  of  higher-income  households,  andsection  4
7:210:18048:18:38:57:355:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provides extensive robustness checks.Section 5concludes.
7:211:18104:38:23:57:429:512:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:C:1  Determinants of Municipal Yield Spreads
7:212:18146:23:18:75:562:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This section extracts the path of expected tax rates from the term structure of municipal yield
7:213:18241:18:18:57:562:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads which are used in section 3 to estimate the response of high-income household to fiscal news.
7:214:18342:18:18:57:562:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I start by providing non-parametric evidence that future tax rates predict changes in relative yield
7:215:18442:18:17:57:562:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads well,  especially at lower frequencies.  I then analyze three other factors that could affect
7:216:18543:17:18:57:562:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the yield spread besides expected tax rates, namely default risk, state income taxes, and changes
7:217:18640:18:18:57:562:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in liquidity risk or tax uncertainty.  I limit the effect of liquidity and default risk by using only a
7:218:18743:18:18:57:562:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subset of high-quality municipal bond yields, and matching them with taxable Treasury yields of
7:219:18838:18:18:57:562:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:off-the-run bonds which are less liquid and hence resemble more closely the municipal bonds than
7:220:18934:18:18:57:562:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the typical on-the-run Treasury yields.1However, these unobserved factors affect the yield spreads
7:221:19032:18:18:57:562:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at higher frequencies.  I therefore extend the traditional model of municipal yield spreads to allow
7:222:19132:18:18:57:561:310:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f8:B:for both changes in expected tax rates and for a latent factor that captures such unobserved risks.2
7:223:19232:18:18:75:562:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  order  for  the  implied  tax  rates—which  I  call  break-even  tax  rates  (BETR)  because  of  the
7:224:19337:18:18:57:562:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similarity to the concept of the break-even inflation rate—to reflect expected tax rates, it is impor-
7:225:19439:18:18:57:562:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tant to identify who the marginal investor is and hence which tax parameter is identified by the
7:226:19535:18:18:57:562:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield spread.  Moreover, the marginal investor has to be stable over the sample period in order for
7:227:19634:18:18:57:562:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in break-even tax rates to reflect changes in expected tax rates rather than changes in the
7:228:19733:18:18:57:562:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal investor.  Household-level data from the Survey of Consumer Finances and aggregate data
7:229:19829:18:17:57:562:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the Flow of Funds suggest that the marginal investor during the sample period from 1977 to
7:230:19924:17:18:57:562:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2001 is indeed a high-income household.  I formally test this hypothesis in the next section using
7:231:20022:18:18:57:562:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two presidential elections as quasi-natural experiments, and I estimate the degree of fiscal foresight
7:232:20124:18:18:57:562:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contained in the municipal yield spreads.  While these tests do not rely on the model of the term

7:237:20632:12:0:57:168:61:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:the linear approximation.
8:238:20658:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structure of yield spreads developed in this section, I find that the model performs well in relat-
8:239:20757:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing the reduced-form responses estimated during the two presidential elections to the subsequent
8:240:20853:18:18:57:172:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legislated tax changes.
8:241:20876:18:18:75:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This section also relates to a large literature in empirical finance that analyzes the determinants
8:242:20975:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the municipal yield spreads. Early studies such asFama(1977),Poterba(1986),Kochin and Parks
8:243:21069:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1988),Green(1993), orFortune(1996) use different tax rates to model the municipal yield spread.
8:244:21165:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This paper contributes to this literature by identifying the marginal investor for an important class of
8:245:21269:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets and shows that the disagreement about the fundamental determinants of the municipal yield
8:246:21365:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spread might be due to changes in the marginal investor over time, in particular before and after the
8:247:21466:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1970s.  While high-income households appear to be the marginal investors since the late 1970s, bank
8:248:21565:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporations were probably the marginal investors in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Moreover, I show
8:249:21662:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that economic fundamentals explain most of the variation in the municipal yield spread over long
8:250:21758:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:horizons, i.e., at lower frequencies, while liquidity, credit risk or discount rate shocks are important

8:257:22300:18:18:57:562:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on I use daily data provided by Thomson Municipal Market Monitor.  I use the one year of overlap
8:258:22396:18:17:57:562:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the two sources to verify that the two series are almost identical.  The data reflect generic
8:259:22497:17:18:57:562:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield curves of transactions of$2 million or more that are the general preference of institutional

8:261:22696:18:18:57:562:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The bonds used to generate the yield curve are not subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).

9:275:23823:18:18:57:562:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant over the maturity of the two bonds, then the break-even tax rate (BETR) would equal the
9:276:23919:18:18:57:562:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal tax rate of the marginal investor, i.e.,θt,m=τ.  (Below I show how to interpret the BETR
9:277:24016:18:17:57:486:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when allowing for non-constant expected tax rates and for unobserved risk factors.)
9:278:24099:17:18:75:562:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure  1  provides  non-parametric  evidence  that  municipal  yield  spreads  indeed  reflect  expec-
9:279:24202:18:18:57:562:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tations of future tax rates,  especially at lower frequencies,  by contrasting the 2- and the 15-year
9:280:24303:18:18:57:562:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:BETR with the marginal tax rate of the top 1% of the income distribution, taken fromSaez(2004).
9:281:24398:18:18:57:562:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The figure shows both the raw data as well as the trend component after applying a low-pass filter
9:282:24496:18:18:57:562:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explained in more detail in the next section.  The 2-year BETR follows the effective marginal tax
9:283:24593:18:18:57:562:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate  of  the  top  1%  closely,  with  the  exception  of  the  early  1990s,  suggesting  that  the  marginal
9:284:24704:18:18:57:562:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investor is a household in the top of the income distribution.  This finding is consistent with the fact
9:285:24808:18:18:57:562:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that incentives to hold tax-exempt debt increase with the effective marginal tax rate.  Importantly,
9:286:24908:18:18:57:562:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:movements in the 2-year BETR anticipate movements in the top tax rate.  Moreover, short-term
9:287:25000:18:18:57:434:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds are less affected by other risk factor such as credit risk or liquidity.
9:288:25078:18:18:75:562:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The 15-year BETR on the other hand, which averages expected future tax rates over a longer
9:289:25168:18:18:57:562:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:horizon,  behaves  differently.   It  sharply  decreases  during  the  early  1980s  in  anticipation  of  the
9:290:25278:18:18:57:562:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Reagan tax cuts and stays relatively constant until the late 1990s when it starts to decline again
9:291:25376:18:17:57:562:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in anticipation of the Bush tax cuts of the early 2000s.  The fact that the time series of BETRs
9:292:25472:17:18:57:562:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with different maturities do not move one-for-one suggests that the bond market forecasts both the
9:293:25570:18:18:57:562:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:timing of future income tax changes and theexpected pathor expected persistence of the tax changes
9:294:25668:18:18:57:562:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well.  The two quasi-natural experiments discussed in the next section confirm this conjecture.  In
9:295:25767:18:18:57:562:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular, longer-term yield spreads respond strongly to changes in election probabilities and the
9:296:25866:18:18:57:562:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response is quantitatively consistent with long-term differences between the proposed tax reforms.
9:297:25964:18:18:57:562:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence,  the  lower  level  of  the  15-year  BETR  inFigure  1does  not  reflect  a  disconnect  between
9:298:26068:18:18:57:562:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected taxes and yields, but instead is consistent with a risk premium that is increasing in the
9:299:26166:18:18:57:134:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bond maturity.
9:300:26180:18:18:75:562:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 1also shows that the 2-year and the 15-year break-even tax rates are generally below the
9:301:26275:18:18:57:562:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:top marginal tax rate, reflecting a risk premium for other factors than expected tax rates, which
9:302:26372:18:18:57:562:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  more  important  for  longer-term  bonds  than  for  short-term  bonds.   Hence,  longer-term  bonds
9:303:26476:18:18:57:562:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand a larger compensation for such risks than short-term bonds.  The finding that the relative
9:304:26573:18:18:57:562:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk premium increases with the maturity of the yield spread is consistent with a large literature
9:305:26671:18:17:57:562:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the so-called “muni puzzle,” the observation that the slope of the municipal bond yield curve
9:306:26767:17:18:57:562:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is almost always steeper than the slope of the Treasury yield curve.  There is a large literature in
9:307:26867:18:18:57:562:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finance that tries to explain this fact, but it seems fair to say that so far no single explanation of
9:308:26969:18:0:57:182:60:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this puzzle has emerged.
10:309:26994:0:23:57:539:731:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:1.3  Factors other than Expected Tax Rates Affecting Yield Spreads
10:310:27060:23:18:75:562:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Of course, there are other factors than expected tax rates that affect municipal yield spreads,
10:311:27155:18:35:57:469:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:especially at higher frequencies.  I next discuss the three most important factors.
10:312:27238:35:17:57:562:655:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:Credit risk:The first factor that comes to mind is probably default or credit risk.  In order to
10:313:27334:17:18:57:562:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eliminate, or at least minimize, the effect of credit risk on the yield spreads, I use only the highest
10:314:27437:18:18:57:562:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality municipal bonds available.  In particular,  the municipal yield curve used in this paper is
10:315:27536:18:18:57:562:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based on AAA-rated general-obligation state bonds.  State bonds are a subset of all municipal bonds
10:316:27635:18:18:57:562:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and benefit from the same federal tax exemption.  They are more liquid compared to other types
10:317:27729:18:18:57:562:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of municipal bonds; see e.g.,Harris and Piwowar(2004).  General-obligation bonds are backed by
10:318:27823:18:18:57:562:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the full faith and credit of the issuing state,  similar to the backing of Treasury bonds.  The last
10:319:27923:18:18:57:562:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:default  of  any  state  general-obligation  bond  occurred  in  1933  and  was  only  temporary  (Hempel
10:320:28028:18:18:57:562:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1971)).  Moreover, municipal bonds in general and general-obligation bonds in particular have a
10:321:28124:18:18:57:562:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high recovery rate. For instance,Fitch Ratings(2007) assumes that general-obligation bonds recover
10:322:28222:18:18:57:562:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:100% of par within one year of default.  The prime-grade general-obligation municipal bonds used
10:323:28318:18:18:57:362:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this paper are therefore essentially free from default risk.
10:324:28381:18:18:75:562:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While municipal bond defaults have been rare historically—especially for state general-obligation
10:325:28478:18:18:57:562:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds—it  is  nevertheless  conceivable  that  such  rare  default  events  affect  municipal  bond  prices.

10:331:28999:18:18:57:562:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest on municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income taxes and interest on Treasury
10:332:29097:18:18:57:562:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds is exempt from state and local income taxes, nothing prevents states from taxing interest on
10:333:29195:18:18:57:562:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:municipal bonds.  Many states exempt municipal bond interest from state and local income taxes,
10:334:29290:18:18:57:562:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:either  for  all  or  at  least  for  in-state  investors,  and  several  states  do  not  collect  personal  income
10:335:29406:18:18:57:562:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taxes at all.  Moreover, investors have strong incentives to avoid paying state taxes on municipal
10:336:29504:18:17:57:562:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds, for instance by investing in municipal bonds of their state of residence (Babina, Jotikasthira,
10:337:29606:17:18:57:233:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lundblad and Ramadorai(2015)).

10:342:30050:16:12:57:562:109:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:investors from state taxes but taxes out-of-state investors; Illinois taxes both in-state and out-of-state investors; and
10:343:30171:12:12:57:562:97:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:Texas has no personal income tax.  All state bonds are AAA-rated general obligations, with the exception of Illinois,
10:344:30288:12:12:57:562:85:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:for which there are no AAA general-obligation bonds available in the sample.  Instead, I use AA-rated state bonds
10:345:30401:12:11:57:562:73:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:that are insured against default risk so that they are comparable to the other AAA-rated general-obligation bonds.
10:346:30515:11:0:57:402:62:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:The sample starts in 1996, the first year I have data on individual state bonds.

11:348:30691:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spread to similar 10-year Treasury bonds, which is on average 132 basis points over the same period.
11:349:30791:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This strongly suggests that state taxes are not an important determinant of municipal yield spreads
11:350:30890:18:35:57:239:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to federal income tax rates.

11:352:31018:18:18:57:562:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads other than expected tax rates are therefore liquidity risk and potentially tax uncertainty.
11:353:31117:18:17:57:562:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To  minimize  the  effect  of  liquidity  shocks  on  the  yield  spread  I  use  off-the-run  Treasury  bonds,
11:354:31228:17:18:57:562:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which are less liquid than on-the-run issues and are therefore more similar to municipal bonds, and
11:355:31327:18:18:57:562:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I use state bonds, which are the most liquid municipal bonds.  However, the off-the-run Treasury
11:356:31423:18:18:57:562:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bond market is still much more liquid than the most liquid municipal bond market.  To account for
11:357:31520:18:18:57:562:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such risk factors, I next extend the traditional model of municipal yield spreads to include a latent
11:358:31621:18:33:57:413:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk factor and to allow for changes in the path of expected tax rates.
11:359:31692:33:23:57:396:488:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:1.4  A Model of Break-Even Tax Rates (BETR)
11:360:31735:23:18:75:562:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Interest  income  from  Treasury  bonds  is  exempt  from  state  and  local  taxes,  but  is  subject  to
11:361:31841:18:18:57:562:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:federal income taxes, while interest on municipal bonds is exempt from federal income taxes and
11:362:31936:18:18:57:562:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from state income taxes for most investors.  In order to interpret the yield data it is important to
11:363:32036:18:18:57:562:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:note that the relative municipal yield spread is different from the expected tax rate.  Similarly, the
11:364:32138:18:17:57:562:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield spread between nominal and real Treasury bonds—the so-called break-even inflation rate—
11:365:32231:17:18:57:562:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not equal the expected rate of inflation.  However, in both cases the yield spreads are related
11:366:32331:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the underlying expectations.  To formalize this relationship I start with the definition of the par
11:367:32433:18:18:57:562:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield of a Treasury bond.  Since Treasury bonds are taxed based on their imputed par yield, the par
11:368:32532:18:18:57:562:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bond is the natural concept when analyzing the effects of taxes on bond prices, while zero coupon
11:369:32629:18:18:57:562:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds are the starting point of most fixed-income models,  which abstract from taxes;  see Kueng

11:380:33168:18:15:71:562:132:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:5To simplify notation I abstract here from the fact that coupon payments are semi-annual rather than annual,
11:381:33276:15:12:57:562:117:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:but I take this into account when analyzing the data.  Moreover, whenever possible I use the first subscript—usually
11:382:33392:12:12:57:562:105:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f10:F:t—to denote calendar or “household time” and the second subscript—usuallymors—to denote the forecast horizon

12:436:35608:18:18:57:562:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:narratives surrounding all major post-war tax changes,Romer and Romer(2010) conclude that all
12:437:35701:18:18:57:562:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income tax changes from 1980 to 2001—with one minor exception in 2001—are not countercyclical
12:438:35794:18:18:57:562:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policies or spending related but motivated by concerns about the long-run growth rate or the federal
12:439:35894:18:18:57:562:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:debt.  Hence,  the tax risk premium Λτis likely primarily due to the progressivity of the income
12:440:35990:18:15:71:561:215:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:6I  add  the  latent  shocks  in  a  linear  way  to  obtain  an  analytical  expression  that  is  linear  in  both  the  path  of

12:442:36234:12:12:57:562:188:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:does not change the conclusions.  In an ideal setting we would have two identical bonds with the exception that one
12:443:36349:12:12:57:562:176:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:is taxable and the other is tax-exempt.yM−λis the risk-adjusted municipal yield that proxies for such an ideal
12:444:36459:12:9:57:246:164:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:but unobserved tax-exempt Treasury bond.
12:445:36499:9:15:71:562:155:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:7Equating (2) and (3) implicitly assumes that both bonds are held to maturity,  thereby abstracting from the
12:446:36607:15:12:57:562:140:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:timing of capital gains and losses.  However,  unexpected capital gains on both municipal and Treasury bonds are
12:447:36719:12:12:57:562:128:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:taxable at the capital gains tax rate.  Therefore, the yield spread between the two bonds cancels out any first-order
12:448:36836:12:8:57:182:116:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:effects of capital gains taxes.
12:449:36867:8:17:71:562:108:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:8When  I  calculate  the  weights  in  the  empirical  section  below  I  take  into  account  that  coupon  payments  are

12:451:37101:16:12:57:562:75:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:to 1/m.  With discounting, the weights are generally decreasing inmsuch thatw(m)t,m<1/m.  If the tax-exempt yield
12:452:37214:12:0:57:556:63:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:curve steepens, then future income is discounted more heavily, leading the weights on future tax rates to decrease.

13:455:37536:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore likely non-positive.  In this paper I do not attempt to separate these two risk factors, and

13:473:39039:18:18:57:562:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting that a household is the marginal investor and hence that expected personal income tax
13:474:39135:18:18:57:562:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates are reflected in the relative bond prices.  However,  we need to know which households own
13:475:39231:18:18:57:562:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:municipal bonds in order to determine the marginal tax rate identified by the relative bond spread.

13:481:39793:18:18:57:562:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is described in more detail in the

13:483:39990:17:18:57:562:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the effective marginal tax rate over all households that own both taxable and tax-exempt bonds.

15:537:44883:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by  dropping  the  last  week  of  daily  election  data  when  such  considerations  became  relevant,  and
15:538:44991:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I obtained very similar results.  Furthermore,  since bets are limited to$500,  market participants
15:539:45090:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cannot use the prediction markets to hedge their income tax risk.  Therefore, changes in the prices
15:540:45189:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of such contracts can be interpreted as measuring daily changes in the election probability of the

15:546:45744:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contracts represent an alternative measure of changes in expected tax rates due to the difference

15:549:46037:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that shocks unrelated to tax expectations are correlated between the betting and bond markets, I

15:560:46988:17:16:67:562:132:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:11Later in his first term, President George W. Bush lowered the dividend tax rate and the long-term capital gains

15:562:47209:12:8:57:122:104:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:Calmes (2000).
15:563:47223:8:16:67:562:96:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:12The controls include measures of (il)liquidity such as the number of repeated prices, muni supply (negotiated and
15:564:47338:16:12:57:562:80:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:competitive offers), on-the-run/off-the-run Treasury spread, prediction market volume and units traded; measures of
15:565:47453:12:12:57:562:68:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:credit risk such as the pre-refunded spread, spreads between lower-grade municipal bonds; and the weekly standard

16:568:47745:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This shows that the lowerlevelof long-term BETRs shown in Figure 1 does not reflect a disconnect
16:569:47841:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between expected taxes and yields, but instead is consistent with the presence of a risk premium
16:570:47937:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is increasing in the maturity.  The results here show thatchangesin BETRs strongly respond
16:571:48032:18:18:57:450:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to changes in expected tax rates at all maturities as predicted by the theory.
16:572:48110:18:18:75:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To interpret the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients, note that the contracts pay 100 cents if
16:573:48209:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the candidate wins the popular vote and zero otherwise.  Therefore, an increase of the price by 1 cent
16:574:48311:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponds to a 1% increase in the perceived probability of the candidate winning.  Multiplying the
16:575:48411:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients by 100 yields the predicted change in the BETRs if George W. Bush (Bill Clinton) wins
16:576:48509:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in 2000 (1992) relative to the counter-factual that Al Gore (George H.W. Bush) or the third-party

16:580:48809:18:18:57:562:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the two major presidential candidates in both elections.  In order to interpret the magnitudes of
16:581:48909:18:18:57:562:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the coefficients, it is important to remember that the break-even tax rate responses do not reflect
16:582:49008:18:18:57:562:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes  in  expected  tax  rates,  but  instead  are  weighted  averages  of  differences  in  the  expected
16:583:49117:18:18:57:562:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:path of tax rates under different presidents.  However, we can use the model of the term structure
16:584:49215:18:18:57:562:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of municipal yield spreads derived in the previous section to give the reduced-form coefficients a

16:593:49981:18:18:57:562:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows that the vector of population regressionsβrepresents the annuity values of the difference in

16:602:50691:9:12:57:562:104:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:would indicate a change in the tax proposal of the candidates during the sample period but did not find any.  Hence
16:603:50806:12:12:57:562:92:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:I assume that the relative difference between the tax proposals (Et[τ|Bush]−Et[τ|Gore]) remains constant during

17:611:51583:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:beyond 2011, one in which the Bush tax cuts expire in 2011 as scheduled and one in which they

17:616:51989:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the model.  Hence, the model does a good job at relating current changes in break-even tax
17:617:52084:18:34:57:295:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates to the subsequent legislated tax changes.

17:638:53741:18:18:57:562:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expect the initial tax cuts to be off-set by later tax increases above the initial level of 39.6%.  One
17:639:53844:18:17:57:562:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interpretation is that the bond markets expect the tax cuts to be unsustainable.  Compared to the
17:640:53941:17:18:57:562:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perfect-foresight tax path, the path of the expected tax rates returns quickly back to rates around
17:641:54040:18:18:57:562:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:40%.  The expected tax rate starts to increase sharply after four years, consistent for example with
17:642:54140:18:18:57:562:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expectations that President George W. Bush will serve only one term.  Turning to the presidential

18:650:55008:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax increase.  The path also shows that the bond markets in 1992 expect the tax rates to return
18:651:55103:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:back to the initial level in the long run.  However, the tax cuts enacted under President W. Bush
18:652:55200:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“only” lowered the top rate to 35% instead of 31%, the level in 1992, or 33%, George W. Bush’s

18:675:56896:18:18:57:562:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 2001.  Consistent with the muni puzzle, the average risk premium is monotonically increasing in
18:676:56994:18:18:57:561:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the maturity of the BETR. Adjusting for this average risk premium changes the relativelevelof

18:679:57200:18:18:75:562:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The second identification assumption deals with temporary shocks to the risk premium. I assume
18:680:57294:18:17:57:562:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that households and the marginal investors form tax expectations independently of the municipal
18:681:57389:17:18:57:562:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield spread.  For instance, households read newspapers or follow political campaigns and use all
18:682:57486:18:18:57:562:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these sources of information to form expectations about future tax rates.  The econometrician does
18:683:57584:18:18:57:562:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not directly observe those news sources, but can infer the aggregate information set by looking at
18:684:57682:18:18:57:562:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:municipal yield spreads and interpret the data through the lens of the BETR model.  For instance,
18:685:57779:18:18:57:562:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suppose the break-even tax rates decrease at datetbut immediately rebound the next day, att+ 1.
18:686:57874:18:18:57:562:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The econometrician can use this fact to estimate the tax expectations at datet.  He will conclude
18:687:57971:18:0:57:562:65:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  this  change  in  break-even  tax  rates  was  most  likely  due  to  say  a  liquidity  shock  instead  of
19:688:58086:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax news.  If he uses only past and current prices he will underestimate the rational information
19:689:58183:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set.  This way of modeling tax news implies that the econometrician wants to use all prices—past,
19:690:58280:18:18:57:495:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current, and future—to infer the path of expected tax ratesEtτat any point in time.
19:691:58363:18:18:75:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Filtering the tax news shocks from the “noise” shocks—i.e., the risk premium shocks—is impor-
19:692:58456:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tant since the tax news shocks form the regressor in the consumption analysis in the next section.
19:693:58554:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Liquidity  shocks  and  other  shocks  that  are  unrelated  to  tax  news  introduce  noise  and  therefore
19:694:58662:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential attenuation bias of the household spending response coefficient, a fact I demonstrate in
19:695:58760:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the robustness section 4.  Not dealing with this attenuation bias would lead to the conclusion that
19:696:58859:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households  do  not  respond  to  news  even  if  they  in  fact  are  forward-looking.   To  obtain  a  more
19:697:58968:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:precise measure of the expected tax rates I use the two-sided low-pass filter proposed byBaxter
19:698:59063:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  King(1999)  that  passes  all  frequencies  below  two  years.   While  the  filter  may  remove  some
19:699:59170:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax news shocks in addition to risk premium shocks,  it reduces potential attenuation bias in the
19:700:59267:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis of household consumption.  Importantly, when estimating the household spending response
19:701:59363:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to tax news, I always include both the filtered news shock and the residual in the regression.  Hence,
19:702:59465:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if the residual did contain information that is relevant to consumers, then we would expect it to
19:703:59562:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have a significant effect on household spending.  The two-year low pass filter is motivated both by
19:704:59661:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:visual inspection of the time series and by the fact that two years is the shortest period between two

19:706:59854:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extensive robustness checks of the household spending response to different thresholds as well as
19:707:59951:18:32:57:211:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different filters (seeFigure 6).

19:712:60347:18:18:57:562:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the methodology derived in the previous section to extract the path of expected tax rates from the
19:713:60445:18:18:57:562:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:municipal yield spreads.  Note that whileFigure 1already suggests that the Reagan tax cuts were
19:714:60540:18:18:57:562:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well anticipated, this is only a conjecture since the time series shown inFigure 1are break-even tax

19:722:61268:18:16:67:562:105:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:15The web appendix of this paper (www.lorenzkueng.com) contains an animation of the evolution ofEt[τ] from

19:725:61610:12:0:57:110:65:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:before 1983.
20:726:61624:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In fact, the upward sloping path of expected tax rates reflects proposals during the late 1970s by
20:727:61722:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:President Carter to raise top income tax rates; seePoterba(1986).  The increase is also consistent
20:728:61820:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with expected bracket creep due to rampant inflation during this time when tax brackets were not
20:729:61916:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yet indexed to inflation.  Since the marginal tax rate of the marginal investor was well below the
20:730:62014:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:top statutory rate (seeFigure 2),  expected increases in nominal income would push high-income
20:731:62108:18:18:57:227:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors in even higher brackets.
20:732:62142:18:18:75:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The long-run expectations decreased sharply during the presidential election of 1980 as it became

20:734:62332:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:promised  tax  cuts.   Between  1980  and  1982  as  Reagan  passed  his  first  tax  cut  the  bond  market
20:735:62440:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also started to anticipate the second tax reform, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA 1986).  This
20:736:62534:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:figure reveals an astonishing degree of fiscal foresight contained in the municipal yield spreads.  In
20:737:62636:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the next section I use these changes in the paths of expected tax rates to estimate the household

20:740:62879:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considerable amount of fiscal foresight.  Moreover, the path of expected tax ratesEtτderived from

20:742:63084:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, while the wealthy households that invest in municipal bonds have a high degree of fiscal
20:743:63181:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:foresight, their expectations may not be representative of (wealthy) consumers as a whole.  In the
20:744:63279:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:next section I quantify the degree of fiscal foresight of higher-income households by estimating the
20:745:63379:18:18:57:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household consumption response to tax news in order to learn more about consumer behavior and

20:747:63528:37:23:57:449:339:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:C:3  Household Spending Response to Tax News
20:748:63570:23:18:75:562:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To the best of my knowledge, this study is the first to test the standard life-cycle consumption
20:749:63666:18:18:57:562:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theory by estimating the spending response to changes in expected life-time resources at the house-

20:751:63867:18:18:57:562:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large empirical literature that tests the life-cycle model and its various extensions.  Previous studies
20:752:63971:18:18:57:562:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this literature have mostly focused on anticipated income shocks, for which the frictionless model
20:753:64072:18:18:57:562:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicts no consumption responses (so called excess sensitivity tests), or they estimate the response
20:754:64173:18:18:57:562:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to unanticipated income shocks for which the model’s predicted response depends on the expected
20:755:64268:18:18:57:562:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persistence of the shock; seeJappelli and Pistaferri(2010).  This paper is more closely related to
20:756:64366:18:18:57:562:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the latter as the tax news shock extracts the persistent component of a tax reform.  However, an
20:757:64462:18:18:57:562:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important distinction of this study is that it estimates the response to a shock that is only expected
20:758:64564:18:32:57:562:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be realized in the future and hence represents the present value of future anticipated tax changes.

20:760:64705:23:18:75:562:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  time  series  of  tax  expectations  described  above  affects  households  differently  depending
20:761:64808:18:0:57:562:63:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on how much of their future taxable income is affected by the expected tax changes.  In an ideal
21:762:64906:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:setting I would observe news shocks for each tax rate in each tax bracket as well as news about
21:763:65001:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes of those tax brackets.  Expected tax liabilities for each household could then be computed
21:764:65099:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by integrating over expected brackets and rates.  In practice I only observe a time series of paths
21:765:65198:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of expected top tax rates.  To take into account the cross-sectional heterogeneity in the exposure

21:782:66640:18:18:57:562:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but a similar interpretation can be derived by log-linearizing the inter-temporal budget constraint;
21:783:66740:18:18:57:562:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seeCampbell and Deaton(1989).  This simplified model abstracts from three main effects.  First, it
21:784:66838:18:17:57:562:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not capture the effect of marginal tax rates on consumption via the inter-temporal substitution
21:785:66938:17:18:57:562:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:channel triggered by changes in the effective after-tax interest rate.  However, as mentioned above,
21:786:67038:18:18:57:562:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all regressions include a full set of time fixed effects, which absorb such effects to a first order.  Sec-
21:787:67145:18:18:57:562:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ond, certainty equivalence ignores the effect of tax uncertainty on household consumption through
21:788:67242:18:18:57:562:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in precautionary savings.  Third, the model ignores potential effects of changes in expected
21:789:67342:18:18:57:562:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal tax rates on current and future labor supply or any other indirect effects of marginal tax
21:790:67441:18:18:57:562:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates on pre-tax income such as wages or growth effects in general equilibrium.  It also abstracts
21:791:67539:18:18:57:562:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from non-separability of consumption and leisure.  The regression coefficientβcan therefore also
21:792:67635:18:18:57:562:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be interpreted as a reduced form of a more general model that would explicitly model—and more
21:793:67728:18:18:57:538:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:importantly also separately identify—those channels, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

22:810:68894:18:18:57:562:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:section below shows similar results when using lagged consumption (appropriately rescaled) as a

22:830:70111:18:17:57:562:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions.  First, I assume that changes in the tax base—if they do occur—are perfectly foreseen.
22:831:70210:17:18:57:562:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:With the exception of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), which is I discuss in more detail in the
22:832:70306:18:18:57:562:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:robustness section below and in the online appendix, this assumption is reasonable for the income
22:833:70403:18:18:57:562:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax reforms in my sample because the brackets did not change much.  In the robustness section I
22:834:70498:18:18:57:562:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that excluding TRA from the sample by focusing on the later period starting in the mid-1990s
22:835:70595:18:18:57:562:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yields  similar  results.   Second,  I  scale  the  perfect-foresight  tax  rateτt+s(b)  in  each  lower  income

23:849:71537:36:18:57:562:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This means that if households have perfect foresight about the top marginal tax rate (i.e., if they
23:850:71636:18:18:57:562:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correctly guess the future tax rate such that the second term is one), they also have perfect foresight
23:851:71739:18:18:57:562:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about the lower bracket rates.  Since the empirical analysis restricts the sample to higher-income
23:852:71837:18:18:57:562:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households, defined as the top quartile of the income distribution for which policy-induced changes
23:853:71936:18:18:57:562:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in average tax rates are highly correlated with changes in the top marginal tax rate, this assumption
23:854:72037:18:18:57:562:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not affect the results much.  In the robustness section I analyze the sensitivity of the results
23:855:72138:18:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to this assumption.  First, I obtain essentially the same results when using only the smaller subset
23:856:72238:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of households in the top 10% percentile who are not much affected by assumptions about expected
23:857:72333:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates in lower tax brackets,  because most of their income falls into the higher brackets.  Second,
23:858:72432:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I  show  that  if  we  instead  fix  the  lower  bracket  rates  at  their  current  predetermined  level  based
23:859:72544:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the current tax code (i.e., if we useτt(b) instead ofτt+s(b)) I obtain very similar results.  This
23:860:72645:18:17:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:essentially implements the Bartik approach without using the life-cycle model to derive the correct
23:861:72744:17:18:57:175:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cross-sectional weights.
23:862:72768:18:18:75:562:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With these assumptions, changes in household-specific expected average tax rates can be written

23:878:73153:17:18:57:562:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the signal that the household receives between datet−1 andt.  The term ̄τi,t+sτt+sis a measure of

23:880:73355:18:18:57:562:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“importance weight”ωiin the Bartik approach described above:  If this ratio is low then the impact
23:881:73453:18:18:57:562:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  news  about  the  top  tax  rate  insyears  has  only  a  small  impact  on  the  household’s  expected
23:882:73560:18:18:57:562:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after-tax lifetime income, and a rational household should therefore largely ignore the signal.  On
23:883:73659:18:18:57:549:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the other hand, if the ratio is large, then the household should pay close attention to the signal.
23:884:73758:18:18:75:562:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is important to note that this assumption doesnotimply that the expected change in the
23:885:73847:18:18:57:561:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:averagetax  rate  is  the  same  for  all  households.   To  see  this,  suppose  that  the  expected  future
23:886:73956:18:18:57:562:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax schedule insyears from now has only two tax rates, 10% and 50%.  Let the first tax bracket
23:887:74050:18:18:57:562:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:range from$0 to$10,000 so that all income above$10,000, which is the second income bracket, is
23:888:74144:18:12:57:562:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected to be taxed at the 50% rate.  Suppose that the expected top tax rate increases by 10%, i.e.
23:889:74244:12:10:59:116:116:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:∆tEt+1τt+s(B)

23:891:74346:17:16:67:562:89:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:19Since  the  sampling  frequency  is  quarterly  at  the  household-level  while  expectations  are  formed  over  annual
23:892:74468:16:13:57:562:73:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:intervals, I assume that the perfect-foresight variables do not change between quarters, so that (Et+1−Et)τt+s(b) =
23:893:74583:13:0:57:160:60:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f10:F:τt+s(b)×(Et+1−Et)τt+sτt+s.
24:894:74611:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the top tax rate by 5 percentage points from 50% to 55%.  The expected average tax rate of a
24:895:74707:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household with an income of$10,000 increases by 1 percentage point, while the expected average
24:896:74801:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax rate of a household with an income of$15,000 increase by 21/3percentage points.  Moreover, the
24:897:74899:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected change of the average tax rate approaches 5 percentage points as income goes to infinity,
24:898:74997:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  equals  the  expected  change  of  the  top  tax  rate.   Figure  A2  in  the  online  appendix  shows

24:905:75613:17:18:75:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As mentioned above, the assumption in equation (11) is least restrictive for higher-income house-
24:906:75710:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holds for which changes in the top tax rate are closely related to changes in their average tax rate.
24:907:75811:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For this reason I focus on the consumption response of higher-income households to tax news.Fig-
24:908:75907:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ure 5shows that changes in average tax rates for households in the top quartile of the adjusted
24:909:76002:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gross income distribution (AGI) are highly correlated over the sample period, although they are not
24:910:76101:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perfectly correlated.  I therefore choose the top income quartile of households (by tax filer status and
24:911:76205:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year) in the CEX as my baseline sample, and I then analyze how the results change as I change this
24:912:76303:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:threshold.  The different income distribution cut-offs trade off measurement error with statistical
24:913:76402:18:18:57:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power:  While including more households that are further away from the top tax bracket increases
24:914:76498:18:18:57:562:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the precision of the estimates, it potentially biases the results if assumption (11) is less appropriate
24:915:76602:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for those additional households, i.e., if tax news shocks are less well measured with municipal yield

25:942:78088:18:18:75:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Strictly  speaking,  the  model  predicts  thatβ=−1,  i.e.,  that  consumption  moves  one-for-one

25:944:78284:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income.  However, one should keep in mind the many simplifying assumptions discussed above that
25:945:78379:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were required to obtain such a sharp prediction. Hence, finding a household response to this measure
25:946:78479:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of tax news that is different from−1 should not be taken as a rejection of the rational-expectation

25:967:79833:18:18:57:562:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy was extensively used prior to the 1980s, it was largely replaced by monetary policy as the main
25:968:79935:18:18:57:562:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countercyclical policy tool since then, at least until very recently.  The extensive narrative analysis of
25:969:80041:18:18:57:562:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Romer and Romer (2010) therefore concludes that all income tax changes between 1980 and 2003—
25:970:80134:18:18:57:562:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with one minor exception in 2001—are not countercyclical nor did they coincide with changes in
25:971:80228:18:18:57:562:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government spending.20Romer and Romer classify those income tax reforms as exogenous, driven
25:972:80320:18:18:57:562:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:either by attempts to increase long-run economic growth (ERTA 1981, TRA 1986, EGTRRA 2001
25:973:80409:18:18:57:562:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and JGTRRA 2003) or by concerns about the federal budget deficit (OBRA 1990 and OBRA 1993).
25:974:80500:18:18:75:562:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While the tax reforms in the sample are orthogonal to the current state of the economy—and
25:975:80590:18:18:57:562:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence exogenous according to the terminology of Romer and Romer—, the corresponding tax news
25:976:80682:18:18:57:562:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shocks might nevertheless be correlated with news about future pre-tax income.  Thus, while it is
25:977:80779:18:18:57:562:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not possible to fully rule out that the consumption response is at least partially driven by correlated
25:978:80882:18:17:57:562:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income news shocks, a consumption response to either type of shock still indicates that households
25:979:80980:17:16:67:562:106:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:20The minor exception is the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Tax Act of 2001 (EGTRRA). The
25:980:81084:16:12:57:562:90:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:countercyclical part of EGTRRA concerns the accelerated implementation of the tax cuts but it does not concern
25:981:81194:12:12:57:562:78:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:the overall size of the cuts.  For instance,Romer and Romer(2008) note that “this [countercyclical] motivation was
25:982:81308:12:12:57:562:66:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:almost always discussed in the context of making some of the cuts retroactive to January 1, 2001 rather than having
25:983:81423:12:0:57:231:54:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:them begin on January 1, 2002.”  (p.84)
26:984:81464:0:18:57:160:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are forward-looking.
26:985:81484:18:18:75:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One final concern is that other shocks to the bond markets such as liquidity risk are correlated
26:986:81580:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the business cycle or with bad income news in general.  To assess the potential bias introduced,
26:987:81681:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:note that when financial markets are under stress—such as during the financial crisis of 2008-2010—
26:988:81780:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the liquidity premium on Treasury bonds tends to increase.  Such periods are also associated with
26:989:81877:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower consumption.  An increase in the demand for liquidity provided by Treasury bonds relative
26:990:81972:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to municipal bonds increases the relative price for Treasuries and hence lowers the Treasury yield
26:991:82070:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to the yield on municipal bonds.  Equation (4) shows that this mechanism causes the BETRs
26:992:82168:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:θtto decrease and therefore decreases the measured path of expected forward tax ratesEtτt.  To
26:993:82262:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  extent  that  such  liquidity  shocks  are  not  absorbed  by  year-by-month  time  fixed  effects,  by
26:994:82370:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:the filtering of the time series, or by directly controlling for them, they induce a spuriouspositive
26:995:82471:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlation between changes in the measured path of expected tax rates and consumption changes.
26:996:82566:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This potential correlation leads the response coefficients to be biased upward against the forward-
26:997:82665:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:looking consumption model. For these reasons—that income tax reforms in the sample are unrelated
26:998:82761:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the current state of the economy, and that any remaining liquidity shock biases the results against
26:999:82863:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the basic model—estimating regressions of the form (12) provide a meaningful assessment of the
26:1000:82957:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response of higher-income households’ consumption to news about future taxes.  Furthermore, the
26:1001:83052:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:robustness section addresses this concern directly by including the yield residual and by directly
26:1002:83150:18:32:57:249:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controlling for such bond risk factors.
26:1003:83189:32:24:57:272:380:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:3.3  Household Spending Data
26:1004:83217:24:17:75:562:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:I  use  data  from  the  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey  (CEX),  which  is  the  most  comprehensive
26:1005:83316:17:18:57:562:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data source on household consumption in the U.S. A more detailed description of the data and data
26:1006:83413:18:18:57:562:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:steps  is  provided  in  the  appendix.   The  CEX  is  a  monthly  rotating  panel  and  each  household  is
26:1007:83522:18:18:57:562:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interviewed once per quarter for at most four consecutive quarters.  In each interview the reference
26:1008:83622:18:18:57:562:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period for expenditures covers the three months prior to the interview month.  I follow the literature
26:1009:83724:18:18:57:562:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and aggregate the expenditures to quarterly spending.  Income data is asked only in the first and
26:1010:83821:18:18:57:562:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:last  interview.   The  reference  period  for  income  covers  the  twelve  months  prior  to  the  interview
26:1011:83931:18:18:57:562:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:month.  The definition of spending on nondurables and services follows the literature and excludes
26:1012:84029:18:18:57:562:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing services, health care and health insurance, and education services, since these expenditures
26:1013:84129:18:18:57:562:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have characteristics of durable goods.21All nominal variables are deflated using the CPI-U. Due
26:1014:84224:18:18:57:562:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  extreme  outliers  I  windsorize  consumption  growth  at  the  10%  level;  all  results  are  robust  to
26:1015:84334:18:18:57:562:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choosing a different threshold.Table 2provides summary statistics of the main sample of higher-
26:1016:84429:18:18:57:562:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income  households  used  in  the  analysis.   These  households  have  a  federal  adjusted  gross  income
26:1017:84536:18:28:57:366:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(AGI) above the 75thpercentile by year and tax filer status.
26:1018:84596:28:16:67:562:95:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:21Following the previous literature, this implicitly assumes linear Engle curves or separability between nondurables

27:1020:84727:0:23:57:542:731:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:3.4  The Spending Response to the Reagan Tax Cuts:  A Case Study
27:1021:84791:23:18:75:562:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:By far the largest change in marginal and average tax rates occurred in the early 1980s under
27:1022:84884:18:18:57:562:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:President Reagan.  Soon after Reagan announced his candidacy for President of the United States
27:1023:84979:18:18:57:562:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on November 13, 1979 bond markets started to factor in lower expected tax rates at the longer end
27:1024:85076:18:18:57:562:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the term structure as seen inFigure 4.  Luckily, this event coincides with the start of the CEX
27:1025:85174:18:18:57:562:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample.  I therefore first conduct a case study of these tax changes before extending the sample to
27:1026:85273:18:18:57:283:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include the entire period from 1980 to 2001.
27:1027:85317:18:17:75:562:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3estimates the response of household spending on nondurables and services to news about
27:1028:85410:17:18:57:562:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future taxes using regression equation (12) on the sample of households with a federal AGI above
27:1029:85506:18:18:57:562:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 75thpercentile by tax filer status in each year from 1980 to 1982.  Column 1 uses a minimalist
27:1030:85604:18:18:57:561:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specification  including  only  year-by-month  time  fixed  effectsαtalong  the  tax  new  shock.   The
27:1031:85707:18:18:57:562:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate  suggests  that  household  increase  spending  by  about  1.5%  in  response  to  news  about  a
27:1032:85813:18:18:57:562:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decrease in the annuity value of future tax liabilities of 1%.  Column 2 adds the residual of the time-
27:1033:85916:18:18:57:562:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series filter discussed insection 2.2.  The news shock residual’s effect on spending is economically
27:1034:86016:18:18:57:562:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small  and  not  significantly  different  from  zero  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  this  variation
27:1035:86127:18:18:57:562:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:represents changes in relative bond prices that are not driven by news about future taxes.  Column
27:1036:86225:18:18:57:562:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3 uses variables that are standard in the literature to control for predictable changes in household
27:1037:86325:18:18:57:562:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:composition  that  can  break  the  consumption  Euler  equation.   The  increases  in  spending  related
27:1038:86430:18:18:57:562:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to increases in the number of adults or children do not affect the response to the tax news shock.
27:1039:86528:18:18:57:562:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Column 4 controls for the other main effects of the news shocks besides the time fixed effects, the
27:1040:86627:18:17:57:352:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average tax rate and fixed effects for each tax filer status.
27:1041:86688:17:18:75:562:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The precision of the estimates in columns 1 to 4 is very low given the small sample size.  Nev-
27:1042:86783:18:18:57:562:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ertheless  the  point  estimates  suggest  a  substantial  spending  response  to  tax  changes  that  were
27:1043:86890:18:18:57:562:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implemented in later years.  By increasing the sample size to include all years under President Rea-
27:1044:86990:18:18:57:562:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gan we can increase the precision of the estimates and check the robustness of the initial results.
27:1045:87089:18:18:57:562:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Columns 5 and 6 show that the point estimates are very similar when using this longer sample period
27:1046:87188:18:18:57:562:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from 1980 to 1988.  Column 6 also controls for other household characteristics including household
27:1047:87286:18:18:57:562:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income (federal AGI), a quadratic of the head’s age, and fixed effects for marital status, family size,
27:1048:87389:18:18:57:562:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number and composition of earners, and the level of education, where I use the maximum number
27:1049:87482:18:32:57:287:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of years of schooling across head and spouse.

27:1051:87584:24:17:75:562:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 4presents the main results of the analysis. Column 1 uses the same minimalist specification
27:1052:87681:17:18:57:562:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as before, but now on the full sample of households with AGI in the top quartile (by tax filer status

27:1054:87890:18:18:57:562:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for-one (in absolute value).  Adding the residual of the filtered news shock series (column 2) and

28:1058:88281:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(12) and fixed effects for each tax filer status.  The estimated spending response to the tax news
28:1059:88379:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shock  remains  largely  unchanged.   Column  5  is  the  preferred  specification  using  the  full  set  of
28:1060:88488:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controls, including the other household characteristics described above such as household income
28:1061:88584:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and age.  The household spending response to the news shocks remains about one-for-one, although
28:1062:88680:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:still measured with substantial standard errors.  Nevertheless,  the null hypothesis of no forward-
28:1063:88779:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:looking behavior is strongly rejected.  As mentioned above, this of course does not confirm the basic
28:1064:88880:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:life-cycle model, and given the relatively large standard errors many other models that also feature
28:1065:88980:18:18:57:409:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forward-looking behavior are consistent with the estimated response.
28:1066:89048:18:18:75:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, column 6 runs the same regression on the smaller sample of households in the top 10%
28:1067:89141:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of federal AGI for whom the news shock should be measured with less error since it depends much
28:1068:89236:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less  on  the  assumption  made  in  equation  (11).   While  the  precision  decreases  by  about  50%  as
28:1069:89343:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected based on the substantial reduction in sample size, the point estimate is almost unchanged
28:1070:89441:18:33:57:333:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and remains economically and statistically significant.
28:1071:89496:33:23:57:451:469:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:3.6  Response Heterogeneity and Ricardian Equivalence
28:1072:89549:23:18:75:562:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As  mentioned  above,  a  model  with  dynastic  households  that  are  altruistically  linked  or  with
28:1073:89653:18:18:57:562:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an infinitely-lived representative agent with rational expectations would (under some assumptions)
28:1074:89751:18:18:57:562:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predict that consumption would not change to changes in expected future taxes if those taxes were
28:1075:89848:18:18:57:562:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lump-sum and if government spending was expected to remain unchanged;  seeBarro(1974) and
28:1076:89937:18:18:57:562:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Seater(1993).  Ideally, we would have a measure of households’ expectations of future changes in
28:1077:90033:18:17:57:562:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government  spending  (and  of  pre-tax  income).   Unfortunately,  such  measures  are  in  general  not
28:1078:90138:17:18:57:562:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available; seeRamey(2011) for an exception.  In this section I instead analyze three dimensions of
28:1079:90236:18:18:57:562:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cross-sectional heterogeneity that are informative to assess the degree of Ricardian equivalence in
28:1080:90335:18:18:57:103:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the data.
28:1081:90344:18:18:75:562:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, I test whether there is a difference in the spending response to tax news shocks between
28:1082:90439:18:18:57:562:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families with and without children. Under Ricardian equivalence we would expect parents to respond
28:1083:90537:18:18:57:562:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less to the tax news since their children will be affected by future changes in government spending
28:1084:90636:18:18:57:562:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or by future changes in taxes not captured by the 30-year forecast horizon used in this paper; see
28:1085:90734:18:18:57:562:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff(1992,1997).  Column 1 ofTable 5shows that we cannot reject the
28:1086:90827:18:18:57:562:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis that households with children respond as strongly as households without children.  One
28:1087:90924:18:18:57:562:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:might be worried about misclassification if young households plan to have children but currently
28:1088:91020:18:18:57:562:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not have any yet or if older households had children that are not living in the same household
28:1089:91117:18:18:57:562:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anymore.  Column 2 therefore restricts the sample to households between 30 and 50 years old.  The
28:1090:91214:18:18:57:562:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:point  estimates  remain  largely  unchanged  suggesting  that  measurement  error  is  not  driving  the
28:1091:91319:18:17:57:562:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similarity in the responses.  In fact, in both cases the point estimate of households with children is
28:1092:91421:17:18:57:285:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:slightly larger than that of childless families.
28:1093:91469:18:0:75:562:70:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  we  would  expect  younger  households  to  respond  less  to  the  tax  news  since  they  are
29:1094:91575:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to face off-setting changes in government spending in the future.  Column 3 shows that
29:1095:91673:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the response is similar for all households below age 55 and that households in the oldest 10-year
29:1096:91770:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age bin in fact respond less, not more, rejecting equal responses with a p-value of 0.3%.  Again, the
29:1097:91871:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households which should respond the least in the presence of Ricardian equivalence effects have in
29:1098:91969:18:18:57:219:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fact the largest point estimates.
29:1099:92002:18:18:75:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, I split the sample by whether household have a mortgage.  We would expect that house-
29:1100:92094:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holds with a mortgage would respond less if they fear that these future tax changes will be financed
29:1101:92194:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by reducing or eliminating the mortgage interest tax deduction, which is one instance of government
29:1102:92293:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:benefits that disproportionately favor richer households.22Column 4 instead shows that mortgage
29:1103:92388:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:owners  respond  similarly  to  the  news  as  households  without  a  mortgage.   Again,  the  point  esti-
29:1104:92496:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mate for mortgage owners is larger, not smaller.  Hence, these three tests suggest that Ricardian
29:1105:92593:17:38:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equivalence is not a first-order concern when interpreting the spending responses to tax news shocks.
29:1106:92694:38:23:57:538:500:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:C:4  Robustness of the Spending Response to News Shocks
29:1107:92747:23:18:75:562:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, I extend the previous analysis by adding two alternative tests of the underlying
29:1108:92844:18:18:57:562:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism and I check the robustness of the finding that changes in expected future taxes have
29:1109:92938:18:18:57:562:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large  effects  on  households’  current  spending.   I  investigate  the  sensitivity  of  the  main  result  to
29:1110:93051:18:18:57:562:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using different sub-sample periods not previously analyzed and to alternative normalizations of the
29:1111:93150:18:18:57:562:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending changes.  I also test the robustness of the results to different procedures of filtering the tax
29:1112:93255:18:18:57:562:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:news shocks and to controlling for bond risk directly.  In all specifications I use the baseline sample
29:1113:93358:18:18:57:562:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of households in the top quartile of the AGI distribution by tax filer status in each year and the full
29:1114:93461:18:32:57:266:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set of controls as in column 5 ofTable 4.
29:1115:93502:32:23:57:340:319:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:4.1  Alternative Tests of the Mechanism
29:1116:93541:23:18:75:562:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 6provides two alternative tests of the underlying mechanism that focus on the absence
29:1117:93632:18:18:57:562:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  a  response  in  cases  where  we  would  not  expect  to  find  an  effect.   The  first  such  test  focuses
29:1118:93746:18:18:57:562:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on lower-income households.Figure 5shows that the average tax rate of households with an AGI
29:1119:93838:18:18:57:562:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below the median is only weakly correlated with average tax rates of households in the top of the
29:1120:93935:18:18:57:562:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income distribution.  The partial correlation between changes in the average tax rates of households
29:1121:94035:18:18:57:562:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below the median and households in the top 1% is only 3% and is not statistically different from
29:1122:94131:18:18:57:562:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero.   Consistent  with  news  about  top  tax  rates  not  being  informative  about  future  average  tax
29:1123:94239:18:18:57:562:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates for households below the median, column 1 shows no spending response of those households
29:1124:94333:18:17:57:248:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the bond-based tax news measure.
29:1125:94368:17:18:75:562:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  I  analyze  the  response  of  household  spending  during  a  period  in  which  factors  other
29:1126:94473:18:18:57:562:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than tax news dominate the municipal bond market and hence in which the identification approach
29:1127:94568:18:18:57:562:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should break down.  As discussed above and seen inFigure 1, in the absence of additional variation
29:1128:94666:18:16:67:562:81:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:22Note that any wealthy-hand-to-mouth borrowing constraints would also predict a lower response of households
29:1129:94775:16:0:57:377:65:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:with mortgages and hence bias the test in favor of Ricardian equivalence.
30:1130:94850:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from  election  probabilities,  the  bond-based  measure  of  expected  tax  rates  works  well  in  the  late
30:1131:94960:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1990s and particularly in the early 1980s when marginal rates change dramatically.  However, the
30:1132:95056:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:break-even tax rates at short maturities behave poorly in the early 1990s.  Columns 2 and 3 split
30:1133:95153:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sample accordingly in order to investigate whether the household spending response also reflects
30:1134:95253:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this pattern.  Column 2 excludes the period from 1989 to 1992 when the relationship between short-
30:1135:95351:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:term municipal yield spreads and the top tax rate breaks down.  The spending response increases
30:1136:95446:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:slightly but remains similar to the full-sample estimate.  However, column 3 shows that the measure
30:1137:95545:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of expected tax liabilities does not predict household spending from 1989 to 1992, in line with this
30:1138:95645:18:18:57:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disconnect.  In fact, the positive but insignificant point estimate of the news residual is consistent
30:1139:95747:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the fact that short-term break-even tax rates move in opposite direction to the top marginal
30:1140:95844:18:32:57:101:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax rate.
30:1141:95853:32:23:57:504:523:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:4.2  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Changes in the Tax Base
30:1142:95912:23:18:75:562:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 7 provides additional robustness checks of the main results.  As discussed above and more
30:1143:96007:18:18:57:562:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extensively in the online appendix, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) also changed tax brackets
30:1144:96101:18:18:57:562:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in addition to changing marginal rates.  Column 1 analyzes how excluding TRA from the analysis
30:1145:96195:18:18:57:562:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affects the results. Since the bond markets might have predicted part of the rate decreases associated
30:1146:96297:18:18:57:562:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with TRA already several years in advance as suggested byFigure 4, we cannot use data prior to
30:1147:96391:18:18:57:562:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1986.  Furthermore, since the municipal yield spread appears disconnected from tax fundamentals
30:1148:96486:18:18:57:562:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the short end of the term structure in the early 1990s (Figure 1andTable 6) I restrict the sample
30:1149:96586:18:18:57:562:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to years 1993-2001.  Column 1 shows that despite the substantial reduction in the sample size, the
30:1150:96684:18:17:57:562:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated response of household spending to tax news shocks is similar to the response over the full
30:1151:96784:17:18:57:132:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample period.
30:1152:96798:18:18:75:562:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column  2  relates  the  analysis  to  the  previous  literature  on  fiscal  foresight  by  only  using  the
30:1153:96907:18:18:57:562:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legislated  lags  proposed  by  the  narrative  analysis  ofYang(2008)  as  a  measure  of  the  length  of
30:1154:97014:18:18:57:562:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax policy foresight.  These are defined as the periods between the time a tax proposal was first
30:1155:97111:18:18:57:562:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentioned  by  a  President  and  when  it  was  enacted,  but  before  rates  changed.   These  periods
30:1156:97215:18:18:57:562:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore exclude the times before the formal introduction of a tax bill to Congress, which contains
30:1157:97315:18:18:57:562:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:most  of  the  news.   In  particular,  it  excludes  any  information  that  becomes  available  during  a

30:1159:97530:18:18:57:562:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variation associated with the Reagan tax cuts shown in the first five panels ofFigure 4.  Moreover,
30:1160:97629:18:18:57:562:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this restriction also excludes false negatives, i.e., news about possible future tax changes that did
30:1161:97730:18:18:57:562:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not  materialize.   Despite  throwing  away  a  substantial  amount  of  identifying  variation  household
30:1162:97836:18:18:57:562:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending  strongly  responds  to  the  bond-based  measure  of  fiscal  news  even  in  this  very  limited
30:1163:97943:18:18:57:95:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample.
30:1164:97950:18:17:75:562:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, column 3 analyzes the robustness of the measure of consumption growth using lagged
30:1165:98041:17:18:57:562:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending as an alternative normalization of spending changes, which is the specification obtained
30:1166:98138:18:0:57:562:70:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when log-linearizing the inter-temporal budget constraint.  To make the coefficient comparable with
31:1167:98239:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the previous specifications, I scale the series by the sample median of the ratio of consumption to
31:1168:98338:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predetermined  income.   The  point  estimate  is  very  similar  to  the  main  response  in  column  5  of
31:1169:98446:18:33:57:316:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 4, while the standard error is slightly larger.

31:1171:98546:23:18:75:562:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Are  the  results  driven  by  the  structure  imposed  by  the  life-cycle  model  when  deriving  the

31:1173:98750:18:18:57:562:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduced-form tax news shock that follows the Bartik approach outlined in section 3.1but does not

31:1190:99342:59:18:75:562:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 8shows very similar result when using this reduced-form tax news shock instead of the
31:1191:99433:18:18:57:562:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more structural news shock in (12).  In particular, higher-income households with an AGI in the
31:1192:99528:18:18:57:562:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:top quartile (column 1) or in the top 10% (column 2) strongly respond to news about future tax
31:1193:99622:18:18:57:562:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes, while households with below-median AGI (column 3) are not affected by news about future
31:1194:99718:18:18:57:562:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax rates in higher income brackets.  Hence, the results are not driven by the structural model used
31:1195:99818:18:33:57:427:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to derive the household-level tax news shocks used in the main analysis.

31:1197:99940:23:18:75:562:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The analysis so far used the two-sided low-pass filter described in the previous section to filter
31:1198:100038:18:18:57:562:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out noise unrelated to tax news from the break-even tax rate series.Table 9reports results using
31:1199:100134:18:17:57:562:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different  filters  shown  inFigure  6.   The  two  year  cut-off  is  conservative  since  it  probably  filters
31:1200:100247:17:18:57:562:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out some tax news shocks.  This loss of information lowers the precision of the spending response
31:1201:100344:18:18:57:562:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates.  On the other hand, this cut-off value lowers the level of noise in the tax news shocks.  The
31:1202:100448:18:18:57:562:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduction of the noise reduces the potential attenuation bias in the spending response coefficients.
31:1203:100548:18:18:57:562:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, the choice of the frequency cut-off reflects a trade-off between bias and efficiency of the
31:1204:100650:18:18:57:562:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates.  To see this trade-off, columns 2 and 3 use different cut-offs.  Column 2 uses a filter that
31:1205:100753:18:18:57:562:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:passes frequencies lower than eight years and hence is even more conservative than the baseline two-
31:1206:100853:18:18:57:562:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year filter.  While eight years might appear to be excessive,Figure 6shows that this filtered series
31:1207:100953:18:18:57:562:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is not very different from the filtered series using the baseline two-year filter.  As expected, column
31:1208:101056:18:18:57:562:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2 reports a less precisely estimated spending response with a higher point estimate, although one
31:1209:101153:18:18:57:562:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cannot reject that the response is the same as in the main analysis reproduced for convenience in
31:1210:101250:18:0:57:107:58:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:column 1.
32:1211:101261:0:18:75:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column 3 on the other hand passes higher frequencies than in the baseline specification.Figure 6
32:1212:101357:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows that passing all frequencies lower than half a year makes the filtered series fairly volatile.  As
32:1213:101461:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected, the standard error of the estimated spending response falls by more than 60%, but the
32:1214:101556:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:noisier measure severely attenuates the estimated spending response.  To see this point more clearly,
32:1215:101657:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:column 4 uses the raw series without any filtering.  As expected, the substantial noise introduced by
32:1216:101758:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the high-frequency shocks biases the spending response to zero.  In fact, the attenuation bias in both
32:1217:101860:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cases is almost complete, resulting in an estimated response that is economically and statistically
32:1218:101959:18:18:57:122:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant.
32:1219:101973:18:18:75:562:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column 5 addresses the concern that a two-sided filter uses not only current and lagged obser-
32:1220:102067:18:18:57:562:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vations, but also future ones.  Therefore, the econometrician might overestimate the information set
32:1221:102167:18:17:57:562:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of consumers, thereby underestimating the response to news.  This would be the case for example
32:1222:102262:17:18:57:562:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if households tried to infer the path of expected tax ratesEtτfrom municipal yield spreadsθt.  The
32:1223:102360:18:18:57:562:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households and the econometrician would solve effectively the same signal extraction problem in
32:1224:102455:18:18:57:562:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real time.  Therefore,  in this scenario the econometrician should only use current and past bond
32:1225:102552:18:18:57:562:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices to infer the households’ information sets.  The difference between the two ways of modeling
32:1226:102650:18:18:57:562:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information can be seen from the way the econometrician solves the signal extraction problem of
32:1227:102745:18:18:57:562:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation (5).  The approach taken so far implies that the optimal solution is a two-sided filter, while
32:1228:102848:18:18:57:562:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this alternative view requires the use of a backward-looking one-sided filter.  To account for this
32:1229:102947:18:18:57:562:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possibility,  I use the optimal one-sided Hodrick-Prescott filter suggested byMehra(2004),  and I
32:1230:103044:18:18:57:562:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:followRavn and Uhlig(2002) in setting the smoothing parameter.  One-sided filters only use current
32:1231:103142:18:18:57:562:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and lagged observations, but induce a phase-shift; that is, the filtered series lags the raw data and
32:1232:103243:18:18:57:562:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence  detects  a  change  in  the  trend  only  with  some  delay.   This  phase-shift,  shown  inFigure  6,
32:1233:103352:18:18:57:562:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:introduces measurement error in the news shock and might therefore bias the spending response
32:1234:103445:18:17:57:562:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:toward zero under the plausible scenario in which households do not use municipal bonds to infer
32:1235:103541:17:18:57:562:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future tax rates.  Column 5 shows that the estimated spending response to the tax news shock that
32:1236:103638:18:18:57:421:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uses a one-sided filter is very similar to the main estimate in column 1.
32:1237:103711:18:18:75:562:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column 6 instead directly controls for these other bond risk factors by taking residuals from
32:1238:103804:18:18:57:562:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regressing the BETRs on the corresponding Treasury on-the-run/off-the-run yield spreads before
32:1239:103898:18:18:57:562:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applying the filter.23The household spending response remains economically and statistically sig-
32:1240:103995:18:18:57:562:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nificant  and  is  similar  to  the  baseline  result.   The  smaller  point  estimate  is  consistent  with  the
32:1241:104108:18:18:57:507:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regression residual being more volatile and hence noisier than the original BETR series.
32:1242:104196:18:18:75:562:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, note that all specifications ofTable 9contain essentially the same information:  adding
32:1243:104292:18:18:57:562:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the residual to the filtered news shock reproduces the raw series used in column 4.  The residual is
32:1244:104392:18:18:57:562:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:never statistically or economically significant.  This suggest for example that even if we interpret the
32:1245:104496:18:18:57:562:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of the term-structure of break-even tax rates as a linear approximation of a more complete
32:1246:104592:18:18:57:562:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but non-linear model such as the one proposed byGreen(1993), the higher-order terms of such a
32:1247:104685:18:17:57:377:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model do not significantly affect household spending behavior.
32:1248:104747:17:0:67:407:72:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:?:23This spread is the only risk measure available going back to the late 1970s.
33:1249:104827:0:18:75:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall,  the  results  in  this  section  show  that  the  estimated  spending  response  to  tax  news
33:1250:104931:18:18:57:562:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  similar  under  alternative  specifications.   More  importantly,  the  point  estimates  change  in  the
33:1251:105040:18:18:57:562:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:direction we would expect if the tax news shocks indeed measure the persistent component of changes
33:1252:105139:18:18:57:562:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in expected future tax liabilities.  First, the response is lower in absolute value than predicted by the
33:1253:105244:18:18:57:562:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:life-cycle model if we use shocks that are not guided by theory or if we use noisier shocks while it is
33:1254:105347:18:18:57:562:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in line with the theory if we filter out the noise and use theory-based news shocks (Tables 8and9).
33:1255:105446:18:18:57:562:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, the response is stronger when looking at households which are more affected by the news
33:1256:105541:18:18:57:562:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or when looking at periods during which we would expect the identification approach to work best
33:1257:105637:18:37:57:107:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Table 6).
33:1258:105647:37:23:57:169:554:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:C:5  Conclusion
33:1259:105660:23:18:75:562:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper identifies tax expectations using the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt
33:1260:105752:18:18:57:562:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds  with  maturities  of  one  to  thirty  years.   Combining  these  tax  expectations  with  household
33:1261:105859:18:18:57:562:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending data shows that the basic life-cycle consumption model with forward-looking households
33:1262:105954:18:18:57:562:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:describes  the  behavior  of  higher-income  households  remarkably  well.   This  paper  is  the  first  to
33:1263:106062:18:18:57:562:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly measure the response of household spending to news shocks, and thus is the first direct test
33:1264:106163:18:18:57:494:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the theory’s prediction for the response of household spending to new information.
33:1265:106248:18:18:75:562:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While  a  full  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  implications  of  these  results  is  beyond  the  scope
33:1266:106354:18:18:57:562:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  this  paper,  it  is  nevertheless  useful  to  discuss  two  issues  related  to  fiscal  policy.   First,  the
33:1267:106470:18:18:57:562:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response of household consumption to news about future tax policies suggests that studies which
33:1268:106565:18:18:57:562:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ignore anticipation effects do not capture the total effect of a tax change on the economy.  Whether
33:1269:106665:18:17:57:562:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the anticipation effect documented in this paper amplifies or dampens the effect that such studies
33:1270:106763:17:18:57:562:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:typically  find—for  example  due  to  households  that  exhibit  excess  sensitivity  in  consumption—
33:1271:106866:18:18:57:562:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depends on how this policy changes households’ expectations about other future tax policies.  For
33:1272:106963:18:18:57:562:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example,  a  tax  reform  that  is  expected  to  permanently  lower  taxes  would  cause  unconstrained
33:1273:107067:18:18:57:562:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forward-looking households to respond to the news, while constrained households (either because
33:1274:107162:18:18:57:562:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of economic or behavioral frictions) would respond to the actual tax change, in which case the total
33:1275:107262:18:18:57:562:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measured effect of a tax reform would be amplified by including the anticipation effects.  On the
33:1276:107359:18:18:57:562:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other hand, a tax stimulus that targets constrained households and is expected to be paid for by
33:1277:107455:18:18:57:562:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increasing taxes on unconstrained households in the future would cause the anticipation and excess
33:1278:107553:18:18:57:556:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sensitivity effects to go in opposite directions, thereby dampening the total effect of the stimulus.
33:1279:107654:18:18:75:562:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  while the anticipation effect could partially overcome the long implementation lag of
33:1280:107748:18:18:57:562:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fiscal  policies  (a  major  limitation  of  taxes  as  short-run  policy  instruments)  the  fact  that  coun-
33:1281:107859:18:18:57:562:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tercyclical policies are usually designed to be budget neutral over the business cycle implies that
33:1282:107958:18:17:57:562:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forward-looking households might realize that a countercyclical tax policy has little effect on their
33:1283:108059:17:18:57:516:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lifetime income and might thus respond neither to the news nor to the actual tax change.
33:1284:108147:18:18:75:562:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Clearly,  more  research  on  the  response  of  households  to  news  shocks  needs  to  be  undertaken
33:1285:108251:18:0:57:562:65:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:before such data can offer policy guidance that is empirically well-grounded.  Identifying more news
34:1286:108353:0:18:57:562:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shocks that directly affect household budget sets is clearly desirable in order to verify the results of

36:1373:114840:23:18:75:562:705:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This section provides more details about the household spending and income data used in the
36:1374:114931:18:18:57:562:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis.   I  use  sample  restrictions  that  are  common  in  the  literature;  see  for  example,Souleles
36:1375:115040:18:18:57:561:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1999) orJohnson, Parker and Souleles(2006).  In particular, I restrict the sample to households
36:1376:115136:18:18:57:562:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with complete income reports and non-zero income where the head’s age is between 25 and 65 years
36:1377:115232:18:18:57:562:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the head is not a student.  In addition, I drop the following cases:  interviews with more or less
36:1378:115334:18:18:57:562:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than three monthly observations; households with zero food or total expenditures; non-consecutive
36:1379:115431:18:18:57:562:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interviews; observations with negative expenditures where there should not be any; households with
36:1380:115529:18:18:57:562:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more than one consumer unit;  households for which the family size changes by more than three;
36:1381:115623:18:18:57:562:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households for which the age of any member increases by more than one or decreases; and households
36:1382:115721:18:18:57:562:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with negative liquid wealth; and households with positive business or farm income.  I correct sample
36:1383:115821:18:18:57:562:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:breaks in the following few expenditure categories due to slight changes in the questionnaire: food at
36:1384:115923:18:18:57:562:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:home (’82Q1-’88Q1), personal care services (’01Q2), occupation expenditures (’01Q2), and property
36:1385:116020:18:17:57:562:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taxes (’91Q1).  As recommended by the BLS, I sum expenditures that occur in the same month but
36:1386:116114:17:18:57:238:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are reported in different interviews.
36:1387:116151:18:18:75:562:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:I impute taxes with the NBER TAXSIM calculator using an iterative procedure to determine the
36:1388:116243:18:18:57:562:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:itemization status of each household and to account for deductions that depend on the household’s
36:1389:116340:18:18:57:562:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:AGI such as health-care or job expenses. The code is available atwww.nber.org/∼taxsim/to-taxsim/

36:1391:116537:18:18:57:562:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend on the head of household’s age and the household’s predetermined income percentile.  These
36:1392:116634:18:18:57:562:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profiles allow for predictable changes in average tax rates due to the hump shape of the life-cycle
36:1393:116733:18:18:57:562:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income profile.  Other studies also found that household income dynamics are well approximated by
36:1394:116830:18:18:57:562:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a random walk after controlling for the age profile of income; see e.g.,Abowd and Card(1989) and
36:1395:116926:18:18:57:562:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Meghir and Pistaferri(2004).  Predetermined income summarizes observed household characteristics
36:1396:117022:18:18:57:562:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as education and experience as well as unobserved heterogeneity such as work effort. Household
36:1397:117121:18:18:57:562:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age has predictive power for future income even conditional on work experience.  Having only two
36:1398:117217:18:18:57:553:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dimensions guarantees that there are at least 20 households in each age-income cell in each year.
36:1399:117314:18:17:75:562:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:I estimate future average tax rates non-parametrically; in particular, I discretize the joint distri-
36:1400:117415:17:18:57:562:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bution of age and income and assume that the household remains in the same age-specific income
36:1401:117509:18:18:57:562:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentile  throughout  its  life-cycle.24I  use  households  age  65  to  75  to  estimate  counter-factual
36:1402:117617:18:18:57:562:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:retirement income after age 65.  I assume that households expect to receive this level of retirement
36:1403:117717:18:18:57:562:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income for the rest of the planning period.  I limit the estimation of the retirement period to house-
36:1404:117819:18:18:57:562:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holds between ages 65 to 75 due to the fact that the quality of the survey answers tends to be poorer
36:1405:117920:18:39:57:135:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for old retirees.
36:1406:117937:39:16:67:561:92:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:24More  precisely,  I  use  the  following  income  percentile  thresholds:  10,20,...,50,55,...,95.   I  use  a  finer  grid
36:1407:118062:16:12:57:562:76:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:for higher incomes to better account for the increasing income inequality during the sample period.  I use age bins
36:1408:118177:12:12:57:562:64:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:with a 10-year range to have at least 20 households in each cell.  The five age bins 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-75
36:1409:118295:12:0:57:261:52:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:approximate the income life-cycle profiles well.
