2:33:1876:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In practice, teacher turnover appears to have negative effects on school quality as measured by student
2:34:1979:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:performance. However, some simulations suggest that turnover can instead have large, positive effects
2:35:2080:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:under a policy regime in which low-performing teachers can be accurately identified and replaced
2:36:2176:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with more effective teachers. This study examines this question by evaluating the effects of teacher
2:37:2276:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:turnover on student achievement under IMPACT, the unique performance-assessment and incentive
2:38:2369:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:system in the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). Employing a quasi-experimental design
2:39:2464:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:based on data from the first year years of IMPACT, we find that, on average, DCPS replaced teachers
2:40:2563:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who left with teachers who increased student achievement by 0.08 SD in math. When we isolate the
2:41:2659:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:effects of lower-performing teachers who were induced to leave DCPS for poor performance, we find
2:42:2756:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that student achievement improves by larger and statistically significant amounts (i.e., 0.14 SD in reading
2:43:2863:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and 0.21 SD in math). In contrast, the effect of exits by teachers not sanctioned under IMPACT is
2:44:2960:14:42:72:309:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:typically negative but not statistically significant.

3:73:3516:27:20:86:555:689:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Having an effective teacher can dramatically alter students’ educational and economic outcomes. 
3:74:3612:20:21:50:540:669:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Yet, we know there are substantial differences in the quality of public school teachers, and increasing 
3:75:3716:21:21:50:533:648:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:evidence that in some urban areas less effective teachers are often concentrated in lower-performing 
3:76:3817:21:21:50:545:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:schools serving disadvantaged students. Policymakers and researchers recognize these issues and have 
3:77:3918:21:20:50:562:606:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sought policies to provide all children with effective teachers. The selective retention of effective teachers 
3:78:4029:20:21:50:546:586:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:has been one of the most-discussed strategies that may contribute to this goal. In theory, districts could 
3:79:4136:21:21:50:554:565:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dismiss ineffective teachers, hire more effective teachers and redouble efforts to retain effective teachers 
3:80:4245:21:20:50:550:544:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in these schools. However, we know relatively little about how such policies would work in practice. In 
3:81:4349:20:21:50:558:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:particular, the capacity of districts to identify effective teachers at the hiring stage is limited (Boyd, et al., 
3:82:4464:21:21:50:537:503:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2008; Rockoff & Speroni, 2010; Rockoff, et al., 2011). Furthermore, research and practice have only 
3:83:4564:21:21:50:518:482:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:recently begun making progress on accurately and reliably assessing teacher effectiveness. Some 
3:84:4660:21:20:50:535:461:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:simulations (Hanushek, 2009; Staiger & Rockoff, 2010) estimate that dismissal of the least effective 
3:85:4761:20:21:50:563:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers would dramatically improve student achievement. However, these simulations make assumptions 
3:86:4862:21:21:50:562:420:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regarding the retention of more effective teachers and the labor supply of new teachers that may be overly 
3:87:4969:21:20:50:558:399:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:optimistic. For example, if teacher evaluation and dismissal policies cause more effective teachers to feel 
3:88:5077:20:21:50:562:379:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their jobs are threatened, such policies may have the unintended consequence of actually lowering teacher 
3:89:5183:21:21:50:532:358:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:quality (Rothstein, 2015). The ultimate outcome depends on the details of the policy, the behavioral 
3:90:5284:21:27:50:556:337:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:response of teachers, and the characteristics of the local labor market from which new teachers are hired. 
3:91:5391:27:20:86:542:310:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Some school districts have begun to implement rigorous teacher-evaluation policies that could 
3:92:5485:20:21:50:546:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:systematically dismiss meaningful numbers of ineffective teachers (Thomsen, 2014). However, we are 
3:93:5584:21:20:50:541:269:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unaware of any research that documents how the patterns of teacher turnover created by such policies 
3:94:5685:20:21:50:545:249:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(i.e., the attrition of teachers sanctioned for low performance, other teachers choosing to leave, and the 
3:95:5792:21:21:50:527:228:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hiring of new teachers) influence student achievement.  In this study, we provide such evidence by 
3:96:5891:21:21:50:563:207:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:examining the effects of teacher turnover under IMPACT, a seminal teacher-evaluation and compensation 
3:97:5993:21:20:50:551:186:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system introduced in the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). Implemented at the beginning of 
3:98:6094:20:21:50:518:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the 2009-10 school year, IMPACT evaluates all teachers annually based on multiple measures of 
3:99:6188:21:21:50:558:145:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectiveness. Teachers rated as “Highly Effective” are offered large financial and non-financial rewards; 
3:100:6295:21:20:50:555:124:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:those rated as “Ineffective” or twice consecutively “Minimally Effective” are separated from the district. 
3:101:6402:20:21:50:562:104:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In a purely descriptive sense, DCPS appears to be successful employing compositional change to improve 
3:102:6505:21:0:50:561:83:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the quality of teaching. The average IMPACT scores of entering teachers exceed those of exiting teachers 
4:103:6612:0:21:50:561:716:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in each of the three years for which we have data (Figure 1); average differences vary between a third and 
4:104:6719:21:20:50:543:695:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a half of a standard deviation of teacher quality. Although these are impressive differences, there are a 
4:105:6825:20:21:50:530:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:variety of reasons why the overall averages may misrepresent the ability of DCPS to systematically 
4:106:6924:21:27:50:396:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:improve teacher quality in the classrooms where they are most needed.  
4:107:6995:27:21:86:561:627:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We employ a quasi-experimental event study to examine teacher turnover and its effect on student 
4:108:7092:21:20:50:532:606:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achievement in DCPS in 2011 through 2013. Specifically, we rely on school-grade-year cells as our 
4:109:7190:20:21:50:532:586:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fundamental unit of observation and examine, in “difference-in-differences” specifications, how the 
4:110:7290:21:21:50:557:565:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:patterns of teacher mobility influence student test performance in math and English language arts (ELA). 
4:111:7395:21:20:50:562:544:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We find that teacher turnover in DCPS had an overall positive effect on student achievement in math (i.e., 
4:112:7502:20:21:50:547:524:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:0.08 standard deviations), and that the effect of turnover in reading is also positive (i.e., 0.046 standard 
4:113:7611:21:21:50:554:503:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:deviations) but is only significant at the 10 percent level. However, the overall effect of teacher turnover 
4:114:7720:21:21:50:511:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:masks considerable heterogeneity. We find that, when low-performing teachers (i.e., those with 
4:115:7815:21:20:50:560:461:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Ineffective” or “Minimally Effective” ratings under IMPACT) leave the classroom, student achievement 
4:116:7917:20:21:50:563:441:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:grows by 21 percent of a standard deviation in math and 14 percent of a standard deviation in reading. We 
4:117:8023:21:21:50:560:420:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:also find that the attrition of high-performing teachers (i.e., those rated “Effective” or “Highly Effective”) 
4:118:8134:21:26:50:409:399:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on student performance. 
4:119:8211:26:21:86:512:373:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:To be clear, this paper should not be viewed as an evaluation of IMPACT, or even as an 
4:120:8298:21:21:50:546:352:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:assessment of IMPACT’s differential effect on teacher composition in DCPS.1 Instead, we believe this 
4:121:8399:21:21:50:562:331:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:paper makes an important contribution by examining the effects of teacher turnover under a unique policy 
4:122:8504:21:20:50:534:310:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:regime. The existing literature finds that teacher turnover negatively influences student achievement 
4:123:8606:20:21:50:560:290:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(Bryk & Schneider, 2002; Guin, 2004;Ronfeldt, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2013), perhaps due to the difficulty of 
4:124:8709:21:20:50:558:269:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:replacing experienced teachers who leave and through disruptive effects among the teachers who remain. 
4:125:8812:20:21:50:548:249:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:However, teacher turnover may instead have large positive effects if school districts can accurately and 
4:126:8917:21:21:50:531:228:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:systematically identify low-performing teachers and replace them with more effective teachers. But 
4:127:9016:21:21:50:563:207:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:whether that can be achieved at scale in a real-world setting is an open, empirical question. In our study of 
4:128:9126:21:20:50:530:186:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:DCPS schools under IMPACT, we find overall positive effects of teacher turnover. However, these 
4:129:9222:20:30:50:505:166:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:effects are highly heterogenous. The exits of teachers identified as low-performing on average 
4:130:9317:30:7:194:197:136:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                
4:131:9364:7:16:50:556:129:42:g_d0_f4:97:g_d0_f4:1 A conventional impact evaluation is not feasible because IMPACT was a district-wide reform and because data from the pre-
4:132:9487:16:11:50:549:113:97:g_d0_f4:97:g_d0_f4:IMPACT era are not generally available. However, the regression-discontinuity study by Dee and Wyckoff (2015) indicates 
4:133:9607:11:0:50:535:102:97:g_d0_f4:97:g_d0_f4:how the incentive contrasts created by IMPACT influenced the retention and subsequent performance of extant teachers. 
5:134:9726:0:21:50:526:716:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:meaningfully improve student achievement, while in some cases exits of high-performing teachers 
5:135:9822:21:20:50:547:695:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:negatively influence achievement. Critically, the supply of entering teachers appears to be of sufficient 
5:136:9928:20:21:50:546:675:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:quality to sustain a relatively high turnover rate. Nonetheless, retaining more high-performing teachers 
5:137:10033:21:33:50:311:654:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:would provide substantial direct and indirect benefits. 
5:138:10089:33:27:50:116:621:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f5:Background 
5:139:10099:27:20:86:547:594:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Improving teacher quality in schools with poor, low-performing and largely non-white students 
5:140:10193:20:21:50:560:574:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:has become an imperative of education policy. A recent body of research has made clear that the variance 
5:141:10298:21:21:50:548:553:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in teacher effectiveness is qualitatively large and that more effective teachers can dramatically improve 
5:142:10404:21:20:50:531:532:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:students’ short and long-run life outcomes (Aaronson, Barrow, & Sander, 2007; Chetty et al., 2014; 
5:143:10503:20:21:50:537:512:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Jackson, 2012; Rivkin, Hanushek, & Kain, 2005; Rockoff, 2004). Furthermore, the evidence of stark 
5:144:10601:21:21:50:551:491:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:inequities in access to effective teachers (Goldhaber et al., 2015; Isenberg et al., 2013; Sass et al., 2012) 
5:145:10711:21:21:50:527:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:has also motivated efforts to improve teacher effectiveness as a means of reducing educational and 
5:146:10810:21:20:50:562:449:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:economic inequality.  Policies to improve teacher effectiveness can be conceptualized as either improving 
5:147:10916:20:21:50:544:429:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the performance of existing teachers or altering the composition of teachers. In this study, we focus on 
5:148:11021:21:21:50:538:408:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:how changes in the composition of the teacher workforce (i.e., due to turnover and hiring) influences 
5:149:11123:21:26:50:350:387:144:g_d0_f5:63:g_d0_f5:student outcomes under a system of performance assessment.2 
5:150:11183:26:27:86:282:361:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Composition of the Teaching Workforce 
5:151:11221:27:21:86:540:334:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The composition of a district’s teachers improves when their policies retain the most effective 
5:152:11317:21:21:50:540:313:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:teachers, exit poorly performing teachers and select the most able entering teachers. High-performing 
5:153:11419:21:20:50:530:292:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:teachers leave their schools and districts for a variety of reasons, some personal, but most related to 
5:154:11523:20:21:50:555:272:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:attributes of their jobs (Johnson, Kraft, & Papay, 2011). Several descriptive studies link teacher turnover 
5:155:11631:21:20:50:556:251:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to negative school environments and poor student outcomes (Bryk & Schneider, 2002; Guin, 2004). And 
5:156:11731:20:21:50:561:231:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:this teacher turnover is likely to further exacerbate poor school performance through several mechanisms. 
5:157:11837:21:21:50:534:210:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Quasi-experimental evidence from New York City finds that teacher turnover leads to lower student 
5:158:11935:21:21:50:539:189:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:achievement (i.e., -0.08 SD in math and -0.05 SD in reading), and that some of that effect reflects the 
5:159:12039:21:35:50:521:168:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:disruptive nature of turnover on the students of teachers who remain (Ronfeldt, et al., 2013). This 
5:160:12139:35:8:194:197:133:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:                                                
5:161:12186:8:17:50:535:125:63:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:2 In reality, teacher policies often operate through both margins. That is, policies intended to alter the composition of the 
5:162:12312:17:0:50:559:108:97:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:workforce may also induce existing teachers to improve. Indeed, the design of IMPACT is intended to operate in this fashion.  
6:163:12439:0:21:50:561:716:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:evidence suggests that, in the absence of policies that effectively improve the composition of teachers, we 
6:164:12547:21:26:50:387:695:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:should expect turnover to result in a decrease in student achievement. 
6:165:12618:26:21:86:549:669:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:Increasing the retention of effective teachers would appear to be an obvious strategy to improve 
6:166:12715:21:21:50:521:648:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:teaching effectiveness, yet over a third of high-performing teachers report that they received little 
6:167:12817:21:21:50:561:627:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:encouragement from their principals to remain at their current school (TNTP, 2012). There is only limited 
6:168:12923:21:20:50:550:606:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:evidence that financial incentives make a difference in retaining teachers generally (Clotfelter, Glennie, 
6:169:13030:20:21:50:557:586:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:Ladd, & Vigdor, 2008; Glazerman & Seifullah, 2012) and high-performing teachers, specifically (Dee & 
6:170:13131:21:21:50:552:565:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:Wyckoff, 2015). Teacher tenure decisions offer an opportunity to differentially retain the most effective 
6:171:13237:21:20:50:535:544:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:novice teachers. While states are increasingly employing more rigorous evaluations as part of tenure 
6:172:13338:20:21:50:553:524:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:reviews, nearly all teachers reviewed are granted tenure (National Council on Teacher Quality, 2012). A 
6:173:13442:21:21:50:531:503:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:tenure review process that more meaningfully differentiates teacher effectiveness is associated with 
6:174:13543:21:27:50:552:482:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:substantial improvements in teacher quality and student achievement (Loeb, Miller, & Wyckoff, 2015).  
6:175:13645:27:20:86:557:455:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:In the absence of real-world evidence on the effects of policies that improve teacher composition, 
6:176:13744:20:21:50:542:435:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:researchers have simulated the effects of such policies. It is estimated that annually replacing teachers 
6:177:13850:21:21:50:562:414:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:who fall in the bottom 5 to 10 percent of the value-added distribution would improve student achievement 
6:178:13955:21:20:50:547:393:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:by 50 percent of a standard deviation (Hanushek, 2009). Similarly, Staiger and Rockoff (2010) suggest 
6:179:14057:20:21:50:563:373:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:that replacing 80 percent of first-year teachers with new hires would increase average teacher value-added 
6:180:14164:21:21:50:547:352:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:by 8 percent of a standard deviation of student achievement. However, making alternative assumptions 
6:181:14265:21:21:50:529:331:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:regarding the reliability of teacher quality measures and teachers’ behavioral responses to retention 
6:182:14367:21:20:50:527:310:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:policies can lead to different outcomes. Districts whose evaluation system leads to the dismissal of 
6:183:14468:20:21:50:564:290:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:meaningful numbers of teachers may face a limited supply of high-quality teachers. Teachers may find the 
6:184:14573:21:20:50:549:269:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:stress and uncertainty of these working conditions outweigh the benefits, including compensation. As a 
6:185:14676:20:21:50:510:249:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:result, such policies will need to be accompanied by improved working conditions or increased 
6:186:14770:21:27:50:216:228:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:compensation (Rothstein, 2015).   
6:187:14804:27:21:86:564:201:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:In sum, there is at best limited empirical evidence of the effects of differential retention policies on 
6:188:14909:21:20:50:550:180:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:teacher quality and student achievement. What evidence does directly bear on this issue are simulations 
6:189:15013:20:21:50:532:160:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:dependent on a series of simplifying assumptions about the policies and the behavioral responses of 
6:190:15113:21:0:50:562:139:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:existing teachers and the available labor market. Our study leverages the implementation of IMPACT, the 
7:191:15219:0:21:50:555:716:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:high-stakes teacher evaluation and compensation system in DCPS, to examine this issue directly in an at-
7:192:15323:21:32:50:118:695:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:scale setting.  
7:193:15339:32:27:86:229:663:144:g_d0_f10:144:g_d0_f10:Teacher Evaluation in DCPS 
7:194:15366:27:21:86:562:636:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:In just the last few years, the design and implementation of teacher evaluation has evolved quickly 
7:195:15466:21:21:50:563:615:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:as many districts look to improve teacher performance, partly under the encouragement of federal policies 
7:196:15572:21:20:50:562:594:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:such as waivers from the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act and the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF). While 
7:197:15673:20:21:50:547:574:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:these policy innovations are still a work in progress, best-practice principles of effective evaluation are 
7:198:15781:21:21:50:558:553:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:beginning to emerge (Donaldson & Papay, 2015). The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) were 
7:199:15880:21:20:50:543:532:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:an early and influential adopter. DCPS began evaluating teachers under IMPACT, a new performance-
7:200:15977:20:21:50:528:512:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:assessment and incentive system, during the 2009-10 school year.  The design of IMPACT appears 
7:201:16072:21:21:50:556:491:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:consistent with virtually all of the emerging best-practice principles. First, all teachers are evaluated on a 
7:202:16183:21:21:50:530:470:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:multi-faceted measure of teacher performance (e.g., clearly described standards, the use of multiple 
7:203:16284:21:20:50:521:449:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:teacher observations made by different observers and the use of student outcomes). Second, these 
7:204:16381:20:21:50:553:429:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:evaluations are linked to high-powered incentives that include the potential dismissal of low-performing 
7:205:16486:21:21:50:525:408:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:teachers and very large financial incentives for high-performers. Third, in addition to the feedback 
7:206:16587:21:20:50:531:387:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:associated with the evaluations, teachers are provided with various supports, including instructional 
7:207:16689:20:21:50:558:367:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:coaching to assist in improving their teaching practice.  Because IMPACT has been implemented at scale 
7:208:16792:21:27:50:511:346:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:over a sustained period, we have an opportunity to observe behavioral responses to the policy.   
7:209:16889:27:21:86:556:319:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:Each year, teachers receive a final IMPACT score that determines their IMPACT rating and their 
7:210:16984:21:20:50:563:298:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:associated consequences. IMPACT scores range from 100 – 400 points and are a weighted average of five 
7:211:17086:20:21:50:522:278:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:components employed to evaluate teachers. During the period of our study, IMPACT scores were 
7:212:17179:21:20:50:513:257:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:translated into one of four IMPACT ratings, which dictated consequences as shown in Table 1.3 
7:213:17272:20:21:50:526:237:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:Specifically, “Ineffective” teachers are separated from the district, as are teachers who receive two 
7:214:17374:21:21:50:561:216:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:consecutive “Minimally Effective” ratings. The financial incentives available to high-performing teachers 
7:215:17480:21:30:50:562:195:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:through IMPACTplus include one-time bonuses of up to $25,0004 and permanent increases to base-pay of 
7:216:17581:30:7:194:197:165:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:                                                
7:217:17628:7:16:50:556:158:42:g_d0_f9:97:g_d0_f9:3 In 2012-13, DCPS introduced a fifth IMPACT rating category (Developing) and increased the minimum score required for a 
7:218:17749:16:11:50:547:142:97:g_d0_f9:97:g_d0_f9:Minimally Effective (ME) rating. These revisions are inconsequential for our study as they influenced consequences for the 
7:219:17872:11:13:50:144:131:97:g_d0_f9:97:g_d0_f9:following school year.  
7:220:17895:13:16:50:541:118:42:g_d0_f9:97:g_d0_f9:4 Bonuses are available to teachers who receive a rating of Highly Effective (HE). The size of the bonuses varied based on 
7:221:18018:16:0:50:541:102:97:g_d0_f9:97:g_d0_f9:whether the teacher taught in a high-poverty school (defined to be a school where the percentage of free and reduced price 
8:222:18143:0:21:50:542:716:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:up to $27,000 per year, the present value of which are worth up to $185,259 in current dollars.5 These

8:243:19447:20:21:50:562:360:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:the annual attrition in DCPS is comparatively high, which may reflect the intended and unintended effects 
8:244:19553:21:21:50:544:339:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:of IMPACT as well as unique features of the local labor market. Interestingly, the attrition rate among 
8:245:19657:21:21:50:546:318:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:teachers rated as “Effective” or “Highly Effective” (high-performers) was only 13 percent. Attrition of 
8:246:19761:21:20:50:551:297:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:these higher-performing teachers was 10 percent in low-poverty schools and 14 percent in high-poverty

8:250:20258:11:13:50:240:233:97:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:whether the teacher taught a high-need subject. 
8:251:20305:13:16:50:548:220:42:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:5 Increases in base-pay are awarded to teachers with two consecutive HE ratings and vary by whether the teacher taught in a 
8:252:20429:16:14:50:352:204:97:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:high-poverty school and the position of the teacher on the salary schedule.  
8:253:20504:14:18:50:549:190:63:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:6 This is the average rate of teacher attrition from 2009-10 to 2011-12. We examine outcomes from 2010-11 to 2012-13 as a 
8:254:20626:18:13:50:301:172:97:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:function of teacher turnover at the end of 2009-10 to 2011-12. 
8:255:20688:13:18:50:538:159:63:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:7 Prior to 2012-13, schools were identified as high-poverty if more than 60 percent of students were eligible for FRPL. In 
8:256:20811:18:11:50:557:141:97:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:2012-13, the threshold was revised down to 50 percent, causing more schools to be identified as high-poverty. Two schools in 
8:257:20936:11:12:50:561:130:97:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:our sample are identified as high-poverty schools for the first time in 2012-13. However, this change does not affect our results 
8:258:21066:12:11:50:548:118:97:g_d0_f11:97:g_d0_f11:because we examine turnover at the end of the prior year. As such, these two schools are essentially considered low-poverty 
8:259:21190:11:0:50:220:107:97:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:schools throughout the period of analysis. 
9:260:21234:0:21:50:556:716:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:attrition in many districts, (e.g., demanding working conditions or unsupportive leadership). However, in 
9:261:21340:21:20:50:506:695:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:DCPS some high-performing teachers may leave because they find some features of IMPACT 
9:262:21427:20:21:50:558:675:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:demotivating or stressful. If this response is sufficiently large, IMPACT could reduce teacher quality and 
9:263:21534:21:21:50:550:654:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:student achievement. However, IMPACT also leads to the dismissal of ineffective teachers and induces 
9:264:21635:21:21:50:541:633:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:other low-performing teachers to exit voluntarily (Dee & Wyckoff, 2015). The annual attrition rate of 
9:265:21737:21:20:50:548:612:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:low-performing teachers is 46 percent. This implies that low-performing teachers were more than three 
9:266:21839:20:21:50:548:592:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:times as likely to leave as high-performing teachers (Figure 2) and accounted for 36 percent of all exits 
9:267:21945:21:21:50:164:571:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:from DCPS (Figure 3). 
9:268:21967:21:20:86:542:550:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:This descriptive summary of retention highlights the challenges confronting DCPS to improve 
9:269:22059:20:21:50:562:530:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:student achievement by improving the composition of its teacher workforce. Losing 13 percent of the best 
9:270:22164:21:21:50:560:509:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:teachers each year places strong demands on teacher recruitment to prevent a reduction in achievement in 
9:271:22269:21:21:50:561:488:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:those classrooms. However, exiting 46 percent of low-performing teachers creates substantial opportunity 
9:272:22374:21:20:50:558:467:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:to improve achievement in the classrooms of low-performing teachers. In the remainder of this paper, we 
9:273:22478:20:21:50:541:447:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:explore how teacher turnover in DCPS under IMPACT affects student achievement. We examine this 
9:274:22573:21:21:50:562:426:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:question in the aggregate and separately for low- and high-performing teachers. We also consider whether 
9:275:22678:21:32:50:551:405:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement varies across schools and over time.

9:277:22833:27:21:86:537:346:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:To examine the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement, we employ a panel-based 
9:278:22924:21:21:50:557:325:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:research design that effectively compares how outcomes in school-grade cells changed following the exit 
9:279:23028:21:20:50:525:304:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:of a teacher to the contemporaneous change in school-grade cells where no turnover occurred. We 
9:280:23124:20:21:50:564:284:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:particularly want to understand whether teacher effectiveness and student achievement are higher or lower 
9:281:23230:21:20:50:540:263:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:as a result of exiting teachers. Changes in overall teacher effectiveness depend upon the magnitude of 
9:282:23333:20:21:50:564:243:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:mean difference in effectiveness between entering and exiting teachers and the proportion of teachers who 
9:283:23439:21:21:50:547:222:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:turnover. Changes in student achievement depend on these differences and on the relationship between 
9:284:23540:21:21:50:507:201:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:measured teacher effectiveness and student achievement. Our empirical model attends to these 
9:285:23633:21:26:50:120:180:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:relationships.  
9:286:23649:26:21:86:547:154:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f14:To illustrate how our research design utilizes student- and teacher-level data, we begin with the

10:289:23960:0:23:50:556:715:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:student’s observables, including prior achievement, (Xisgjct), and the attributes of classroom peers, !!"#$%, 
10:290:24070:23:22:50:546:692:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:the teacher’s value-added (μjsgt), a school fixed effect (!!), a year fixed effect (τt), and an idiosyncratic 
10:291:24180:22:21:50:520:670:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:error term (εisgjct) that captures random noise that may occur at the individual and higher levels of 
10:292:24282:21:27:50:266:649:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:aggregation (e.g., school, grade, classroom):

10:295:24492:21:23:50:528:567:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:replace the dependent variable in equation (1) with the student-level residuals (!!"#$%&∗) obtained by

10:304:25215:29:21:86:558:334:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:That is, equation (3) models the change in student achievement (i.e., conditional on student traits) 
10:305:25316:21:21:50:534:313:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:as a teacher-level function of the change in classroom peers, the change in teacher quality, and other 
10:306:25419:21:20:50:536:292:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:unobserved time-varying changes. However, conducting the analysis at the teacher level would have 
10:307:25517:20:21:50:561:272:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:several prohibitive limitations. For example, if the attrition of a teacher has negative consequences for the 
10:308:25627:21:21:50:550:251:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:productivity of her grade-level colleagues (Ronfeldt et al. 2013), this specification would not capture it. 
10:309:25735:21:21:50:562:230:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:Furthermore, a teacher-level specification may exacerbate the bias due to internal-validity threats (Chetty, 
10:310:25844:21:20:50:547:209:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:Friedman, and Rockoff, 2014). For example, in the presence of teacher turnover, some more motivated 
10:311:25944:20:21:50:548:189:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:parents may seek to have their children placed in the classrooms of returning teachers, leaving entering 
10:312:26049:21:21:50:524:168:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:teachers with lower-performing students (i.e., net of observed traits).  Such non-random sorting of 
10:313:26149:21:20:50:545:147:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:students to teachers is much less likely at the school-by-grade level, because the sorting would need to 
10:314:26254:20:21:50:541:127:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:occur across schools to affect school-grade outcomes. Furthermore, observations at the annual school-
10:315:26355:21:0:50:556:106:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f19:grade level capture spillover effects that may exist among members of a school-grade team. Aggregating 
11:316:26460:0:21:50:550:716:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:to the grade level also avoids the need to match each exiting teacher with the teacher replacing her. The

11:319:26691:29:20:86:525:639:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:Our analysis aims to understand how student achievement changes as a function of teacher 
11:320:26780:20:21:50:535:619:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:turnover, rather than as a function of changes in teacher value-added in equation (4). That is, teacher 
11:321:26884:21:21:50:564:598:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:turnover may change teacher quality (e.g., Δμsgt), which in turn changes student achievement. We estimate

11:326:27313:28:21:86:543:480:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:The identification strategy implied by this research design has a straightforward "difference-in-
11:327:27410:21:20:50:553:459:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:differences" logic.8 That is, we effectively examine the change in student performance in a school-grade 
11:328:27515:20:21:50:549:439:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:cell before and after teacher turnover has occurred. These student-performance changes reflect both the 
11:329:27619:21:20:50:543:418:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:effect of teacher turnover and the effect of other time-varying determinants. A second difference—the 
11:330:27721:20:21:50:549:398:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:contemporaneous performance change in school-grade cells that did not experience turnover—captures 
11:331:27820:21:21:50:555:377:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:the effects of those other time-varying determinants. The difference in these differences then isolates the 
11:332:27928:21:21:50:555:356:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:effect of teacher turnover. Ideally, we would complement this analysis with similar results for the period 
11:333:28035:21:20:50:563:335:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:that preceded the introduction of IMPACT. However, reliable data for teachers linked to students does not 
11:334:28141:20:27:50:160:315:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:exist prior to 2009-10. 
11:335:28165:27:21:86:558:288:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:Our quasi-experimental specification unrestrictively controls for several unobserved determinants 
11:336:28263:21:20:50:532:267:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:of student achievement. More specifically, this specification identifies the effect of teacher turnover 
11:337:28367:20:21:50:561:247:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:controlling for time-invariant traits specific to each school-grade cell, time-varying traits shared across all 
11:338:28479:21:21:50:546:226:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:schools and grades, and various student-level traits including prior achievement. However, the internal 
11:339:28583:21:21:50:533:205:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:validity of the inferences based on this basic model still rests on several critical assumptions that we 
11:340:28688:21:20:50:556:184:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:engage directly. First, our design implicitly assumes that students don’t sort to (or from) turnover classes 
11:341:28797:20:25:50:522:164:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:by switching schools in a way that biases the results. Second, as currently specified, our approach 
11:342:28897:25:8:194:197:139:144:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:                                                
11:343:28944:8:29:50:516:131:63:g_d0_f52:144:g_d0_f52:8 Also, all estimates cluster standard errors at the school-grade level to account for repeated observations over time. 
11:344:29062:29:0:50:52:102:97:g_d0_f52:97:g_d0_f52: 
12:345:29065:0:21:50:522:716:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:implicitly assumes that, when filling vacancies due to turnovers, schools don’t manipulate teacher 
12:346:29164:21:20:50:563:695:144:g_d0_f59:144:g_d0_f58:transfers within DCPS in a manner that biases turnover results. For example, when an exit occurs within a 
12:347:29270:20:21:50:554:675:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:school, principals don’t systematically move the most or least effective teachers from other grades to fill 
12:348:29378:21:21:50:537:654:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:that vacancy. Although there are slight variations across years and subjects, on average 55 percent of 
12:349:29481:21:21:50:556:633:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:replacement teachers come from outside the DCPS system, 34 percent transfer within DCPS schools and 
12:350:29581:21:20:50:559:612:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:11 percent transfer across DCPS schools. Our specification also assumes that these teacher transfers have 
12:351:29687:20:21:50:560:592:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:no achievement implications for the “sending” school-grade cell (e.g., due to disruption of teacher peers). 
12:352:29795:21:21:50:561:571:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:Third, our design assumes that there are not important unobserved factors changing at the school or grade-
12:353:29901:21:20:50:536:550:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:level that influence student achievement and that are also correlated with turnover (e.g., increasingly 
12:354:30005:20:27:50:155:530:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:effective principals).  
12:355:30029:27:21:86:550:503:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:To address the robustness of our results in the presence of these potential confounds, we modify 
12:356:30126:21:21:50:529:482:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:our basic estimation approach and conduct several robustness tests. First, we add several additional 
12:357:30227:21:20:50:555:461:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:controls to our empirical models to address potential challenges to internal validity. To address concerns 
12:358:30334:20:21:50:553:441:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:that within-school or across-school transfers may influence our results, we also introduce direct controls 
12:359:30441:21:21:50:559:420:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:for these transfers.  To assess the relevance of unobserved school trends that are correlated with turnover, 
12:360:30550:21:20:50:527:399:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:we also employ specifications that include school fixed effects. Time-invariant school effects have 
12:361:30650:20:21:50:527:379:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:already been eliminated from our design as a result of first-differencing school-grade observations. 
12:362:30751:21:21:50:532:358:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:Adding a school fixed effect to our first-difference specification implies that we are also controlling 
12:363:30855:21:21:50:558:337:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:flexibly for school-specific changes over time (e.g., school trends in culture and leadership).9 Second, we 
12:364:30963:21:20:50:564:316:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:also estimate auxiliary regressions to examine whether our treatment explains changes in observed student 
12:365:31069:20:21:50:518:296:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:attributes. To the extent that teacher turnover predicts changes in students traits, it would suggest 
12:366:31171:21:26:50:433:275:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:endogenous switching based on unobserved correlates of these observed traits.  
12:367:31250:26:21:86:558:249:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:Third, we estimate the effects of teacher turnover on teacher quality directly. If, as our conceptual 
12:368:31352:21:21:50:563:228:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:model suggests, teacher quality is the mechanism through which turnover influences student achievement, 
12:369:31456:21:21:50:525:207:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:we should observe consistent results for the effects of turnover on both teacher quality and student 
12:370:31557:21:20:50:532:186:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:achievement. To provide increased assurance that any student achievement changes associated with 
12:371:31654:20:41:50:551:166:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:teacher turnover reflect its effects on teacher quality, we estimate some specifications where we employ 
12:372:31759:41:7:194:197:125:144:g_d0_f58:144:g_d0_f58:                                                
12:373:31806:7:16:50:541:118:42:g_d0_f58:97:g_d0_f58:9 Controlling for school fixed effects in our first-differenced specification has some disadvantages. These include a loss of 
12:374:31932:16:0:50:538:102:97:g_d0_f58:97:g_d0_f58:statistical precision and a reliance on the variation within schools that have more turnover during our brief sample period. 
13:375:32059:0:21:50:540:716:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:IMPACT scores as the dependent variable.10,11 As will be seen in Tables 3-5, in every instance where 
13:376:32160:21:20:50:552:695:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:turnover is estimated to positively or negatively affect achievement, we observe an effect of turnover on 
13:377:32266:20:21:50:550:675:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:observed teacher quality that is of the same sign and usually of proportionate magnitude. This increases 
13:378:32371:21:21:50:553:654:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:our confidence that the change in teacher quality is the primary factor determining the effect of turnover 
13:379:32478:21:27:50:529:633:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:on student achievement, and not other factors that could plausibly be associated with teacher exits.  
13:380:32579:27:20:86:561:606:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f61:We create three treatment variables to examine different types of teacher turnover. As before Esgt-1 
13:381:32679:20:21:50:563:586:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:is the proportion of students in a school-grade-year cell in the prior year whose teacher left the district and 
13:382:32791:21:22:50:558:565:144:g_d0_f60:63:g_d0_f61:is used in specifications in which we examine the overall effects of turnover. In other specifications, ELsgt-
13:383:32900:22:19:50:515:543:63:g_d0_f61:144:g_d0_f60:1 denotes the proportion of students in each such cell whose teacher exited DCPS and was a low-
13:384:32994:19:21:50:563:524:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:performing (i.e., Minimally Effective or Ineffective) teacher, and EHsgt-1 denotes the proportion of students 
13:385:33104:21:21:50:561:503:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:taught by a high-performing (Effective or Highly Effective) teacher who left the district at the end of year 
13:386:33213:21:23:50:553:482:144:g_d0_f61:144:g_d0_f60:t-1. In all specifications, we condition on the prevalence of within-school transfers, !!"#!!, and transfers 
13:387:33322:23:22:50:563:459:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:across schools in the district, !!"#!!. These controls allow us to condition on the effects that turnover may 
13:388:33432:22:21:50:552:437:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:have on school-grade cells that “send” teachers elsewhere within the district. The resulting specification 
13:389:33539:21:27:50:181:416:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:takes the following form:   
13:390:33567:27:29:86:540:389:144:g_d0_f41:144:g_d0_f60:∆!!"#∗= !!!!"#!!!+!!!!"#!!!+!!!"#!!+!!!"#!!+∆!!"#!!+ !!+!!+!!"#∗ (6a) 
13:391:33634:29:28:89:541:360:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60: ∆!"!"#= !!!!!"#!!!+!!!!!"#!!!+!!!!"#!!+!!!!"#!!+ !′!+!′!+!!"#!  (6b) 
13:392:33699:28:21:50:539:332:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:Finally, we examine whether the effect of teacher turnover varies by year or school characteristics by 
13:393:33802:21:21:50:545:311:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:interacting each treatment variable with the appropriate year or school-characteristic indicator variable 
13:394:33908:21:21:50:560:290:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:(not shown). For instance, we assess whether the effect of teacher turnover differs between high- and low-
13:395:34014:21:20:50:132:269:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:poverty schools. 
13:396:34031:20:60:50:53:249:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60: 
13:397:34031:60:8:194:197:189:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:                                                
13:398:34078:8:16:50:538:181:42:g_d0_f60:97:g_d0_f60:10 Dividing γ1 from Equation 6a by δ1 from Equation 6b approximates the Wald estimator, which represents the change in 
13:399:34197:16:13:50:402:165:97:g_d0_f60:97:g_d0_f60:student achievement due to changes in teacher quality that result from teacher turnover. 
13:400:34285:13:16:50:545:152:42:g_d0_f60:97:g_d0_f60:11 There is a debate whether to control for student attributes when examining measures of teacher quality (see, for example, 
13:401:34410:16:11:50:547:136:97:g_d0_f60:97:g_d0_f60:Whitehurst et al., 2014). For teachers in tested grades IMPACT already controls for student characteristics when estimating 
13:402:34534:11:12:50:529:125:97:g_d0_f60:97:g_d0_f60:value added. For other components of IMPACT the logic of student controls is much less obvious. As a result, we omit 
13:403:34650:12:11:50:518:113:97:g_d0_f60:97:g_d0_f60:controls for observable student attributes in equation 6b. This contrasts with our approach to the estimates of student 
13:404:34770:11:0:50:452:102:97:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:achievement, where there is strong evidence and a long history of controlling for student attributes.  
14:405:34875:0:27:50:326:716:144:g_d0_f73:144:g_d0_f73:DCPS Administrative Data and Sample Construction 
14:406:34924:27:20:86:542:689:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:Our analysis draws on several sources of student, teacher, and school administrative data from 
14:407:35019:20:21:50:508:669:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:DCPS. Students’ test scores, demographic variables, and teacher assignments come from DC’s 
14:408:35110:21:21:50:541:648:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:Comprehensive Assessment System (DC CAS). These data span the 2009-10 through 2012-13 school 
14:409:35203:21:21:50:559:627:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:years and include just over 56,564 student-years for tested students in grades 4 through 8 with a prior test 
14:410:35312:21:20:50:547:606:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:scores. Teacher administrative data include annual school assignments and annual IMPACT evaluation 
14:411:35410:20:21:50:547:586:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:data. These data also span the 2009-10 through 2012-13 school years and include almost 1,900 teacher-
14:412:35511:21:21:50:562:565:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:years for teachers of students with DC CAS achievement data. Finally, school administrative data identify 
14:413:35617:21:26:50:278:544:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:school type, poverty status, and closure status.  
14:414:35667:26:21:86:563:518:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:To construct our final analytical sample, we edited the data on the students and teachers in several, 
14:415:35769:21:21:50:540:497:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:conventional ways. First, we restricted our sample to general education classrooms, which resulted in 
14:416:35871:21:21:50:553:476:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:dropping 12 special education campuses leaving 103 schools serving students tested in grades 4 through 
14:417:35974:21:20:50:533:455:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:8. We then excluded students when they were tested in a grade other than their assigned grade (0.22 
14:418:36074:20:21:50:561:435:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:percent of student-year observations) or when they lacked a prior-year score (1.97 percent of student-year 
14:419:36181:21:21:50:555:414:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:observations). To limit measurement error, we linked teachers to school-grade-year cells if the teacher is 
14:420:36288:21:20:50:535:393:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:assigned to at least ten tested students in that cell. This restriction eliminated 0.62 percent of teacher-
14:421:36395:20:21:50:553:373:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:school-grade-year observations. We also excluded teacher-year observations when those teachers taught 
14:422:36497:21:21:50:532:352:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:in a school that closed at the end of that school year. This restriction also eliminated 0.62 percent of 
14:423:36602:21:27:50:248:331:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:teacher-school-grade-year observations.  
14:424:36643:27:20:86:505:304:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:The primary outcome of interest is the year-to-year change in average residualized and 
14:425:36730:20:21:50:540:284:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:standardized student achievement at the school-grade-year level.12 To construct this measure, we first 
14:426:36833:21:20:50:553:263:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:standardize students’ scale scores to have mean zero and unit standard deviation within a subject, grade, 
14:427:36939:20:21:50:557:243:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:and year. Next, we recover the residuals from a student-level linear regression of standardized test scores 
14:428:37047:21:21:50:545:222:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:on lagged standardized test scores and student demographics. Then using the average residuals in each 
14:429:37149:21:21:50:526:201:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:school-grade-year cell, we subtract prior year outcomes from current year outcomes. This measure 
14:430:37246:21:20:50:538:180:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:isolates how test performance in each school-grade cell changed across years after controlling for the 
14:431:37349:20:33:50:560:160:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:prior achievement and outcome-relevant baseline traits of the students it served. We similarly constructed 
14:432:37456:33:8:194:197:127:144:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:                                                
14:433:37503:8:17:50:548:119:63:g_d0_f72:97:g_d0_f72:12 See the Technical Appendix for an extended discussion of the sample and variable construction. We create separate math 
14:434:37625:17:0:50:505:102:97:g_d0_f72:144:g_d0_f72:and reading samples because teachers are linked to different students and school-grade-year cells in each subject. 
15:435:37742:0:21:50:560:716:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:first-differenced measures for the IMPACT scores of teachers in each school-grade-year cell. Because we 
15:436:37846:21:20:50:543:695:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:have achievement data and IMPACT scores for four years (2009-10 to 2012-13), we are able to create 
15:437:37945:20:21:50:536:675:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:three years of these differenced outcomes. Aggregating these observations to school-grade-year cells 
15:438:38046:21:21:50:559:654:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:produces the unrestricted sample, whose descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2 columns 1 (math) and 
15:439:38151:21:27:50:109:633:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:5 (reading). 
15:440:38164:27:20:86:530:606:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:A final set of sample restrictions reflects concerns regarding missing data. First, differenced 
15:441:38260:20:21:50:516:586:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:outcomes can only be created when the school-grade cell contains the outcome of interest in two 
15:442:38356:21:21:50:563:565:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:consecutive years. This results in missing observations when schools open or close during the years of our 
15:443:38463:21:20:50:554:544:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:analysis. This restriction produces school-grade-year cells with missing outcome data, which results in a 
15:444:38569:20:21:50:530:524:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:loss of 87 school grade cells in math (838 observations in the unrestricted sample to 751 in the base 
15:445:38671:21:21:50:537:503:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:sample) and 85 in reading (838 to 753).  Second, some school-grade-year cells are missing IMPACT 
15:446:38768:21:21:50:557:482:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:scores, which results in different estimation samples for changes in IMPACT scores (equation 6b) versus 
15:447:38872:21:20:50:556:461:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:changes in student achievement (equation 6a). Because we want to observe the effect of teacher turnover 
15:448:38976:20:21:50:541:441:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:on teacher quality and student achievement in the same school-grade-year cells, we drop cells that are 
15:449:39079:21:21:50:542:420:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:missing differenced IMPACT scores. This results in the loss of 17 school-grade-year cells in the math 
15:450:39181:21:20:50:558:399:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:sample and 20 school-grade-year cells in the reading sample. The remaining sample is unbalanced in that 
15:451:39285:20:27:50:303:379:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:each school-grade cell is not observed in each year.  
15:452:39339:27:21:86:549:352:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:Third, we eliminate school-grade cells with fewer than three years of differenced outcomes. We 
15:453:39434:21:21:50:557:331:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:are concerned that unbalanced observations introduce structural changes that influence estimates in ways 
15:454:39539:21:20:50:544:310:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:that don’t reflect responses to typical teacher exits. For example, school-grade-cells may exist in some 
15:455:39644:20:21:50:529:290:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:years but not others because schools close during the time frame of our analysis. In such situations, 
15:456:39746:21:20:50:551:269:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:within-school, time-varying factors which we don’t observe, may influence student achievement and be 
15:457:39847:20:21:50:557:249:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:correlated with teacher turnover, biasing our estimates. This restriction results in the loss of an additional 
15:458:39958:21:21:50:561:228:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:71 school-grade-year cells from the math sample and 67 school-grade-year cells from the reading sample, 
15:459:40062:21:27:50:213:207:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:and creates the balanced sample.  
15:460:40096:27:20:86:549:180:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:Table 2 summarizes average student and teacher characteristics observed in each of the analytic 
15:461:40192:20:21:50:543:160:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:samples. As might be expected these sample restrictions influence the nature of our sample. Appendix 
15:462:40293:21:21:50:563:139:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:Table 1 statistically compares the differences in the means of the school-grade-year cells that were deleted 
15:463:40402:21:0:50:554:118:144:g_d0_f74:144:g_d0_f74:in moving from the unrestricted to the balanced samples. As might be expected, relative to cells retained 
16:464:40511:0:21:50:545:716:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:in the balanced sample, the dropped cells have lower residualized achievement and a somewhat higher 
16:465:40611:21:20:50:560:695:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:percentage of black students, a lower percentage of Hispanic students and a higher percentage of students 
16:466:40717:20:21:50:524:675:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:attending high-poverty schools. Cells dropped to create the balanced math sample also have lower 
16:467:40814:21:21:50:527:654:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:average IMPACT scores and a higher incidence of teacher turnover. We estimate our basic student 
16:468:40910:21:21:50:545:633:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:achievement model (equation 6a) with and without these observations to explore how these exclusions 
16:469:41010:21:20:50:521:612:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:affect our estimates. As is evident by comparing the estimates in Appendix Tables 2 (math) and 3 
16:470:41107:20:21:50:555:592:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:(reading), these estimates are similar. In general, these estimates show that, as we restrict the sample, the 
16:471:41217:21:21:50:548:571:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:estimates of the effect of turnover of low-performing teachers become somewhat more positive and the 
16:472:41318:21:20:50:521:550:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:effect of exits of high-performing teachers becomes slightly less negative.  Results of models that 
16:473:41418:20:21:50:552:530:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:distinguish between high and low-poverty schools and by year show very similar patterns. These results 
16:474:41521:21:21:50:202:509:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:are available from the authors.  
16:475:41553:21:21:86:553:488:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:The “treatment” variable in our setting is defined by the proportion of students in a school-grade-
16:476:41652:21:20:50:561:467:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:year cell experiencing different types of teacher turnover.13 Teacher-school assignment rosters and rosters 
16:477:41760:20:21:50:520:447:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:that link teachers to students allow us to identify teacher exits as well as within and across school 
16:478:41862:21:21:50:558:426:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:transfers. IMPACT ratings distinguish turnover among high-performing teachers (those rated “Effective” 
16:479:41965:21:20:50:525:405:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:or “Highly Effective”) from turnover among low-performing teachers (those rated “Ineffective” or 
16:480:42062:20:21:50:564:385:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:“Minimally Effective”). Turnover dosages are calculated by employing teacher-student assignment rosters 
16:481:42166:21:27:50:562:364:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:to identify the proportion of students in school-grade-year cells affected by each type of teacher turnover.  
16:482:42275:27:27:50:90:337:144:g_d0_f76:144:g_d0_f76:Results 
16:483:42283:27:20:86:542:310:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:Our conceptual model suggests the induced turnover of low-performing teachers (i.e., teachers 
16:484:42377:20:21:50:552:290:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:rated by IMPACT as “Ineffective” or “Minimally Effective”) should result in improvements in teaching 
16:485:42478:21:20:50:516:269:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:quality and student achievement, while the turnover of high-performing (“Highly Effective” and 
16:486:42573:20:21:50:560:249:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:“Effective”) teachers may well result in a reduction in teacher quality and student achievement depending 
16:487:42679:21:21:50:535:228:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:on the quality of entering teachers. The overall effect, which balances these two types of turnover, is 
16:488:42783:21:21:50:549:207:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:conceptually ambiguous and depends on the composition of exiting teachers and the quality of entering 
16:489:42885:21:32:50:98:186:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:teachers.  
16:490:42896:32:7:194:197:154:144:g_d0_f75:144:g_d0_f75:                                                
16:491:42943:7:16:50:543:147:42:g_d0_f75:97:g_d0_f75:13 Teachers on leave of absence were not considered exits in our analysis and thus are not considered in construction of the 
16:492:43068:16:12:50:546:131:97:g_d0_f75:97:g_d0_f75:treatment variable. Also, students in school-grade cells for whom there is insufficient information to include in our analytic 
16:493:43195:12:11:50:562:119:97:g_d0_f75:97:g_d0_f75:sample were included in the calculation of the treatment variable. We do so to minimize potential bias associated with selective 
16:494:43324:11:0:50:117:108:97:g_d0_f75:97:g_d0_f75:sample attrition. 
17:495:43344:0:27:86:193:716:144:g_d0_f78:144:g_d0_f78:Descriptive Summary 
17:496:43364:27:20:86:557:689:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:Before turning to our estimates, it may be instructive to examine simple averages of the IMPACT 
17:497:43460:20:21:50:510:669:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:scores of exiting and entering teachers. If our estimates, which control for a variety of potential 
17:498:43560:21:21:50:514:648:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:confounds, are wildly different from these simple means, we would want to understand how our 
17:499:43653:21:21:50:546:627:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:adjustments influence the outcomes. Figure 4 shows the unconditional means of IMPACT scores of all 
17:500:43752:21:20:50:561:606:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:exiting and entering general education teachers (i.e., teachers of all subjects in tested and untested grades) 
17:501:43863:20:21:50:537:586:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:in DCPS.14 As might be expected, mean IMPACT scores of exiting high-performing teachers exceed 
17:502:43958:21:21:50:545:565:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:those of entering teachers by 12 to 23 IMPACT points (i.e., 25 to 45 percent of a standard deviation of 
17:503:44062:21:20:50:531:544:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:teacher effectiveness (IMPACT scores)) depending on the year. In contrast, exiting low-performing 
17:504:44160:20:21:50:563:524:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:teachers are substantially less effective than the average entering teacher, with differences between 71 and 
17:505:44269:21:21:50:537:503:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:85 IMPACT points (i.e., 1.4 and 1.7 standard deviations). Across all teachers, entering teachers have 
17:506:44371:21:21:50:561:482:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:IMPACT scores between and third and a half of a standard deviation greater than exiting teachers. A very 
17:507:44476:21:20:50:557:461:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:similar pattern exists when the sample is restricted to teachers who can be matched to students with math 
17:508:44582:20:21:50:555:441:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:achievement scores (Figure 5). Here the difference between entering and exiting teachers varies by 35 to 
17:509:44687:21:21:50:562:420:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:55 percent of a standard deviation of teacher effectiveness depending on the year. The pattern for teachers 
17:510:44795:21:20:50:531:399:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:matched to students with reading scores is identical with somewhat smaller differences between the 
17:511:44894:20:21:50:551:379:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:IMPACT scores of entering and exiting teachers (i.e., 0.25 to 0.50 standard deviations; results available 
17:512:45000:21:21:50:545:358:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:from authors). Importantly for the purposes of our analysis, the differences in Individual Value-Added 
17:513:45103:21:21:50:530:337:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:(IVA) scores for entering and exiting teachers are very similar to those observed for teacher quality 
17:514:45205:21:20:50:539:316:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:(Figure 6). The patterns for the exits of high-performing and low-performing teachers are identical to 
17:515:45308:20:27:50:232:296:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:those observed for IMPACT scores.   
17:516:45344:27:20:86:546:269:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:Comparing the IMPACT scores of entering and exiting teachers suggests that teacher quality is 
17:517:45438:20:21:50:528:249:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:improving as a result of teacher turnover. This is true whether teacher effectiveness is measured by 
17:518:45539:21:21:50:511:228:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:overall IMPACT scores or by value-added. However, when teachers who are judged to be high-
17:519:45629:21:21:50:549:207:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:performing voluntarily exit, they are replaced on average by somewhat less effective teachers. Contrast 
17:520:45733:21:27:50:561:186:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:that with the exit of teachers who are either forced to leave as a result of IMPACT or whose performance, 
17:521:45839:27:7:194:197:159:144:g_d0_f77:144:g_d0_f77:                                                
17:522:45886:7:16:50:552:152:42:g_d0_f77:97:g_d0_f77:14 Our data do not allow us to identify which teachers may fill the specific vacancy left by an exiting teacher. Thus, while we 
17:523:46014:16:11:50:559:136:97:g_d0_f77:97:g_d0_f77:know the IMPACT rating of an exiting teacher, e.g., Ineffective or Minimally Effective, we don’t know the IMPACT rating of 
17:524:46137:11:12:50:524:125:97:g_d0_f77:97:g_d0_f77:the teacher who replaced that teacher. Thus, IMPACT scores for entering teachers reflect all entering teachers and not 
17:525:46256:12:11:50:559:113:97:g_d0_f77:97:g_d0_f77:necessary those who replaced an exiting high-performing or low-performing teachers. In the “High-Performing” and the “Low-
17:526:46378:11:0:50:345:102:97:g_d0_f77:97:g_d0_f77:Performing” panels we employ the overall average for entering teachers.  
18:527:46453:0:21:50:544:716:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:if not improved, would lead to a forced exit. Turnover in this instance appears to result in a substantial 
18:528:46560:21:20:50:540:695:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:improvement in measured effectiveness. As discussed above, there are a variety of reasons why these 
18:529:46660:20:21:50:516:675:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:simple comparisons may misrepresent the effects of teacher turnover in DCPS. For example, the 
18:530:46754:21:21:50:525:654:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:composition of students may have changed from one year to the next in a way that either favors or 
18:531:46852:21:21:50:554:633:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:disadvantages teachers entering a school-grade cell which experienced teacher turnover. We now turn to 
18:532:46955:21:26:50:539:612:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:the estimation of equations 6a and 6b, which control for a number of potentially confounding factors. 
18:533:47056:26:27:86:236:586:144:g_d0_f80:144:g_d0_f79:Quasi-Experimental Estimates 
18:534:47084:27:21:86:561:559:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:We report our main results (i.e., estimates based on equations 6a and 6b) in Table 3. The results in 
18:535:47185:21:20:50:550:538:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:the first row identify the estimated effect of overall teacher turnover. Interestingly, these results suggest 
18:536:47295:20:21:50:557:518:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:that the exit of DCPS teachers led to improved teacher quality and student achievement in both math and 
18:537:47399:21:21:50:535:497:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:reading, although the reading estimate is not significant at traditional levels. More specifically, these 
18:538:47505:21:21:50:563:476:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:results imply that, if all students in a school-grade cell experienced turnover of the average exiting teacher 
18:539:47616:21:20:50:555:455:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:IMPACT scores would increase by 17.4 points (Table 3, row 1, column 1). This is approximately a third 
18:540:47718:20:21:50:539:435:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:of a standard deviation (SD) of teacher effectiveness (SD=50). The corresponding increase in student 
18:541:47819:21:21:50:553:414:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:achievement is 0.079 SD. In reading, IMPACT scores are estimated to increase by 15.1 IMPACT points 
18:542:47918:21:20:50:542:393:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:and student achievement is estimated to increase by 0.046 SD, but is only significant at the 0.10 level. 
18:543:48023:20:21:50:523:373:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:Thus, on average exiting teachers are replaced by teachers who are more effective as measured by 
18:544:48120:21:27:50:368:352:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:IMPACT and who increase student achievement, at least in math. 
18:545:48182:27:21:86:540:325:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:In remaining rows of Table 3, we report the estimates when the effects of teacher turnover are 
18:546:48277:21:20:50:524:304:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:allowed to differ across teacher effectiveness groups (i.e., high and low performers). These results 
18:547:48378:20:21:50:545:284:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:indicate that the overall effects of teacher turnover masked considerable heterogeneity across low- and 
18:548:48482:21:20:50:563:263:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:high-performing teachers. Turnover of high-performing teachers results in a decrease in average IMPACT 
18:549:48585:20:21:50:527:243:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:scores of 30 points (i.e., 0.60 SD of teacher effectiveness) in math. This negative effect reflects the 
18:550:48689:21:21:50:511:222:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:difficulty of replacing a high-performing teacher. Our estimates indicate that turnover of a high-
18:551:48787:21:21:50:539:201:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:performing teacher has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on student achievement (-0.055 
18:552:48891:21:26:50:297:180:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:SD). Similar, but smaller, results hold for reading.  
18:553:48945:26:21:86:551:154:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:In contrast, the exit of low-performing teachers substantially increases both teaching quality and 
18:554:49044:21:21:50:529:133:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:student achievement. In math, the exit of low-performing teachers is estimated to improve teaching 
18:555:49143:21:0:50:549:112:144:g_d0_f79:144:g_d0_f79:quality by 64 IMPACT points (1.3 SD) and student achievement by 0.21 SD. The effects in reading are 
19:556:49246:0:21:50:552:716:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:somewhat smaller but still large, 46 IMPACT points and 0.14 SD of student achievement. Over the first 
19:557:49348:21:20:50:557:695:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:three years of IMPACT, replacing teachers identified by IMPACT as low-performers leads to substantial 
19:558:49450:20:21:50:554:675:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:improvement in student achievement as, on average, their replacements are meaningfully more effective 
19:559:49552:21:27:50:98:654:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:teachers.

19:561:49585:27:20:86:544:600:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81: The consistency of the effects of turnover on teacher quality and student achievement and their 
19:562:49681:20:21:50:517:580:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:robustness to introducing student controls increases our confidence in the internal validity of our 
19:563:49781:21:21:50:539:559:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:estimates. Nonetheless, legitimate concerns may remain that parents or principals may systematically 
19:564:49882:21:20:50:527:538:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:respond to teacher turnover by altering the assignment of students to teachers in ways that threaten 
19:565:49983:20:21:50:545:518:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:internal validity. For example, if turnover predicts changes in student attributes, it may signal strategic 
19:566:50091:21:21:50:554:497:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:behavior by parents or principals that may bias our results. Fortunately we find nothing of concern when 
19:567:50196:21:21:50:516:476:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:we regress a variety of student characteristics on teacher turnover (Appendix Table 4). Of the 18 
19:568:50294:21:20:50:536:455:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:estimated coefficients (six student attributes by three types of teachers (all, high-performing and low-
19:569:50398:20:21:50:564:435:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:performing), only one is significant at conventional levels. The exit of all high-performing teachers from a 
19:570:50507:21:21:50:541:414:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:school-grade cell is associated with a 2.4 percent decrease in LEP students. These results suggest that 
19:571:50611:21:20:50:538:393:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:there is not systematic sorting of students to teachers in response to turnover, and when there is some 
19:572:50715:20:21:50:547:373:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:evidence, the magnitudes are modest. Nonetheless, we include controls for all student variables we can 
19:573:50818:21:27:50:96:352:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:observe.  
19:574:50828:27:21:86:551:325:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:Another potential threat to the validity of our estimates may be that underlying trends in schools 
19:575:50927:21:20:50:527:304:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:may cause student achievement to increase over time in school-grade cells with turnover but not in 
19:576:51026:20:21:50:526:284:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:school-grade cells without turnover. To address this issue, we estimate first-difference models that 
19:577:51127:21:20:50:558:263:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:introduce school fixed effects and models include school-by-year fixed effects.  The identifying variation 
19:578:51234:20:21:50:555:243:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:for estimates with school fixed effects comes from within school comparisons of school-grade cells with 
19:579:51338:21:21:50:563:222:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:and without turnover. Adding a school-by-year fixed effect effectively limits our comparisons to grades in 
19:580:51445:21:21:50:560:201:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:the same school and year with and without turnover. Estimates for our base models and those with school 
19:581:51549:21:20:50:554:180:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:and school-by-year fixed effects are shown in Appendix Tables 5 (math) and 6 (reading). Adding school 
19:582:51651:20:21:50:535:160:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:fixed effects to our base model change the estimates only slightly. The one substantive change is the 
19:583:51753:21:21:50:553:139:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:effect of a typical teacher exit on math student achievement. The coefficient is somewhat smaller (0.058 
19:584:51858:21:0:50:543:118:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f81:SD rather than 0.79 SD), the standard error larger (0.038 rather than 0.030), the combination of which 
20:585:51964:0:21:50:554:716:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:results in a statistically insignificant estimate.  Adding school-by-year fixed effects has a larger effect on 
20:586:52075:21:20:50:560:695:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:some of the estimates. In math, while still significant and educationally meaningful, the effect of turnover 
20:587:52184:20:21:50:528:675:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:on the achievement of low-performers is about half as large as in either of the other two models. In 
20:588:52285:21:21:50:548:654:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:reading the change is not nearly so dramatic. Adding school-by-year fixed effects substantially reduces 
20:589:52389:21:21:50:554:633:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:the identifying variation in ways that have important implications for the identification of effects and for 
20:590:52498:21:20:50:564:612:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:external validity. For example, 663 school-grade-cells contribute to identifying the effects of our preferred 
20:591:52608:20:21:50:550:592:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:specification in math (Table 3). This is reduced to 534 school-grade cells when we include school fixed 
20:592:52712:21:27:50:372:571:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:effects and to only 317 if we include school-by-year fixed effects.  
20:593:52781:27:20:86:563:544:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:We include one additional robustness check in which we estimate the effects of a “placebo” model 
20:594:52878:20:21:50:553:524:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:where turnover at the end of 2012-13 is used to predict changes in student achievement from 2009-10 to 
20:595:52981:21:21:50:547:503:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:2010-11. If turnover is the mechanism that drives our results and not some other attribute of the school-
20:596:53086:21:21:50:556:482:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:grade cells that experience turnover, then the effects of the placebo estimates should not be similar to the 
20:597:53195:21:20:50:527:461:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:estimates presented in Table 3. They are not. As shown in Appendix Table 7 none of the estimated 
20:598:53292:20:27:50:335:441:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:coefficients in math or reading are statistically significant.  
20:599:53355:27:27:86:209:414:144:g_d0_f84:144:g_d0_f84:Treatment Heterogeneity 
20:600:53379:27:20:86:552:387:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:There are several other ways in which the effects of teacher turnover may be heterogeneous. For 
20:601:53475:20:21:50:536:367:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:example, the contexts across low and high-poverty schools are likely to shape both the prevalence of 
20:602:53576:21:21:50:557:346:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:teacher turnover and its effects on students. Overall, we find that high-poverty schools appear to improve 
20:603:53683:21:21:50:552:325:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:as a result of teacher turnover. We estimate that the overall effect of turnover on student achievement in 
20:604:53790:21:20:50:551:304:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:high-poverty schools is 0.084 and 0.052 in reading. Both estimates are statistically distinguishable from 
20:605:53896:20:21:50:559:284:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:zero (Table 4, row 2).  In comparison, the point estimates of the effect of turnover in low-poverty schools 
20:606:54004:21:26:50:137:263:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:are close to zero.  
20:607:54024:26:21:86:548:237:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83: DCPS appears to be quite capable of replacing exiting high-performing teachers in low-poverty 
20:608:54118:21:21:50:542:216:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:schools with comparable teachers (Table 4, row 3). However replacing a high-performing teacher in a 
20:609:54218:21:21:50:548:195:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:high-poverty school is more difficult and is estimated to result in a decrease of 80 percent of a standard 
20:610:54325:21:20:50:500:174:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:deviation of teacher quality in math and 40 percent of a standard deviation in reading, though 
20:611:54420:20:27:50:466:154:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:corresponding decreases in student achievement are not significant (Tables 4, row 4).  
20:612:54507:27:21:86:532:127:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:Forty percent of teacher turnover in high-poverty schools is among low-performing teachers 
20:613:54598:21:0:50:553:106:144:g_d0_f83:144:g_d0_f83:(Figure 3). Our estimates indicate that there are consistently large gains from the exit of low-performing 
21:614:54708:0:21:50:563:716:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:teachers in high-poverty schools. In math, teacher quality improves by 1.3 standard deviations and student 
21:615:54815:21:20:50:544:695:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:achievement by 20 percent of a standard deviation; in reading these figures are 1 standard deviation of 
21:616:54919:20:21:50:549:675:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:teacher quality and 14 percent of standard deviation of student achievement. In DCPS, virtually all low-
21:617:55023:21:21:50:556:654:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:performing teacher turnover is concentrated in high-poverty schools: on average, 1 percent of students in 
21:618:55129:21:27:50:377:633:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:low-poverty schools experience low-performing teacher turnover.15 
21:619:55194:27:20:86:560:606:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:When we examine the effects of DCPS turnovers over time, we observe substantial consistency as 
21:620:55289:20:21:50:562:586:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:well as a few interesting differences. Overall, the effects of DCPS turnover appear to become increasingly 
21:621:55396:21:21:50:543:565:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:positive year to year. However, student achievement is estimated to be unaffected until 2013 when for 
21:622:55498:21:20:50:558:544:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:math (Table 5, columns 1 and 2, first three rows) and reading (Table 5, columns 5 and 6, first three rows) 
21:623:55605:20:27:50:441:524:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:the estimated effect is an improvement of 11 percent SD of student achievement. 
21:624:55684:27:21:86:550:497:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:For most years, the exit of high-performing teachers doesn’t influence teacher quality or student 
21:625:55782:21:21:50:533:476:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:achievement. However, in one year for math (2012) and reading (2011), the exit of high-performing 
21:626:55880:21:20:50:547:455:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:teachers has a substantial negative effect on teaching quality and student achievement. These estimates 
21:627:55984:20:21:50:528:435:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:are similar across alternative analytic samples that employ the base and unbalanced data. When we 
21:628:56082:21:21:50:549:414:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:examine the individual exiting and entering teachers in the school-grade cells with teacher turnover, we 
21:629:56187:21:20:50:523:393:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:observe the exit of several very effective teachers who are replaced by teachers whose subsequent 
21:630:56285:20:27:50:311:373:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:performance places them among the low-performers.  
21:631:56336:27:21:86:563:346:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:In contrast, the exit of low-performing teachers yields consistently large improvements in teaching 
21:632:56436:21:21:50:556:325:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:quality and student achievement in math (0.18 to 0.24 SD of student achievement) and increasing effects 
21:633:56540:21:20:50:535:304:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:over time in reading (0.05 (not significant) to 0.21 SD of student achievement). In almost every year 
21:634:56642:20:21:50:545:284:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:DCPS has been able to replace low-performing teachers with high-performing teachers who have been 
21:635:56740:21:32:50:235:263:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:able to improve student achievement.  
21:636:56777:32:27:50:107:231:144:g_d0_f86:144:g_d0_f85:Discussion 
21:637:56787:27:21:86:562:204:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:In general, higher rates of teacher turnover are legitimately thought to negatively influence student 
21:638:56889:21:21:50:532:183:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:outcomes (e.g., Ronfeldt et al. 2013). However, DCPS constitutes a unique and policy-relevant case 
21:639:56988:21:23:50:557:162:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:because, under IMPACT, a substantial fraction of teacher turnover consists of lower-performing teachers 
21:640:57092:23:9:194:197:139:144:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:                                                
21:641:57139:9:17:50:548:130:63:g_d0_f85:97:g_d0_f85:15 More specifically, 3 low-poverty school-grade-year cells in the math sample experience low-performing teacher turnover 
21:642:57261:17:11:50:559:113:97:g_d0_f85:97:g_d0_f85:and only 1 low-poverty school-grade-year cell in the reading sample experiences low-performing teacher turnover. As a result, 
21:643:57387:11:0:50:425:102:97:g_d0_f85:144:g_d0_f85:we do not present estimates for turnover of low-performing teachers in low-poverty schools.  
22:644:57482:0:21:50:560:716:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:who were purposefully compelled or encouraged to leave, thus potentially altering the typical distribution 
22:645:57589:21:20:50:540:695:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:of teacher effectiveness among exiting teachers.  We find that the overall effect of teacher turnover in 
22:646:57694:20:21:50:523:675:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:DCPS conservatively had no effect on achievement and, under reasonable assumptions, improved 
22:647:57787:21:21:50:548:654:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:achievement. This average combines the negative, but statistically insignificant, effects of exits of high-
22:648:57894:21:21:50:556:633:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:performing teachers with the very large improvements in student achievement resulting from the exits of 
22:649:57998:21:26:50:180:612:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:low-performing teachers.   
22:650:58025:26:21:86:537:586:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:The high stakes associated with IMPACT have been controversial, both within the District of 
22:651:58117:21:21:50:553:565:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:Columbia, as well as in broader discussions of education policy. There are elements of both sides of this 
22:652:58223:21:20:50:531:544:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:debate in our estimates. While we are unable to identify high-performing teachers who leave DCPS 
22:653:58320:20:21:50:525:524:144:g_d0_f88:144:g_d0_f87:because of IMPACT, our estimates indicate that replacing high-performing teachers who exit with 
22:654:58416:21:21:50:513:503:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:teachers who perform similarly is difficult. In general, such turnover doesn’t lead to statistically 
22:655:58517:21:21:50:555:482:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:significant reductions in student performance, except in one notable instance (i.e., math teachers in 2011-
22:656:58624:21:26:50:72:461:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:12). 
22:657:58629:26:21:86:563:435:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:Alternatively, IMPACT targets the exit of low-performing teachers. Our estimates show that doing 
22:658:58726:21:21:50:513:414:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:so substantially improves teaching quality and student achievement in high-poverty schools. An 
22:659:58821:21:20:50:554:393:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:improvement of 20 percent of a standard deviation of student achievement in math is roughly equivalent 
22:660:58924:20:21:50:560:373:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:to 35 to 65 percent of a year of student learning, depending on grade level (Hill, Bloom, Black, & Lipsey, 
22:661:59031:21:21:50:535:352:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:2008). Similarly, improvements of 14 percent of a standard deviation in reading translate to 35 to 55 
22:662:59133:21:21:50:553:331:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:percent of a year of learning. More than 90 percent of the turnover of low-performing teachers occurs in 
22:663:59238:21:20:50:561:310:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:high-poverty schools, where the proportion of exiting teachers who are low-performers is twice as high as 
22:664:59344:20:21:50:542:290:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:in low-poverty schools.  An important component of IMPACT’s design is to dismiss teachers rated as 
22:665:59443:21:20:50:552:269:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:“Ineffective” and twice consecutively “Minimally Effective.” As is clear from this analysis, the benefits 
22:666:59549:20:21:50:562:249:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:of that policy primarily redound to high-poverty schools. By comparison to almost any other intervention, 
22:667:59655:21:27:50:482:228:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:these are very large improvements that are situated among some of the neediest students.  
22:668:59745:27:21:86:536:201:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:We should note that our analysis does not have the causal warrant of an experimental design. 
22:669:59838:21:20:50:499:180:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:Nonetheless, under certain identifying assumptions that we articulate and examine, our quasi-
22:670:59931:20:21:50:518:160:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:experimental design does identify the change in student achievement caused by teacher turnover. 
22:671:60027:21:21:50:564:139:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:However, we don’t claim that IMPACT caused all of the teacher turnover we observe. Although IMPACT 
22:672:60126:21:0:50:540:118:144:g_d0_f87:144:g_d0_f87:certainly caused some teachers to leave DCPS through dismissals, voluntary teacher attrition is likely 
23:673:60232:0:21:50:558:716:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:driven by myriad teacher preferences. While it’s possible that teachers may leave DCPS because they are 
23:674:60336:21:20:50:555:695:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:dissatisfied with IMPACT and the human capital strategies in DCPS writ large, we are unable to link the 
23:675:60440:20:21:50:539:675:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:attrition of high-performing teachers to IMPACT.16 Nor do we know whether our turnover results for 
23:676:60539:21:21:50:524:654:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:teachers and students in grades 4th through 8th in math and reading generalize to turnover for other 
23:677:60640:21:27:50:558:633:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:teachers and students. However, the descriptive summaries in Figures 4 and 5 would suggest they might.  
23:678:60743:27:20:86:546:606:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:Our empirical results were not inevitable, even for the turnover of low-performing teachers. As 
23:679:60839:20:21:50:525:586:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:Rothstein (2015) makes clear, there are good reasons to believe that the supply of teachers may be 
23:680:60938:21:21:50:561:565:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:insufficient to maintain teacher quality, especially when teacher quality is difficult to ascertain in advance 
23:681:61049:21:20:50:554:544:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:and challenging to improve in schools where there is substantial turnover. Our estimates suggest that, on 
23:682:61155:20:21:50:545:524:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:average, DCPS is able to recruit replacements for exiting teachers who are at least as effective, and for 
23:683:61261:21:21:50:556:503:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:low-performing teachers, replacements who are substantially more effective. These results are consistent 
23:684:61366:21:21:50:564:482:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:with simple descriptive evidence on the effectiveness of entering and exiting teachers (Figures 1, 4 and 5). 
23:685:61475:21:20:50:545:461:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:This may reflect the compensating differentials available to DCPS teachers in the form of bonuses and 
23:686:61577:20:21:50:520:441:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:increases in base pay or it may reflect specific aspects of the market for teachers in the District of 
23:687:61680:21:21:50:553:420:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:Columbia. Other school districts may experience different results when implementing a system intended 
23:688:61782:21:26:50:300:399:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:to increase the attrition of low-performing teachers. 
23:689:61836:26:21:86:553:373:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:The challenge of improving the composition of teachers in DCPS is increasing. First, as the least 
23:690:61934:21:21:50:548:352:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:effective teachers exit, there are fewer such teachers to exit over time and we would expect the average 
23:691:62039:21:21:50:562:331:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:effectiveness of exiting teachers to continue to increase. Second, in 2012-13 DCPS adjusted its evaluation 
23:692:62146:21:20:50:545:310:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:system so that to be rated as “Effective” or better (and thus avoid sanctions) teachers needed IMPACT 
23:693:62248:20:21:50:528:290:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:scores of at least 300 rather than 250 as had been true in 2011-12. Increasing the threshold for high-
23:694:62350:21:20:50:523:269:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:performing status will likely lead to the exit of some previously “Effective” teachers who are now 
23:695:62449:20:21:50:551:249:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:classified as “Developing” and may cause some “Effective” and “Highly Effective” teachers to leave as 
23:696:62551:21:21:50:531:228:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:they perceive the system as more stressful. On the other hand, DCPS made several other changes to 
23:697:62649:21:21:50:556:207:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:IMPACT in 2012-13 which may cause the system to be more hospitable, such as reducing the number of 
23:698:62748:21:20:50:558:186:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:teacher observations, increasing access to bonus and base pay increases and reducing the weight of value-
23:699:62853:20:41:50:190:166:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:added for Group 1 teachers.  
23:700:62882:41:7:194:197:125:144:g_d0_f89:144:g_d0_f89:                                                
23:701:62929:7:16:50:551:118:42:g_d0_f89:97:g_d0_f89:16 As noted earlier, the attrition of high-performing DCPS teachers (i.e., 13 percent) is similar to that observed in other urban 
23:702:63059:16:0:50:467:102:97:g_d0_f89:97:g_d0_f89:districts, suggesting that the per se effect of IMPACT on the attrition of such teachers may not be large. 
24:703:63169:0:21:86:545:716:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:We expect that both the declining numbers of very low-performing teachers and changes in the 
24:704:63262:21:20:50:564:695:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:IMPACT rating thresholds place strong demands on the system to continue recruiting effective teachers to 
24:705:63367:20:21:50:561:675:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:replace the exit of higher-performing teachers. Figure 1 presents some early evidence of these trends. The 
24:706:63474:21:21:50:546:654:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:teachers exiting at the end of our study window were noticeably more effective than those exiting after 
24:707:63578:21:21:50:555:633:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:IMPACT’s first year (i.e., by about 40 percent of a teacher-level standard deviation). However, over this 
24:708:63684:21:20:50:544:612:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:same period, the performance of entering teachers also grew appreciably (i.e., 28 percent of a standard 
24:709:63788:20:21:50:534:592:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:deviation). These trends appear unrelated to the average experience of entering and exiting teachers, 
24:710:63890:21:21:50:545:571:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:which, throughout this period, remained relatively constant at 3.5 and 7 years, respectively. As long as 
24:711:63995:21:20:50:530:550:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:DCPS continues to recruit more able teachers than it loses, compositional change will likely lead to 
24:712:64096:20:21:50:561:530:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:increased student achievement. Whether DCPS can reap further performance benefits from compositional 
24:713:64197:21:21:50:550:509:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:change in its workforce as it increases performance standards appears plausible, but remains to be seen. 
24:714:64302:21:21:50:545:488:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:Regardless, our results indicate that, under a robust system of performance assessment, the turnover of 
24:715:64406:21:20:50:535:467:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:teachers can generate meaningful gains in student outcomes, particularly for the most disadvantaged 
24:716:64506:20:0:50:239:447:144:g_d0_f90:144:g_d0_f90:students.

32:993:75741:21:20:50:553:544:144:g_d0_f107:144:g_d0_f107:identifies each student’s assigned school, grade, test grade, test subject, raw and scale score, proficiency
