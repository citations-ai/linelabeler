2:32:1859:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:33:1867:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:Large  and  regular  seasonal  price  fluctuations  in  local  grain  markets  appear  to  offer  African 
2:34:1973:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:farmers substantial  inter-temporal  arbitrage  opportunities,  but  these  opportunities  remain  largely 
2:35:2079:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:unexploited: small-scale  farmers  are  commonly  observed  to  "sell  low  and  buy  high"  rather  than 
2:36:2184:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:the  reverse.  In  a field  experiment  in  Kenya,  we  show  that  credit  market  imperfections  limit 
2:37:2288:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:farmers' abilities to move grain inter-temporally. Providing timely access to credit allows farmers 
2:38:2387:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices, increasing farm revenues and generating a return 
2:39:2485:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:on  investment  of  28%.  To  understand general  equilibrium  effects  of  these  changes  in  behavior, 
2:40:2590:14:14:71:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:we vary the density of loan offers across locations. We document significant effects of the credit 
2:41:2688:14:14:71:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:intervention on seasonal price fluctuations in local grain markets, and show that these GE effects 
2:42:2786:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:shape  individual  level  profitability  estimates. In  contrast  to  existing  experimental  work,  the 
2:43:2890:14:14:71:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:results indicate a setting in which microcredit can improve firm profitability, and suggest that GE 
2:44:2989:14:14:71:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:effects can substantially shape microcredit's effectiveness. In particular, failure to consider these 
2:45:3090:14:14:71:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:GE   effects   could   lead   to   underestimates   of   the   social   welfare   benefits of   microcredit

3:70:3770:0:33:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1    Introduction
3:71:3787:33:22:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:African agricultural markets are thin and imperfectly integrated, resulting in substantial variation
3:72:3887:22:22:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in staple commodity availability and prices (Fafchamps, 1992; Barrett and Dorosh, 1996; Minten
3:73:3981:22:22:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Kyle, 1999).  Particularly pronounced are price fluctuations seen over time, with grain prices
3:74:4079:22:22:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in major markets regularly rising by 25-40% between the harvest and lean seasons, and often more
3:75:4175:22:22:72:540:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than 50% in more isolated markets.  Underpinning these fluctuations is seemingly puzzling behavior
3:76:4273:22:22:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the farmer level:  despite having access to relatively cheap storage technologies, farmers tend to
3:77:4374:22:22:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sell their crops immediately after harvest and, in many areas, then later return to the market as
3:78:4471:22:22:72:420:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumers several months later in the lean season once prices have risen.
3:79:4544:22:21:88:539:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we explore the role of financial market imperfections in contributing to farmers’
3:80:4640:21:22:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:apparent inability to exploit this arbitrage opportunity.  Lack of access to credit markets has long
3:81:4740:22:22:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:been considered to play a central role in underdevelopment, but much of the literature has focused
3:82:4838:22:22:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the implications for firm growth and occupational choice (Banerjee and Newman, 1993; Galor and
3:83:4935:22:22:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Zeira, 1993; Banerjee and Duflo, 2010).  Here, we explore a novel channel by which poor financial
3:84:5032:22:22:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market  access  may  limit  development:  by  restricting  individuals’  ability  to  engage  in  arbitrage
3:85:5139:22:22:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and,  at a macro level,  by subsequently contributing to the large seasonal price fluctuations that
3:86:5238:22:22:72:201:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:characterize these markets.
3:87:5265:22:22:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Rural households’ difficulty in using storage to move grain from times of low prices to times
3:88:5358:22:22:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of high prices appears at least in part due to limited borrowing opportunities:  lacking access to
3:89:5456:22:22:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit or savings, farmers report selling their grain at low post-harvest prices to meet urgent cash
3:90:5556:22:22:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:needs (e.g., to pay school fees).  To meet consumption needs later in the year, many then end up
3:91:5652:22:22:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:buying back grain from the market a few months after selling it, in effect using the maize market
3:92:5749:22:21:72:397:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as a high-interest lender of last resort (Stephens and Barrett, 2011).
3:93:5819:21:22:88:539:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Working with a local agricultural microfinance NGO, we offer randomly selected smallholder
3:94:5909:22:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maize farmers a loan at harvest, and study whether access to this loan improves their ability to
3:95:6005:22:22:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:use storage to arbitrage local price fluctuations relative to a control group.  We find that farmers
3:96:6105:22:22:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:offered this harvest-time loan sell significantly less and purchase significantly more maize in the
3:97:6204:22:35:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period immediately following harvest, and this pattern reverses during the period of higher prices 6-
3:98:6305:35:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2
4:99:6306:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:9 months later.  This change in their marketing behavior results in a statistically significant increase
4:100:6410:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in revenues (net of loan interest) of 545 Ksh (or roughly 6 USD), suggesting that the loan produces
4:101:6509:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a return on investment of 28% over a roughly nine month period.  We replicate the experiment in
4:102:6604:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two back-to-back years to test the robustness of these results and find remarkably similar results
4:103:6702:22:22:72:243:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on primary outcomes in both years.
4:104:6736:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also run a long-run follow-up survey with respondents 1-2 years after harvest-time credit
4:105:6828:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intervention  had  been  discontinued  by  the  NGO,  to  test  whether  farmers  are  able  to  use  the
4:106:6933:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:additional  revenues  earned  from  this  loan  product  to  “save  their  way  out”  of  credit  constraints
4:107:7042:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in future years.  We find no evidence of sustained shifts in the timing of farm sales in subsequent
4:108:7141:22:22:72:456:511:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:seasons, nor do we see long-run effects on sales or revenues in subsequent years.1
4:109:7223:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To explore whether this shift in sales behavior by individuals farmers has an effect on market-
4:110:7318:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level  prices,  we  experimentally  vary  the  density  of  treated  farmers  across  locations  and  tracked
4:111:7427:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market prices at 52 local market points.  We find that increase grain storage at the market level
4:112:7524:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(induced by the credit intervention) led to significantly higher prices immediately after harvest and
4:113:7625:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to lower (albeit not significantly so) prices during the lean season.  One immediate implication of
4:114:7724:22:22:71:509:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these observed price effects is that grain markets in the study region are highly fragmented.
4:115:7817:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  find  that  these  general  equilibrium  effects  also  greatly  alter  the  profitability  of  the  loan.
4:116:7927:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:By dampening the arbitrage opportunity posed by seasonal price fluctuations, treated individuals
4:117:8023:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  areas  highly  saturated  with  loans  show  diminished  revenue  gains  relative  to  farmers  in  lower
4:118:8132:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:saturation  areas.   We  find  that  while  treated  farmers  in  high-saturation  areas  store  significantly
4:119:8242:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more than their control counterparts, doing so is not significantly more profitable;  the reduction
4:120:8341:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in seasonal price dispersion in these areas may reduce the benefits of loan adoption.  In contrast,
4:121:8440:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treated  farmers  in  low-density  areas  have  both  significantly  higher  inventories  and  significantly
4:122:8548:22:22:71:227:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher profits relative to control.
4:123:8583:22:22:88:539:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These  general  equilibrium  effects  —  and  their  impact  on  loan  profitability  at  the  individual
4:124:8688:22:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level  —  have  lessons  for  both  policy  and  research.   In  terms  of  policy,  the  general  equilibrium
4:125:8798:21:16:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects shape the distribution of the welfare gains of the harvest-time loan:  while recipients gain
4:126:8898:16:0:84:394:123:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1Though we do find some evidence of heterogeneity by treatment saturation.
5:127:8973:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relatively less than they would in the absence of such effects, we find suggestive evidence that non-
5:128:9074:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recipients  benefit  from  smoother  prices,  even  though  their  storage  behavior  remains  unchanged.
5:129:9179:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Though estimated effects on non-treated individuals are relatively imprecisely estimates, a welfare
5:130:9278:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:calculation  taking  the  point  estimates  at  face-value  suggests  that  69%  of  overall  gains  in  high-
5:131:9388:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment-intensity areas accrue to program non-recipients.  These gains to non-recipients, which
5:132:9485:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cannot be readily recouped by private sector lending institutions, may provide some incentive for
5:133:9582:22:22:72:233:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:public provision of such products.
5:134:9616:22:22:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The eroding profitability of arbitrage that we observe in highly loan saturated areas also has
5:135:9710:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:implications for impact evaluation in the context of highly fragmented markets, such as the rural
5:136:9807:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:markets in this study. When general equilibrium effects are pronounced and the SUTVA assumption
5:137:9902:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:violated (Rubin 1986),  the evaluation of an individually-randomized loan product may conclude
5:138:9996:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there is a null effect even when there are large positive social welfare impacts.  While this issue
5:139:10095:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may  be  particularly  salient  in  our  context  of  a  loan  explicitly  designed  to  enable  arbitrage,  it
5:140:10206:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is  by  no  means  unique  to  our  setting.   Any  enterprise  operating  in  a  small,  localized  market  or
5:141:10317:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  a  concentrated  industry  may  face  price  responses  to  shifts  in  own  supply,  and  credit-induced
5:142:10426:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expansion  may  therefore  be  less  profitable  than  it  would  be  in  a  more  integrated  market  or  in
5:143:10535:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a less concentrated industry.  Proper measurement of these impacts requires a study design with
5:144:10630:22:22:72:269:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exogenous variation in treatment density.
5:145:10671:22:22:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The results speak to a large literature on microfinance, which finds remarkably heterogenous

5:151:11177:22:16:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:farms,  a  setting  that  has  been  largely  outside  the  focus  of  the  experimental  literature  on  credit
5:152:11289:16:14:84:539:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2Experimental evaluations of microcredit include Attanasio et al. (2011); Crepon et al. (2011); Karlan and Zinman

5:154:11515:11:11:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(2009) for nice recent reviews of these literatures.  A related literature on providing cash grants to households and
5:155:11632:11:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:small firms suggest high rates of return to capital in some settings but not in others.  Studies finding high returns to

6:158:11969:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constraints.  Why do we find positive effects on firm profitability when many other experimental
6:159:12065:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies on microcredit do not?  First, unlike most of the settings examined in the literature, using
6:160:12165:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit to “free up” storage for price arbitrage is a nearly universally available investment opportunity
6:161:12269:22:22:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that does not depend on entrepreneurial skill.3Farmers do not even have to sell grain to benefit
6:162:12365:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from credit in this context: a net-purchasing farm household facing similar seasonal cash constraints
6:163:12466:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could use credit and storage to move its purchases from times of high prices to times of lower prices.
6:164:12568:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, the terms of repayment on the loan we study are flexible, which has been showing to be
6:165:12662:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:important for encouraging investment (Field et al., 2012).  Finally, as described above, the general
6:166:12762:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equilibrium effects of credit expansion could alter individual-level treatment effect estimates in a
6:167:12862:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of ways, potentially shaping outcomes for both treated and untreated individuals (Breza
6:168:12956:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Kinnan, 2018)).  This is a recognized but unresolved problem in the experimental literature
6:169:13051:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on credit, and few experimental studies have been explicitly designed to quantify the magnitude of
6:170:13149:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these general equilibrium effects (Acemoglu, 2010; Karlan et al., 2012).4Our results suggest that,
6:171:13247:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at least in our rural setting, treatment density matters and market-level spillovers can substantially
6:172:13349:22:22:72:309:402:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:shape individual-level treatment effect estimates.5
6:173:13400:22:22:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Beyond  contributing  to  the  experimental  literature  on  microcredit,  our  paper  is  closest  to  a
6:174:13505:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number  of  recent  papers  that  examine  the  role  of  borrowing  constraints  in  households’  storage
6:175:13611:22:16:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decisions and seasonal consumption patterns.6Using secondary data from Kenya,  Stephens and
6:176:13702:16:15:84:539:320:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3Existing studies have concluded that many small businesses or potential micro-entrepreneurs simply might not
6:177:13811:15:11:72:540:305:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:possess profitable investment opportunities (Banerjee et al., 2013; Fafchamps et al., 2013; Karlan et al., 2012; Banerjee,
6:178:13933:11:11:72:540:294:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:2013) or may lack the managerial skill or ability to channel capital towards these investments (Berge et al., 2011;
6:179:14048:11:7:72:151:283:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Bruhn et al., 2012).
6:180:14068:7:15:84:539:276:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4For instance,  Karlan et al. (2012) conclude by stating,  “Few if any studies have satisfactorily tackled the im-
6:181:14182:15:11:72:539:261:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:pact of improving one set of firms’ performance on general equilibrium outcomes....  This is a gaping hole in the
6:182:14295:11:11:72:540:250:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:entrepreneurship  development  literature.”  Indeed,  positive  spillovers  could  explain  some  of  the  difference  between
6:183:14421:11:11:72:540:239:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the experimental findings on credit, which suggest limited effects, and the estimates from larger-scale natural exper-
6:184:14539:11:11:72:540:228:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:iments, which tend to find positive effects of credit expansion on productivity – e.g.  Kaboski and Townsend (2012).
6:185:14655:11:10:72:540:217:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Acemoglu (2010) uses the literature on credit market imperfections to highlight the understudied potential role of
6:186:14769:10:8:72:348:207:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:GE effects in broad questions of interest to development economists.
6:187:14837:8:14:84:539:199:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5Whether these GE effects also influenced estimated treatment effects in the more urban settings examined in
6:188:14945:14:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:many previous studies is unknown,  although there is some evidence that spillovers do matter for microenterprises
6:189:15058:11:11:72:540:174:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:who directly compete for a limited supply of inputs to production.  For example, see De Mel et al. (2008) and their
6:190:15173:11:11:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:discussion of returns to capital for bamboo sector firms, which must compete over a limited supply of bamboo.  In
6:191:15286:11:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:any case, our results suggest that explicit attention to GE effects in future evaluations of credit market interventions
6:192:15406:11:7:72:149:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:is likely warranted.
6:193:15426:7:15:84:539:134:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:6In a forebearer to this literature, McCloskey and Nash (1984) attribute the dramatic reduction in seasonal grain
6:194:15539:15:48:72:506:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:price fluctuations observed in England between the 14th and 17th centuries to a reduction in interest rates.
6:195:15647:48:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:5
7:196:15648:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Barrett (2011) argue that credit constraints substantially alter smallholder farmers’ marketing and
7:197:15747:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:storage decisions, and Basu and Wong (2012) show that allowing farmers to borrow against future
7:198:15842:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harvests can substantially increase lean-season consumption.  Similarly,  Dillion (2017) finds that
7:199:15941:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an administrative change in the school calendar that moved the timing of school fee payments to
7:200:16036:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earlier in the year in Malawi forced credit constrained households with school-aged children to sell
7:201:16136:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their crops earlier and at a lower price.  Fink et al. (2014) shows that agricultural loans aimed at
7:202:16236:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alleviating seasonal labor shortages can improve household welfare in Zambia, while Beaman et al.
7:203:16333:22:22:72:526:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2014) find in Mali that well-timed credit access can increase investment in agricultural inputs.
7:204:16430:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As in these related papers, our results show that financial market imperfections lead households
7:205:16526:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to turn to increasingly costly ways to move consumption around in time.  In our particular setting,
7:206:16625:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit  constraints  combined  with  post-harvest  cash  needs  cause  farmers  to  store  less  than  they
7:207:16732:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would  in  an  unconstrained  world.   In  this  setting,  even  a  relatively  modest  expansion  of  credit
7:208:16841:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:affects local market prices, to the apparent benefit of both those with and without access to this
7:209:16939:21:22:72:102:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit.
7:210:16946:22:22:88:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 describes the setting and the ex-

7:212:17145:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:presents baseline estimates ignoring the role of general equilibrium effects.  Section 5 presents the
7:213:17246:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market level effects of the intervention.  Section 6 shows how these market-level effects shape the
7:214:17345:22:46:72:342:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individual-level returns to the loan.  Section 7 concludes.

7:217:17493:29:22:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Seasonal fluctuations in prices for staple grains appear to offer substantial intertemporal arbitrage
7:218:17594:22:22:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:opportunities, both in our study region of East Africa as well as in other parts of the developing
7:219:17692:22:22:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:world.  While long-term price data do not exist for the small, rural markets where our experiment
7:220:17789:22:22:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:takes  place,  price  series  data  are  available  for  major  markets  throughout  the  region.   Average
7:221:17896:22:47:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seasonal price fluctuations for maize in available markets are shown in Figure 1.  Increases in maize

8:223:17998:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prices in the six to eight months following harvest average roughly 25-40% in these markets; price
8:224:18096:22:22:72:476:687:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:increase reported elsewhere in Africa are consistent with these figures, if not higher.7
8:225:18184:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These  increases  also  appear  to  be  a  lower  bound  on  typical  increase  observed  in  the  smaller
8:226:18290:22:22:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:markets in our study area,  which (relative to these much larger markets) are characterized with
8:227:18386:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:much smaller “catchments” and less outside trade. We asked farmers at baseline to estimate average
8:228:18484:22:22:71:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:monthly prices of maize at their local market point over the five years prior to our experiment.  As
8:229:18584:22:22:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shown in Panel A of Figure 4, they reported a typical doubling in price between September (the
8:230:18678:22:22:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:main  harvest  month)  and  the  following  June.8We  also  collected  monthly  price  data  from  local
8:231:18782:22:22:71:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market points in our sample area during the two years of this study’s intervention, as well as for a
8:232:18882:22:22:71:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year after the intervention ended (more on this data collection below).9Panel B of Figure 4 presents
8:233:18982:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the price fluctuations observed during this period.  Because data collection began in November 2012
8:234:19081:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(two months after the typical trough in September), we cannot calculate the full price fluctuation

8:236:19284:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasing by 42% and 45% respectively.  These are smaller fluctuations than those seen in prior
8:237:19380:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:years (as reported by farmers in our sample) and smaller than those seen in subsequent years, which
8:238:19479:22:22:72:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:saw increases of 53% and 125% respectively.10There is therefore some variability in the precise
8:239:19574:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:size of the price fluctuation from season to season.  Nevertheless, we see price consistently rise by
8:240:19675:22:22:72:350:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more than 40% and, in some years, by substantially more.
8:241:19731:22:22:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These fluctuations have meaningful and negative consequences for the welfare of rural house-

8:243:19923:22:16:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption dropping noticeably during the lean season (Kaminski and Gilbert, 2014; Basu and
8:244:20015:16:15:84:539:254:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7For  instance,  Barrett  (2007)  reports  seasonal  rice  price  variation  in  Madagascar  of  80%,  World  Bank  (2006)

8:247:20281:7:15:84:539:221:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:8In case farmers were somehow mistaken or overoptimistic, we asked the same question of the local maize traders
8:248:20392:15:11:72:540:206:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:that can typically be found in these market points.  These traders report very similar average price increases:  the
8:249:20508:11:7:72:503:195:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:average reported increase between October and June across traders was 87%.  Results available on request.

8:253:20845:7:15:80:539:155:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:10For the 2015-2016 season, we combine our data with that collected by Bergquist (2017) in the same county in
8:254:20954:15:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Kenya and estimate that maize prices increased by 53% from November to June.  For the 2016-2017 season, we thank
8:255:21066:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Pascaline Dupas for her generosity in sharing maize price data collected in the same county in November 2016 and
8:256:21178:11:47:72:299:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:June 2017, from which we estimate an increase of 125%.

9:259:21329:22:22:72:219:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:falls on the poorest of farmers.
9:260:21361:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These  price  fluctuations  are  surprising  in  light  of  the  storable  nature  of  staple  commodities.
9:261:21468:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Home  storage  is  a  simple  technology  available  to  farmers  in  this  region.   To  store,  farmers  dry
9:262:21578:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maize kernels on a tarp immediately after harvest, treat the crop with insecticide dust, and store
9:263:21676:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it in locally-made sacks, kept on wooden pallets to allow for air circulation and typically located
9:264:21775:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in farmers’ homes or in small outdoor sheds.  Our survey data suggests the cost of these storage
9:265:21871:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:materials  is  low,  at  around  3.5%  of  the  value  of  the  crop  at  harvest  time.   Post-harvest  losses
9:266:21982:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also  appear  minimal  in  this  setting,  with  an  average  of  2.5%  of  the  crop  lost  over  a  6-9  month
9:267:22094:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:storage period (see Appendix B for further discussion).  The low cost of storage,  in conjunction
9:268:22191:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with consistently large price increases over the course of the season, therefore appears to offer large
9:269:22294:22:22:72:202:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:opportunities for arbitrage.
9:270:22322:22:21:88:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However, farmers do not appear to be taking advantage of these apparent arbitrage opportuni-
9:271:22414:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ties.  Figure A.1 shows data from two earlier pilot studies conducted either by our NGO partner (in
9:272:22513:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2010/11, with 225 farmers) or in conjunction with our partner (in 2011/12, with a different sample
9:273:22611:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of 700 farmers).  These studies tracked maize inventories, purchases, and sales for farmers in our
9:274:22709:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:study region.  In both years,  the median farmer exhausted her inventories about 5 months after
9:275:22804:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harvest, and at that point switched from being a net seller of maize to a net purchaser as shown in
9:276:22903:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the right panels of the figure.  This was despite the fact that farmer-reported sales prices rose by
9:277:23003:22:22:72:433:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more than 80% in both of these years in the nine months following harvest.
9:278:23077:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Why are farmers not using storage to sell grain at higher prices and purchase at lower prices?
9:279:23171:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our experiment is designed to test one specific explanation:  that credit constraints limit farmers
9:280:23270:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ability  to  arbitrage  these  price  fluctuations.11In  extensive  focus  groups  with  farmers  prior  to
9:281:23377:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our  experiment,  credit  constraints  were  the  unprompted  explanation  given  by  the  vast  majority
9:282:23482:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  these  farmers  as  to  why  they  sold  the  majority  of  their  maize  in  the  immediate  post-harvest
9:283:23592:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period.   In  particular,  because  nearly  all  of  these  farm  households  have  school-aged  kids,  and
9:284:23699:21:16:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a  large  percentage  of  a  child’s  school  fees  are  typically  due  in  the  few  months  after  harvest  in
9:285:23812:16:15:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:11Other factors, mostly outside the scope of this paper, may also be at play in limiting farmers’ ability to store.
9:286:23927:15:0:72:304:108:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Appendix B explores these other factors in greater detail.
10:287:23986:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:January, given the calendar-year school year schedule, many farmers report selling much of their
10:288:24082:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harvest to pay these fees.  Indeed, many schools in the area will accept in-kind payment in maize
10:289:24179:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:during this period.  Farmers also report having to pay other bills they have accumulated throughout
10:290:24278:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the year during the post-harvest period.  Finally, many farmers also spend more on discretionary
10:291:24374:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditures during this harvest period as well, which may be reflective of high levels of impatience
10:292:24475:22:22:72:521:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or present-biased preferences.  Regardless of the source, harvest is a time of large expenditure.
10:293:24572:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Why do these high harvest-time expenditures necessitate high harvest-time sales of maize?  In
10:294:24665:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the absence of functioning financial markets, the timing of production and consumption – or, more
10:295:24762:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifically, sale and expenditure – must be intimately tied.  As with poor households throughout
10:296:24859:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:much of the world, farmers in our study area appear to have very limited access to formal credit.
10:297:24956:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Only eight percent of households in our sample reported having taking a loan from a bank in the
10:298:25051:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year prior to the baseline survey.12Informal credit markets also appear relatively thin, with fewer
10:299:25150:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than 25% of farmers reporting having given or received a loan from a moneylender, family member,
10:300:25246:21:22:71:287:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or friend in the 3 months before the baseline.
10:301:25292:22:22:88:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Absent  other  means  of  borrowing,  and  given  the  high  expenditure  needs  they  report  facing
10:302:25393:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the post-harvest period, farmers end up liquidating grain rather than storing.  Furthermore, a
10:303:25490:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant percentage of these households end up buying back maize from the market later in the
10:304:25586:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season to meet consumption needs, and this pattern of “sell low and buy high” directly suggests
10:305:25681:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a  liquidity  story:  farmers  are  in  effect  taking  a  high-interest  quasi-loan  from  the  maize  market
10:306:25791:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Stephens  and  Barrett,  2011).   Baseline  data  indicate  that  35%  of  our  sample  both  bought  and
10:307:25897:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sold  maize  during  the  previous  crop  year  (September  2011  to  August  2012),  and  that  over  half
10:308:26004:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of these sales occurred before January (when prices were low).  40% of our sample reported only
10:309:26099:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:purchasing maize over this period, and the median farmer in this group made all of their purchases
10:310:26197:22:22:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:after January.  Stephens and Barrett (2011) report similar patterns for other households in Western
10:311:26296:22:16:71:221:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Kenya during an earlier period.
10:312:26327:16:14:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:12Note that even at the high interest rates charged by formal banking institutions (typically around 20% annually),
10:313:26442:14:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:storage would remain profitable, given the 40% plus (often much larger) increases in prices that are regularly observed
10:314:26561:11:11:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:over the 9-month post-harvest period and relatively small storage costs and losses (e.g., due to spoilage), which we
10:315:26677:11:0:72:186:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:estimate to be less than 6%.

11:319:26947:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the organization One Acre Fund (OAF) to offer farmers harvest-time loan.  OAF is a microfinance
11:320:27042:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:NGO that makes in-kind,  joint-liability loans of fertilizer and seed to groups of farmers,  as well
11:321:27142:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as providing training on improved farming techniques.  OAF group sizes typically range from 8-12
11:322:27238:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:farmers, and farmer groups are organized into “sublocations” – effectively clusters of villages that
11:323:27338:22:22:72:539:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can be served by one OAF field officer.13OAF typically serves about 30% of farmers in a given
11:324:27431:22:22:72:129:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sublocation.
11:325:27443:22:22:88:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The study sample is drawn from existing groups of One Acre Fund (OAF) farmers in Webuye
11:326:27530:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Matete districts in Western Kenya.  The Year 1 sample consists of 240 existing OAF farmer
11:327:27623:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:groups drawn from 17 different sublocations in Webuye district, and our total sample size at baseline
11:328:27724:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was 1,589 farmers.  The Year 2 sample attempts to follow the same OAF groups as Year 1; however,
11:329:27820:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:some groups dissolved such that in Year 2 we are left with 171 groups.  In addition, some of the
11:330:27916:22:22:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:groups experienced substantial shifting of the individual members; therefore some Year 1 farmers
11:331:28012:22:22:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:drop out of our Year 2 sample, and other farmers are new to our Year 2 sample.14Ultimately, of
11:332:28106:22:22:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the 1,019 individuals in our Year 2 sample, 602 are drawn from the Year 1 sample and 417 are new

11:334:28216:22:22:88:539:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 4 displays the experimental design.  There are two main levels of randomization.  First,
11:335:28311:22:22:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we randomly divided the 17 sublocations in our sample into 9 “high” intensity” sites and 8 “low
11:336:28406:22:22:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intensity”  sites.   In  high  intensity  sites,  we  enrolled  80%  of  OAF  groups  in  the  sample  (for  a
11:337:28516:22:22:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample  of  171  groups),  while  in  low  intensity  sites,  we  only  enrolled  40%  of  OAF  groups  in  the
11:338:28627:22:22:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample (for a sample of 69 groups).  Then, within each sublocation, groups were randomized into
11:339:28722:22:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment or control.  In Year 1, two-thirds of individuals in each sublocation were randomized into
11:340:28822:16:11:80:429:181:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:13A sublocation is a group of 4-5 villages, with a typical population of 400-500 people.
11:341:28910:11:14:80:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:14Shifting of group members is a function of several factors, including whether farmers wished to participate in the
11:342:29026:14:11:72:540:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:overall OAF program from year to year.  There was some (small) selective attrition based on treatment status in Year
11:343:29142:11:11:72:540:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:1; treated individuals were 10 percentage points more likely to return to the Year 2 sample than control individuals
11:344:29258:11:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(significant at 1%).  This does slightly alter the composition of the Year 2 sample (see Table L.3 and Section L), but
11:345:29376:11:11:72:540:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:because Year 2 treatment status is stratified by Year 1 treatment status (as will be described below), it does not alter
11:346:29496:11:41:72:239:112:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the internal validity of the Year 2 results.
11:347:29540:41:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:10
12:348:29542:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment (more on this below) and one-third into control.  In Year 2, half of individuals in each
12:349:29640:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sublocation were randomized into treatment and half into control.  As a result of this randomization
12:350:29740:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:procedure,  high  intensity  sublocations  have  double  the  number  of  treated  individuals  as  in  low
12:351:29847:22:22:72:178:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intensity sublocations.
12:352:29870:22:22:88:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The group-level randomization was stratified at the sublocation level (and in Year 1, for which
12:353:29965:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we had administrative data,  further stratified based on whether group-average OAF loan size in
12:354:30060:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  previous  year  was  above  or  below  the  sample  median).   In  Year  2,  we  maintained  the  same
12:355:30167:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:saturation treatment status at the sublocation level,15but re-randomized groups into treatment
12:356:30261:22:22:71:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and control, stratifying on their treatment status from Year 1.16Given the roughly 35% reduction
12:357:30357:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in overall sample size in Year 2, overall treatment saturation rates (the number of treated farmers
12:358:30456:22:22:71:438:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per sublocation) were effectively 35% lower in Year 2 as compared to Year 1.
12:359:30532:22:22:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Year 1, there was a third level of randomization pertaining to the timing of the loan offer.
12:360:30627:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In focus groups run prior to the experiment,  farmers were split on when credit access would be
12:361:30722:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:most  useful,  with  some  preferring  cash  immediately  at  harvest,  and  others  preferring  it  a  few
12:362:30829:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:months later timed to coincide with when school fees were due (the latter preferences suggesting
12:363:30925:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that farmers may be sophisticated about potential difficulties in holding on to cash between the
12:364:31021:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time it was disbursed and the time it needed to be spent).  In order to test the importance of loan
12:365:31120:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:timing, in Year 1, a random half of the treated group (so a third of the total sample) received the
12:366:31219:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loan in October (immediately following harvest), while the other half received the loan in January
12:367:31317:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(immediately before school fees are due, although still several months before the local lean season).
12:368:31418:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As  will  be  described  in  Section  4,  results  from  Year  1  suggested  that  the  earlier  loan  was  more
12:369:31530:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effective, and therefore in Year 2 OAF only offered the earlier timed loan to the full sample (though
12:370:31631:22:22:71:473:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:due to administrative delays, the actual loan was disbursed in November in Year 2).
12:371:31714:22:22:88:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although  all  farmers  in  each  loan  treatment  group  were  offered  the  loan,  we  follow  only  a
12:372:31818:22:16:71:539:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:randomly selected 6 farmers in each loan group, and a randomly selected 8 farmers in each of the
12:373:31914:16:14:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:15Such that, for example, if a sublocation was a high intensity sublocation in Year 1 it remained a high intensity
12:374:32028:14:7:72:160:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:sublocation in Year 2.
12:375:32050:7:15:80:539:145:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:16This was intended to result in randomized duration of treatment – either zero years of the loan, one year of the
12:376:32164:15:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:loan, or two years – however, because the decision to return to the Year 2 sample was affected by Year 1 treatment
12:377:32278:11:0:72:442:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:status, we do not use this variation here and instead focus throughout on one year impacts.
13:378:32371:0:22:72:143:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:control groups.
13:379:32386:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Loan offers were announced in September in both years.  The size of the loan for which farmers
13:380:32480:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were eligible was a linear function of the number of bags they had in storage at the time of loan
13:381:32577:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disbursal.17In Year 1, there was a cap of 7 bags for which farmers could be eligible; in Year 2, this
13:382:32678:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cap was 5 bags.  In Year 1, to account for the expected price increase, October bags were valued
13:383:32774:22:22:71:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at 1500 Ksh, and January bags at 2000 Ksh.  In Year 2, bags were valued at 2500 Ksh.  Each loan
13:384:32869:22:22:71:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:carried with it a “flat” interest rate of 10%, with full repayment due after nine months.1819These
13:385:32967:22:22:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loans  were  an  add-on  to  the  existing  in-kind  loans  that  OAF  clients  received,  and  OAF  allows
13:386:33074:22:22:71:478:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:flexible repayment of both – farmers are not required to repay anything immediately.
13:387:33158:22:22:88:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:OAF did not take physical or legal position of the bags, which remained in farmers’ home stores.
13:388:33254:22:22:71:539:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Bags were tagged with a simple laminated tag and zip tie.  When we mentioned in focus groups
13:389:33346:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the possibility of OAF running a harvest loan program, and described the details about the bag
13:390:33440:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tagging, many farmers (unprompted) said that the tags alone would prove useful in shielding their
13:391:33537:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maize from network pressure:  “branding” the maize as committed to OAF, a well-known lender in
13:392:33631:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the region, would allow them to credibly claim that it could not be given out.20Because tags could
13:393:33729:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:represent a meaningful treatment in their own right, we wished to separate the effect of the credit
13:394:33828:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from any effect of the tag, and therefore in the Year 1 study offered a separate treatment arm in
13:395:33925:22:22:71:253:336:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:which groups received only the tags.21
13:396:33963:22:22:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, because self- or other-control problems might make it particularly difficult to channel
13:397:34059:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cash toward productive investments in settings where there is a substantial time lag between when
13:398:34156:22:16:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the cash is delivered and when the desired investment is made, in Year 1, we also cross-randomized
13:399:34254:16:15:80:539:254:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:17However, there was no further requirement that farmers store beyond the date of loan disbursal.  This requirement
13:400:34369:15:7:72:488:239:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:was set by OAF to ensure that farmers took a “reasonable” loan size that they would be able to repay.
13:401:34470:7:15:80:539:232:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:18Annualized, this interest rate is slightly lower than the 16-18% APR charged on loans at Equity Bank, the main
13:402:34582:15:7:72:161:217:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:rural lender in Kenya.
13:403:34604:7:14:80:539:210:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:19For example, a farmer who committed 5 bags when offered the October loan in Year 1 would receive 5*1500 =
13:404:34711:14:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:7500 Ksh in cash in October (∼$90 at current exchange rates), and would be required to repay 8250 Ksh by the end
13:405:34823:11:8:71:101:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of July.
13:406:34831:8:14:80:539:177:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:20Such behavior is consistent with evidence from elsewhere in Africa that individuals take out loans or use com-
13:407:34943:14:11:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:mitment savings accounts mainly as a way to demonstrate that they have little to share with others(Baland et al.,
13:408:35056:11:7:72:174:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:2011; Brune et al., 2011).
13:409:35082:7:15:80:539:145:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:21This is not the full factorial research design – there could be an interaction between the tag and the loan – but
13:410:35197:15:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:we did not have access to a sufficiently large sample size to implement the full 2 x 2 design to isolate any interaction
13:411:35317:11:48:72:96:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:effect.

14:413:35326:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a  simple  savings  technology  that  had  shown  promise  in  a  nearby  setting  (Dupas  and  Robinson,
14:414:35431:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2013).  In particular,  a subset of farmers in each loan treatment group in Year 1 were offered a
14:415:35528:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:savings  lockbox  (a  simple  metal  box  with  a  sturdy  lock)  which  they  could  use  as  they  pleased.
14:416:35637:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While such a savings device could have other effects on household decision making, our hypothesis
14:417:35734:22:22:72:533:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was that it would be particularly helpful for loan clients who received cash before it was needed.
14:418:35832:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The tags and lockbox treatments were randomized at the individual level during Year 1.  These
14:419:35925:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatments were not included in Year 2 due to minimal treatment effects in Year 1 data (discussed
14:420:36022:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:below),  as well as the somewhat smaller sample size in Year 2.  Using the sample of individuals
14:421:36118:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:randomly selected to be followed in each group, we stratified individual level treatments by group
14:422:36216:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment assignment and by gender.  So, for instance, of all of the women who were offered the
14:423:36311:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:October loan and who were randomly selected to be surveyed, one third of them were randomly
14:424:36402:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:offered the lockbox (and similarly for the men and for the January loan).  In the control groups, in
14:425:36502:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which we were following 8 farmers, 25% of the men and 25% of the women were randomly offered
14:426:36594:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  lockbox,  with  another  25%  each  being  randomly  offered  the  tags.   The  study  design  allows
14:427:36700:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identification of the individual and combined effects of the different treatments, and our approach
14:428:36799:22:46:72:293:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for estimating these effects is described below.

14:430:36871:32:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The timing of the study activities is shown in Figure 3. In August/September 2012 (prior to the Year
14:431:36971:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1 experiment), a baseline survey was conducted with the entire Year 1 sample.  The baseline survey
14:432:37069:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:collected data on farming practices, storage costs, maize storage and marketing over the previous
14:433:37166:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crop  year,  price  expectations  for  the  coming  year,  food  and  non-food  consumption  expenditure,
14:434:37271:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household borrowing, lending, and saving behavior, household transfers with other family members
14:435:37367:22:22:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and neighbors, sources of non-farm income, time and risk preferences, and digit span recall.  Table
14:436:37466:22:22:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:N.1 presents summary statistics for a range of variables at baseline; we observe balance on most
14:437:37562:22:22:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of these variables across treatment groups, as would be expected from randomization.  Table K.1
14:438:37657:22:22:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shows the analogous table comparing individuals in the high- and low-treatment-density areas; the
14:439:37754:22:33:72:325:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:samples appear balanced on observables here as well.

15:441:37808:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  then  undertook  three  follow-up  rounds  over  the  ensuing  12  months,  spanning  the  spring
15:442:37909:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2013 “long rains” planting (the primary growing season) and concluding just prior to the 2013 long
15:443:38007:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rains harvest (which occurs August-September).  The multiple follow-up rounds were motivated by
15:444:38102:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:three factors.  First, a simple inter-temporal model of storage and consumption decisions suggests
15:445:38200:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that while the loan should increase total consumption across all periods, the per-period effects could
15:446:38302:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be ambiguous – meaning that consumption throughout the follow-up period needs to be measured
15:447:38394:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  get  at  overall  effects.   Second,  because  nearly  all  farmers  deplete  their  inventories  before  the
15:448:38507:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:next  harvest,  inventories  measured  at  a  single  follow-up  one  year  after  treatment  would  likely
15:449:38614:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provide very little information on how the loan affected storage and marketing behavior.  Finally,
15:450:38712:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as shown in McKenzie (2012), multiple follow-up measurements on noisy outcomes variables (e.g
15:451:38805:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption) has the added advantage of increasing power.  The follow-up surveys tracked data on
15:452:38901:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:storage inventory, maize marketing behavior, consumption, and other credit and savings behavior.
15:453:38997:22:21:72:532:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Follow-up surveys also collected information on time preferences and on self-reported happiness.
15:454:39093:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because the Year 2 experiment was designed to follow the sample sample as Year 1, a second
15:455:39183:22:22:72:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:baseline was not run prior to Year 2.22A similar schedule of three follow-up rounds over 12 months
15:456:39281:22:22:72:326:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was conducted in Year 2 following the loan disbursal.
15:457:39334:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Attrition was relatively low across survey rounds.  In Year 1, overall attrition was 8%, and not
15:458:39430:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significantly different across treatment groups (8% in the treatment group and 7% in the control).
15:459:39528:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Year 2, overall attrition was 2% (in both treatment and control, with no significant difference).
15:460:39628:22:22:88:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Year 1 treatment status is predictive of Year 2 re-enrollment in the study (treated individuals
15:461:39723:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were more likely to re-register for OAF in the second year, perhaps reflecting a positive appraisal of
15:462:39825:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the value of the loan).  However, because Year 2 treatment status was re-randomized and stratified
15:463:39923:22:16:72:519:226:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:by Year 1 treatment status, this does not alter the internal validity of the Year 2 results.23,24
15:464:40020:16:14:80:539:210:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:22In practice, due to the administrative shifts in farmer group composition described in greater detail in Section
15:465:40134:14:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:2, 417 of the 1,019 individuals in the Year 2 sample were new to the study.  For these individuals, we do not have
15:466:40248:11:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:baseline data (there was insufficient time between receiving the updated administrative records for Year 2 groups and
15:467:40365:11:11:72:540:174:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the disbursal of the loan to allow for a second baseline to be run).  Therefore, balance tables can only be run with the
15:468:40485:11:11:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:sample that was present in Year 1.  Because the loan offer was randomized, however, this should not affect inference
15:469:40601:11:7:72:209:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:regarding the impacts of the loan.
15:470:40635:7:15:80:539:145:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:23This does, however, mean that we cannot exploit the re-randomization in Year 2 to identify the effect of receiving
15:471:40751:15:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the loan for multiple years or of receiving the loan and then having it discontinued, as an endogenously selected group
15:472:40870:11:7:72:461:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:did not return to the Year 2 sample and therefore was never assigned a Year 2 treatment status.
15:473:40965:7:41:80:539:112:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:24This also slightly alters the composition of the Year 2 sample, relevant to external validity.  Appendix L explores

16:475:41084:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In order to explore the long-run effects of the loan, we also ran a Long-Run Follow-Up (LRFU)
16:476:41177:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:survey  from  November-December  2015.   This  was  two  (one)  years  following  loan  repayment  for
16:477:41279:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Year 1 (Year 2) treatment group.  This survey followed up on the entire Year 2 sample (1,091
16:478:41375:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals) and a representative subset of the Year 1 only sample (another 481 individuals), for
16:479:41472:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a  total  sample  of  1500  individuals.   The  survey  collected  information  on  maize  harvests,  sales,
16:480:41580:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:purchases,  and revenues by season from 2014-2015.  It also collected data on farm inputs (labor
16:481:41676:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and capital), food consumption and expenditure, household consumption, educational expenditure
16:482:41770:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and attendance among children, non-farm employment and revenues, and a self-reported happiness
16:483:41864:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measure.  Attrition in the LRFU was 9%, with no differential attrition based on Year 2 treatment
16:484:41960:22:22:72:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:status and slight differential attrition based on Year 1 treatment status.25Appendix L provides
16:485:42055:22:22:72:159:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:further discussion.
16:486:42074:22:22:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In addition to farmer-level surveys, we also collected monthly price surveys at 52 market points
16:487:42170:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  the  study  area.   The  markets  were  identified  prior  to  treatment  based  on  information  from
16:488:42276:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:local  OAF  staff  about  the  market  points  in  which  client  farmers  typically  buy  and  sell  maize.
16:489:42384:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Data collection for these surveys began in November 2012 and continued through December 2015.
16:490:42477:22:38:72:524:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, we utilize administrative data on loan repayment that was generously shared by OAF.
16:491:42569:38:29:72:203:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.1    Pre-analysis plan
16:492:42593:29:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To limit both risks and perceptions of data mining and specification search (Casey et al., 2012), we
16:493:42693:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:registered a pre-analysis plan (PAP) for Year 1 prior to the analysis of any follow-up data.26The
16:494:42790:22:22:72:518:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Year 2 analysis follows a near identical analysis plan.  The PAP can be found in Appendix N.
16:495:42882:22:22:88:539:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We deviate significantly from the PAP in one instance:  the PAP specifies that we will analyze
16:496:42976:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the effect of treatment saturation on the percent price spread from November to June.  However,
16:497:43071:22:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because in practice the loan was offered at slight different points in time (October and January in
16:498:43170:20:7:72:120:183:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:this further.
16:499:43183:7:15:80:539:176:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:25Being treated in Year 1 is associated with a 3 percentage point increase in the likelihood of being found in the
16:500:43297:15:11:72:540:161:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:long-run follow up survey, significant at 10%.  This appears to be at least partially driven by the fact that Year 1
16:501:43413:11:11:72:540:150:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:treated individuals were more likely to be in the Year 2 sample (and therefore had been more recently in touch with
16:502:43528:11:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:our survey team).  After controlling for whether an individual was present in the Year 2 sample, Year 1 treatment
16:503:43641:11:7:72:301:128:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:status is no longer significantly correlated with attrition.
16:504:43701:7:15:80:539:121:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:26The pre-analysis plan is registered here:  https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/67, and was registered on
16:505:43816:15:35:72:379:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:September 6th 2013.  The complete set of results are available upon request.

17:507:43894:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Year 1; November in Year 2) and because there is year-to-year variation in when markets hit their
17:508:43991:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:peak and trough, this measure may fail to capture the full effect of treatment on prices.  Moreover,
17:509:44091:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this measure is statistically underpowered, ignoring 77% of our monthly data by focusing solely on
17:510:44189:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the price gap between two months, rather than exploiting the full nine months of data collected
17:511:44284:22:22:72:148:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:over the season.
17:512:44300:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Therefore,  in  our  primary  specifications,  we  relax  our  attachment  to  this  underpowered  and
17:513:44402:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:perhaps misspecified measure November-June price gap, instead analyze the non-parametric effect
17:514:44497:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of treatment on the evolution of monthly prices, as well as a level and time trend effect.  Appendix
17:515:44597:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I.3  presents  the  pre-specified  November-June  effect.   For  all  analyses,  we  maintain  our  original
17:516:44705:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hypothesis that effect of high-density treatment on prices will be initially positive if receipt of the
17:517:44808:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loan allows farmers to pull grain off the market in the post-harvest surplus period and later negative
17:518:44910:22:22:72:278:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as stored grain is released onto the market.
17:519:44954:22:21:88:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In two other instances we add to the PAP. First, in addition to the regression results specified
17:520:45050:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the PAP, we also present graphical results for many of the outcomes.  These results are based
17:521:45146:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on non-parametric estimates of the parametric regressions specified in the PAP, and are included
17:522:45242:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because they clearly summarize how treatment effects evolve over time,  but since they were not
17:523:45337:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explicitly specified in the PAP we mention them here.  Second, we failed to include in the PAP the
17:524:45435:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(ex post obvious) regressions in which the individual-level treatment effect is allowed to vary by
17:525:45533:22:38:72:388:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sublocation-level treatment intensity, and present these below.
17:526:45600:38:29:72:286:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.2    Estimation of treatment effects
17:527:45638:29:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In all analyses, we present results separately by year and pooled across years.  Because the Year
17:528:45735:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2 replication produced results that are quantitatively quite similar to the Year 1 results for most
17:529:45834:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outcomes, we rely on the pooled results as our specification of primary interest.  However, for the
17:530:45933:22:22:72:330:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sake of transparency and comparison, we report both.
17:531:45985:22:21:88:539:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There are three main outcomes of interest:  inventories, maize net revenues, and consumption.
17:532:46078:21:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Inventories are the number of 90kg bags of maize the household had in their maize store at the
17:533:46172:22:45:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time of the each survey.  This amount is visually verified by our enumeration team, and so is likely
17:534:46272:45:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:16
18:535:46274:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to be measured with minimal error.  We define maize net revenues as the value of all maize sales
18:536:46370:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minus the value of all maize purchases, and minus any additional interest payments made on the
18:537:46464:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loan for individuals in the treatment group.  We call this “net revenues” rather than “profits” since
18:538:46565:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we likely do not observe all costs; nevertheless, costs are likely to be very similar across treatment
18:539:46667:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:groups (fixed costs of storing at home were already paid, and variable costs of storage are very low).
18:540:46769:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The values of sales and purchases were based on recall data over the period between each survey
18:541:46864:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:round.  Finally, we define consumption as the log of total household expenditure over the 30 days
18:542:46961:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prior to each survey.  For each of these variables we trim the top and bottom 0.5% of observations,
18:543:47060:22:22:72:244:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as specified in the pre-analysis plan.

18:552:47695:22:22:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loan take-up was high.  To absorb additional variation in the outcomes of interest, we also control
18:553:47794:22:21:71:539:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for survey date (dt) in the regressions.  Each follow-up round spanned over three months, meaning
18:554:47891:21:22:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that there could be (for instance) substantial within-round drawdown of inventories.  Inclusion of
18:555:47989:22:22:71:539:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this  covariate  should  help  to  make  our  estimates  more  precise  without  biasing  point  estimates.
18:556:48096:22:22:71:325:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Standard errors are clustered at the loan group level.
18:557:48150:22:22:88:539:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  assumption  in  Equation  8  is  that  treatment  effects  are  constant  across  rounds.   In  our
18:558:48254:22:22:71:539:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:setting, there are reasons why this might not be the case.  In particular, if treatment encourages
18:559:48352:22:22:71:540:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:storage, one might expect maize revenues to belowerfor the treated group immediately following
18:560:48446:22:22:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harvest,  as  they  hold  off  selling,  andgreaterlater  on  during  the  lean  season,  when  they  release
18:561:48555:22:57:71:534:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their stored grain.  To explore whether treatment effects are constant across rounds, we estimate:

19:570:48911:22:40:88:368:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To explore heterogeneity in treatment effects, we estimate:
19:571:48970:40:39:170:540:547:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:Yijry=α+β1Tjy+β2Zi0+β2Tjy∗Zi0+ηry+dt+εijry(3)

19:573:49111:22:22:72:540:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As pre-specified, we explore heterogeneity by impatience (as measured in standard time preference
19:574:49208:22:22:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:questions), the number of school-aged children, the initial liquid wealth level, the percent of baseline
19:575:49312:22:22:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sales sold early (prior to January 1), and the seasonal price increase expected between September
19:576:49409:22:22:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2012 and June 2013.  Because a baseline was only run prior to Year 1, we are only able to present
19:577:49506:22:22:72:297:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these specifications for the Year 1 intervention.
19:578:49555:22:22:88:539:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To quantify market level effects of the loan intervention, we tracked market prices at 52 market
19:579:49651:22:22:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:points throughout our study region, and we assign these markets to the nearest sublocation.  To
19:580:49746:22:43:72:416:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate price effects we begin by estimating the following linear model:
19:581:49819:43:33:171:540:289:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:pmsty=α+β1Hs+β2montht+β3(Hs∗montht) +εmst(4)

19:585:50139:22:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:farmers to shift purchases to earlier in the season or sales to later in the season, and if this shift in
19:586:50244:21:22:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marketing behavior was enough to alter supply and demand in local markets, then our prediction is
19:587:50341:22:16:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thatβ1>0 andβ3<0, i.e.  that prices in areas with more treated farmers are higher after harvest
19:588:50436:16:15:80:539:131:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:27Prices  are  normalized  to  100  among  the  “low”  intensity  markets  in  the  first  month  (Hs=  0,montht=  0).
19:589:50554:15:0:72:502:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Therefore, price effects can be interpreted as a percentage change from control market post-harvest prices.

20:592:50787:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:should be orthogonal to other location-specific characteristics that might also affect prices (e.g.  the
20:593:50891:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:size of each market’s catchment), we have only 17 sublocations.  This relatively small number of
20:594:50987:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:clusters could present problems for inference (Cameron et al., 2008).  We begin by clustering errors
20:595:51087:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at  the  sublocation  level  when  estimating  Equation  4.   We  also  report  standard  errors  estimated
20:596:51194:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:using both the wild bootstrap technique described in Cameron et al. (2008) and the randomization
20:597:51290:22:22:72:327:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inference technique used in Cohen and Dupas (2010).
20:598:51341:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To  understand  how  treatment  density  affects  individual-level  treatment  effects,  we  estimate
20:599:51442:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Equations 8 and 9, interacting the individual-level treatment indicator with the treatment density
20:600:51540:22:39:72:251:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dummy.  The pooled equation is thus:
20:601:51576:39:40:163:540:450:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:Yijsry=α+β1Tjy+β2Hs+β3(Tjy∗Hs) +ηry+dt+εijsry(5)
20:602:51624:40:22:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If the intervention produces sufficient individual level behavior to generate market-level effects, we
20:603:51726:22:22:72:539:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predict thatβ3<0 and perhaps thatβ2>0 - i.e.  treated individual in high-density areas do worse
20:604:51821:22:22:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than  in  low  density  areas,  and  control  individuals  in  high  density  areas  do  better  than  control
20:605:51931:22:22:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals in low density areas.  As in Equation 4, we report results with errors clustered at the
20:606:52030:22:22:72:154:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sublocation level.
20:607:52048:22:43:88:501:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For long-run effects, we first estimate the following regression for each year separately:
20:608:52138:43:33:257:540:257:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:Yij=α+βTjy+εij(6)
20:609:52155:33:22:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in whichYijis the outcome of interest for individualiin groupj.  The sample is restricted to those
20:610:52253:22:22:72:215:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who were in the Yearystudy.
20:611:52280:22:39:88:336:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We further also estimate the following specification:
20:612:52333:39:70:204:540:141:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:Yij=α+β1Tj1+β2Tj2+β3Tj1∗Tj2+εij(7)
20:613:52367:70:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:19
21:614:52369:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in whichTj1is an indicator for being an in treated group in year 1,Tj12is an indicator for being
21:615:52465:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in a treated group in year 2,  andTj1∗Tj2is an interaction term for being in a group that was
21:616:52558:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treated  in  both  years.   The  sample  is  restricted  to  those  who  were  in  the  study  for  both  years.
21:617:52670:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because of this sample restriction, and because decision to return to the sample from the Year 1

21:619:52866:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is open to endogeneity concerns and therefore should not be interpreted causally.  For the sake of
21:620:52964:22:45:72:431:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transparency, we present it regardless, but with the aforementioned caveat.
21:621:53039:45:34:72:257:532:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4    Individual level results

21:623:53095:29:22:72:540:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Take-up of the loan treatments was quite high.  Of the 954 individuals in the Year 1 treatment
21:624:53189:22:22:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:group, 610 (64%) applied and qualified for the loan. In Year 2, 324 out of the 522 treated individuals
21:625:53291:22:22:72:276:425:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:(62%) qualified for and took up the loan.28
21:626:53334:22:21:88:539:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Unconditional loan sizes in the two treatment groups were 4,817 Ksh and 6,679 Ksh, or about
21:627:53425:21:22:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$57 and $79 USD, respectively.  The average loan sizes conditional on take-up were 7,533 Ksh (or
21:628:53521:22:22:72:539:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about $89 USD) for Year 1 and 10,548 Ksh (or $124) for Year 2.29.  Default rates were extremely
21:629:53616:22:16:72:171:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:low, at less than 2%.
21:630:53637:16:15:80:539:322:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:28Relative to many other credit-market interventions in low-income settings in which documented take-up rates
21:631:53746:15:11:72:540:307:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:range from 2-55% of the surveyed population (Karlan et al., 2010),  the 60-65% take-up rates of our loan product
21:632:53858:11:11:72:540:296:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:were very high.  This is perhaps not surprising given that our loan product was offered as a top-up for individuals
21:633:53973:11:11:72:540:285:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:who were already clients of an MFI. Nevertheless, OAF estimates that about 30% of farmers in a given village in
21:634:54084:11:11:72:539:274:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:our study area enroll in OAF, which implies that even ifnonon-OAF farmers were to adopt the loan if offered it,
21:635:54195:11:7:72:371:263:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:population-wide take-up rates of our loan product would still exceed 15%.
21:636:54268:7:15:80:539:256:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:29Recall in Year 1 there were two versions of the loan, one offered in October and the other in January.  Of the 474
21:637:54384:15:11:72:540:241:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:individuals in the 77 groups assigned to the October loan treatment (T1), 329 (69%) applied and qualified for the
21:638:54497:11:11:72:540:230:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:loan.  For the January loan treatment (T2), 281 out of the 480 (59%) qualified for and took up the loan.  Unconditional
21:639:54616:11:11:72:540:219:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:loan sizes in the two treatment groups were 5,294 Ksh and 4,345 Ksh (or about $62 and $51 USD) for T1 and T2,
21:640:54725:11:11:72:540:208:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:respectively, and we can reject at 99% confidence that the loan sizes were the same between groups.  The average
21:641:54837:11:11:72:540:197:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:loan sizes conditional on take-up were 7,627Ksh (or about $90 USD) for T1 and 7,423Ksh (or $87) for T2, and in
21:642:54947:11:0:72:412:186:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:this case we cannot reject that conditional loan sizes were the same between groups.

22:644:55073:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We begin by estimating treatment effects in the standard fashion,  assuming that there could be
22:645:55168:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:within-randomization-unit  spillovers  (in  our  case,  the  group),  but  that  there  are  no  cross-group
22:646:55276:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spillovers.  In all tables and figures, we report results broken down by each year and pooled.  As
22:647:55374:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explained in Section 3, the Year 2 replication produced results that are quantitatively quite similar
22:648:55475:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  the  Year  1  results  for  most  outcomes,  and  as  such,  we  report  in  the  text  the  pooled  results,
22:649:55588:22:22:72:183:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unless otherwise noted.

22:656:56208:21:22:88:539:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Farmers responded to the intervention as anticipated.  They held significantly more inventories
22:657:56303:22:22:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for much of the year, on average about 25% more than the control group mean (Column 6 in Table
22:658:56397:22:22:72:456:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2).  Inventory effects are remarkably similar across both years of the experiment.
22:659:56479:22:22:88:540:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Net revenues30are significantly lower immediately post harvest and significantly higher later
22:660:56572:22:22:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the year (Column 6 in Table 3).  The middle panel of Figure 5 presents the time trend of net
22:661:56667:22:22:72:540:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue effects,  which suggest that treated farmers purchase more maize in the immediate post-
22:662:56762:22:22:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harvest period, when prices are low (as represented by more negative net revenues November to
22:663:56855:22:22:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:February)  and  sell  more  later  in  the  lean  season,  when  prices  are  high  (as  represented  by  more
22:664:56965:22:22:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:positive revenues May to July).  The net effect on revenues averaged across the year is positive in
22:665:57064:22:22:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:both years of the experiment, and is significant in the Year 2 and the pooled data (see Columns 1,
22:666:57162:22:22:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3, and 5 in Table 3).  Breaking down Year 1 results by the timing of loan suggest that the reason
22:667:57259:22:22:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results in Year 1 are not significant is that the later loan, offered in January to half of the treatment
22:668:57364:22:21:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:group,  was less effective than the October loan.  Table D.1 presents results for the Year 1 loan,
22:669:57462:21:17:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:broken down by loan timing.  We see in Column 5 that the October loan (T1) produced revenue
22:670:57553:17:0:80:403:115:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:30From which loan interest rates were subtracted for those who took out a loan.
23:671:57634:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects that are more similar in magnitude (and now significant, at 5%) to those of the Year 2 loan
23:672:57733:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(which was offered almost at the same time).  The January loan (T2) had no significant effect on
23:673:57829:22:22:72:465:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenues.  Appendix Section D explores the effects of loan timing in greater detail.
23:674:57913:22:22:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The total effect on net revenues across the year can be calculated by adding up the coefficients in
23:675:58012:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Column 6 of Table 3,which yields an estimate of 1,548 Ksh, or about $18 at the prevailing exchange
23:676:58110:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate at the time of the study.  Given the unconditional average loan size of 5,476 Ksh in the pooled
23:677:58210:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data, this is equivalent to a 28% return (net of loan and interest repayment), which we consider
23:678:58306:22:22:72:98:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:large.
23:679:58312:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The final panel of Figure 5 and Table 4 present the consumption effects (as measured by logged
23:680:58406:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total  household  consumption).   While  point  estimates  are  positive  in  both  years,  they  are  not
23:681:58512:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant at traditional confidence levels when pooled (in Year 2, treatment is associated with a 7

23:683:58711:22:21:72:342:445:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:only slightly greater than zero and are not significant).31
23:684:58770:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table  5  presents  effects  on  the  pattern  of  net  sales  (quantity  sold  -  quantity  purchased),  as
23:685:58878:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well as prices paid and received.  We see that in the immediate post-harvest period, net sales are
23:686:58976:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significantly  lower  among  the  treated  group,  as  sales  decrease/purchases  increase.   Later  in  the
23:687:59084:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season, this trend reverses, as net sales significantly expand among the treated.  As a result of this
23:688:59186:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shifted timing of sales and purchases, treated individuals enjoy significantly lower purchase prices
23:689:59286:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(as prices are shifted to earlier in the season, when prices tend to be lower) and receive significantly
23:690:59390:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher sales prices (as sales are shifted to later in the season, when prices tend to be higher).  The
23:691:59492:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total  impact  on  net  sales  is  a  weakly  positive  effect,  which  –  off  of  a  negative  average  net  sales
23:692:59608:22:16:71:374:248:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:amount – means that households are slightly less in deficit.32,33
23:693:59673:16:15:80:539:232:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:31Because the consumption measure includes expenditure on maize, in Appendix E.1 we also estimate effects on
23:694:59781:15:7:72:509:217:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:consumption excluding maize and consumption excluding all food.  Results are similar using these measures.
23:695:59887:7:14:80:540:210:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:32Unlike the impact on net salesper  round, on which we have strong theoretical predictions, the impact on total
23:696:59999:14:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:net  sales  is  ex-ante  ambiguous,  from  a  theoretical  perspective.   In  practice,  the  total  effect  on  net  sales  will  be  a
23:697:60135:11:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:combined response of the increase in purchases in response to lower effective purchase prices and increases in sales
23:698:60251:11:11:72:540:174:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in response to higher effective sales prices.  Valuing the increase in net sales, we estimate that 48% of the increase in
23:699:60372:11:7:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:revenues among treated individuals is driven by an increase in net sales and 52% by a shifting in the timing of sales.
23:700:60490:7:15:80:539:156:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:33From where is the increase in net sales drawn?  We assume net sales = amount harvested - post-harvest losses
23:701:60600:15:11:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:- amount consumed - amount transferred and decompose the treatment effect on each component part.  We see a
23:702:60707:11:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:marginally significant (at 10%) increase in amount that treated households transfer to others by 0.2 bags.  We are
23:703:60821:11:48:72:532:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:unable to identify with precision any effects on the other components of net sales (results available upon request).

24:707:61054:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects on inventories, revenues and log household consumption.  Because the pre-specified specifica-
24:708:61155:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion is an intention-to-treat estimation, we also present a regression of take-up on the standardized
24:709:61256:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variable of heterogeneity.  While we see greater take-up of the loan by impatient households and
24:710:61352:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:households  with  more  school-aged  children,  we  see  no  significant  heterogeneity  in  treatment  ef-
24:711:61459:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fects by these dimensions.  We observe slightly larger treatment effects among wealthy households
24:712:61556:22:22:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(marginally significant for revenue outcomes, but not significant for inventories or consumption).
24:713:61654:22:22:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Interestingly, we see significantly and large increases in the estimated treatment effects for house-
24:714:61755:22:22:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:holds with a larger percentage of early sales at baseline (that is, those who were less likely to store
24:715:61858:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at  baseline).   It  may  be  that  these  households  have  the  greatest  room  for  movement  in  storage

24:717:62071:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenues, treatment appears to cut in half the gap between the baseline storers and non-storers.

24:724:62627:22:22:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and E.4).  We also find no significant effects on schools fees paid (the primary expenditure that
24:725:62724:22:22:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:households  say  constrain  them  to  sell  their  maize  stocks  early;  see  Table  E.7),  nor  do  we  find
24:726:62834:22:22:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant effects on food expenditure (Table E.5).  We do in Year 1 find a significant 0.07 point

25:733:63297:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Up  (LRFU)  survey  conducted  November-December  2015,  which  measures  outcomes  one  to  two
25:734:63393:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:years after completion of the intervention (for the Year 2 and Year 1 loan respectively).  In this
25:735:63491:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:section, we primarily focus on the effects of each year of the study as estimated separately, as these
25:736:63593:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results can be interpreted causally.  For the sake of transparency,  we also present a specification
25:737:63693:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the two treatment years interacted, but with the aforementioned caveats described in Section
25:738:63790:22:22:72:80:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3.
25:739:63792:22:22:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  first  explore  outcomes  for  the  2014  long-rains  harvest,  the  season  immediately  following
25:740:63895:22:22:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the completion of the Year 2 study.  If farmers are able to use revenues from the one- (sometimes
25:741:63992:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two-) time loan to “save their way” out of this credit constraint, we should expect to see sustained
25:742:64092:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shifts in the timing of sales, as well as long-run revenue effects.  However, in Table F.1 we observe
25:743:64193:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:no statistically significant differences in the timing of transactions (neither in terms of the percent
25:744:64296:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of purchases conducted in the low-price harvest season nor the percent of sales conducted in the
25:745:64392:22:22:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high-price lean season).  We also see no statistically significant difference in long-run net revenues
25:746:64494:22:22:72:539:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(though due to the imprecision of these estimates, we cannot rule out large, positive effects).34We
25:747:64593:22:22:71:539:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also see no long-run effect on amount and value sold or purchased (Tables F.2-F.4), though again
25:748:64689:22:22:71:212:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates are relatively noisy.
25:749:64720:22:22:88:539:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We are able to ask more detailed questions about the subsequent season (the 2015 long-rains

25:751:64915:22:16:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recall.   Measuring  impacts  on  input  usage  and  harvest  levels,  we  test  the  hypothesis  that  loan
25:752:65023:16:15:80:539:247:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:34While we see no significant changes in sales timing or revenue in among the pooled treatment group, we see when
25:753:65136:15:11:72:540:232:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:breaking  these  results  down  by  treatment  status  some  interesting  heterogeneity  (see  Table  F.10.   Point  estimates
25:754:65262:11:11:72:540:221:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:suggest  (and  are  significant  in Year  2)  that the  percent sold  in the  lean season  and  the percent  purchased  in the
25:755:65388:11:11:72:540:210:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:harvest season are higher in low-saturation areas.  In high saturation areas, the negative interaction terms cancels
25:756:65504:11:11:72:540:199:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:this effect out (see Table F.10).  This is consistent with the idea that in low intensity areas,  the lack of effect on
25:757:65623:11:10:72:540:188:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:prices means storage is highly profitable, encouraging individuals to purchase more in the post-harvest period and
25:758:65737:10:11:72:540:178:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:sell more in the lean season.  In contrast, in high intensity areas, price effects dampen the returns to arbitrage, and
25:759:65856:11:11:72:540:167:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:there  is  lower  incentive  to  store.   However,  we  see  that  control  individuals  in  high  intensity  areas  may  be  storing
25:760:65989:11:11:72:540:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:more, buying more (significant among Year 2 individuals) in the harvest period, when prices are low.  As a result, we
25:761:66106:11:11:72:540:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:see cannot rule out sizable increases in revenues for control individuals in high-intensity areas; though this effect is

26:766:66507:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:movement on this margin.  We estimate fairly precise null effects on labor inputs, non-labor inputs,
26:767:66607:22:22:72:236:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 2015 long-rains harvest levels.
26:768:66642:22:22:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also explore other outcomes for the 2015 year.  We find no significant effects on a variety
26:769:66736:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  outcomes,  including:  maize  eaten,  food  expenditures,  consumption,  educational  expenditure,
26:770:66838:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school attendance,  non-farm enterprise profits,  hours worked in non-farm enterprises,  and hours
26:771:66936:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:worked in salaried positions (Tables F.6 - F.8).  Point estimates on wages in salaried positions are
26:772:67036:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:positive, but is only significant in Year 2.  Finally, we see slight increases in self-reported happiness,
26:773:67142:22:22:72:278:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but only among the Year 1 treated sample.
26:774:67183:22:22:88:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In summary,  while we cannot rule out potentially large long-run effects on revenues,  we find
26:775:67277:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:no  significant  evidence  that  the  loan  permanently  alters  farmers’  timing  of  sales  or  a  variety  of
26:776:67389:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:other household-level economic outcomes.  Consistent with this, we find no long-run effects on local
26:777:67489:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market prices (though effects are in the same direction as the short-run effects, but are much muted;
26:778:67590:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:see Table F.9).  We therefore find little evidence that a one-time injection of credit can permanently
26:779:67692:22:38:72:341:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ameliorate the underlying constraints limiting arbitrage.

26:782:67878:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the impact of laminated tags that brand the maize as committed to OAF. Estimates are shown in
26:783:67971:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 13.  We find no significant difference in inventories, revenues, or consumption for individuals
26:784:68072:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who receive only the tags (without the loan), and point estimates are small.  Therefore, the tags do
26:785:68172:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not appear to have any effect on storage behavior.  However, this may simply be because tags are
26:786:68268:22:16:72:363:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a weak form of commitment, either to one’s self or to others.
26:787:68329:16:15:80:539:209:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:35This could occur if revenues from the loan relaxed credit constraints that previously restricted farmers’ ability
26:788:68444:15:10:72:540:194:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:to  invest  in  inputs.   Alternatively,  if  the  loan  led  to  long-run  improvements  in  the  price  farmers  receive  for  their
26:789:68578:10:11:72:540:184:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:crops, this increased output price could increase incentives to invest in production-enhancing inputs.  An improved
26:790:68693:11:11:72:540:173:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:price could be attained either in the lean season, if the farmer in question himself stores, or at harvest time, if other
26:791:68814:11:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:farmers are arbitraging and producing lower overall season price fluctuations (though note in Tables F.1 and F.9 we
26:792:68929:11:80:72:358:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:see no evidence of such long-run shifts in either sales timing or prices).

27:796:69155:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:H, we present various estimates suggesting that it would take the farmer 3-6 years to self-finance
27:797:69253:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the loan, if he were to save the full returns from his investment, but 34 years if he saved at a more
27:798:69354:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:standard savings rate of 10%.  Therefore,  low savings rates are important to understanding why
27:799:69449:22:22:72:506:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit constraints persist in the presence of high return, divisible investment opportunities.
27:800:69543:22:22:88:539:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In order to test the importance of savings constraints, we examine the impact of the lockbox,
27:801:69636:22:22:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as well as its interaction with the loan.  Table H.1 presents these results.  We observe no significant
27:802:69739:22:22:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects of the lockbox on inventories, revenues, or consumption in the overall sample.  Interestingly,
27:803:69841:22:22:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when interacted with the loan, we see that receiving the lockbox alone is associated with significantly
27:804:69944:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f3:lowerinventories; perhaps the lockbox serves as a substitute savings mechanism, rather than grain.
27:805:70042:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However,  receiving  both  the  lockbox  and  the  loan  is  associated  with  a  reversal  of  this  pattern.
27:806:70152:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We see no such heterogeneity on revenues.  Interestingly, the point estimates on consumption are
27:807:70248:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative (though not significant) for the lockbox and loan when received separately; however, the
27:808:70345:22:46:72:471:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interaction of the two is positive (and significant, at 95%), canceling out this effect.
27:809:70433:46:33:72:287:349:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:5    General equilibrium effects
27:810:70465:33:22:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because the loan resulted in greater storage, which shifted supply across time, and given the high
27:811:70563:22:21:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transport costs common in the region, we might expect this intervention to affect the trajectory
27:812:70659:21:22:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of local market prices.  By shifting sales out of a relative period of abundance, we would expect
27:813:70756:22:22:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the loan to result in higher prices immediately following harvest.  Conversely, by shifting sales into
27:814:70858:22:22:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a period of relative scarcity,  we would expect the loan to result in lower prices later in the lean
27:815:70958:22:22:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season.  Note, however, that these effects will only be discernible if (1) the treatment generates a
27:816:71058:22:22:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantial shock to the local supply of maize; and (2) local markets are somewhat isolated, such
27:817:71155:22:92:72:385:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that local prices are at least partially determined by local supply.

28:820:71252:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To understand the effect of our loan intervention on local maize prices, we identified 52 local market
28:821:71354:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:points spread throughout our study area where OAF staff indicated their clients typically bought
28:822:71450:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and sold maize,  and our enumerators tracked monthly maize prices at these market points.  We
28:823:71543:22:22:72:431:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then match these market points to the OAF sublocation in which they fall.
28:824:71616:22:22:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A  note  on  the  matching  process:  “sublocation”  is  an  OAF  administrative  unit  that  is  well-
28:825:71719:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:defined in terms of client composition (i.e.  OAF divides its farmer groups into sublocations based
28:826:71818:22:22:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on geographic proximity), but which is less well-defined in terms of precise geographic boundaries
28:827:71916:22:22:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(that is,  no shape file of sublocations exists).  Given this,  we use GPS data on both the market
28:828:72014:22:22:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:location and the location of farmers in our study sample to calculate the “most likely” sublocation,
28:829:72114:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:based on the designated sublocation to which the modal study farmer falling within a 3km radius
28:830:72209:22:22:72:539:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:belongs.36This  procedure,  include  the  radius  to  be  used,  was  pre-specified.   As  was  also  pre-
28:831:72315:22:21:71:383:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specified, we test robustness to alternative radii of 1km and 5km.
28:832:72381:21:22:88:539:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We then utilize the sublocation-level randomization in treatment intensity to identify market-

28:835:72674:22:22:71:539:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In each year, we explore the price changes from the period following loan disbursal (November in

28:837:72867:22:22:71:539:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In  Figure  6,  which  presents  the  pooled  data,  we  see  prices  in  high-intensity  markets  on  average
28:838:72977:22:22:71:539:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:start out almost 4% higher in the immediate post-harvest months.  As the season progresses, prices
28:839:73075:22:22:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in high-density markets begin to converge and then dip below those low-density markets, ending
28:840:73169:22:22:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:almost  2%  lower  in  high-density  areas  compared  to  low-density.   Table  6  presents  these  results
28:841:73276:22:22:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:according to the empirical specifically outlined in Section 3.  In line with the graphic results visible
28:842:73380:22:22:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Figure 6, here we see the interaction term on “Hi” treatment intensity is positive (and significant
28:843:73482:22:22:71:539:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at 5%), while the interaction term between the monthly time trend and the high intensity dummy
28:844:73576:22:16:71:539:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is negative (though not significant).  Columns 4-5 display robustness to alternative radii; we find
28:845:73675:16:15:80:539:137:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:36Because we draw twice the sample from high-intensity areas compared to low (in accordance with our randomized
28:846:73786:15:11:72:540:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:intensity), we weight the low-intensity observations by two to generate a pool reflective of the true underlying OAF
28:847:73902:11:0:72:356:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:population.  From this pool, we identify the modal farmer sublocation.
29:848:73974:0:22:72:184:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similar point estimates.

29:850:74103:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results presented above.  Price effects are most pronounced (and statistically significant) early on
29:851:74203:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the season.  This is when we observe the largest and most concentrated shock to the supply on
29:852:74299:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the market (note in Table 2 that the greatest shift in inventories is seen in Round 1).  Sensibly,
29:853:74397:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment effects are most concentrated around the time of the loan disbursal, which represents a
29:854:74494:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:common shock affecting all those taking out the loan; this produces a simultaneous inward shift in
29:855:74592:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply in the post-harvest period.  In contrast, the release of this grain onto the market in the lean
29:856:74694:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period appears to happen with more diffuse timing among those the treatment group (as can be
29:857:74786:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seen in Figure 5, in which we note a gradual reduction in the treatment-control gap in inventories,
29:858:74885:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rather  than  the  sharp  drop  we  would  expect  if  all  treated  individuals  sold  at  the  same  time).
29:859:74994:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Anecdotally, farmers report that the timing of sales is often driven by idiosyncratic shocks to the
29:860:75093:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household’s need for cash, such as the illness of a family member, which may explain the observed
29:861:75190:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity  in  timing  in  which  the  treatment  group  releases  its  stores.   Perhaps  as  a  result  of
29:862:75302:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these more diffuse treatment effects in the lean season, price effects are smaller and measured with
29:863:75402:22:22:72:322:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:larger standard errors in the second half of the year.
29:864:75456:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Are the size of these observed price effects plausible?  A back-the-envelope calibration exercise
29:865:75553:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggests yes.  OAF works with about 30% of farmers in the region.  Of these farmers, 80% were
29:866:75646:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enrolled in the study in high density areas, while 40% were enrolled in low-density areas.  About
29:867:75743:22:22:72:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:58%  of  those  enrolled  received  the  loan  offer37Together,  this  implies  that  about  14%  of  the
29:868:75848:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:population was offered treatment in high-intensity sublocations and 7% in low-intensity areas, such
29:869:75947:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that the treatment was offered to 7 percentage points more of the population in high-density areas.
29:870:76046:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 2 suggests that treated individuals experienced average increases in inventory (i.e.  inward
29:871:76144:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply shifts) of 24.5%.  Taken together, this suggests a contraction in total quantity available in
29:872:76244:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the high-density markets by 1.7%.  Experiments conducted in the same region in Kenya suggest
29:873:76336:22:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an average demand elasticity of -1.1 (Bergquist, 2017).  This would imply that we should expect
29:874:76431:16:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:37In Year 1, 66% of the sample received the loan offer (1/3 received the offer in October, 1/3 received the loan offer
29:875:76549:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in January, and 1/3 served as control).  In Year 2, 50% of the sample received the loan offer (1/2 received the offer
29:876:76666:11:47:72:522:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in November and 1/2 served as control).  In this calibration exercise, we use the average of the two years’ rates.
29:877:76780:47:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:28
30:878:76782:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  see  an  overall  price  increase  of  1.5%.   In  the  period  immediately  following  harvest,  when  the
30:879:76893:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inventory effects are most concentrated – during which time inventories are 47.7% higher among
30:880:76987:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment individuals – we see an inward supply shift of 3.3%, and should therefore expect to see
30:881:77084:22:22:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a 3.0% increase in price.38This is quite close to what we observe in Figure 6.  We see a jump in
30:882:77180:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:price of about 2.5% during this period,39which then peters out to a slightly negative (though not
30:883:77277:22:38:71:301:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant) effect towards the end of the season.
30:884:77327:38:29:71:210:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.2    Robustness checks
30:885:77351:29:22:71:539:532:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We check the robustness of the regression results to functional form assumptions.  Table I.1 presents
30:886:77452:22:22:71:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a  binary  version  of  Equation  4,  replacingmonthtwith  an  indicatorleantfor  being  in  the  lean
30:887:77554:22:22:71:539:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season (defined as April-August) and the interaction term withleant∗Hs.  Results suggest similar
30:888:77650:22:22:71:539:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant increases in price post-harvest in high-intensity markets.  The lean season interaction
30:889:77749:22:21:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:term suggests that prices in high-intensity markets are lower overall in the lean season, although
30:890:77847:21:22:71:539:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  point  estimate  on  the  interaction  term  is  only  slightly  larger  in  absolute  value  than  the  the
30:891:77960:22:22:71:539:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mainHstreatment coefficient, such that the combined effect of treatment in the lean season is to
30:892:78056:22:22:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lower prices in high-intensity markets only slightly below those in low-intensity overall.  Comparing
30:893:78157:22:22:71:539:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these effects to Figure 6, we observe this is because at the beginning of the lean season prices are
30:894:78257:22:22:71:539:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:still higher in high intensity markets, with a cross-over mid-lean season as prices in high-intensity
30:895:78358:22:22:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:markets drop below those low-intensity markets.  However, the 1km and 5km specifications shown
30:896:78452:22:22:71:539:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the right panel in Figure 6 shows suggest that this crossover occurs closer to the transition from
30:897:78553:22:22:71:539:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  harvest  to  lean  season;  therefore  the  1km  and  5km  specification  of  the  binary  specification,
30:898:78663:22:22:71:539:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shown in Columns 4-5 of Table I.1, estimate a more substantial decrease in price for the full lean
30:899:78761:22:22:71:104:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season.
30:900:78768:22:14:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  also  check  the  robustness  of  these  results  to  a  more  continuous  measure  of  treatment  at
30:901:78873:14:14:80:539:189:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:38Note this exercise assumes no trade across sublocations.  On the opposite extreme, the case of perfect market
30:902:78984:14:11:72:540:175:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:integration with zero transaction costs would imply perfect smoothing of any localized supply shock, and we would
30:903:79097:11:11:72:540:164:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:therefore  observe  no  change  in  price.   We  therefore  view  the  range  of  0-3%  as  the  extreme  bounds  of  what  price
30:904:79226:11:7:72:222:153:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:changes we should expect to observe.
30:905:79262:7:15:80:539:146:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:39We  measure  shifts  in  post-harvest  inventories  in  Round  1  of  the  survey,  which  conducted  roughly  January-
30:906:79383:15:11:72:540:131:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:February for the average respondent.  We therefore estimate the change in price change in January-February from
30:907:79494:11:0:72:234:120:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Table 6 to be 3.97 + 2.5∗(−0.57) = 2.5.
31:908:79535:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the market-level,  following the technique described in Miguel and Kremer (2004).  We construct
31:909:79630:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an estimate of the ratio of total treated farmers to the total farmers in our sample within a 3km
31:910:79727:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:radius  around  each  market.40We  re-estimate  an  equation  identical  to  Equation  4  withHsre-
31:911:79826:22:22:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:placed withratiom, the aforementioned ratio.  Results are presented in Table I.2.  We also present
31:912:79924:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-parametric estimates of this specification in Figure I.1,  displaying average prices in markets
31:913:80023:22:22:71:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with above- vs.  below-median ratios.  While results are somewhat less precisely estimated in this
31:914:80121:22:22:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specification,  the broad patterns remain consistent:  prices are higher in the post-harvest period
31:915:80220:22:22:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and lower in the lean period in markets with a greater proportion of treated individuals in the area.
31:916:80321:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also check robustness to small cluster standard error adjustments.  These market-level price
31:917:80416:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results rely on the treatment saturation randomization being conducted at the sublocation level (a
31:918:80514:22:22:71:539:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher level than the group-level randomization employed in the individual-level results).  While
31:919:80611:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we  cluster  standard  errors  at  the  sublocation  level,41one  might  be  concerned  due  to  the  small
31:920:80718:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of sublocations – of which we have 17 – that asymptotic properties may not apply to our
31:921:80812:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market-level analyses and that our standard errors may therefore be understated.  We run several
31:922:80908:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:robustness checks to address these small sample concerns.  In Appendix I, we use a nonparametric
31:923:81004:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:randomization inference approach employed by Bloom et al. (2013) and Cohen and Dupas (2010) to
31:924:81098:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:draw causal inferences in the presence of small samples.  Results using these alternative approaches
31:925:81198:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are broadly consistent with those from the primary specifications.  We also check the robustness of
31:926:81297:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our results by conducting the wild bootstrap procedure proposed by Cameron et al. (2008).  While
31:927:81393:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we do see some decrease in statistical precision,  these adjustments are small.  Finally,  to ensure
31:928:81493:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that results are not sensitive to a single outlier sublocation, we drop each sublocation one-by-one
31:929:81592:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  re-run  our  analysis;  the  pattern  observed  in  the  full  data  is  generally  robust  to  this  outlier
31:930:81706:22:16:71:281:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:analysis.  See Appendix I for further details.
31:931:81752:16:14:80:539:210:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:40Because we draw twice the sample from high-intensity areas compared to low (in accordance with our randomized
31:932:81863:14:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:intensity), for the total farmer count, we weight the low-intensity observations by two to generate a count reflective
31:933:81981:11:8:72:232:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of the true underlying OAF population.
31:934:82019:8:14:80:539:177:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:41For all analyses in this paper, we cluster our standard errors at the level of randomization.  For the individual
31:935:82134:14:11:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:results shown in Section 4, this is at the group level.  For the results presented in this section, which relying on the
31:936:82254:11:0:72:378:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:sublocation-level randomized saturation, we cluster at the sublocation level.
32:937:82333:0:29:72:211:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.3    Related Outcomes
32:938:82356:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also check whether treatment intensity affected other outcomes of interest related to market
32:939:82451:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:price.  First, we check whether treatment effects can be seen in farmgate prices (see Table I.5).  We
32:940:82552:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:see similar patterns in these prices as well.  We also explore whether trader movement responds
32:941:82647:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to treatment.  We see some evidence that fewer traders enter high-intensity treated markets in the
32:942:82745:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:immediate post-harvest period in Year 2 (see Table I.6), a sensible demand response to the increase
32:943:82844:22:45:72:415:570:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:in price observed during a time when traders are typically purchasing.42
32:944:82916:45:33:72:327:525:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6    Individual results with spillovers
32:945:82955:33:22:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Mass storage appears to raise prices at harvest time and lower price in the lean season,  thereby
32:946:83052:22:22:72:540:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:smoothing out seasonal price fluctuations.  What effect does this have on the individual profitability
32:947:83154:22:22:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the loan, which is designed to help farmers to take advantage of these price variations?  That is,
32:948:83255:22:22:72:493:426:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:how do the individual-level returns to arbitrage vary with the number of arbitrageurs?43
32:949:83343:22:22:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To  answer  this  question,  we  revisit  the  individual  results,  re-estimating  them  to  account  for
32:950:83449:22:22:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the variation in treatment density across sublocations.  Table 7 and Figure 7 display how our main
32:951:83547:22:22:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outcomes  respond  in  high  versus  low  density  areas  for  treated  and  control  individuals.   We  find
32:952:83656:22:22:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that inventory treatment effects do not significantly differ as a function of treatment intensity for
32:953:83757:22:22:72:176:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the pooled treatment.
32:954:83778:22:21:88:539:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Effects on net revenues, however, paint a different picture.  Treatment effects in low-intensity
32:955:83874:21:22:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:areas  are  much  larger  –  roughly  double  —  those  estimated  in  the  pooled  specification.   This  is
32:956:83983:22:22:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because most of the revenue effects seen in the pooled specification are concentrated among treated
32:957:84082:22:16:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals  in  low-intensity  sublocations.   In  contrast,  revenue  effects  for  treated  individuals  in
32:958:84192:16:15:80:540:213:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:42This, along with the overall weaker treatment intensity in Year 2, may contribute to the smaller price effects
32:959:84304:15:11:72:540:198:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:observed in Year 2.  In terms of weaker treatment intensity, note that the sample size in Year 2 is only about 65% that
32:960:84423:11:11:72:540:187:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of Year 1.  As a result, the intensity in Year 2 is only about 65% what it was in Year 1.  Note that the point estimate
32:961:84542:11:11:72:540:176:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:on “Hi” in column 2 (Y2) of Table 6 is almost exactly 65% of the coefficient on column 1 (Y1).  The coefficient on
32:962:84656:11:7:72:522:165:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:“Hi Intensity * Month” in column 2 (Y2) is close to (a bit more than) 65% of the coefficient on column 1 (Y1).
32:963:84766:7:15:80:539:158:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:43Local market effects may not be the only channel through which treatment density affected individual-level results.
32:964:84883:15:11:72:540:143:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:For example, sharing of maize or informal lending between households could also be affected by the density of loan
32:965:84997:11:11:72:540:132:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:recipients.  Appendix K explores these alternative channels and presents evidence suggesting that the individual-level
32:966:85115:11:11:72:540:121:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:spillover results are most consistent with spillovers through effects on local markets.  However, we cannot rule out
32:967:85231:11:39:72:253:110:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:that other mechanisms could also be at play.
32:968:85275:39:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:31
33:969:85277:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high-intensity sublocations are substantially lower (and, in fact, are statistically indistinguishable
33:970:85379:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from zero in the pooled results presented Column 6 of Table 7).44,45Therefore, while individuals
33:971:85475:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in both high and low-intensity sublocations store significantly more as a result of treatment, only
33:972:85574:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treated individuals in low-intensity sublocations earn significantly higher revenues.  As with earlier
33:973:85676:22:22:72:461:621:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:estimates, estimates for consumption remain relatively imprecisely estimated.46,47
33:974:85758:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Why might loan profitability be lower in high treatment density areas?  Intuitively, arbitrage
33:975:85852:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:– the exploitation of price differentials – is most profitable to an individual when she is the only
33:976:85952:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:one arbitraging.  As others begin to arbitrage as well, general equilibrium effects drive down these
33:977:86052:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:differentials and therefore diminish the direct returns to arbitrage.  Conversely, for those who do
33:978:86151:22:22:72:539:511:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f3:notengage  in  arbitrage,  these  spillovers  may  be  positive.   Though  the  timing  of  their  sales  will
33:979:86261:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not change, they may benefit from relatively higher sale prices at harvest-time and relatively lower
33:980:86361:22:22:72:258:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:purchase prices during the lean season.
33:981:86400:22:21:88:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  see  some  evidence  of  these  positive  spillovers  to  control  group  revenues  in  high-intensity
33:982:86506:21:22:72:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment  areas  (see  middle  panel  of  Figure  7  and  the  estimate  on  theHidummy  in  Column
33:983:86606:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:6  of  Table  7).   However,  it  should  be  noted  that  this  effect  is  measured  with  considerable  noise
33:984:86718:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and and thus remains more speculative.48Given the diffuse nature of spillover effects, it is perhaps
33:985:86818:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unsurprising that identifying these small effects with statistical precision is challenging.49However,
33:986:86920:22:16:71:518:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they are suggestive of important distributional dynamics for welfare, which we explore below.
33:987:87013:16:15:80:540:320:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:44Table 7 displays “p-val T+TH=0,” which indicates the joint significance ofβ1+β3from Equation 5; this represents
33:988:87126:15:7:71:363:305:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the full effect of treatment for individuals in high-intensity sublocations.
33:989:87202:7:15:80:539:298:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:45While the interaction term “Treat*Hi” is only significant at traditional levels in Year 1,  we attribute at least
33:990:87317:15:11:71:539:283:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:some of the weakened Year 2 interaction term to the lower treatment intensity in Year 2.  Recall that the sample size
33:991:87434:11:11:71:539:272:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in Year 2 is only about 65% that of Year 1.  As a result, the intensity in Year 2 is only about 65% what it was in
33:992:87548:11:11:71:539:261:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Year 1.  If we scale the coefficient on “Treat*Hi” in Year 2 (column 2) to account for this difference (i.e.  divide by
33:993:87667:11:11:71:539:250:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:0.65), we get an estimate much closer to the Year 1 estimate.  In addition, any trader movement that dampened Year
33:994:87781:11:7:71:393:239:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:2 market-level effects may have further contributed to this weaker Year 2 effect.
33:995:87862:7:15:80:539:232:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:46Interestingly, they are strongly positive for treated individuals in the high-intensity areas in Year 2.  However,
33:996:87978:15:7:71:498:217:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:because there is no clear pattern across years, we avoid speculating or over-interpreting this fragile result.
33:997:88088:7:14:80:539:210:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:47Because the consumption measure includes expenditure on maize, in Appendix E.1 we also estimate effects on
33:998:88196:14:8:71:508:196:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:consumption excluding maize and consumption excluding all food.  Results are similar using these measures.
33:999:88302:8:11:80:463:188:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:48And even goes in the opposite direction in the Year 2 results alone; see Column 5 of Table 7.
33:1000:88397:11:14:80:539:177:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:49Simple power calculations suggest that if the point estimate of 165 is the true effect, a sample size of 218,668 –
33:1001:88513:14:92:71:503:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:more than 32 times our current sample size – would be necessary to detect this effect with 95% confidence.

34:1003:88621:0:29:72:164:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:6.1    Discussion
34:1004:88638:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  randomized  saturation  design  allows  us  to  capture  how  both  direct  and  indirect  treatment
34:1005:88743:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects  vary  with  saturation  level.   Table  8  breaks  down  the  distribution  of  welfare  gains  from
34:1006:88852:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the loan, based on saturation rate and revenue effects drawn from the pooled results.  While this
34:1007:88949:22:22:72:539:614:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:exercise takes all point estimates as given, note that some are less precisely measured than others.50
34:1008:89051:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As a result, there are likely large standard errors around some of the figures presented in Table 8.
34:1009:89151:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This exercise should therefore be interpreted as an illustration of how general equilibrium effects
34:1010:89250:22:22:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can  shape  the  distribution  of  welfare  gains  in  isolated  markets,  rather  than  precise  quantitative
34:1011:89360:22:22:72:119:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates.
34:1012:89370:22:22:88:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the first row, we present the direct gains per household, representing the increase in revenues
34:1013:89468:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:driven  by  treatment  for  those  who  are  treated  (specifically  calculated  as  the  coefficient  on  the
34:1014:89578:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“Treat”  dummy  in  low  saturation  areas  and  as  the  coefficient  on  the  “Treat”  dummy  plus  the
34:1015:89683:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient on the “Treat*Hi” interaction term in high saturation areas).  As discussed above, we
34:1016:89780:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:see  that  the  direct  treatment  effects  are  greater  for  those  in  low  saturation  sublocations,  where
34:1017:89891:22:22:72:532:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treated individuals are closer to “being the only one arbitraging,” than in high saturation areas.
34:1018:89989:22:22:88:539:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  second  row  presents  the  indirect  gains  per  household.   This  is  estimated  as  zero  in  low
34:1019:90095:22:22:72:539:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:saturation areas and as the coefficient on “Hi” in high saturation areas.51We see in row 3 that, in
34:1020:90194:22:22:71:539:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the high saturation areas, the indirect gains are 58% the size of the direct gains.  When we account
34:1021:90294:22:22:71:539:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for  the  much  larger  size  of  the  total  population  relative  to  that  of  just  the  direct  beneficiaries
34:1022:90408:22:22:71:539:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(presented in rows 5 and 4 respectively), we find that the total size of the indirect gains swamp
34:1023:90505:22:22:71:434:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that of the direct gains in high saturation areas (rows 7 and 6 respectively).
34:1024:90583:22:22:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These findings have two implications.  First, the total gains from the intervention (presented in
34:1025:90680:22:22:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:row 7) are much higher in high saturation areas than they are in low saturation areas.  While the
34:1026:90777:22:22:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:direct gains to the treatment group are lower in areas of high saturation, the small per-household
34:1027:90875:22:22:71:539:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indirect gains observed in these areas accrue to a large number of untreated individuals, resulting
34:1028:90974:22:15:71:539:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in an overall increase in total gains (note that although there is a large degree of imprecision in our
34:1029:91077:15:15:80:539:138:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:50For  example,  the  point  estimate  on  “Treat*Hi”  is  not  quite  significant  at  traditional  levels,  while  the  point
34:1030:91204:15:7:72:260:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:estimate on “Hi” is measured with large noise.
34:1031:91250:7:15:80:539:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:51Though note that low-intensity treatment areas may also experience GE effects which we are unable to detect.
34:1032:91360:15:0:72:442:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:We are only able to detectrelativedifferences in prices across low- and high-intensity areas.
35:1033:91455:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate of the indirect gains, the qualitative result that higher saturation produces larger gains
35:1034:91554:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:than low saturation holds even at indirect gains as low as 38Ksh/individual, less than $0.5 USD).52
35:1035:91653:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:High saturation offers greater relaxation of a barrier to intertemporal trade (credit constraints) and
35:1036:91755:22:22:72:265:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thereby produces larger aggregate gains.
35:1037:91795:22:22:88:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, the distribution of gains shifts in the presence of general equilibrium effects.  While in
35:1038:91893:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:low saturation areas all of the gains appear to come from direct gains,  in high saturation areas,
35:1039:91991:22:22:72:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:81%  of  the  total  gains  are  indirect  gains  (row  9).53General  equilibrium  effects  therefore  more
35:1040:92098:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evenly  distribute  gains  across  the  entire  population,  reducing  the  proportion  of  the  gains  that
35:1041:92206:22:22:72:521:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:direct beneficiaries exclusively receive and increasing the share enjoyed by the full population.
35:1042:92303:22:22:88:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This redistribution of gains has implications for private sector investment in arbitrage.  Row 10
35:1043:92400:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:presents the per-household private gains accruing to arbitragers, as estimated by the coefficient on
35:1044:92500:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the “Treat” indicator in low saturation areas and by the coefficient on the “Treat” dummy plus
35:1045:92594:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the coefficient on the “Treat*Hi” interaction term plus the coefficient on the “Hi” interaction term
35:1046:92694:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in high saturation areas.  This represents the per-household gains accruing to treated farmers in
35:1047:92791:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our sample, under each level of saturation.  It also represents the most that private sector banks
35:1048:92889:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or other financial institutions could hope to extract from each farmer to whom they might provide
35:1049:92986:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loans for storage.  Row 11 presents the total private gains, multiplying the per-household gains by
35:1050:93085:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the number of treated individuals.  Despite the fact that high saturation areas have two times the
35:1051:93183:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of treated farmers, the total private gains are still lower in these areas compared to low
35:1052:93280:22:22:72:152:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:saturation areas.
35:1053:93297:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These  calculations  suggest  that  private  sector  financial  institutions  may  face  incentives  that
35:1054:93402:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:result  in  the  under-provision  of  finance  for  arbitrage.   Although  overall  social  gains  are  higher
35:1055:93512:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at  greater  levels  of  saturation  (row  8),  because  much  of  these  gains  are  indirect,  private  sector
35:1056:93624:22:16:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:institutions will not be able to capture them.  For private sector institutions, the available gains
35:1057:93724:16:14:80:539:188:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:52Also contributing is the fact that although the direct benefits/household are only a quarter of the size in high
35:1058:93838:14:8:72:528:174:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:areas, there are twice the number of beneficiaries, which makes up some of the gap in terms of total direct gains.
35:1059:93952:8:14:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:53It  is  possible  that  there  are  general  equilibrium  effects  –  and  therefore  indirect  gains  –  occurring  in  the  low
35:1060:94083:14:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:saturation areas that we simply cannot detect in the absence of a pure control group.  If this is the case, it would
35:1061:94199:11:11:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:mean that our current estimates underestimate the total gains, as well as the percentage of gains coming from indirect
35:1062:94317:11:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:gains, in low saturation areas.  However, it would also mean that we are underestimating these figures in the high
35:1063:94431:11:0:72:163:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:intensity areas as well.
36:1064:94457:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for capture are actually lower at high levels of saturation (row 11).  Row 12 attempts to quantify
36:1065:94555:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this disincentive.  At low levels of saturation, private sector institutions could fully internalize all
36:1066:94659:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gains,  capturing up to 100% of the total revenue increases generated by the product (under our
36:1067:94754:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption of no indirect gains in the low saturation case).  However, at high saturation rates, only
36:1068:94855:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:31% of the total gains are private.  Financial institutions therefore will fail to internalize 69% of
36:1069:94956:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the gains at these higher saturation levels, which will likely result in under-provision of financial
36:1070:95057:22:45:72:305:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:products, compared to the socially optimal level.
36:1071:95106:45:33:72:173:532:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:7    Conclusion
36:1072:95121:33:22:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Large  and  regular  increases  in  the  price  of  maize  between  the  harvest  and  the  lean  season  offer
36:1073:95232:22:22:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:farmers substantial arbitrage opportunities.  However, smallholder farmers appear unable to arbi-
36:1074:95329:22:22:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trage these price fluctuations due to high harvest-time expenditure needs and an inability to access
36:1075:95429:22:22:72:367:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit markets, necessitating high harvest-time sales of maize.
36:1076:95492:22:22:88:539:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We study the effect of offering Kenyan maize farmers access to a loan during the harvest period.
36:1077:95588:22:22:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We find that access to this perhaps counter-intuitively timed credit “frees up” farmers to use storage
36:1078:95690:22:22:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to arbitrage these price movements. Farmers offered the loan shift maize purchases into the period of
36:1079:95791:22:22:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:low prices, put more maize in storage, and sell maize at higher prices later in the season, increasing
36:1080:95893:22:21:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:farm revenue.  Using experimentally-induced variation in the density of treatment farmers across
36:1081:95989:21:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:locations,  we  document  that  this  change  in  storage  and  marketing  behavior  aggregated  across
36:1082:96092:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment  farmers  also  affects  local  maize  prices:  post  harvest  prices  are  significantly  higher  in
36:1083:96203:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high-density areas, consistent with more supply having been taken off the market in that period,
36:1084:96299:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and are lower later in the season (though not significantly so).  These general equilibrium effects
36:1085:96398:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:feed back to our profitability estimates, with treatment farmers in low-density areas – where price
36:1086:96497:22:22:72:508:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:differentials were higher and thus arbitrage opportunities greater – differentially benefiting.
36:1087:96592:22:22:88:539:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The findings make a number of contributions.  First, our results are among the few experimental
36:1088:96687:22:22:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results  to  find  a  positive  and  significant  effect  of  microcredit  on  the  profits  of  microenterprises
36:1089:96800:22:22:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(farms in our case).  This is also to our knowledge one of the first experimental studies to directly
36:1090:96901:22:33:72:540:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:account for general equilibrium effects in this literature.  At least in our particular setting, failing to
36:1091:97008:33:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:35
37:1092:97010:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:account for these GE effects substantially alters the conclusions drawn about the average benefits
37:1093:97108:22:22:72:195:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of improved credit access.
37:1094:97134:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This  has  methodological  implications  for  a  broader  set  of  interventions  that  may  shift  local
37:1095:97239:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply  –  such  as  agricultural  technologies  that  increase  local  food  supply  or  vocational  training
37:1096:97349:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:programs  that  increase  local  skilled  labor  supply  –  in  the  presence  of  thin  or  imperfectly  inte-
37:1097:97460:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:grated markets.  Our results suggest that, when implemented in rural or fragmented markets, these
37:1098:97557:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interventions  may  lead  local  prices  to  respond  substantially  enough  to  alter  the  profitability  of
37:1099:97667:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these interventions for direct beneficiaries and to impact the welfare of non-beneficiaries.  Explicit
37:1100:97769:22:22:72:378:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attention to GE effects in future evaluations is likely warranted.
37:1101:97835:22:22:88:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally,  we show how the absence of financial intermediation can be doubly painful for poor
37:1102:97927:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:households in rural areas.  Lack of access to formal credit causes households to turn to much more
37:1103:98025:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expensive  ways  of  moving  consumption  around  in  time,  and  aggregated  across  households  this
37:1104:98127:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:behavior generates a large scale price phenomenon that further lowers farm income and increases
37:1105:98222:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:what most households must pay for food.  The results suggest that expanding access to affordable
37:1106:98318:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit  could  reduce  this  price  variability  and  thus  have  benefits  for  recipient  and  non-recipient
37:1107:98428:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:households alike.  Welfare estimates in our setting suggest that a large portion of the benefits of
37:1108:98527:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expanded loan access could accrue indirectly to non-borrowers.  Under such a distribution of welfare
37:1109:98627:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gains, private sector financial institutions may undersupply credit relative to the social optimum,
37:1110:98726:22:22:72:453:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:raising the possibility that public credit programs could raise aggregate welfare.
37:1111:98808:22:22:88:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:What our results do not address is why wealthy local actors – e.g.  large-scale private traders
37:1112:98903:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:– have not stepped in to bid away these arbitrage opportunities.  Traders do exist in the area and
37:1113:99001:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can commonly be found in local markets.  In a panel survey of local traders in the area, we record
37:1114:99099:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data on the timing of their marketing activities and storage behavior.  But we find little evidence
37:1115:99198:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of long-run storage.  When asked to explain this limited storage, many traders report being able to
37:1116:99297:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:make even higher total profits by engaging in spatial arbitrage across markets (relative to temporal
37:1117:99397:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:arbitrage).  Nevertheless, this does not explain why the scale or number of traders engaging in both
37:1118:99497:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spatial and intertemporal arbitrage has not expanded; imperfect competition among traders may
37:1119:99590:22:46:72:212:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:play a role (Bergquist, 2017).
