2:24:1166:28:30:273:338:610:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:ABSTRACT
2:25:1174:30:24:72:540:580:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:We  relate  the  degree  of  investor  portfolio  focus  to  the  broader  urban  economic  context  of  the
2:26:1282:24:24:71:539:556:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:household. Using a detailed panel of investors in Sweden over the period 1995 to 2000, we find that
2:27:1381:24:24:72:540:532:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:the level of investor diversification, as measured by number of stocks in the portfolio and by the
2:28:1479:24:24:72:540:508:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:average correlation among holdings, is partially explained by city industrial characteristics. We find
2:29:1581:24:24:72:540:484:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:that rural portfolios are more diversified than urban portfolios and that portfolio diversification is
2:30:1683:24:24:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:characterized by factors associated with urban growth. We consider a number of theories to explain
2:31:1781:24:27:72:540:436:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:investor focus, including behavioral biases, real and perceived informational advantage, local social
2:32:1882:27:28:72:540:409:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:competition and hedging of non-tradable risk. We find little evidence to support social and hedging
2:33:1981:28:28:72:540:381:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:motives to explain the lack of portfolio diversification, and some evidence in favor of perceived
2:34:2078:28:28:72:540:353:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:informational advantage in an urban setting. We attribute this evidence as support for the broader
2:35:2176:28:27:72:540:325:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:F:"knowledge-spillover" processes documented in the recent urban economics literature. Portfolio
2:36:2270:27:33:72:457:298:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:effects may be added to the list of factors that define and differentiate urbanism.

3:49:2551:21:20:108:111:688:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
3:50:2551:20:21:108:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:Urban economics in recent years has taught us a lot about the economic function of cities, 
3:51:2642:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:from  their  special  capacity  as  engines  of  enterprise,  to  the  role  they  play  in  stimulating  the  
3:52:2753:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:acquisition  of  labor  skills  and  knowledge.  For  example,  by  bringing  firms  from  a  variety  of  
3:53:2860:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:industries  together  in a  single  location,  cities  present  a  wider  array  of  opportunities  for 
3:54:2964:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:employment,  even  while  attracting  a  motivated  labor  force  to  compete  for  these  jobs.      By  the  
3:55:3075:21:21:72:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:same  token,  by  bringing  firms  within  a  single  industry  together,  cites  have  been  shown  to  
3:56:3180:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:compound the potential for technological development.  Papers over the past decade by Edward 
3:57:3272:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:Glaeser and co-authors in particular have explored the role that geographical concentration plays 
3:58:3370:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  innovation  and  the  transfer  of  knowledge.2    Testing  whether  industrial  concentration  or  
3:59:3474:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  are  determinants  of  economic  growth,  these  papers  emphasize  the  benefits  of  
3:60:3578:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:knowledge  spillover  in  an  urban  setting  and  the  role  of  density  in  skill  development.  For  
3:61:3683:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:example,  Glaeser  et  al.  (1992)  show  that  industrial  competition  rather  than  concentration  is  a  
3:62:3792:20:21:72:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:determining  factor  in  growth,  and  Glaeser  and  Maré (2001) find empirical evidence suggesting 
3:63:3891:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:that    the  development  of  human  capital  within  cities  is  the  major  vector  of    growth.    Taken  
3:64:4001:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:together,  this  work  and  the  work  of  others  in  the  field  suggest  that  skill  development  and  
3:65:4108:21:21:72:396:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:knowledge transfer may well be the key determinant of urbanism.   
3:66:4173:21:20:108:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  economic  influence  of  cities  on  both  enterprise  and  human  capital  is  so  important  
3:67:4273:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  it  is  natural  to  ask  whether  its  effects  can  be  documented  in  the  financial  portion  of  the  
3:68:4387:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:household  investment  portfolio.    More  broadly,  urbanism  itself  might  be  viewed  as  having  an  
3:69:4493:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:impact  on  investing.      The  cross-sectional  differences  afforded  by  urban  vs.  rural  locations  as  
3:70:4604:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:well  as  the  cross-sectional  differences  among  cities  themselves  should    allow  us  to  test  some  
3:71:4713:21:20:72:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:basic  theories  about  how  and  why  people  invest  in  financial  assets.    These  theories  can  be  
3:72:4820:20:21:72:352:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:broadly divided into those concerned with risk and return.

3:75:4882:21:21:108:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:A:Neo-classical   portfolio   theory   emphasizes   the   risk-reducing   role   of   the   investment 
3:76:4983:21:20:72:543:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio.    Ross’s  (1978)    K-fund    separation  theory,    for  instance,  posits  that  all  investors  will  
3:77:5100:20:22:72:544:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:hold some combination of diversified investment funds – at least in a frictionless world where all

3:79:5247:9:0:72:541:78:7:Times:10:Times:F:2  See, for example,  Ellison and Glaeser, 1999,  Glaeser et al. 1992, 1995, 1997 and 2002, Glaeser and Mare, 2001.   
4:80:5365:0:21:72:544:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:assets  are  traded  and  returns  correspond  to  a  quite  general  set  of  distributions.    With  non-traded 
4:81:5479:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:human  capital,  and  frictions  like  the  high  costs  of  re-location  or  search  costs  for  selling  a  home,  
4:82:5596:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:answers  to  the  household  portfolio  problem  are  more  complicated.    The  financial  portion  of  the  
4:83:5706:21:20:72:494:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment portfolio becomes a potential tool for hedging non-financial income risk.3    
4:84:5794:20:21:108:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:A:Besides  standard  macro  and  micro  economic  risks,  recent  research  has  also  posited  a  
4:85:5891:21:21:72:542:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:geographically  based  “social  risk.”     Bakshi and Chen  (1996)  for  example,  build  an economy in 
4:86:5995:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:which  investors  are  motivated  by  the  social  status  of  wealth  –  presumably  with  respect  to  their  
4:87:6107:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:geographical  neighbors.4          DeMarzo,  Kaniel  and  Kremer  (2002)  term  this  regional  factor  in  the  
4:88:6220:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment  motive  “district  risk.”    Thus,  cities  can  be  seen  not  only  as  a  technology  for 
4:89:6325:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversifying  human  capital  risk,  but  also  as  a  medium  for  stimulating  social  competition  with  
4:90:6433:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment  implications.    These  two  effects  suggest  that  the  financial  diversification  of  urban  
4:91:6542:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors  is  likely  to  be  different  from  that  of  rural  investors.    By  the  same  token,  under  these  
4:92:6658:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:various  hedging  stories,  cities  that  have  more  focused  economies  might  be  expected  to  have  
4:93:6763:21:20:72:459:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors whose portfolios effectively hedge out the focus of the city economy.   
4:94:6844:20:21:72:75:420:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
4:95:6844:21:21:72:107:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:Return 
4:96:6850:21:21:108:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:A:The other side of investment is expected return.   People invest in financial assets to make 
4:97:6943:21:21:72:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:money,  not  simply  to  insure  themselves  against  shocks  to  labor  income  or  other  sources  of  
4:98:7048:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:uncertainty.    Under  the  assumption  of  efficient  markets,  speculation  in  individual  securities  is  
4:99:7158:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:expected to yield no higher rate of return than provided by a diversified portfolio. However, with 
4:100:7257:21:21:72:549:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:asymmetric   information,   diversification   is   not   necessarily   an   optimal   investment   strategy.   
4:101:7368:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:Recent behavioral studies have suggested that the average speculator in stocks does not profit by 
4:102:7466:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:trading  on  his  ideas  (Barber  and  Odean,  2000).  However,  this  does  not  appear  to  prevent  the  
4:103:7574:21:20:72:543:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:majority  of  investors  from  focusing  their  stock  portfolios  into  only  a  few,  correlated  securities  
4:104:7686:20:21:72:248:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:(cf. Goetzmann and Kumar, 2002).   
4:105:7720:21:21:108:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:A:One  potential  reason  for  this  portfolio  concentration  is  the  existence  of  actual  or 
4:106:7816:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:perceived  informational  advantage.    Given  that  knowledge  spillover  is  a  major  characteristic  of  
4:107:7925:21:29:72:545:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:cities,  one  might  expect  to  find  portfolio  concentration  in  urban,  rather  than  rural  settings.  
4:108:8034:29:8:216:219:121:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
4:109:8082:8:16:72:542:113:7:Times:10:Times:F:3    Recent  work  on  the  financial  portfolio  as  hedging  instrument  includes,  DeMarzo,  Kaniel  and  Kremer,  2002,  
4:110:8207:16:11:72:542:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:Heaton  and  Lucas,  2000,  a&b,  and  Vissing-Jorgensen,  2002a,  as  well  as  a  broader  literature  on  precautionary  
4:111:8331:11:8:72:386:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:savings, including Carroll and Samwick, 1997 and Carroll and Kimball, 2001. 
4:112:8406:8:0:72:476:78:7:Times:10:Times:F:4 This is similar to the idea of “keeping up with the Joneses” (Ryder and Heal, 1973 and Gali, 1994). 
5:113:8507:0:21:72:544:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:Because  much  business  is  still  largely  conducted  through  personal  interaction,  cities  continue  to  
5:114:8618:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:be  settings for the creation and propagation of  value-relevant  information and skills.  This is not 
5:115:8721:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:to say that knowledge is not created in rural settings, but density of enterprise and a critical level 
5:116:8824:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  personal  interaction  are  needed  for  diffusion  and  utilization  of  that  knowledge.      Thus,  
5:117:8931:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment  opportunities  may  be  expected  to  appear  more  frequently  in  an  urban  environment,  
5:118:9036:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:and to yield economic returns  to those who seize them.  In    this    context,    the    investment 
5:119:9136:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio  might  be  thought  of  as  capital  for  exploiting  short-lived  investment  ideas.    A  caveat  to  
5:120:9251:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:“don’t  put  all  of  your  eggs  in  one  basket”  is  that  you  may  know  something  special  about  one  
5:121:9361:21:20:72:544:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:particular  basket.    Hence,  we  might  expect  urban  households  with  access  to  knowledge  spillover  
5:122:9470:20:21:72:419:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:to use their investment portfolio to take advantage of this knowledge.     
5:123:9543:21:21:108:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:A:It  is  important  to  note  that,  for  most  investors,  these  investment  opportunities  created  in  
5:124:9649:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:an   “information-dense”   business   environment   might   be   illusory.   Investors   with   access   to 
5:125:9757:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:business  information  flow  about  a  particular  company  may  not  know  whether the  current  
5:126:9855:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:security  price  already  reflects  this  new  information  or  not.    In  fact,  they  may  be  subject  to  
5:127:9966:20:21:72:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:behavioral  biases  such  as  over-confidence  or  mistaken  self-attribution  that  would  lead  them  to  
5:128:10074:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:believe  incorrectly  that  they  have  superior  investment  knowledge.  Thus,  unless  investment  
5:129:10175:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:activity is completely characterized by unbiased, rational expectations about returns, we may not 
5:130:10273:21:21:72:544:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:find  that  urban  investors  perform  better  on  average  than  rural  investors.  Since  most  people  
5:131:10379:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:believe  themselves  to  have  above  average  skill,  we  might  expect  to  find  more  focused, 
5:132:10478:20:21:72:542:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:speculative portfolios among investors regularly exposed to information – whether they are truly 
5:133:10575:21:21:72:199:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:mediocre investors or not. 
5:134:10601:21:20:108:542:274:12:Times:12:Times:A:Another  feature  we  might  expect  from  informed  -- or seemingly informed --  trading on 
5:135:10694:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:urban   knowledge   spill-over   is   investment   in   local   industry.      Zhu   (2002)   documents   the 
5:136:10804:21:20:72:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:propensity  of  speculators  to  trade  in  stocks  close  to  where  they  live  and  finds  little  evidence  that  
5:137:10922:20:21:72:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:trading  in  localized  shares  yields  higher  profits.  Academic  interest  in  geographically  proximate  
5:138:11031:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:investing  has  been  growing,  however.    Coval  and  Moskowitz  (2001)  find  evidence  of  positive  
5:139:11136:21:21:72:544:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:returns  to  institutional  trading  close  to  home.    Ivkovic  and  Weisbrenner  (2003)  report  that  
5:140:11242:21:21:72:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor  holdings  in  local  stocks  outperform  distant  holdings.  The  debate  about  whether  local  
5:141:11349:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors  actually  profit  from  geographical  information  diffusion  is  still  not  settled,  however,  
5:142:11458:20:21:72:543:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:most  researchers  agree  that  investors  at  least    tend  to  behave  as  if  they    believed  they  had  
5:143:11569:21:0:72:261:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:superior information about local firms.

6:145:11609:21:20:72:237:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:Contribution of the Current Work 
6:146:11641:20:21:108:544:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  major  challenge  to  exploring  the  relationship  between  investment  portfolios  and 
6:147:11733:21:20:72:546:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:geographical  location  has  been  the  lack  of  comprehensive    and  detailed  data.      Do  investors    
6:148:11843:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:hedge human capital risks with financial investments? Are urban portfolios more diversified than 
6:149:11940:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:rural  portfolios?  These  are  empirical  questions    that  rely  upon  data    which,  to  date,  have  been  
6:150:12053:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:difficult  to  obtain.  Testing  requires  not  only    a  detailed  knowledge  of  the  assets  in  the  financial  
6:151:12170:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio  but  also  information  about  employment,  housing,  geographical  location  and  even 
6:152:12269:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:demographic characteristics.  If people are optimizing over all the relevant  economic  factors  in  
6:153:12370:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:their  lives,  how  would  we  know  without    having  an  embarrassing    amount  of    personal  detail  to  
6:154:12482:21:21:72:105:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:study? 
6:155:12488:21:20:108:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:A:In  fact,  in  this  paper  we  have  access  to  a  very  detailed  geo-coded panel dataset  over the 
6:156:12591:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:period  1995  to  2000  for  a  large  sample  of    households  in  Sweden.    Constructed  from  several  
6:157:12699:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:sources, this dataset allows us to explore the geographical determinants of  investment.  We seek 
6:158:12797:20:21:72:544:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:to address  the question of how cities affect  household risk and return, and how these effects are 
6:159:12897:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:manifested  in  the  choice  of  a  diversified  vs.  a  focused  investment  portfolio.    We  use  the  panel  
6:160:13010:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:data to test a number of implications about both the risk and return stories presented above.  Our 
6:161:13109:21:21:72:544:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:findings  suggest  that,  in  general,    city  investors  are  more  focused (less-diversified) and that the 
6:162:13219:21:20:72:539:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:tendency  to  focus  the  portfolio  increases  with  the  degree  to  which  the  city  itself  is  industry-
6:163:13329:20:21:72:544:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:focused.      Our  results  are  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  of  real  or  perceived  local  knowledge  
6:164:13440:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:spillover.    We  test  for  “district effects” by considering whether portfolio focus depends upon a 
6:165:13542:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:city’s    relative  economic  prosperity,  and  find  little  support  for  this  theory.    On  balance,  our  
6:166:13654:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:findings  suggest  that  the  composition  of  investor  stock  portfolios  does  not  reflect    hedging 
6:167:13760:21:20:72:487:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:motives, but rather reflects expectations about  superior information-motivated return. 
6:168:13847:20:21:108:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:A:Our results provide some potentially useful evidence on theories of agglomeration.  Cities 
6:169:13938:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:appear  to  enhance  risk-taking  behavior  based  on  the  economic  opportunities  they  offer  –  or  
6:170:14043:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:appear to offer --    their  inhabitants.      Moreover,  we  find  that  the  very  factors    economists  have  
6:171:14157:21:21:72:546:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:associated  with  urban  growth  --    particularly  industry  scale,  diversity  and  concentration,  are    
6:172:14267:21:20:72:247:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:associated with investor risk-taking. 
6:173:14304:20:21:108:543:109:12:Times:12:Times:A:The remainder  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows.    In  the  next  section,  we  discuss  the  
6:174:14410:21:0:72:543:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:literature  related  to  our  work  with  particular  focus  on  the  various  theories  that  might  explain  
7:175:14522:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor  focus,  and  the  testable  implications  given  our  dataset.    Section  3  discusses  the  data,  
7:176:14633:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:Section  4  describes  the  construction  of  the  variables.  Section  5  describes  the  estimation 
7:177:14735:20:21:72:450:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:procedure. Section 6 reports the empirical results.  A brief conclusion follows.

7:179:14815:20:21:72:281:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:2. Background and Testable Hypotheses 
7:180:14852:21:21:72:75:606:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
7:181:14852:21:21:72:396:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:2.1 Some alternative approaches to portfolio under-diversification  
7:182:14919:21:21:108:542:564:12:Times:12:Times:A:One  rational  explanation  for  apparently  under-diversified  investor  portfolios  is  a  hedging  
7:183:15021:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:argument.   Merton (1971) for example, shows that, in the presence of non-financial income risk 
7:184:15117:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors will hold  the  market  portfolio  and  some  additional  position  constructed  to  hedge  the  
7:185:15224:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes  in  the  stochastic  opportunity  set  or  other  sources  of  uncertainty.  For  example,  an 
7:186:15328:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor subject to income risk may try to diversify it away by holding, in addition to the market 
7:187:15427:20:21:72:542:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio,  a  portfolio  negatively  correlated  to  his  labor  income.    The  net  overall  financial 
7:188:15533:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio  may  appear  undiversified,  when  in  fact  the  investor  has  reduced  the  overall  risk  of  his  
7:189:15647:20:21:72:539:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio.      The  hedging  motive  predicts  that    under-diversification  should  be  related  to  non-
7:190:15755:21:21:72:425:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment income risks. We are able to test this with the current dataset. 
7:191:15830:21:21:108:548:378:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  second  explanation  for  portfolio  focus is      motivated  by  asymmetric  information.   
7:192:15926:21:21:72:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:Investors  may  hold  focused  portfolios  because  they  either  possess  value-relevant  information,  or  
7:193:16035:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:believe  they  possess  value  relevant  information.  Superior  information  about  a  few  securities  
7:194:16140:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:implies a portfolio concentrated in those securities (Grinold and Kahn, 1999).  Even the mistaken 
7:195:16238:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:belief  by  the  investor  that  information  in  his  possession  can  provide  superior  returns  will  
7:196:16344:21:20:72:315:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:motivate a deviation from a diversified portfolio.   
7:197:16396:20:21:108:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  third  explanation  relies  on  prospect  theory  and,  in  general,  on  the  preference  for  
7:198:16495:21:20:72:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:skewness.  Shore and White (2002) and Polkovnichenko (2003) point  out  those  investors  with  a  
7:199:16594:20:21:72:542:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:taste for low-probability high-stakes gambles  will invest only in the very few stocks from which 
7:200:16692:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:they expect higher returns, forfeiting the benefits of diversification in return for a chance at great 
7:201:16795:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:wealth.    Perhaps  the  investment  accounts  of  individuals  in  our  sample  are,  in  effect,  gambling  
7:202:16905:21:21:72:544:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:accounts  which  lose  their  attractiveness  to  investors  once  they  become  too  diversified  to  provide  
7:203:17017:21:20:72:543:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:returns well in excess of the market.   Strange as the suggestion may seem, this might be rational 
7:204:17116:20:0:72:234:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:for some form of utility function. 
8:205:17151:0:21:108:544:709:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  fourth  explanation  for  under-diversification  is  bounded  rationality.    Goetzmann  and  
8:206:17248:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:Kumar  (2002)  find  that  less  sophisticated  investors  are  also  less  diversified.  Barber  and  Odean  
8:207:17358:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2003)  find  that  investors  tend  to  trade  more  frequently  in  stocks  in  the  news  – suggesting either 
8:208:17471:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:non-trivial  information  costs  to  investment  research,  or  uncritical  use  of  the  current  news.    The  
8:209:17584:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:direct  implication  of  bounded-rationality  theories  is  a  strong  correlation  between  familiarity and 
8:210:17693:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment in stocks (Merton, 1987 and Shapiro, 2000).   In fact, Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) 
8:211:17790:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:document just such a familiarity bias in Finland  using  a  similarly  geo-coded investor dataset.  If 
8:212:17893:21:21:72:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor interest drops off with the distance fro the company, individual portfolios will tend to be 
8:213:17994:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:regionally  focused,  and  thus  exposed  to  more  volatility  than  they  should  be.    This  is  a  question  
8:214:18108:20:21:72:182:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:we can put to the data. 
8:215:18131:21:21:108:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  fifth  explanation  is  a  theory  of  social  competition.    The  theory  of  district  risk  argues  
8:216:18238:21:20:72:542:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  investors  --  competing  for  local  resources  within  their  district  -- have utility that depends on 
8:217:18350:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:both  their  own  wealth  as  well  as  the  aggregate  district  wealth  (DeMarzo,  Kaniel  and  Kremer,  
8:218:18457:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:2002).  In  their  model,  investors,  in  order  to  keep  up  with  their  neighbors,    invest  in  the  same  
8:219:18571:20:21:72:542:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:stocks  in  which  their  neighbors  invest,  resulting  in  an  un-diversified portfolio.5  The district risk 
8:220:18682:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:theory  postulates  that  the  higher  the  growth  of  wealth  of  the  district,  the  higher  the  local 
8:221:18790:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:(consumption) prices,  the  more  investors  would  concentrate  on  the  same  stocks.  This  suggests  a  
8:222:18898:21:21:72:544:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:strong  positive  correlation  between  the  growth  and  change  in  wealth  of  the  local  district  and  the  
8:223:19012:21:20:72:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:degree  of  under-diversification.  It  is  important  to  note  that  this  theory  assumes  away  the  mere  
8:224:19123:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:possibility  of  migration  across  districts,  while  we  will  argue  that  this  is  one  of  the  main 
8:225:19230:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:components of the story.  Our approach to testing this is to examine the correlations between the 
8:226:19328:21:20:72:539:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic performance of the district and the degree of diversification of the investors within it.   
8:227:19428:20:21:108:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:A:It  is  important  to  notice  that  in  Sweden  investors  are  not  forced  or  induced  to  own  
8:228:19528:21:20:72:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:company stocks. This is not only confirmed by casual evidence collected by the authors, but also 
8:229:19625:20:21:72:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:by  the  data.  Moreover,  in  general  professional  proximity  (that  is  the  degree  to  which  a  stock  is  
8:230:19739:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:close  to  the  profession  of  the  investor)  does  not  induce  investors  to  tilt  their  portfolio  toward  
8:231:19853:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:stocks  of  the  company  they  work  for  or  of  companies  belonging  to  the  same  industry.  This  
8:232:19958:21:21:72:544:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggests  that  investor  loyalty  and  own  company  ownership  do  not  provide  a  valid  alternative  
8:233:20064:21:20:72:133:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:explanation.

8:235:20124:7:16:72:542:102:7:Times:10:Times:F:5 This argument does not quite explain focused portfolios, because one equilibrium is that all investors in a district 
8:236:20243:16:12:72:542:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:might  hold  the  market.    However,  if  keeping  up  with  the  Joneses  depends  upon  seeking  to  keep  up  with  the  most  
8:237:20374:12:0:72:460:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:successful investor  in the district, the extreme portfolio in a population is de facto undiversified.

9:240:20512:20:21:108:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:As  emphasized  above,  the  economists  have  provided  considerable  evidence  suggesting  
9:241:20605:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:that   knowledge   creation   and knowledge   spillover   are   the   main   determinants   of   city 
9:242:20707:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:agglomeration  and  development  (Glaeser,  et al., 1992, Glaeser, et al., 2002, Glaeser and Mare, 
9:243:20806:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:2001,  Ellison  and  Glaeser,  1997,  Glaeser,  et  al.,  1995).  Knowledge  creation  and  spillover  are  
9:244:20914:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:defined   in   terms   of   professional   specialization   and   proximity.   Agglomeration   economies, 
9:245:21020:21:21:72:539:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:characterized  by  dynamic  local  externalities,  increase  the  returns  to  investment  in  high  labor-
9:246:21127:21:20:72:349:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:capital intensive technologies and induce specialization.   
9:247:21186:20:21:108:539:523:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  major  question  addressed  by  urban  economists  is  whether  intra-industry  or  inter-
9:248:21279:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:industry spillover is more important.   Glaeser et al. (1992) characterize the former as a Marshall, 
9:249:21380:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:Arrow  and  Romer  [MAR]  model.  Along  these  lines,  Porter  (1990)  argues  that  the  main 
9:250:21476:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:determinant   of   growth   is   specialization.      Local   monopoly   increases   growth   as   it   allows 
9:251:21587:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:externalities  to  be  internalized.    On  the  other  hand,    Jacobs  (1969)  links  city  growth  to  the  
9:252:21698:20:21:72:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:existence  of  various  and  proximate  industries,  and    in  tests  of  these  off-setting  propositions, 
9:253:21807:21:21:72:544:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:Glaeser et  al.,  1992    find  that  "important  knowledge  transfers  come  from  outside  the  core  
9:254:21911:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:industry''.      They  find  that  cross-industry spillover as opposed to within-industry  spillover  is    the  
9:255:22024:21:21:72:206:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:main driver to city growth.  
9:256:22052:21:20:108:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  archtypal  MAR  region  is    Silicon  Valley.    Concentration  of  the  high-tech  industry  
9:257:22152:20:21:72:546:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:around San Jose, California generates knowledge spillover between firms in the same industry.  
9:258:22246:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:Jacobs's  model  represents  the  development  of  industries  that  grow  out  of  specialization  of  a  
9:259:22353:21:20:72:544:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:particular  process.  The  example  he  gives  is  the  brassiere  industry,  which  evolved  from  the  
9:260:22458:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:dressmakers'  industry  as  opposed  to  the  lingerie  industry.  An  additional  feature  of  the    Jacobs  
9:261:22569:21:20:72:543:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:model  is  that  it  suggests  that  local  competition  induces  knowledge  creation  and  innovation.  The 
9:262:22678:20:21:72:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:given  example  is  the    Italian  ceramics  industry,  in  which  technical  and  aesthetic  innovation  is  
9:263:22789:21:21:72:385:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:driven by  intense, local competition among many similar firms.  
9:264:22853:21:21:108:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:A:These  theories  disagree  in  terms  of  the  form  of  the  market  most  conducive  to  knowledge 
9:265:22954:21:21:72:544:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:creation  and  specialization  (i.e.,  competition  as  opposed  to  local  monopoly).  However,  they  do  
9:266:23062:21:20:72:543:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:agree on relating growth to the process of knowledge creation and specialization.  While existing 
9:267:23160:20:21:72:543:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:theories  of  urban  economics  focus  on  development  of  skills  and  stimulus  for  technological 
9:268:23262:21:0:72:544:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:innovation,  they  apply  equally  well  to  the  propagation  of  investment  opportunities  and  ideas.  
10:269:23370:0:21:72:539:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:Workers  in  both  diversified  and  concentrated  urban  settings  are  likely  to  be  exposed  to  value-
10:270:23478:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:relevant  information.    If  this  information  is  about  publicly  traded  firms,  then  we  would  expect  
10:271:23589:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:knowledge  spillover  to  stimulate  investment  activity.      Whether  this  spill-over  results  in  a  
10:272:23696:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio  with  many  or  few  stocks  is  somewhat  ambiguous.        If  the  city  employment  is  
10:273:23799:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:concentrated  in  a  few  major  firms,  we  might  expect  to  find  local  investor  portfolios  highly  
10:274:23906:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:concentrated.    However,  if  a  city  has  a  number  of  publicly  traded  companies  and  there  is  
10:275:24011:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:knowledge transfer among them, then local speculators might take a number of positions at once.

10:277:24107:21:20:72:251:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:2.3 A simple  model of specialization 
10:278:24144:20:21:108:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:A:An important consideration in the question of portfolio focus and knowledge spill-over is 
10:279:24234:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:that employment specialization itself has the potential to affect investment behavior.  Investment 
10:280:24333:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:activities  compete  for  the  attention  of  the  worker.    As  specialization  increases,  and  labor  market  
10:281:24447:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:competition  rises,  the  time  investors  allocate  to  search  for  new  stocks  may  decrease,  even  as  the  
10:282:24561:21:20:72:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:value-relevance –  or  apparent  value-relevance –  of  acquired  information  increases.   In  a  MAR  
10:283:24665:20:21:72:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:setting,  for  example,  in  which  an  investor  acquires  knowledge  of  the  particular  sector/industry,  
10:284:24775:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:this    implies  a  lower  search  cost  for  the  stocks  of  that  industry,  but  a  higher  information  search  
10:285:24892:21:21:72:257:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:cost for stocks outside of the industry. 
10:286:24932:21:21:108:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:A:To examine  this  issue  in  a  bit  more  detail,  we  consider  a  search  framework  (Carlson  and  
10:287:25035:21:20:72:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:McAfee, 1983, Hortacsu and Syverson, 2002). We assume that investors have a certain wealth 
10:288:25126:20:21:72:544:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:(W)  to  invest  and  a  search  cost  (x).  The  search  cost  may  be  alternatively  seen  as  a  discrete  
10:289:25237:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:amount  that  has  to  be  paid  to  enter  a  specific  market.6  Investors are risk averse and are aware 
10:290:25344:21:20:72:544:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  different  stocks  have  different  risk-return  profiles,  but  are  uncertain  about  the  asset  that  
10:291:25456:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:represents the best next addition to the portfolio. Each stock has a specific risk-return profile (R) 
10:292:25558:21:20:72:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  is  a  function  of  the  stock  expected  return,  correlation  and  volatility.  If  we  also  assume  that  
10:293:25675:20:21:72:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors  have  identical  perceptions  of  the  risk-returns  profiles  of  the  different  stocks,  it  can  be  
10:294:25791:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:shown (Hortacsu and Syverson, 2002) that an investor with W  to  invest  and  a  search  cost  x  will  
10:295:25895:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:adopt  the  following  investment  rule:  keep  on  investigating  one  additional  stock  if  the  cost  of  
10:296:26005:21:33:72:291:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:searching is less than the benefit, that is,

10:305:26140:9:0:72:427:78:7:Times:10:Times:F:6 See, for example, Ukhov (2002) for a model with a fixed investor cost of market entry. 
11:306:26229:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:otherwise  stop  and  invest  in  that  stock.  The  intuition  behind  equation  1  is  the  existence  of  
11:307:26338:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:discreteness  in  the  cost  of  investment  that  effectively  segments  the  market  and  generates  a 
11:308:26443:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:discontinuity  in  the  investment  process.  This  approach  assumes  that  the  degree  of  portfolio  
11:309:26548:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  is  mainly  a  function  of  the  search  cost  to  invest  in  a  specific  stock.  Equation  1  
11:310:26663:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:provides  a  stylized  representation  that  contains  all  the  elements  of  portfolio  choice,  but  it  is  
11:311:26775:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:completely unlike the neo-classical portfolio problem, in that past choices are not re-evaluated in 
11:312:26875:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:the context of current ones.  It has the feature of habit-formation in which the existing portfolio is 
11:313:26978:21:21:72:163:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:the acquired habit. 
11:314:26997:21:20:108:544:543:12:Times:12:Times:A:Investment  in  stocks  provides  three  advantages:  the  first  is  that  a  search  may  turn  up  a  
11:315:27102:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:genuine,  undervalued  security.    While  insider  trading  laws  may  prevent  the  exploitation  of  this  
11:316:27212:21:21:72:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:information,  trading  in  the  stocks  of  related  companies  exposed  to  such  information  may  not  be  
11:317:27322:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:prohibited  (Tookes,  2003).    The  second  is  the  reduction  of  the  overall  portfolio  risk  due  to  
11:318:27431:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification.  Therefore,  if  the  investor  is  risk  averse,  he  has  an  incentive  to  keep  on  searching  
11:319:27548:21:20:72:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  not  to  invest  only  in  a  single  stock.  A  risk  neutral  investor  will  only  care  about  the  return  
11:320:27665:20:21:72:542:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:payoff and will concentrate on one stock –  it  is  well-known that the maximum expected return 
11:321:27761:21:21:72:544:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio  is  a  composed  of  a  single  security,  however  it  is  costly  to  continue  to  search  for  that  
11:322:27877:21:21:72:201:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:highest-returning security. 
11:323:27904:21:21:108:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:A:What  is  exactly the search cost? It is a function of  the  actual  purchase  of  information  as  
11:324:28004:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:well  as  the  time  spent  doing  so.  The  latter  increases  with  alternative  opportunities  the  investor  
11:325:28117:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:faces  and,  therefore,  with  the  reward/opportunity  ratio  provided  by  his  professional  activity.  
11:326:28224:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:Therefore,  the  more  professionally  involved  the  investor  is,  the  less  time  he  will  have  to  devote  
11:327:28338:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  portfolio  allocation.  We  can  think  of  this  in  terms  of  bounded  rationality  (Simon,  1986, 
11:328:28444:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sargent, 1993) or limited processing capacity (Sims, 2000). Building on Sims’ results in terms of 
11:329:28542:21:20:72:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:limited processing capacity, Peng and Xiong (2002) show how limited capacity, defined in terms 
11:330:28637:20:21:72:342:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:of time to process information, affects portfolio choice.  
11:331:28695:21:21:108:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:A:The   search   cost   is   negatively   related   to   the   investor’s   ability   to   get   information. 
11:332:28803:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:Therefore,  in a business  setting  in  which  an  investor  is  naturally  exposed  to  certain  kind  of  
11:333:28911:21:21:72:544:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:information, professional, geographical and informational proximity are by-products of labor and 
11:334:29008:21:20:72:543:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:thus reduce the search cost.   Even in a situation in which there  is  no excess return expected from 
11:335:29110:20:21:72:544:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:an  investment,  if  the  search  cost  is  discrete  and  high  enough,  an  investor  will  forfeit  the  benefits  
11:336:29228:21:0:72:545:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  broader  diversification  and  hold  the  few  stocks  related  to  his  job  –  in  a  sense,  free-riding on  
12:337:29346:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:professional knowledge  spillover.  It  thus  follows  that  the  degree  of  portfolio  diversification  is  a  
12:338:29459:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:direct  function  of  the  search  cost.  This  simple  model  is  consistent  with  existing  empirical 
12:339:29564:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:evidence  showing  that  investors  tend  to  invest  in  stocks  of  companies  headquartered  close  to

12:343:29887:21:21:108:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  main  implication  of  this  simple  model  is  to  suggest  portfolio  diversification  may  be  
12:344:29990:21:21:72:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:related  to  an    investor’s  professional  life.  This  allows  us  to  link  portfolio  diversification  to  the  
12:345:30107:21:20:72:544:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:process  of  city  agglomeration  and  industrial  specialization.  We  find  evidence  that  the  same  
12:346:30212:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:factors that drive agglomeration  are  those  that  affect  the  professional  lives  of  investors,  and  by

12:351:30363:20:21:108:544:420:12:Times:12:Times:A:In order to examine the relationship between urbanism and diversification, we require a 
12:352:30451:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:set  of  variables  that  proxy  for  knowledge  spillover  and  local  prosperity,  as  well  as  a  set  of  
12:353:30562:21:21:72:542:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables to test competing theories.  To test  hypotheses  about  hedging,  we require a measure of 
12:354:30663:21:21:72:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:non-financial income risk by the investor, measures of the level and risk of non-financial income, 
12:355:30762:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:as  well  as  proxies  for  investor  borrowing  constraints.  Theories  related  to  information  spillover 
12:356:30871:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  bounded  rationality   require   proxies   for   the   degree   of   professional   and   geographical 
12:357:30979:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:proximity  of  the  investor.  The  district  risk  theory  requires  a  measure  of  local  prosperity  as well 
12:358:31092:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:as  investor  specific  wealth  and  sources  of  income.  Finally,  a  fairly  general  set  of  individual  
12:359:31202:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor  control  variables  are  needed.  These  will  allow  us  to  separately  identify  the  impact  of  
12:360:31313:21:20:72:435:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:belonging to a particular district from the investor's specific characteristics. 
12:361:31393:20:21:108:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  collect  data  from  different  sources.  For  each  investor  we  have  detailed  information  
12:362:31493:21:21:72:543:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:about his  or  her  individual  holdings  of  stocks  (broken  down  at  the  stock  level),  mutual  funds,

12:365:31823:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:characteristics.  This  information  is  matched  at  the  individual  level,  so  as  to  construct  a  time  
12:366:31934:20:21:72:542:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:series  of  investment  and  income  for  each  investor.  For  each  stock  we  have  detailed  information  
12:367:32044:21:0:72:544:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  the  company  and  the  price,  volume  and  volatility  at  which  it  trades.  We  also  use  aggregated

14:401:35002:20:21:108:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  tax  aspect  deserves  more  detailed  discussion.  In  Sweden,  in  addition  to  income 
14:402:35096:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:taxation,  there  exists  an  additional  wealth  tax  which  is  paid  by  every  investor  with  net  worth  in  
14:403:35211:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:excess  of  900,000  SEK  (about  US$90,000).  The  taxable  wealth  includes  the  tax-assessed  value  
14:404:35316:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  real  estate,  market  value  of  publicly  listed  securities,  balance  of  bank  accounts  and  fair  value

14:406:35499:21:21:108:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:A:For  the  purpose  of  this  paper,  we  compute  the  current  market  value  of  housing  using  the

14:410:35923:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:companies.  However,  the  data  contains  an  indicator  variable  for  owners  of  privately  held 
14:411:36024:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:companies  and  entrepreneurs  who  file  their  business  tax  return  along  with  their  personal  tax  
14:412:36131:21:20:72:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:return.  For  the  privately  held  unlimited  liability  companies  the  value  of  the  assets  is  included  in  
14:413:36247:20:21:72:542:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:the tax return. For the privately held unlimited liability companies that are not listed, the value of 
14:414:36350:21:21:72:542:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:assets  held  is  generally  missing.  However,  the  size  of  the  group  is  rather  small  (1.74%-1.91% of 
14:415:36461:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  sample  depending  on  a  year)  and  is  unlikely  to  affect  our  estimates  in  a  significant  way.

15:446:38964:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  their  use.  The  first  measure  (D1) is simply the number of positions in the portfolio (i.e., D1 =

15:460:39342:21:21:72:543:250:12:Times:12:Times:B:by –1.  It  increases  with  the  degree  of  diversification  of  the  financial  portfolio.  Diversification  
15:461:39454:21:20:72:544:229:12:Times:12:Times:B:increases  when  the  variance  is  reduced.  The  variance  can  be  reduced  either  by  increasing  the  
15:462:39562:20:26:72:543:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:number  of  shares  in  the  portfolio  (N),  or  by  selecting  the  stocks  so  as  to  reduce  the  average  
15:463:39674:26:20:72:543:183:12:Times:12:Times:B:correlation  among  the  stocks  in  the  portfolio  (Corr).  In  the  limit  as  N  goes  to  infinity  the

16:483:40121:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:same stock would have in the market portfolio. They differ in the way wmkt is constructed. In the 
16:484:40219:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:case of D3, wmkt3  is  constructed  by  using  the  overall  capitalization  of  the  company,  while  in  the  
16:485:40331:20:21:72:542:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:case   of D4, wmkt4   is   constructed   by   using   just   the   free   float.7   These   measures  express 
16:486:40441:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  in  terms  of  divergence  of the financial portfolio from  the  market  portfolio  of  the  
16:487:40551:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor. Higher diversification implies a divergence closer to zero. Both D3, and D4 are defined 
16:488:40649:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:so  that  as  diversification  decreases,  the  measures  become  more  negative.  They  will  be  very  
16:489:40754:21:20:72:544:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:useful  in  terms  of  comparison  with  our  measure  of  active  hedging  of  non-financial  income  risk.  
16:490:40864:20:21:72:539:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:We will indeed see how the distance from the market portfolio relates to the desire to hedge non-
16:491:40961:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  income  risk.  All  our  measures  of  portfolio  versification  increase  with  the  degree  of  
16:492:41070:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  of  the  portfolio  that  is  “a  higher  value  of  these  variables  is  indicative  of  a  higher  
16:493:41189:20:21:72:191:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:level of diversification”.

16:495:41215:20:21:72:283:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.2 Measures of professional specialization 
16:496:41258:21:21:108:544:399:12:Times:12:Times:A:To  proxy  for  professional  specialization,  we  use  the  measures  similar  to  those  developed  
16:497:41360:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:by  Glaeser  et  al.  (1992):  specialization,  competition,  uniformity  and  diversity.  We  create  a  
16:498:41466:21:21:72:544:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:specialization  variable  as  ratio  of  the  share  of  the  top  five  industries  in  local  employment  to  the  
16:499:41583:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:share  of  these  same  five  industries  in  national  employment.    Thus,  the  denominator  of  this  
16:500:41689:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:variable   differs   across   municipalities.   This   provides   a   measure   of   specialization   at   the 
16:501:41800:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:municipality   level.   Competition   is   captured   by   the   number   of   firms   per   employee   in   a 
16:502:41911:21:20:72:544:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:municipality  relative  to  the  number  of  firms  per  employee  in  Sweden.  As  Glaeser  et al. (1992) 
16:503:42018:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:point out, this is not distinguishable from a relative scale variable, but should be correlated to the 
16:504:42121:21:20:72:543:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:degree  of  firm  competition  for  employees.    Our  measure  of  diversity  is  somewhat  different  from  
16:505:42231:20:21:72:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  used  by    Glaeser  et  al.  (1992),  since  their  study  is  conducted  on  industry-level data.    We  
16:506:42344:21:21:72:542:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy  for  diversity using  the  negative  of  the  share  of  the  top  5  industries  in  municipal 
16:507:42447:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:employment.      Cites  with  more  diversity  in  employment  beyond  the  top  five  industries  by 
16:508:42549:21:21:72:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:employment  will  have  a  higher  value.    Glaeser et  al.  (1992),  using  a  sample  of  US  cities,  
16:509:42654:21:31:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:between  1956  and  1987,  find  that  specialization  and  diversity  reduce  city  growth,  while 
16:510:42754:31:8:216:219:98:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
16:511:42802:8:16:72:541:90:7:Times:10:Times:F:7 This is all the more relevant in a country like Sweden where a sizable fraction of the companies’ shares are in the 
16:512:42920:16:0:72:257:74:10:Times:7:Times:F:hands of a restricted number of shareholders.  
17:513:42968:0:21:72:544:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:competition  increases  it.  In  order  to  assess  how  these  variables  affect  city  growth  in  our  sample,  
17:514:43083:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:we  estimate  an  analogous  regression8  for  Sweden.    Our  estimation  of  this  relationship  for 
17:515:43186:20:21:72:544:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sweden  (not  reported)  suggests  that  all  three  variables  are  associated  with  the  growth  rate  of  the  
17:516:43301:21:20:72:98:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:city.  
17:517:43307:20:21:108:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:A: We  also  construct  variables  that  proxy  for  the  degree  of  “isolation”  of  the  local  district. 
17:518:43413:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:These  are  meant  to  describe  how  isolated  the  district  is  with  respect  to  major  financial  and  
17:519:43522:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:information  centers.  These  measures  are:  the  index  of  rural  areas,  the  distance  from  the  closest  
17:520:43634:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:civilian airport and the population density. The index of rural areas is the Urban Code as reported 
17:521:43734:21:20:72:544:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:by  Statistics  Sweden.  It  ranges  from  1  in  the  case  of  a  Metropolitan  area  to  9  in  the  case  of  the  
17:522:43853:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:countryside.  The  distance  to  the  closest  civilian  airport  is  measured  as  the  logarithm  of  the  
17:523:43962:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:distance  between  airport  and  central  post  office  in  the  district.  Population  density is  the  
17:524:44067:21:20:72:348:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:population (in tens of thousands) per square kilometer.     
17:525:44126:20:21:108:111:461:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
17:526:44126:21:20:72:231:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.3 Measures of local prosperity 
17:527:44158:20:21:108:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:A: We  consider  six  variables  that  measure  the  degree  of  prosperity  of  the  district  in  a  given 
17:528:44263:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:year:  the  percentage  of  new  start-ups,  the  percentage  of  bankruptcies,  the  number  of  enterprises  
17:529:44374:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:active  in  the  district,  the  employment  growth  and  some  measures  of  profitability  of  the 
17:530:44475:21:21:72:544:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:companies operating in the district (i.e., the profitability of sales and the return on capital). These 
17:531:44579:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables  are  constructed  at  the  firm  level  and  aggregated  at  the  district  level.  As  an  alternative  
17:532:44695:20:21:72:544:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:measure  of  local  prosperity  we  also  considered  local  consumption  price  indexes.  This  would  be  
17:533:44803:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  variable  required  by  the  district  risk  hypothesis.  However,  this  variable  is  very  highly  
17:534:44910:21:20:72:544:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:correlated  to  the  other  variables  of  local  prosperity.  We  therefore  omit  it  in  the  reported 
17:535:45016:20:21:72:138:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:specification. 
17:536:45030:21:20:72:75:233:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
17:537:45030:20:21:72:369:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.4 Measures of financial and municipal services availability 
17:538:45091:21:21:108:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  degree  of  financial  sophistication  and  bank  coverage  of  a  district  provide  a  good  
17:539:45191:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy  for  both  the  availability  of  financial  information  and  the  vitality  of  the  local  economy  
17:540:45301:21:21:72:544:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:(Garmaise and Moskowitz, 2003). In order to proxy for the availability of  financial services, we 
17:541:45399:21:20:72:543:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:include  the  degree  of  bank  coverage.  It  is  constructed  as  follows.  We  first  identify  the  list  of  
17:542:45513:20:7:216:219:109:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
17:543:45561:7:16:72:541:102:7:Times:10:Times:F:8 While for Glaeser et al. (1992) the unit of measure is the industry-level data, we focus on municipality-level data. 
17:544:45679:16:12:72:542:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:These  results,  that  replicate  Table  3  in  Glaeser  et al.  (1992)  using  this  alternative  specification  are  available  upon  
17:545:45815:12:0:72:172:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:request from the authors 
18:546:45841:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit  institutions  as  reported  by  the  Finance  Inspection  (Swedish  equivalent  of  SEC)  and  then  
18:547:45950:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:we  calculate,  for  each  municipality,  the  number  of  branches  that  each  institution  has  for  a  given  
18:548:46064:20:21:72:544:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:year. The resulting variable “Bank Coverage” is the logarithm of 1 + the number of branches per 
18:549:46160:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:district.  To  proxy  for  the  degree  of  availability  of  municipal  services,  we  use  the  percentage  of  
18:550:46274:20:21:72:324:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:the population that is employed by the municipality.

18:552:46326:21:21:72:231:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.5 Non-financial risk variables. 
18:553:46359:21:21:108:542:564:12:Times:12:Times:A:We define as non-financial risk variables those that allow us to test for portfolio choice in 
18:554:46452:21:21:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  presence  of  non-financial  income  risk  (cf. Heaton  and  Lucas,  2000).  We  consider  three  
18:555:46555:21:24:72:544:522:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables.  The  first  variable  an  the  index  of investor hedging  (iΓ). It  measures  the  extent  to  
18:556:46662:24:21:72:543:498:12:Times:12:Times:B:which  the  investor’s  portfolio  differs  from  the  market  portfolio  in  terms  of  correlation  with  
18:557:46770:21:22:72:306:477:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor's non-financial risk. It is constructed as: 
18:558:46822:22:24:375:387:455:12:Times:12:Times:?:),(),(,portiimiirYcorrrYcorr−=Γ, 
18:559:46854:24:21:72:543:431:12:Times:12:Times:B:where rm is  the  return  on  the  market  portfolio,  ri,port  is  the  return  on  the  financial  portfolio  of  the  
18:560:46975:21:23:72:544:410:12:Times:12:Times:B:ith investor and Yi  is  the  investor  non-financial  expected  income.  In  the  Appendix  we  provide a 
18:561:47082:23:23:72:542:387:12:Times:12:Times:B:detailed  description  of  how  this  variable  is  constructed. iΓ  proxies  for  the  change  in  correlation  
18:562:47195:23:20:72:543:364:12:Times:12:Times:B:between financial and non-financial risk induced by investor’s portfolio choice and quantifies the 
18:563:47294:20:21:72:544:344:12:Times:12:Times:B:extent  to  which  the  investor  deviates  from  a  passive  strategy.  It  is  positive  in  the  case  of  active  
18:564:47412:21:20:72:544:323:12:Times:12:Times:B:hedging and captures the contribution of portfolio choice to the reduction of the overall investor's 
18:565:47513:20:21:72:98:303:12:Times:12:Times:B:risk.  
18:566:47519:21:21:108:542:282:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  second  variable  is  a  measure  of  borrowing  constraints.    Standard  portfolio  theory  
18:567:47618:21:21:72:543:261:12:Times:12:Times:B:links  portfolio  choice  and  market  participation  to  the  existence  of  borrowing  constraints.  Our  
18:568:47726:21:21:72:544:240:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy for these is the ratio of investor debt to total assets. It is constructed at the investor level at 
18:569:47832:21:20:72:543:219:12:Times:12:Times:B:time t.  The  third  proxy  for  non-financial  risk  is  the  percentage  of  the  population  in  the  district  
18:570:47947:20:21:72:544:199:12:Times:12:Times:B:that is enrolled in welfare programs. It proxies for the risk of unemployment that comes from the 
18:571:48045:21:21:72:543:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:fact  of  living  in  a  depressed  area.  It  is  worth  stressing  that  this  is  above  and  beyond  the  risk  of  
18:572:48165:21:20:72:543:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:unemployment that each individual investor perceives. The latter is constructed for each investor 
18:573:48263:20:21:72:337:137:12:Times:12:Times:B:and included among the control variables (see below).

19:577:48319:21:22:72:205:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.6 Measures of familiarity 
19:578:48346:22:23:108:544:666:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  index  of  familiarity  (iΨ)  represents  the  degree  of  “professional”  or  “geographical  
19:579:48445:23:21:72:544:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:proximity” to  a  particular  stock.  In  the  case  of  professional  proximity,  the  index  is  a  dummy  
19:580:48554:21:21:72:543:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:taking  the  value  1  if  the  investor’s  profession  is  in  the  same  area  of  activity  as  the  company  
19:581:48667:21:20:72:543:601:12:Times:12:Times:B:whose  stock  is  under  consideration  and  zero  otherwise.  We  use  the  one  digit  SNI92  codes  
19:582:48770:20:21:72:543:581:12:Times:12:Times:B:(similar  to  SIC  codes)  to  identify  the  areas  of  activities.  For  example,  for  an  investor  working  in  
19:583:48887:21:20:72:499:560:12:Times:12:Times:B:the mining sector who holds  the stock of a mining firm, the dummy would be equal to 1. 
19:584:48974:20:21:108:543:540:12:Times:12:Times:A:In the case of geographical proximity, we use the proximity between the residence of the 
19:585:49063:21:21:72:544:519:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor  and  the  place  where  the  company  is  located.  We  consider  two  different  measures:  the  
19:586:49171:21:21:72:544:498:12:Times:12:Times:B:first  one  is  the  logarithm  of  the  inverse  of  the  distance  between  the  ZIP  code  of  the  investor  and  
19:587:49289:21:21:72:543:477:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  ZIP  code  of  the  closest  branch/subsidiary  of  the  company  whose  stock  we  consider.  As  an  
19:588:49397:21:20:72:543:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:alternative  measure,  we  use  the  logarithm  of  the  inverse  of  the  distance  between  the  ZIP  code  of  
19:589:49511:20:21:72:544:436:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  investor  and  the  ZIP  code  of  the  company  headquarter.  Given  that  the  results  do  not  differ  
19:590:49623:21:21:72:544:415:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  the  variables  are  highly  collinear,  we  report  only  the  first  specification.  These  measures  are  
19:591:49737:21:20:72:543:394:12:Times:12:Times:B:analogous to those proposed by Coval and Moskowitz (1999, 2001) in a study of geographical 
19:592:49828:20:21:72:543:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:preferences  in  mutual  fund  investment.  The  greater  the  value  of  the  variable,  the  closer  the  
19:593:49936:21:20:72:544:353:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor  is  to  the  stock.  These  measures  are  constructed  at  the  stock  level  and  then  aggregated  at  
19:594:50052:20:21:72:544:333:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  investor  level,  across  all  the  stocks  of  his  portfolio,  weighting  them  by  their  share  in  the  
19:595:50166:21:21:72:508:312:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio. This procedure delivers three measures of familiarity for each investor and time. 
19:596:50258:21:21:108:111:291:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
19:597:50258:21:21:72:177:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.7 Control variables 
19:598:50279:21:20:108:544:249:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  consider  the  following  sets  of  control  variables:  measures  of  income  and  wealth,  
19:599:50376:20:21:72:544:229:12:Times:12:Times:B:contemporaneous   gain/loss   variables,   demographic   variables,   momentum   variables,   and 
19:600:50474:21:21:72:251:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:macroeconomic and social variables. 
19:601:50509:21:20:108:544:187:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  measures  of  wealth  include  the  overall  level  of  wealth  of  the  investor  and a 
19:602:50603:20:21:72:543:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:decomposition by components.  Overall  wealth  is  defined  as  the  sum  of  financial  and  real  estate  
19:603:50711:21:20:72:542:146:12:Times:12:Times:B:wealth.  The  measures  of  income  variance  include  the  variance  of  labor  and  entrepreneurial 
19:604:50813:20:21:72:543:126:12:Times:12:Times:B:income of the investor and the correlations between them and financial and real estate income. In 
19:605:50911:21:21:72:544:105:12:Times:12:Times:B:order  to  make  the  results  comparable  with  the  standard  literature  on  portfolio  choice  in  the  
19:606:51019:21:0:72:539:84:12:Times:12:Times:B:presence  of  non-financial  income  risk,  we  construct  measures  of  the  permanent  (expected)  non-
20:607:51126:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  income  following  the  approach  of  Carrol  and  Samwick  (1997)  and  Vissing-Jorgensen 
20:608:51228:21:20:72:539:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2001).  In  the  Appendix  we  provide  a  brief  description  of  the  methodology.  We  consider  non-
20:609:51333:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial income to be labor income and entrepreneurial income. We also construct a measure of 
20:610:51428:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:unemployment risk that proxies for the probability of being unemployed in the following year. It 
20:611:51525:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:is the one year-ahead forecast of a linear probability model where the unemployment status (i.e., 
20:612:51623:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:1 if unemployed and zero otherwise) is regressed on demographic variables, measures of income 
20:613:51717:21:21:72:381:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:and wealth and regional, geographic and professional dummies. 
20:614:51778:21:21:108:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:A:As  an  additional  robustness  check,  we  also  replicated  our  results  by  using  the  actual  
20:615:51878:21:20:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:levels of non-financial income, their volatilities and the correlation of financial and non-financial 
20:616:51980:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:incomes.  This  replaces  the  measures  of  permanent  income,  volatility  of  income  and  their 
20:617:52080:21:21:72:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:correlations  with  portfolio  returns  that  had  been  constructed  according  to  the  Carrol  and 
20:618:52182:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:Samwick (1997) methodology we described earlier. Given that the results are consistent, we will 
20:619:52278:20:21:72:393:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:report only those based on the Carrol and Samwick methodology.  
20:620:52341:21:20:108:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  momentum  variables  include  the  return  of  the  portfolio  of  the  investor  and  of  the  
20:621:52442:20:21:72:544:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:market  portfolio  in  the  previous  12  months.  These  variables  are  meant  to  control  for  the  
20:622:52546:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:possibility  that  the  change  in  the  degree  of  portfolio  diversification  or  portfolio  choice  (i.e.,  
20:623:52658:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:familiarity  bias)  is  due  to  momentum,  that  is,  changes  to  the  variation  in  the  value  of  the  stock  
20:624:52774:21:21:72:303:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:market or in the value of the portfolio holdings. 
20:625:52823:21:20:108:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  demographic  variables  include:  the  level  of  education  of  the  investor,  broken  down  
20:626:52923:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:into  high-school  and  university  level,  the  age  of  the  oldest  member  of  the  family  of  the  investor  
20:627:53038:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  its  value  squared.  This  latter  variable  is  consistent  with  standard  results  (Guiso  and  Jappelli,  
20:628:53154:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:2002, Vissing-Jorgensen,  2002)  which  find  a  non-linear relationship between age and the degree 
20:629:53254:20:21:72:543:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  stock  market  participation.  We  also  include  a  measure  of  unemployment  risk  that  proxies  for  
20:630:53364:21:20:72:543:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  probability  of  being  unemployed  in  the  following  year.  It  is  the  one-year-ahead  forecast  of  a  
20:631:53478:20:21:72:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:linear  probability  model  where  the  unemployment  status  (i.e.,  1  if  unemployed  and  zero 
20:632:53577:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:otherwise)  is  regressed  on  demographic  variables,  measures  of  income  and  wealth  and  regional,  
20:633:53684:21:21:72:268:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:geographical and professional dummies. 
20:634:53722:21:21:108:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:A:To  control  for  the  effect  of  the  local  economy,  we  also  include  a  Stockholm  and  an  
20:635:53821:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:immigration  dummy.  The  Stockholm  dummy  takes  the  value  of  1  if  the  investor  lives  in  the  
20:636:53926:20:21:72:544:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:capital  and  0  otherwise.  The  immigration  dummy  takes  the  value  0  if  all  the  members  of  the  
20:637:54034:21:0:72:543:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:household  are  native  Swedes,  and  1  if  at  least  one  member  of  household  immigrated  from 
21:638:54137:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:abroad.  Furthermore,  we  construct  a  variable  to  proxy  for  the  ability  of  the  investor  in  his  
21:639:54246:21:20:72:544:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:occupation.  This  is  based  on  the  difference  between  his  income  and  the  average  income  of  his  
21:640:54355:20:21:72:544:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:profession.  The  assumption  is  that  the  higher  the  income  of  the  investor  relative  to  the  average  
21:641:54468:21:20:72:452:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:income of the other investors in the same area, the higher his ability should be. 
21:642:54549:20:21:108:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  also  consider  macroeconomic  and  social  variables.  The  macroeconomic  variable  is  
21:643:54643:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  Index  of  Consumer  Confidence.  The  social  variables  include  the  local  tax  rate  and  the  
21:644:54748:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:percentage  of  foreign-born  households.  The  local  tax  rate  controls  for  disparities  across  districts  
21:645:54861:21:21:72:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:merely  due  to  tax  treatment.  The  percentage  of  foreign-born  in  the  population  of  the  district  
21:646:54970:21:20:72:544:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:controls  for  the  assistances  provided  to  the  immigrants.  It  can  be  particularly  relevant  in  some  
21:647:55082:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:areas  of  the  country.  We  also  include  a  variable  that  reports  the  number  of  injured  in  auto  
21:648:55191:21:21:72:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:accidents  per  km  of  the  roads,  as  reported  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Employment  and  
21:649:55293:21:20:72:450:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:Communications. This allows us to control for some outside background risk.

21:651:55369:21:20:72:217:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:5 Econometric methodology 
21:652:55394:20:21:108:111:420:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
21:653:55394:21:27:108:335:399:12:Times:12:Times:A:We concentrate on the following specification: 
21:654:55440:27:23:363:423:372:12:Times:12:Times:?: ititYεα+++=Yitit?CßA,           (2) 
21:655:55475:23:21:72:543:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:where Yit is alternatively one of our measures of portfolio diversification or one of our proxies of 
21:656:55576:21:20:72:543:328:12:Times:12:Times:B:familiarity  (i.e.,  professional  and  geographical  proximity).  The  matrix  Ait contains  the  sets  of  
21:657:55684:20:26:72:543:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables  we  are  interested  in  (i.e.,  proxies  of  professional  specialization,  local  prosperity,  local  
21:658:55799:26:24:72:544:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:welfare assistance and degree of isolation). The matrix YitCcontains all the control variables (i.e., 
21:659:55901:24:21:72:430:258:12:Times:12:Times:B:income, wealth, momentum, demographic and macroeconomic variables). 
21:660:55968:21:21:108:544:237:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  econometric  estimation  of  equation  (2)  has  to  account  for  the  selection  bias  due  to  
21:661:56071:21:20:72:544:216:12:Times:12:Times:B:the fact that we do not observe the investment decision of investors who do not participate in the 
21:662:56170:20:21:72:543:196:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  market.  Given  that  the  participation  decision  is  endogenous,  the  standard  estimates  of  
21:663:56280:21:20:72:544:175:12:Times:12:Times:B:equation (2) would be biased (Maddala, 1983, Nijman and Verbeek, 1996). To address this issue 
21:664:56374:20:21:72:544:155:12:Times:12:Times:B:we  use  a    Heckman  (1979)  two-stage  procedure  and  separately  estimate  the  factors  associated  
21:665:56480:21:21:72:544:134:12:Times:12:Times:B:with  holding  stocks  and  what  influences  his  choices  of  assets.  The  decision  to  enter  the  market  
21:666:56592:21:29:72:183:113:12:Times:12:Times:B:can be represented as:  
21:667:56615:29:0:360:253:84:10:Times:13:Symbol:?:ititPεα+++=

22:670:56653:0:26:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:where Pit  is  a  dummy  that  takes  the  value  of  1  if  the  investor  participates  in  the  financial  market  
22:671:56771:26:23:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:and zero otherwise, Ait is defined as before, while PitCcontains  the  vector  of  control  variables.9 
22:672:56873:23:21:72:543:660:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  probability  that  the  investor  enters  the  financial  market (Pit)  is  modeled  as  a  normal  c.d.f.,  
22:673:56987:21:21:72:544:639:12:Times:12:Times:B:defined  on  an  expanded  dataset  that  contains  both  households  who  hold  financial  assets  and  
22:674:57092:21:21:72:544:618:12:Times:12:Times:B:households  who  do  not.  The  expanded  dataset  includes  the  totality  of  the  households  tracked  
22:675:57198:21:21:72:543:597:12:Times:12:Times:B:over time over each of the sample years 1995 through 2000, regardless of whether they invested 
22:676:57293:21:21:72:408:576:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the stock market. It totals 1,757,406 households-year observations. 
22:677:57363:21:24:108:544:555:12:Times:12:Times:A:From  the  estimation  of  equation  (3)  we  derive  a  variable  (itλ)  that  is  employed  in  the  
22:678:57466:24:22:72:544:531:12:Times:12:Times:B:second  stage  to  control  for  the  selection  bias  (see  Heckman,  1979).  The  significance  of  the  
22:679:57573:22:25:72:544:509:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimate of itλ provides a test of the null of no sample selection bias. The results show that in all 
22:680:57675:25:23:72:543:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  specifications  itλ  is  always  strongly  significant,  suggesting  that  self-selection  is  indeed  
22:681:57783:23:29:72:324:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:important in the sample. We will therefore estimate:

22:685:57879:21:21:108:544:411:12:Times:12:Times:A:Given  that  equation  (3)  is  just  an  auxiliary  regression  only  needed  for  the  proper 
22:686:57975:21:21:72:543:390:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimation  of  the second stage, but out of the scope of this paper, for brevity we will not report

22:688:58174:20:21:72:544:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:Professional  specialization  always  increases  stock  market  participation.  This  result  holds  across  
22:689:58283:21:20:72:543:328:12:Times:12:Times:B:all  the  different  specifications  and  for  both  the  low  wealth  and  the  high  wealth  investors.    Local  
22:690:58399:20:21:72:544:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:isolation  reduces  stock  market  participation,  while  local  prosperity  has  an  ambiguous  impact.  
22:691:58505:21:21:72:543:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:Higher company profitability reduces stock market participation, while an increase in the number 
22:692:58602:21:20:72:544:266:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  companies  raises  stock  market  participation.  This  is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  if  the  
22:693:58710:20:21:72:544:246:12:Times:12:Times:B:industrial  area  is  thriving,  local  investors  are  more  likely  to  invest  in  their  own  business  and  to  
22:694:58827:21:21:72:542:225:12:Times:12:Times:B:start  their  own  enterprises  and  ventures  than  to  invest  in  the  stock  market.  On  the  contrary,  an

22:707:59859:11:12:72:542:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:function  of  the  market  portfolio  (i.e.,  its  correlations),  while  the  portfolio  decision  is  a  function  of  the  individual

23:719:60659:21:21:108:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  proceed  in  two  steps.  First,  we  consider  the  determinants  of  portfolio  diversification.  
23:720:60763:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:This  allows  us  to  directly  compare  evidence  in  favor  of  the  different  theories  described  above.  
23:721:60874:20:21:72:542:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:This  first  part  of  the  analysis,  while  it  addresses  the  question  of why  investors  might  hold  few  
23:722:60986:21:20:72:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:stocks  in  their  portfolio,  however,  does  not  explain  which  stocks  they  invest  in.  Therefore,  the  
23:723:61098:20:21:72:544:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:second part of the analysis addresses the issue of stock-selection.  That  is,  we  relate  the  drive  to  
23:724:61206:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:invest   in   local   or   familiar   stocks   to   the   degree   of   professional   specialization   and   city

23:728:61389:20:21:108:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  regress  our  measures  of  portfolio  diversification  on  the  proxies  for  local  professional  
23:729:61493:21:21:72:542:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:specialization, local prosperity, financial and municipal service availability and the non-financial 
23:730:61594:21:20:72:544:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:risk  variables,  as  well  as  a  set  of  control  variables  meant  to  control  for  investors’  idiosyncratic  
23:731:61710:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:wealth,  income  and  demographic  characteristics  and  for  geographic  and  country  shocks.  The 
23:732:61811:21:20:72:542:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:results  are  reported  in  Tables  2-6.  In  particular,  Table  2  contains  the  main  specification  for  the  4  
23:733:61929:20:21:72:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:measures   of   portfolio   diversification   (respectively   for   the   different   measures   of   portfolio 
23:734:62041:21:21:72:543:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification D1,   D2,   D3,   and D4)   for   the   entire   sample.   Tables  3-6   report   the   main 
23:735:62150:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:specifications  for  the  different  measures  of  portfolio  diversification,  with  the  sample  broken  
23:736:62257:21:21:72:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:down  into  low-wealth  and  wealthy  investors.  For  each  class  of  investors  we  consider  four  
23:737:62360:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:alternative  specifications  differing  on  the  basis  of  the  control  variables  that  are  used.  We  will  
23:738:62473:20:22:72:543:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:mostly  focus  on  the  complete  specification  with  all  controls  --  Specification  1  in  the  tables.  The

23:740:62636:9:0:72:506:78:7:Times:10:Times:F:10 Lagged variables and a set of demographic variables, industry and time dummies are used as instruments. 
24:741:62744:0:21:72:544:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:results  broadly  support  the  city  agglomeration  theory  and  the  limited  information  theory,  while  
24:742:62853:21:20:72:440:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:they fail to support the standard portfolio theory and the district risk theory.  
24:743:62934:20:21:108:544:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:The first finding is a significant negative correlation between portfolio diversification and 
24:744:63028:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:our urban measures of professional specialization. This holds overall and for the different classes 
24:745:63128:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:of    investors.    Industrial    specialization    and    competition    negatively    relate    to    portfolio 
24:746:63242:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification.  That  is,  the  more  concentrated  in  a  particular  area  the  industry  is,  the  higher  the  
24:747:63359:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:degree of local competition for employees and the higher the labor concentration, the lower is the 
24:748:63458:21:21:72:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:degree  of  portfolio  diversification.  This  result  is  robust  across  all  specifications  and  for  different  
24:749:63575:21:20:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:measures  of  portfolio  diversification  for  low-wealth  investors.  It  also  holds  for  high-wealth 
24:750:63680:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors when we use D3 and D4  as  proxies  for  portfolio  diversification,  while  it  is  not  always  
24:751:63788:21:21:72:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:significant when we use D1 and D2. This may be due to the fact that, since high-wealth investors 
24:752:63885:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:are more  financially  sophisticated,  crude  measures  of  diversification  such  as  D1 and D2  are  not  
24:753:63992:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:able  to  capture  the  extent  of  the  investor’s  portfolio  policies.  The  effect  of  industry  diversity  is  
24:754:64109:21:20:72:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:consistently negative for the low-wealth investors for D1 and D2 and insignificant otherwise. This 
24:755:64208:20:21:72:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:lack  of  significance  may  be  due  to  the  relatively  high  correlation  between  this  variable  and  the  
24:756:64321:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:specialization  variable.    The  results  on  specialization,  competition  and  diversity  are  striking  in  
24:757:64433:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  they  are  the  same  factors  related  in  previous  research  to  knowledge  spillover  and  urban  
24:758:64541:21:21:72:117:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth.   
24:759:64550:21:20:108:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:As   the   tables   indicate, diversification   decreases   significantly   with   the   growth   of 
24:760:64651:20:21:72:544:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:competition, specialization and diversity. Thus, a one standard deviation increase in our measure 
24:761:64749:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:of competition  leads  to  a decrease  in  diversification  of  2.2%,  0.5%,  1.7%  and  2.0%  for  the  
24:762:64854:21:20:72:542:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:measures  of  diversification  D1,  D2,  D3,  D4,  respectively.  Similarly,  one  standard  deviation 
24:763:64957:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:increase in specialization leads to a  1.1%, 0.2%, 1.6% and 1.5% for the corresponding measures 
24:764:65053:21:20:72:448:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:of diversification.  The effect of diversity seems to be smaller at less than 1%. 
24:765:65134:20:21:108:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:A:It  is  interesting  to  compare  these  findings  to  the  results  from  the first stage: professional 
24:766:65239:21:21:72:543:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:specialization  increases  stock  market  participation,  but  reduces  portfolio  diversification.  This  is  
24:767:65350:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:consistent  with  the  spill-over hypothesis.  In  particular,  it  suggests  that  the  very  process  of  city  
24:768:65464:21:21:72:542:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth  generates  more  – perhaps illusory -  investment  opportunities  for  the  investors  who  rush  
24:769:65570:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  invest  into  them.  This  simultaneously  increases  stock  market  participation  and  portfolio 
24:770:65673:20:0:72:142:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:concentration. 
25:771:65689:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  results  about  the  measures  of  local  prosperity  are  also  interesting.  Local  prosperity  
25:772:65792:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:may  induce  two  effects:  on  the  one  hand  it  increases  investors’  wealth  and  therefore  financial  
25:773:65902:20:21:72:542:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:sophistication.  On  the  other  hand,  it  raises  the  incentive  to  invest  in  local  stocks.  The  latter  may  
25:774:66020:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:be  due  to  an  incentive  to  catch-up  with  the  neighbors  as  the  local-district  theory  would  suggest,  
25:775:66134:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:or  to  an  incentive  to  increase  the  stakes  in  locally  successful  enterprises.  This  would  be 
25:776:66239:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:particularly  true  for  the  variables  representing  the  number  of  local  start-ups,  local  bankruptcies  
25:777:66351:21:21:72:544:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:and local sale profitability. These variables proxy for the existence of successful local companies 
25:778:66451:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:in which it is worth investing. A typical example would be an area like Silicon Valley, where we 
25:779:66548:21:20:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:would  expect  most  of  the  local  investors  to  be  highly  invested on successful local companies. In 
25:780:66655:20:21:72:534:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:this case, we would expect a negative relationship between local prosperity and diversification.  
25:781:66752:21:21:108:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  results  hold  overall  and  for  the  different  classes  of  investors  and  are  particularly  
25:782:66855:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:strong  for  the  low-wealth  investors.  A  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  the  number  of  startups  
25:783:66967:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:(employment  growth)  leads  to a  5.6%  (1%)  decrease  in  average  correlation.  The  effect  is  
25:784:67068:21:20:72:543:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:noticeably   stronger   for   wealthy   households.      Thus, a one   standard   deviation   increase   in 
25:785:67176:20:21:72:542:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:bankruptcies  rate  leads  to  a  4.0%  decrease  in  average  correlation  (D2)  for  the  low  wealth 
25:786:67280:21:21:72:389:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:households, and a 4.6% decrease for the high wealth households.  
25:787:67344:21:21:108:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  findings  show  that  portfolio  diversification increases with the prosperity of the local 
25:788:67441:21:21:72:544:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:area.  There  is,  indeed,  a  positive  relationship  between  portfolio  diversification  and  employment  
25:789:67550:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth,  the  number  of  new  start-ups,  the  measures  of  profitability  of  local  establishment  (Sales  
25:790:67661:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:Profitability  and  Return  on  Capital)  and  the  number  of  active  enterprises.  An  increase  in 
25:791:67764:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:bankruptcies on the other hand reduces  diversification.  It  is  also  worth  remembering  that  if  we  
25:792:67870:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:consider local  consumption  prices  as  a  proxy  for  local  prosperity  there  is  a  strong  positive  
25:793:67977:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:correlation  between  prosperity  and  portfolio  diversification.  The  results  hold  overall  as  well  as  
25:794:68088:21:20:72:483:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:for different classes of investors and are particularly strong for  low-wealth investors. 
25:795:68177:20:21:108:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:A:These  findings  do  not  support  the  district  risk  theory,  which  postulates  a  negative  
25:796:68274:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship  between  local  prosperity  and  portfolio  diversification.  However,  they  support  the  
25:797:68380:21:21:72:544:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:information  story.  Indeed,  it  is  likely  that  more  information  is  generated  in  more  prosperous  
25:798:68488:21:21:72:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:districts.  For  example,  newspapers  may  be  established,  brokers  and  financial  analysts  may  flock  
25:799:68597:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:in,  banks  may  increase  the  number  of  their  branches  and  the  number  of  financial  services  
25:800:68701:20:0:72:518:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:provided. This would reduce the search cost and therefore increase portfolio diversification.  
26:801:68797:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  further  element  to  support  the  limited  information  theory  is  the  strong,  positive  and  
26:802:68899:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:statistically significant relationship between portfolio diversification and availability of financial 
26:803:69002:20:21:72:544:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:services.  That  is,  the  higher  the  degree  of  bank  coverage,  the  more  investors  are  likely  to  
26:804:69110:21:20:72:542:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversify  their  portfolios.  This  holds  across  all  the  measures  of  diversification  and for  both  
26:805:69218:20:21:72:543:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:classes  of  investors.  A  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  the  number  of  banking  branches  in  a  
26:806:69329:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:municipality  leads  to  an  average  diversification increase between  1.4  and  2.0%.  Moreover,  the  
26:807:69434:21:21:72:542:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:effect is stronger for high-wealth households. Thus, the number of assets increases 3.5% for high 
26:808:69532:21:21:72:342:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:wealth households vs. 0.8% for low-wealth households. 
26:809:69585:21:20:108:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:A:It is worth stressing that in these specifications we are also controlling for the wealth and 
26:810:69679:20:21:72:544:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:income of the investors. Therefore, these effects are “district effects” that act over and above the 
26:811:69780:21:21:72:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:individual  wealth  and  income  effects.  Analogously,  our  proxy  for  the  availability  of  public  
26:812:69885:21:20:72:542:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:services  (the  percentage  of municipal  employees)  is  mostly11  positively  related  to  portfolio 
26:813:69988:20:21:72:149:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification.  
26:814:70005:21:20:108:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:A:What  do  these  results  tell  us  in  terms  of  standard  portfolio  theory?  They  suggest  that  
26:815:70107:20:21:72:544:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  increases  at  the  very  time  when  either  non-financial  income  risk  decreases 
26:816:70209:21:21:72:544:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:(reduction  in  the  number  of  bankruptcies,  increase  in  growth  and  profitability)  or  its  effects  are  
26:817:70323:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:alleviated by the existence of public services or of a financial network. This runs against standard 
26:818:70424:21:21:72:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio theory. Indeed, this theory would suggest that portfolio diversification should be greater 
26:819:70525:21:20:72:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:when  non-financial  risk  is  higher.  Areas  characterized  by  a  high  employment  growth  rate,  high  
26:820:70633:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:start-up rate, and low bankruptcy rate should be areas characterized by low non-financial income 
26:821:70730:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:risk and should therefore  display  lower  financial  diversification.  Indeed,  if  the  local  economy  is  
26:822:70840:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:prosperous  and  growing,  the  risk  of  unemployment  and  well  as  the  risk  of  a  wage  reduction  
26:823:70946:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:should  be  lower.  Therefore,  portfolio  diversification  should  be  lower.  The  findings  point  in  the  
26:824:71057:21:20:72:166:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:opposite direction.  
26:825:71077:20:21:108:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:A:The percentage of people on welfare assistance impacts investors differently, depending 
26:826:71165:21:21:72:542:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  their  level  of  wealth.  It  is  always  negative  and  statistically  significant  for  the  high-wealth 
26:827:71277:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors  and  either  not  significant (for D1 and D2)  or  positive  for  the  low-wealth  investors  (for  
26:828:71388:21:21:72:539:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:D3  and  D4).  This  provides  some  partial  evidence  of  an  impact  of  non  financial  risk  for  low-
26:829:71495:21:42:72:161:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:wealth investors.   
26:830:71514:42:9:216:219:87:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
26:831:71562:9:0:72:532:78:7:Times:10:Times:F:11 This holds for D2 ,D3 and D4 , for both classes of investors. However, it is mostly insignificant in the case of D1. 
27:832:71683:0:21:108:544:709:12:Times:12:Times:A:These  findings  provide  some  preliminary  and  mixed  evidence  on  standard  portfolio  
27:833:71775:21:20:72:544:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:theory  in  the  presence  of  background  risk.  In  order  to  further  examine  this  issue,  we  need  to  
27:834:71886:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:consider  the  relationship  between  portfolio  diversification  and non-financial   income   risk 
27:835:71986:21:22:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:hedging. This is represented by the correlation between our measures of portfolio diversification 
27:836:72084:22:24:72:543:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:and iΓ.  The  results  are  very  striking.  They  show  no  correlation  between  hedging  and  portfolio  
27:837:72192:24:20:72:542:601:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  for  the  low-wealth  investors  and  a  negative  correlation  for  the  high  wealth 
27:838:72296:20:21:72:543:581:12:Times:12:Times:B:households and for the entire sample. These results are very robust across different specifications 
27:839:72396:21:20:72:539:560:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  alternative  measures  of  portfolio  diversification.  This  suggests  that  the  portfolio  under-
27:840:72501:20:21:72:544:540:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification  is  not  due  to  the  need  to  hedge  non-financial income risk. Quite the contrary,  for  
27:841:72611:21:21:72:544:519:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  high  wealth  investors  the  negative  correlation  suggests  familiarity-based  investment  or 
27:842:72713:21:21:72:392:498:12:Times:12:Times:B:knowledge spill-over as an explanation for under-diversification.   
27:843:72780:21:21:108:544:477:12:Times:12:Times:A:Therefore,  the  relative  lack  of  diversification  in  cities  may  not  be  attributed  to  the  fact  
27:844:72887:21:20:72:543:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  cities  allow  investors  to  diversify  away  non-financial  income  risk  by  providing  them  with  
27:845:72996:20:21:72:544:436:12:Times:12:Times:B:alternative  occupational  and  professional  possibilities.  A  possible  rationalization  of  this  is  the  
27:846:73107:21:21:72:542:415:12:Times:12:Times:B:fact  that  investors  simply  do  not  use  their  financial  portfolio  to  hedge  against  non-financial 
27:847:73215:21:20:72:544:394:12:Times:12:Times:B:income  risk.  In  this  case,  the  process  of  knowledge  creation  that  takes  place  in  the  city  just  
27:848:73327:20:21:72:543:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:reduces  the  cost  of  search  and  increases  portfolio  diversification.  This  would  be  supported  by  
27:849:73436:21:20:72:544:353:12:Times:12:Times:B:recent  findings  showing  that  optimally  choose  not  to  hedge  but  invest  in  familiar  stocks  (Massa  
27:850:73547:20:21:72:180:333:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Simonov, 2002).   
27:851:73568:21:21:108:543:312:12:Times:12:Times:A:It  is  interesting to note the role played by borrowing constraints. They do not affect the 
27:852:73661:21:21:72:543:291:12:Times:12:Times:B:low-wealth  investors,  while  they  do  increase  portfolio  diversification  for  the  high-wealth  ones.  
27:853:73770:21:21:72:544:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:At the aggregate level they are positively related to D1 and D2 and not related to the other proxies 
27:854:73871:21:20:72:544:249:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  diversification.  This  apparently  counterintuitive  result  may  be  explained  as  follows.  For  the  
27:855:73981:20:21:72:544:229:12:Times:12:Times:B:low-wealth  investors,  borrowing  constraints  mostly  affect  the  decision  to  participate  in  the  stock  
27:856:74093:21:21:72:542:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:market. And indeed, from the estimation of equation 3)12 , we find that the borrowing constraints 
27:857:74191:21:20:72:543:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:negatively  affect  stock  market  participation  for  the  low-wealth  investors.  For  the  high-wealth 
27:858:74297:20:21:72:544:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors,  instead,  the  borrowing  constraints,  while  not  sufficient  to  prevent  stock  market 
27:859:74400:21:20:72:544:146:12:Times:12:Times:B:participation,  induce  the  investors  to  reduce  the  financial  exposure  of  their  portfolio.  This  
27:860:74507:20:39:72:408:126:12:Times:12:Times:B:additional prudence increases the degree of financial diversification.   
27:861:74579:39:9:216:219:87:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
27:862:74627:9:0:72:248:78:7:Times:10:Times:F:12 Not reported, but available upon request. 
28:863:74673:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:A:To  this  point,  both  the  limited  information  theory  and  the  city  agglomeration  ones  seem  
28:864:74775:21:20:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  be  supported  by  the  data.  However,  if  we  consider  variables  that  proxy  for  the  “degree  of  
28:865:74885:20:21:72:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:isolation”,  we  find  that,  all else equal, portfolio diversification increases  with  isolation.  That  is,  
28:866:74997:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  further  away  an  investor  is  from  an  urban  center,  the  lower  his  connection  to  the  rest  of  the  
28:867:75114:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:world  is  and  the  less  densely  populated  the  district  where  he  lives  is,  the  more  diversified  his  
28:868:75228:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio. In particular, one  standard  deviation  increase  in  population  density  leads  to  a  decrease  
28:869:75339:21:21:72:542:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  2.46%  in  the  number  of  risky  assets  held  (D1), a 1% increase in average correlation between 
28:870:75443:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:assets  (D2) and a 7.5-8%  increase  in  concentration  as  measured  by  D3 and D4. These results are 
28:871:75546:21:20:72:541:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:contrary  to  what  the  limited  information  theory  would  predict13,  while  they  are  consistent  with  
28:872:75656:20:21:72:375:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:the city-agglomeration and knowledge spill-over explanations. 
28:873:75717:21:21:108:544:502:12:Times:12:Times:A:To  sum  up,  the  local  district  affects  the  investors  in  two  ways,  on  the  one  hand,  the  
28:874:75820:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:process   of   professional   specialization   that   takes   place   in   the   city   reduces   the   drive   to 
28:875:75935:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:diversification. On the other hand, the very same of process of knowledge creation reduces the 
28:876:76030:21:20:72:542:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:search costs and may  also  increase  portfolio  diversification.  We  now move on to directly study 
28:877:76131:20:21:72:153:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio choice. 
28:878:76148:21:21:108:111:399:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
28:879:76148:21:21:72:262:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:6.2 Familiarity and city agglomeration 
28:880:76186:21:21:111:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:A: We regress our measures of familiarity – i.e., professional and geographical proximity – 
28:881:76274:21:20:72:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  the  proxies  for  local  professional  specialization,  local  prosperity,  financial  and  municipal 
28:882:76381:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:service  availability  and  the  non-financial  risk  variables,  as  well  as  a  set  of  control  variables  
28:883:76493:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:meant to control for investors’ idiosyncratic wealth, income and demographic characteristics and 
28:884:76590:21:20:72:246:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:for geographic and country shocks.  
28:885:76625:20:21:108:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:A:As before, we consider a specification based on the aggregated sample and one where the 
28:886:76713:21:20:72:543:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:sample  has  been  broken  down  into  high  and  low  wealth  investors.  The  results  are  reported  in  
28:887:76821:20:21:72:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:Tables  7-9.  In  particular,  Table  7  contains  the  main  specification  for  both  geographical  and  
28:888:76928:21:21:72:543:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:professional  proximity  for  the  entire  sample.  Tables  8  and  9  report  the  estimates  for  the  low  and  
28:889:77043:21:21:72:543:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:high wealth investors, for geographical and professional proximity respectively. For each class of 
28:890:77142:21:41:72:543:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:investors  we  consider  four  alternative  specifications  differing  on  the  basis  of  the  control 
28:891:77246:41:7:216:219:109:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
28:892:77294:7:16:72:541:102:7:Times:10:Times:F:13 They would actually lend some support to standard portfolio theory. Indeed, the more isolated the investor is, the 
28:893:77412:16:12:72:541:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:higher is the probability that he will not be able to hedge away his income or professional idiosyncratic shock and, 
28:894:77529:12:0:72:251:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:therefore, the more diversified he should be. 
29:895:77576:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables that are used. The results show that that the same variables that determine the degree of 
29:896:77676:21:20:72:483:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio under-diversification are also those which affect investors’ familiarity bias.  
29:897:77765:20:21:108:543:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:As  a  preliminary  check,  we  consider the  relationship  between  familiarity  and  hedging.  
29:898:77861:21:20:72:544:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:Our   working   hypothesis   is   that   familiarity   should   be   negatively   related   to   hedging   as 
29:899:77971:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:professional    specialization    induces    investment    in    stocks    that    are    professionally    and 
29:900:78083:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:geographically closer. This induces a behavior opposite to that required by hedging. And indeed, 
29:901:78180:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  relationship  between  our  measures  of  familiarity  and  the  indexes  of  non-financial risk show, 
29:902:78288:21:21:72:544:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:that,  as  expected,  hedging  is  negatively  related  to  familiarity.  That  is,  the  more  the  investors  
29:903:78400:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:choose  familiar  stocks,  the  more  they  tilt  their  financial  portfolio  away  from  the  optimal 
29:904:78504:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:composition required to hedge non-financial income risk. This suggests that familiarity is not due 
29:905:78603:21:21:72:131:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:to hedging.  
29:906:78615:21:20:108:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:A:Let  us  now  consider  our  measures  of  professional  specialization and city agglomeration. 
29:907:78711:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  main  finding  is  a  significant  positive  correlation  between  both  measures  of  familiarity  and  
29:908:78821:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:our  measures  of  professional  specialization.  This  relationship  is  strong,  statistically  significant  
29:909:78932:20:21:72:543:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:and holds across all the specifications,  for  the  overall  sample  and  for  both  classes  of  investors  in  
29:910:79045:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  case  of  competition  and  specialization.  It  is  less  significant  for  specialization.  This  may  be  
29:911:79159:21:21:72:543:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:due,  as  it  was  the  case  in  the  previous  section,  to  the  relatively  high  correlation  between  this  
29:912:79273:21:21:72:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:variable   and   the   diversity   variable.   These   results   suggest   that   the   higher   the   degree   of 
29:913:79388:21:20:72:544:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:professional  specialization  of  the  district,  the  more  the  investors  of  such  a  district  tend  to  invest  
29:914:79506:20:21:72:544:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  familiar  stocks.    This  holds  for  both  geographical  and  professional  proximity.  In  particular,  
29:915:79617:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:one  standard  deviation  increase  in  competition  (diversity)  results  in  the  portfolio  being  1.9  (1.7)  
29:916:79731:21:20:72:544:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:times  "closer"  to  the  investor  as  measured  by  value-weighted portfolio proximity. It also results 
29:917:79837:20:21:72:546:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:in increase of probability of investors choosing the professionally related stocks by 2.1% (6.0%).   
29:918:79937:21:20:108:544:233:12:Times:12:Times:A:If  we  then  consider  the  variables  that  proxy  for  the  degree  of  isolation,  we  find  that,  all 
29:919:80045:20:21:72:543:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:else  equal,   the   more   isolated   the   investors   are,   the   more   they   tend   to   invest   in   stocks 
29:920:80162:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:professionally  and  geographically  close  to  them.  That  is,  the  further  away  an  investor  is  from  a  
29:921:80275:21:21:72:544:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:big  center,  the  less  connected  he  is  to  the  rest  of  the  world  and  the  less  densely  populated  the  
29:922:80391:21:21:72:542:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:district  where  he  lives  is,  the  more  he  will  invest in nearby  stocks.  Living  in a municipality with 
29:923:80503:21:20:72:544:129:12:Times:12:Times:B:a  population  density  one  standard  deviation  away  from  the  national  mean  results  in  the  portfolio  
29:924:80615:20:21:72:543:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:being  1.6  times  closer  to  the investor.  These  results  hold  across  investors  (overall  and  for  the  
29:925:80727:21:0:72:312:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:different classes) and for different specifications.  
30:926:80782:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  findings  on  the  measures  of  local  prosperity  are  also  interesting.  Investment  in 
30:927:80879:21:20:72:544:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:familiar stocks increases with the number of new start-ups and the local sales profitability, while 
30:928:80979:20:21:72:542:668:12:Times:12:Times:B:it  decreases  with  the  number  of  local  bankruptcies,  number  of  active  enterprises  and  return  on  
30:929:81089:21:20:72:539:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:capital. Employment growth reduces familiarity for the low-wealth investors, while, for the high-
30:930:81186:20:21:72:544:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:wealth  investors,  it  reduces  familiarity  for  the  case  of  geographical  proximity  and  seems  to 
30:931:81292:21:21:72:544:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:increase  it  for  professional  proximity.  While  in  general  higher  prosperity  seems  to  reduce  the  
30:932:81401:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:impact  of  familiarity,  three  measures  of  prosperity –  new  start-ups,  bankruptcies  and  sales  
30:933:81505:21:21:72:545:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:profitability – seem to go in the opposite direction and increase familiarity.14 These variables are  
30:934:81607:21:20:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxies  for  the  “entrepreneurial  dimension”  of  the  district.  As  we  mentioned  before,  a  local  
30:935:81714:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:investor  in  Silicon  Valley  would  tend  to  invest  in  companies  that  are  geographically  and 
30:936:81815:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:professionally  close  to  him  due  to the fact  that  he  is  likely  to  be  linked  to  these  start-ups and to 
30:937:81931:21:20:72:544:481:12:Times:12:Times:B:their  profitability.  Therefore,  in  general,  local  prosperity  by  increasing  wealth  and,  therefore,  
30:938:82041:20:21:72:544:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  sophistication  reduces  the  impact  of  familiarity.  However,  if  local  prosperity  is  related 
30:939:82153:21:20:72:544:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  the  local  entrepreneurial  dimension  shared  by  the  investor,  the  mere  need  to  be  part  of  such  a  
30:940:82269:20:21:72:544:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:dimension  will  induce  the  investor  to  invest  in  such  shares.  Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  
30:941:82384:21:21:72:542:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:availability  of  financial  services  (bank  coverage)  in  general  reduces  familiarity15.  Indeed,  the 
30:942:82492:21:21:72:544:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:availability  of  financial  services  is  a  way  of  increasing  financial  sophistication  and  therefore  
30:943:82602:21:21:72:188:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:reducing the local bias.  
30:944:82627:21:20:108:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:These  results  are  consistent  with  the  previous  findings  on  portfolio  under-diversification 
30:945:82728:20:21:72:543:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:and   provide   a   direct   link   between   the   familiarity/limited   information   story   and   the   city 
30:946:82841:21:21:72:544:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:agglomeration  story.  They  suggest  that  the  tension  between  professional  specialization  and  
30:947:82943:21:20:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:prosperity  also  affects  the  exposure  to  the  familiarity  bias.  The  more  professionally specialized 
30:948:83052:20:21:72:544:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  investors  are  and  the  more  numerous  the  local  investment  opportunities  where  they  are  
30:949:83156:21:20:72:543:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:locally  involved  (i.e.,  local  entrepreneurial  dimension),  the  more  they  will  invest  in  closely 
30:950:83263:20:21:72:544:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:related  stocks.  In  contrast,  the  richer  and  more  prosperous  the  area  where  they  live,  the  greater  
30:951:83377:21:21:72:544:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  the  easier  the  access  to  information,  the  lower  is  the  search  cost  and  therefore  the  lower  is  
30:952:83493:21:27:72:234:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:the impact of the familiarity bias. 
30:953:83528:27:8:216:219:144:12:Times:12:Times:?:                                                 
30:954:83576:8:11:72:434:136:7:Times:10:Times:F:14 The only exception are the high-wealth investors for the case of professional proximity. 
30:955:83666:11:17:72:542:125:7:Times:10:Times:F:15 This is the case for both professional and geographical proximity for the low-wealth investors and for professional 
30:956:83784:17:11:72:541:108:10:Times:10:Times:F:proximity for the high-wealth investors. Instead, it decreases familiarity for the high-wealth investors in the case of 
30:957:83904:11:11:72:541:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:geographical  proximity.  For  the  latter  case,  we  do  not  have  a  fully  satisfactory  explanation.  We  may  argue that a 
30:958:84034:11:12:72:542:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:better local financial coverage provide them with a quick way to act on the basis of the inside knowledge provided 
30:959:84149:12:0:72:128:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:by proximity.

31:961:84164:21:20:72:132:688:12:Times:12:Times:B:Conclusion 
31:962:84174:20:21:108:546:668:12:Times:12:Times:A:In  this  paper  we  address  the  puzzle  of  portfolio  under-diversification  from  a  broader    
31:963:84275:21:20:72:543:647:12:Times:12:Times:B:perspective,  linking  it  to  theories  of  labor  and  the  urban  economy.    In  particular,  we  argue  that  
31:964:84390:20:21:72:538:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:portfolio under-diversification is closely related to factors linked to knowledge creation and spill-
31:965:84491:21:21:72:543:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:over  in  the  urban  environment.    We showed that the processes of professional specialization and 
31:966:84593:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:knowledge spillover that characterizes city agglomeration on the one hand reduce the availability 
31:967:84691:21:21:72:543:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  time  to  collect  and  analyze  financial  information  and  by  the  same  token  increases  the  relative 
31:968:84804:21:20:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:information that an investor has with respect to stocks closer – professionally or geographically – 
31:969:84903:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  him.    The  net  effect  of  these  two  factors  appears  to  be  that  investors  in  an  information-rich 
31:970:85017:21:21:72:525:502:12:Times:12:Times:B:urban professional environment   -- educated though they may be --  appear to diversify less.

32:972:85112:0:21:72:342:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:Appendix: Construction of income-related variables 
32:973:85162:21:13:72:75:688:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
32:974:85162:13:21:108:544:675:12:Times:12:Times:A:Here,  we  briefly  describe  the  methodology  we  follow  to  construct  proxies  for  permanent  
32:975:85262:21:21:72:544:654:12:Times:12:Times:B:non-financial  income,  its  volatility  and  its  correlation  to  financial  and  real  estate  income.  We  
32:976:85373:21:21:72:543:633:12:Times:12:Times:B:follow  the  approach  of  Carroll  and  Samwick  (1997)  and  Vissing-Jørgensen (2001). We consider 
32:977:85474:21:20:72:543:612:12:Times:12:Times:B:as  non-financial  income:  labor  income  and  entrepreneurial  income.  In  particular,  we  define  the  
32:978:85582:20:21:72:379:592:12:Times:12:Times:B:relevant moments of long term investor's non-financial income: 
32:979:85644:21:21:204:411:571:12:Times:12:Times:?:E(?it|?it-1, Xit-1), Var(?it|?it-1, Xit-1) and ?it, 
32:980:85695:21:20:72:544:550:12:Times:12:Times:B:where  ?it  is  the  non-financial  income  of  investor  i  at  time  t,  Xit-1  are  the  variables  that  can  be  
32:981:85813:20:21:72:543:530:12:Times:12:Times:B:used  to  predict  income  next  period  and  ?it  is  the  conditional  correlation  between  shocks  to  log  
32:982:85925:21:23:72:522:509:12:Times:12:Times:B:non-financial income and the log stock return. We assume that non-financial income follows: 
32:983:86016:23:21:273:342:486:12:Times:12:Batang:?:ln?it = pit+?it, 
32:984:86032:21:23:72:107:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:where: 
32:985:86038:23:21:202:412:442:12:Times:12:Times:?:pit = git+pit-1+?it, ?it~N(0,sεt2), ?it~N(0,s?i2), 
32:986:86088:21:23:72:94:421:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  
32:987:86092:23:21:161:453:398:12:Times:12:Times:?:cov(?it, ?is) = 0, cov(?it, ?is) = 0, cov(?it, ?is) = 0 for each t, s. 
32:988:86162:21:21:72:544:377:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  variable  pit  represents  the  permanent  income  component  of  non-financial  income.  It  has  a  
32:989:86269:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:B:drift  term  (git)  that  is  known  and  based  on  the  information  available  at  t-1.  This  allows  us  to  
32:990:86383:20:24:72:102:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:write: 
32:991:86389:24:20:192:422:312:12:Times:12:Times:?:ln?it-ln?it-1 = pit-pit-1+?it-?it-1  = git+ ?it-?it-1+?it , 
32:992:86448:20:22:72:84:292:11:Times:11:Times:F:or 
32:993:86450:22:21:258:422:270:12:Times:12:Batang:?:ln?it  = ln?it-1 + git+ ?it + ?it  - ?it-1 
32:994:86491:21:21:72:137:249:12:Times:12:Times:B:This implies: 
32:995:86504:21:20:175:438:228:12:Times:12:Times:?:E(?it|?it-1, Xit-1)   =   ln?it-1 + git  =  ?i,t-1 Git exp{Jit /2} 
32:996:86570:20:21:205:474:208:12:Times:12:Times:?:Var(?it|?it-1, Xit-1)   =  (?i,t-1 Git)2 exp(Jit) { exp(Jit) - 1}, 
32:997:86636:21:23:72:104:187:12:Times:11:Helvetica:B:where: 
32:998:86642:23:21:237:377:164:12:Times:12:Times:?:Git = exp(git), Jit =  s?i2+2s?i2 
32:999:86675:21:20:72:320:143:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Xi,t-1 is the set of variables usable to predict git. 
32:1000:86732:20:21:108:544:123:12:Times:12:Times:A:In  order  to  estimate  E(?it|?it-1, Xit-1)  and  Var(?it|?it-1, Xit-1), we  use  data  for  the  period  
32:1001:86839:21:21:72:544:102:12:Times:12:Times:B:1990-2000, with a 5-year lagged rolling window. Following the Carrol and Samwick (1997) and 
32:1002:86931:21:0:72:543:81:12:Times:12:Times:B:Vissing-Jørgensen  (2001)  methodologies,  we  regress  ln?it -  ln?it-1  on  the  set  of  explanatory  
33:1003:87038:0:23:72:543:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables  Xi,t-1  and  use  the  predicted  values  of  such  a  regression  as  an  estimate  of  git  and  the  
33:1004:87153:23:21:72:542:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:residuals  as  an  estimate  of  ?it+?it-?it-1.  The  correlation  between  financial  and  non-financial 
33:1005:87259:21:23:72:542:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:income  (?it)  is  constructed  as  the  conditional  correlation  between  shocks  to  log  non-financial 
33:1006:87366:23:21:72:543:642:12:Times:12:Times:B:income  (?it+?it-?it-1)  and  the  log  gross  stock  returns  (i.e.,  ln(1+Rt)).  We  use  rolling  five  year  
33:1007:87479:21:21:72:255:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:windows to estimate the parameters.   
33:1008:87516:21:21:108:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  set  of  variables  contained  in  Xi,t-1 are: demographic  variables  (secondary  education,  
33:1009:87616:21:20:72:544:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:higher  education,  age,  age  squared,  marriage  status,  size  of  the  household,  number  of  adults  
33:1010:87723:20:21:72:544:559:12:Times:12:Times:B:belonging  to  the  household),  changes  in  the  demographic  variables,  industry  dummies  for  the  
33:1011:87828:21:20:72:542:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:company  the  investor  is  working  for  (e.g.,  oil  industry),  dummies  for  the  type  of  profession  of  
33:1012:87940:20:21:72:543:518:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  investor  (e.g.,  doctor),  emigration  status.  Following  Vissing-Jørgensen  (2002a),  given  the  
33:1013:88046:21:21:72:544:497:12:Times:12:Times:B:potential inaccuracy of estimates based on few observations, we calculate the correlation over the 
33:1014:88145:21:0:72:141:476:12:Times:12:Times:B:entire sample.
