3:43:2574:23:16:70:531:709:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:The  post-communist  dairy  farming  in  Bulgaria  is  a  typical  example  for  the  
3:44:2660:16:16:70:538:693:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:domination    of    subsistence    and    small-scale    farms    with    no    or    little    
3:45:2756:16:16:70:529:677:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:commercialization  opportunities.  Moreover,  the  rapid  development  of  markets  
3:46:2840:16:16:70:530:661:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:and  institutional  environment  during  transition  and  EU  accession  put  serious  
3:47:2927:16:16:70:531:645:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:challenges  for  the  adaptation  of  the  majority  of  dairy  farms  and  processors.  
3:48:3016:16:16:70:530:629:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:Therefore,  a  positive  case  for  the  successful  inclusion  of  dairy  producers  in  
3:49:3106:16:22:70:487:613:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:marketing channels would be interesting to study and replicate elsewhere. 
3:50:3180:22:16:70:532:591:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:  This  paper  presents  a  business  model  for  an  effective  market  inclusion  of  
3:51:3268:16:17:70:529:575:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:numerous  small-scale  dairy  farms  from  Plovdiv  region  developed  by  a  private  
3:52:3355:17:16:70:530:558:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:entrepreneur.  “Dimitar  Madzarov”LTD  dairy  was  set  up  in  first  years  of  the  
3:53:3442:16:16:70:527:542:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:transition and successfully modernized up to the highest industry standards. This 
3:54:3524:16:16:70:535:526:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:enterprise   has   managed   to   adapt   to   dynamic   market   and   institutional

3:60:3976:16:16:70:528:424:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:the situation before the innovation. Next, we describe the content of the business 
3:61:4059:16:16:70:531:408:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:innovation.  After  that,  we  provide  the  evidence  of  inclusion  of  small-scale  
3:62:4146:16:17:70:528:392:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:producers. Then, we specify the drivers and the changes of inclusion. Later, we 
3:63:4226:17:16:70:528:375:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:assess the cost, the benefits, and the sustainability of inclusion. And finally, we 
3:64:4310:16:16:70:527:359:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:evaluate the possibilities for up-scaling and replication of the model, and suggest

16:618:39889:17:16:70:528:122:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:All these confirms a high efficiency and an extension of the trade relations with

17:624:40365:16:17:70:528:726:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:That positive effect is proved by the fact that the average number of heads of all

29:1261:70990:16:16:70:528:613:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:part of the managers efforts (BACHEV AND KAGATSUME, 2003). In contrast with 
29:1262:71066:16:16:70:534:597:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:the   common   situation   in   the   country   the   “marketing   of   product   takes   
29:1263:71156:16:16:70:528:581:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:insignificant costs” for the most surveyed farm. The later is a consequence of the 
29:1264:71239:16:17:70:533:565:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:higher  integration  with  “Dimitar  Madzarov”LTD  and  the  existence  of  an

29:1266:71403:16:16:70:528:532:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:between the farms and the Dairy. According to Ms.Madzarova the “relationships 
29:1267:71481:16:16:70:530:516:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:with  milk  suppliers”  accounts  for  a  significant  part  of  her  managerial  efforts.  
29:1268:71573:16:16:70:531:500:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:Apparently,  the  Dairy  bears  a  considerable  part  of  the  costs  for  improving  
29:1269:71660:16:22:70:258:484:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:governance of the bilateral trade. 
29:1270:71695:22:16:70:528:462:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:More than a half of the surveyed farms declare their intention to “extend current

29:1272:71858:16:16:70:527:430:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:Moreover, no farm intends to decrease the present farm size, concentrate on crop 
29:1273:71939:16:16:70:527:414:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:production, or change the type of farm. Besides, only few farms plan to focus on 
29:1274:72020:16:17:70:530:398:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:subsistence  farming  in  future.  Furthermore,  the  greatest  part  of  farms  has  in  
29:1275:72110:17:16:70:532:381:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:mind  to  “modernize  their  farm”.  What  is  more,  a  considerable  number  of  
29:1276:72193:16:16:70:529:365:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:farmers  envisage  “closer  integration  with  “Dimitar  Madzarov”LTD”.  Mr.  and  
29:1277:72276:16:16:70:531:349:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:Ms.Madzarovi  also  see  the  further  integration  with  the  chief  suppliers  as  a  
29:1278:72364:16:16:70:527:333:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:probable direction for the development. All these suggest a high sustainability of

29:1280:72538:16:16:70:527:301:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:since all experts assessments and trends show a low sustainability of a great part

29:1285:72905:16:17:70:530:215:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:indicate  that  a  great  part  of  the  dairy  farms  (especially  small-scale  operators)

31:1361:78012:16:16:70:529:311:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:be effectively met by the current suppliers. Most of them will adapt to the new 
31:1362:78092:16:16:70:528:295:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:EU requirements and extend their operation size. The farms and the Dairy have 
31:1363:78170:16:16:70:528:279:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:developed effective mechanisms to govern their relations (trust; communication,

31:1374:79065:16:16:70:528:96:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:market farming would considerably help in that respect. Since cow milk quotas 
31:1375:79143:16:0:70:529:80:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:are already exceeded with 10% nationwide, a further diversification into cheep,

32:1377:79318:16:22:70:238:742:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:be expected in smaller farms. 
32:1378:79348:22:17:70:530:720:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:The  effective  and  expending  business  model  of  “Dimitar  Madzarov”LTD  will

32:1380:79525:16:16:70:528:687:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:EU standards and the enhancement of competition would take out of business a

32:1385:79937:22:16:70:532:601:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:According  to  Mr.  and  Mr.Madzarovi  only  two  criteria  will  continue  to  be  
32:1386:80021:16:16:70:528:585:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:important for the selecting suppliers of the Dairy in future: “category of farms” 
32:1387:80103:16:16:70:528:569:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:and “milk quality”. Since smaller farms have serious difficulties adapting to the 
32:1388:80185:16:17:70:528:553:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:new EU requirements they can hardly manage to adapt to the new standards by

32:1390:80348:16:16:70:529:520:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:association along with the state support policy for milk producers is considered 
32:1391:80429:16:16:70:529:504:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:as extremely important. Also a further extension of the vertical integration with 
32:1392:80511:16:16:70:528:488:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:the suppliers is envisaged in the future. As far as the tighter integration with the 
32:1393:80596:16:16:70:534:472:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:buyers   of   dairy   products   is   concerned,   Madzarovs   do   not   perceive   any

32:1397:80840:17:16:70:530:369:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:for  an  effective  private  mode  for  inclusion  of  small-scale  dairy  farms  into  the

34:1460:85866:16:16:70:533:645:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f10:B:The  experience  shows  that  similar  conditions  are  quite  common  in  many  
34:1461:85947:16:22:70:228:629:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:countries around the world. 
34:1462:85975:22:16:70:531:607:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:An  effective  transfer  of  the  business  innovation  could  be  achieved  after  an  
34:1463:86063:16:16:70:530:591:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:appropriate  popularization  of  the  pace  and  the  factors  of  its  development.  Our  
34:1464:86154:16:16:70:528:575:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:recommendations to the prospective business entrepreneurs are to use “Dimitar

34:1466:86315:17:22:70:386:542:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:Crucial for the success of farmers integration would be: 
34:1467:86372:22:16:70:530:520:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:-  investment  in  relation-specific  capital  to  suppliers  such  as  good  reputation,  
34:1468:86463:16:22:70:418:504:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:near or on-farm milk collecting facilities, training of farmers; 
34:1469:86528:22:16:70:528:482:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:-  building  effective  communication,  stimulation,  control,  payment  and  sanction  
34:1470:86616:16:22:70:147:466:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:mechanisms; 
34:1471:86628:22:16:70:530:444:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:-  interlinking  marketing  of  milk  supply  by  farmers  with  the  credit  and  service  
34:1472:86720:16:22:70:188:428:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:supply by the dairy.  
34:1473:86742:22:16:70:528:406:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:All  these  would  develop  mutual  trust,  overcome  uncertainty  and  risk,  stimulate  
34:1474:86832:16:16:70:532:390:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:dairy  specific  investment  by  farmers  and  effective  adaptation  to  evolving  
34:1475:86916:16:17:70:530:374:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:requirements,  minimize  costs  of  transactions,  facilitate  and  intensify  bilateral

34:1477:87043:22:16:70:533:335:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:In   addition,   effective   public   and/or   international   assistance   policies   could   
34:1478:87138:16:16:70:530:319:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:considerably  accelerate  a  successful  replication.  In  that  respect,  a  number  of  
34:1479:87228:16:16:70:528:303:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:recommendations to the relevant government bodies and international assistance 
34:1480:87307:16:22:70:263:287:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:organizations could be suggested: 
34:1481:87341:22:16:70:536:265:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:Firstly, policies   should   be   directed   to   support   private   initiatives   and   
34:1482:87431:16:16:70:533:249:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:entrepreneurship   through   providing   information,   education,   advise,   sharing   
34:1483:87520:16:16:70:530:233:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:positive  (and negative)  experiences  as  well  as  assisting  financially  innovative  
34:1484:87609:16:22:70:239:217:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:small-scale business projects. 
34:1485:87640:22:16:70:528:195:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:Secondly, no restrictions have to be put on business entrepreneurs to invent and 
34:1486:87721:16:17:70:534:179:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:apply   effective   private   governing   modes   (special   contractual   agreements,

34:1488:87899:16:16:70:529:146:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:and  buyers  which  most  suit  to  the  particular  conditions  of  their  mutual  trade.  
34:1489:87991:16:16:70:529:130:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:Contrary,  the  public  intervention  is  to  be  focused  on  improvement  of  general  
34:1490:88080:16:16:70:529:114:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:regulations,  fight  against  “gray”  and  black  sectors,  execute  control  on  critical  
34:1491:88172:16:16:70:530:98:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:points  within  food  chain  (e.g.  food  safety),  effective  enforcement  of  laws  and  
34:1492:88263:16:0:70:528:82:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:private contracts, financial and other support to prospective joint initiatives. The 
35:1493:88350:0:16:76:530:758:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:A:later  is  particularly  important  as  far  as  new  ventures  aiming  at  inclusion  of  
35:1494:88441:16:22:70:422:742:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:small-scale farmers in the modern food chains are concerned.  
35:1495:88503:22:17:70:531:720:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:Third, identification  of  big  transaction  difficulties  (“failures”)  in  market  and  
35:1496:88593:17:16:70:529:703:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:private  transactions  between  farmers  and  processors,  and  a  third-party  (public,

35:1498:88777:16:16:70:529:671:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:information,  setting-up  and  enforcing  prospective  quality  and  safety  standards,

35:1500:88936:22:16:70:529:633:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:Forth, considerable  efforts  is  to  be  put  on  small-scale  farmers  information  on  
35:1501:89026:16:16:70:528:617:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:market and business opportunities, training in farm (business) management and 
35:1502:89104:16:16:70:530:601:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:contracting,  providing  technical  and  financial  assistance  for  adaptation  to  the  
35:1503:89194:16:16:70:528:585:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:new  consumers,  processors,  food  chains,  export,  and  institutional  requirements.  
35:1504:89283:16:16:70:530:569:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:For  instance,  public  premiums  for  high  quality  products  or  preferential  credits  
35:1505:89374:16:17:70:533:553:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:for   enlargement   and   modernization   of   farms   could   significantly   speed-up   
35:1506:89464:17:16:70:529:536:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:transformation.  In  order  to  guarantee  an  access  of  the  small-scale  (rather  than  
35:1507:89556:16:16:70:528:520:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:larger) producers in the public support program special criteria, tailored to their 
35:1508:89640:16:16:70:531:504:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:particular  conditions,  have  to  be  applied  –  e.g.  maximum  size,  a  particular  
35:1509:89728:16:16:70:534:488:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:structure   of   production,   available   cost-sharing   potential,   existing   project   
35:1510:89820:16:22:70:410:472:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:preparation capacity, feasible project implementation terms. 
35:1511:89881:22:16:70:528:450:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:Fifth, when certain “public goods” are to be supplied by farmers (preservation of 
35:1512:89963:16:16:70:532:434:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:environment  and  biodiversity,  keeping  traditional  productions  and  varieties)  
35:1513:90048:16:16:70:531:418:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:they  have  to  be  effectively  funded  by  the  state  budget.  Here  neither  pure  
35:1514:90135:16:16:70:530:402:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:administrative  measures  (“public  orders”)  nor  market  competition  and  private

35:1516:90311:17:16:70:531:369:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:productive”  investment  are  to  be  made  in  benefit  of  the  entire  food  chain  
35:1517:90398:16:16:70:529:353:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:(adaptation to new safety, hygiene, animal welfare etc. standards) then they are 
35:1518:90479:16:16:70:524:337:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:to be financed by the public or shared by all actors (farmers-processors-retailers-
35:1519:90562:16:22:70:171:321:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:final consumers). 
35:1520:90580:22:16:70:533:299:195:g_d0_f10:195:g_d0_f7:B:Finally,   public   support   is   to   be   provided   to   grouping,   cooperation,   and

35:1524:90925:16:16:70:529:235:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f7:B:is  to  embrace  larger  joint  initiatives  and  collective  actions  of  farmers  and  rural
