2:30:1426:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:China’s high corporate savings rate is commonly claimed to be a key driver for the country’s large
2:31:1524:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:current account surplus. The mainstream explanation for high corporate savings is a combination of
2:32:1622:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:windfall profits in state-owned firms, especially in resource sectors, and mis-governance of state-owned
2:33:1726:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:firms represented by their low dividend payout. The paper casts doubt on these views by comparing
2:34:1823:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:the savings of 1557 Chinese listed firms with those of 29330 listed firms from 51 other countries over
2:35:1925:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:2002 to 2007. First, Chinese firms do not have a significantly higher savings rate (as a share of total
2:36:2028:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:assets) than the global average because corporations in most countries have a high savings rate. The
2:37:2128:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:rising corporate savings rate is also consistent with a global trend. Second, there is no significant difference
2:38:2240:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:in the savings behavior and dividend patterns between Chinese majority state-owned and private listed
2:39:2341:14:42:72:261:462:12:Times:12:Times:firms, contrary to the received wisdom.

3:59:2725:0:31:85:165:719:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
3:60:2741:31:20:121:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:China’s  national  savings  rate,  at  50%  of  GDP  in  2007,  is  among  the  world’s  highest  
3:61:2839:20:21:85:542:668:144:Times:144:Times:for any economy of a significant size. This has been said to be an underlying cause of the U.S. 
3:62:2935:21:21:85:545:647:144:Times:144:Times:housing  price  bubble  during  2002-2007  (Bernanke,  2005;  and  Greenspan,  2009),  and  by  
3:63:3031:21:21:85:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:extension, of the current global financial crisis. This illustrates the attention that has been paid 
3:64:3132:21:20:85:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:to  global  implications  of  China’s  savings  issue.  It  is  therefore  useful  to  understand  China’s  
3:65:3240:20:31:85:172:585:144:Times:144:Times:high savings rate. 
3:66:3259:31:21:121:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:Several authors have noted that a significant part of China’s high national savings rate 
3:67:3348:21:20:85:545:533:144:Times:144:Times:come  from  its  large  corporate  savings,  which  by  2007  accounted  for  roughly  half  of  the  
3:68:3450:20:21:85:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:national savings. According to Hofman and Kuijs (2006), what makes China stands out is the 
3:69:3541:21:21:85:548:492:144:Times:144:Times:high   savings   by   its   enterprises.   Furthermore,   low   dividend   payments   by   state   owned   
3:70:3648:21:20:85:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:enterprises  (SOEs),  due  to  a  large-scale  agency  problem,  are  the  primary  cause  of  the  large  
3:71:3755:20:21:85:548:451:144:Times:144:Times:corporate   savings.   Martin   Wolf,   an   influential   Financial   Times   commentator,   asserts   
3:72:3859:21:21:85:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:(Financial  Times,  October  3,  2006)  “But  we  must  then  also  ask  why  China  is  running  such  
3:73:3963:21:20:85:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:large surpluses. ... the frugality of Chinese households is not the chief explanation for China’s 
3:74:4061:20:31:85:478:389:144:Times:144:Times:surplus savings ..., the principal explanation is China’s huge corporate savings.”   
3:75:4146:31:21:121:544:358:144:Times:144:Times:As far as we can see, the first claim – that the large corporate savings rate in China is 
3:76:4236:21:21:85:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:what drives its high national savings relative to other countries – is based on the flow-of-funds 
3:77:4334:21:20:85:546:316:144:Times:144:Times:data  released  by  China’s  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  (NBS),  which  cannot  be  checked  
3:78:4433:20:21:85:546:296:144:Times:144:Times:independently  by  a  third  party.  When  it  issued  revisions  to  the  flow  of  funds  data,  the  
3:79:4537:21:21:85:543:275:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude of the revisions could be large. For example, the recent revision in 2009 changed 
3:80:4629:21:20:85:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:the Chinese corporate savings in 2003 from 13% to 18% of GDP, or a revision on the order of 
3:81:4721:20:21:85:539:234:144:Times:144:Times:US$ 700 billion. The second claim – that a combination of windfall profits received by state-
3:82:4814:21:21:85:543:213:144:Times:144:Times:owned enterprises and their low dividend payout due to mis-governance – is based mostly on 
3:83:4905:21:20:85:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:a  hunch,  as  we  have  not  seen  any  study  that  formally  compares  the  profits  and  dividend  
3:84:5008:20:31:85:357:172:144:Times:144:Times:practices across Chinese firms by ownership and sector. 
3:85:5064:31:21:121:546:141:144:Times:144:Times:In  this  paper,  we  examine  these  claims  by  adopting  a  firm-level  cross-country  
3:86:5154:21:21:85:543:120:144:Times:144:Times:perspective: comparing the savings patterns between 1557 Chinese publicly listed firms with 
3:87:5246:21:20:85:546:99:144:Times:144:Times:29330  listed  firms  in  51  other  countries  during  2002-2007,  and  comparing  state-owned  
3:88:5343:20:21:85:543:79:144:Times:144:Times:enterprises with majority privately-owned firms within China. Unlike the NBS flow-of-funds 
3:89:5434:21:0:85:543:58:144:Times:144:Times:data, the financial statements of listed firms are at least subject to independent auditing. The 
4:90:5534:0:21:85:544:719:144:Times:144:Times:listed firms, collectively, are also  an  important  part  of  the  economy.  According  to  the  China  
4:91:5639:21:20:85:543:698:144:Times:144:Times:Security Regulatory Commission (October 4th, 2009), the profits of the listed firms’ revenues 
4:92:5733:20:21:85:545:678:144:Times:144:Times:accounted  for  37.7%  of  the  GDP  in  2008,  and  their  profits  accounted  for  36.3%  of  all  
4:93:5834:21:21:85:546:657:144:Times:144:Times:enterprise  profits.  As  far  as  we  know,  this  is  the  first  paper  that  adopts  the  firm-level  
4:94:5940:21:31:85:208:636:144:Times:144:Times:comparative perspective. 
4:95:5965:31:20:121:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:Our  results  cast  doubt  on  the  reliability  of  both  claims.  First,  we  find  that  Chinese  
4:96:6066:20:21:85:544:585:144:Times:144:Times:listed  firms  do  not  seem  to  have  higher  gross  savings  (as  a  share  of  total  assets)  than  listed  
4:97:6179:21:21:85:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:firms  in  other  countries  during  our  sample  period.  Moreover,  the  gross  savings  rate  for  a  
4:98:6284:21:20:85:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:typical  listed  Chinese  firm  declined  from  2002  to  2007,  albeit  insignificantly,  even  though  
4:99:6389:20:21:85:543:523:144:Times:144:Times:China’s  current  account  surplus  rose  significantly  over  the  same  period.  This  is  inconsistent  
4:100:6496:21:21:85:544:502:144:Times:144:Times:with  the  view  that  a  rise  in  the  corporate  savings  rate  drives  China’s  rising  current  account  
4:101:6606:21:20:85:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:surplus. Second, from a comparison of state-owned versus non-state Chinese firms, we do not 
4:102:6698:20:21:85:544:461:144:Times:144:Times:find  significant  differences  between  these  two  groups  in  terms  of  their  savings  and  dividend  
4:103:6805:21:21:85:534:440:144:Times:144:Times:patterns. If anything, privately owned firms appear to have a higher savings rate on average.  
4:104:6900:21:20:121:543:419:144:Times:144:Times:The finding that the Chinese corporate savings rates are not much higher than those in 
4:105:6987:20:21:85:546:399:144:Times:144:Times:other  countries  is  not  surprising  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  empirical  corporate  finance  
4:106:7088:21:21:85:544:378:144:Times:144:Times:literature  in  recent  years.  For  example,  J.P.  Morgan  (2005)  and  the  IMF  (2005)  have  noted  
4:107:7193:21:21:85:544:357:144:Times:144:Times:that  corporations  in  G-7  economies  have  all  exhibited  a  rise  in  undistributed  profits.  Bates,  
4:108:7301:21:20:85:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:Kahle and Stulz (2009) note that a typical firm in the United States had so much cash holdings 
4:109:7396:20:21:85:543:316:144:Times:144:Times:by 2005 that it could pay off its entire corporate debt and still have some cash left over.  The 
4:110:7493:21:21:85:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:corporate  finance  literature  does  not  presume  that  high  corporate  savings  per  se  reflect  
4:111:7595:21:20:85:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:inefficiency  or  corporate  mis-governance.  Indeed,  Bates  et  al.  hypothesize  that  it  could  be  a  
4:112:7703:20:21:85:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:rational  (optimal)  response  to  rising  working  capital  needs  faced  by  corporations.  Moreover,  
4:113:7808:21:21:85:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:Fama and French (2001) document a pattern of disappearing dividends in the U.S. from 1978 
4:114:7898:21:20:85:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:to  1999.  The  fraction  of  firms  paying  cash  dividends  falls  from  66.5%  in  1978  to  20.8% in 
4:115:8002:20:21:85:546:192:144:Times:144:Times:1999. Part of the reason is a rising population of small firms with strong growth opportunities.  
4:116:8100:21:21:85:543:171:144:Times:144:Times:Hoberg  and  Prabhala  (2007)  argue  that  a  rising  risk  and  therefore  an  increased  need  for  risk  
4:117:8209:21:21:85:545:150:144:Times:144:Times:control  are  the  main  explanation.  Interestingly,  the  studies  that  focus  on  Chinese  corporate  
4:118:8315:21:20:85:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:savings rates appear unaware of this literature and of the fact that the high corporate savings 
4:119:8411:20:21:85:329:109:144:Times:144:Times:rates in China are part of the global phenomenon.  
4:120:8462:21:21:121:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:The  firm-level  comparative  approach  in  this  paper  has  its  limitations.  In  particular,  it  
4:121:8564:21:0:85:545:67:144:Times:144:Times:doesn’t  account  for  unlisted  firms.  It  is  theoretically  possible  that  both  existing  claims  are  
5:122:8676:0:21:85:544:719:144:Times:144:Times:correct through the actions by non-listed  firms.  We  note,  however,  that  most  non-listed  firms  
5:123:8779:21:20:85:543:698:144:Times:144:Times:are private firms. If the savings by non-listed Chinese firms are much higher than non-listed 
5:124:8873:20:21:85:544:678:144:Times:144:Times:firms  in  other  countries,  it  is  unlikely  to  be  driven  primarily  by  the  mis-governance  issues  
5:125:8981:21:21:85:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:associated  with  state-owned  firms.  A  more  likely  candidate  would  be  financial  constraints  
5:126:9083:21:20:85:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:faced by privately-owned firms. In any case, our results should be interpreted with the caveat 
5:127:9178:20:21:85:322:616:144:Times:144:Times:that non-listed firms are not part of the analysis.2 
5:128:9230:21:21:121:545:595:144:Times:144:Times:Our  findings  have  important  implications  for  policy  discussions.  First,  the  existing  
5:129:9326:21:21:85:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:claims  advocate  that  state-owned  firms  need  to  pay  more  dividends.  But  if  they  save  for  
5:130:9429:21:20:85:543:553:144:Times:144:Times:whatever reasons that have led non-state-owned Chinese firms and firms in other countries to 
5:131:9522:20:21:85:545:533:144:Times:144:Times:save,  then  forcing  them  to  do  less  could  lower  economic  efficiency.  Second,  the  existing  
5:132:9625:21:21:85:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:claims have led to the view that Chinese corporate savings are the primary driver for its large 
5:133:9721:21:20:85:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:current  account  surplus,  and  a  reduction  in  corporate  savings  would  be  key  to  reducing  the  
5:134:9827:20:21:85:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:current account surplus. However, if the Chinese corporate savings rates are actually not much 
5:135:9922:21:21:85:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:higher than in other countries, then one needs to turn to households and government savings 
5:136:10014:21:20:85:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:in  understanding  cross-country  differences  in  national  savings.  As  an  analogy,  even  though  
5:137:10117:20:21:85:544:409:144:Times:144:Times:the skin is the biggest part of an elephant’s body, to understand why an elephant doesn’t run 
5:138:10211:21:21:85:542:388:144:Times:144:Times:as fast as a leopard, we would not want to focus on an elephant’s skin. Similarly, even though 
5:139:10306:21:21:85:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:Chinese corporate savings is the biggest part of its national savings, it need not be the driver 
5:140:10403:21:20:85:482:346:144:Times:144:Times:for why the Chinese national savings rate is so much higher than other countries.   
5:141:10487:20:21:121:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  in  the  following  way.  In  Section  2,  we  analyze  
5:142:10585:21:21:85:542:305:144:Times:144:Times:savings patterns with macro-level data based on flow of funds or national income accounts. In 
5:143:10679:21:20:85:543:284:144:Times:144:Times:Section 3, we turn to firm-level data when we have a much better way to control for various 
5:144:10771:20:21:85:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:determinants  of  corporate  savings,  and  can  separate  gross  versus  net  corporate  savings.  In  
5:145:10875:21:21:85:202:243:144:Times:144:Times:Section 4, we conclude. 
5:146:10899:21:107:121:124:222:144:Times:144:Times:

5:148:10959:19:18:85:542:96:42:Times:100:Times:2 Also, our results examine the level of savings but not the quality of its allocation.  Future research can further 
5:149:11076:18:13:85:544:78:100:Times:100:Times:examine  whether  Chinese  enterprises  use  their  savings  more  or  less  efficiently  than  firms  in  other  countries,  
5:150:11202:13:0:85:421:65:100:Times:100:Times:along the line suggested in Wurgler (2000) and Durnev, Morck, and Yeung (2004). 
6:151:11285:0:31:85:345:719:144:Times:144:Times:2.  The  Patterns  from  the  Flow-of-Funds  Data  
6:152:11336:31:20:121:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:We start by presenting patterns of corporate savings rates from the flow-of-funds data 
6:153:11423:20:21:85:545:668:144:Times:144:Times:for  China  from  the  CEIC  dataset  from  1992  to  2007  (the  latest  available  data),  the  same  
6:154:11527:21:21:85:545:647:144:Times:144:Times:dataset  used  in  Hofman  and  Kuijs  (2006)  and  virtually  all  other  papers  on  the  topic  in  the  
6:155:11635:21:21:85:545:626:144:Times:144:Times:literature.  Figure  1  presents  China’s  national  savings  rate  (total  savings/GDP)  during  this  
6:156:11739:21:20:85:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:period,  and  decomposes  it  into  gross  corporate  savings,  gross  household  savings  and  gross  
6:157:11842:20:21:85:545:585:144:Times:144:Times:government  savings.  Corporate  as  a  share  of  GDP  rose  over  time  from  11.7%  in  1992  
6:158:11939:21:21:85:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:onwards, peaked at 23.5% in 2004, and declined gradually thereafter to 18.8% in 2007.  The 
6:159:12030:21:20:85:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:household  savings  as  a  share  of  GDP  experienced  more  ups  and  downs.  It  became  less  
6:160:12128:20:21:85:545:523:144:Times:144:Times:important  than  corporate  savings  in  2003  and  2004,  but  exceeded  corporate  savings  again  
6:161:12229:21:31:85:140:502:144:Times:144:Times:after 2005. 
6:162:12241:31:20:121:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:In spite of limitations about the flow-of-funds data, it may be useful to perform some 
6:163:12328:20:21:85:545:451:144:Times:144:Times:simple  cross  country  comparisons  based  on  the  macro  data.    The  top  panel  of  Figure  2  
6:164:12429:21:21:85:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:compares  the  aggregate  corporate  gross  savings  (as  a  share  of  assets)  from  1995-2007  for  
6:165:12532:21:20:85:546:409:144:Times:144:Times:China,  Japan,  Korea,  Germany,  Australia,  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States.  The  
6:166:12628:20:21:85:545:389:144:Times:144:Times:Chinese  data  show  a  faster  increase  in  the  savings  rate  up  to  2004  which  then  started  to  
6:167:12734:21:21:85:543:368:144:Times:144:Times:decline  in  the  next  three  years.  Note  that  the  corporate  savings  rates  in  Japan  and  Korea  are  
6:168:12845:21:21:85:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:higher than China’s in every year during the sample period. In fact, in most years, the Chinese 
6:169:12941:21:20:85:543:326:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate gross corporate savings rate tends to be lower than the Japanese corporate savings 
6:170:13034:20:21:85:543:306:144:Times:144:Times:rate by about 5% of GDP, and lower than the Korean corporate savings rate by about 10% of 
6:171:13124:21:31:85:115:285:144:Times:144:Times:GDP. 
6:172:13129:31:20:121:546:254:144:Times:144:Times:The  lower  panel  of  Figure  2  plots  the  net  savings  rates  (gross  savings/asset  –  
6:173:13222:20:21:85:544:234:144:Times:144:Times:investment/asset) for the same set of countries. The most striking feature is  that  China  is  the  
6:174:13323:21:21:85:544:213:144:Times:144:Times:only  economy  in  the  group  that  has  a  significantly  negative  net  savings  rate  in  every  single  
6:175:13432:21:20:85:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:year.  This  reflects  not  only  the  high  investment  rates  in  China,  but  also  the  greater  desire  to  
6:176:13545:20:21:85:543:172:144:Times:144:Times:hoard cash by firms in other economies (rather than to invest or to issue dividends).  Overall, 
6:177:13641:21:21:85:543:151:144:Times:144:Times:what stands out the most is not how much more Chinese firms save than their counterparts in 
6:178:13733:21:21:85:543:130:144:Times:144:Times:other economies, but how much less they save, conditional on the investment need. (One may 
6:179:13824:21:20:85:543:109:144:Times:144:Times:argue about whether Chinese investment is more or less efficient than investments elsewhere, 
6:180:13917:20:21:85:543:89:144:Times:144:Times:but one cannot conclude that the corporate sector in China, on net, has contributed more to its 
6:181:14013:21:0:85:368:68:144:Times:144:Times:current account than their counterparts in other countries.) 
7:182:14077:0:21:121:550:719:144:Times:144:Times:Besides  corporate  savings,  the  other  two   components   of   national   savings   are   
7:183:14170:21:20:85:545:698:144:Times:144:Times:household  savings  and  government  savings.  Figure  3  plots  the  time  series  of  these  two  
7:184:14270:20:21:85:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:components for China and the other countries.  For household savings as a share of GDP, it is 
7:185:14364:21:21:85:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:clear that China is in a league of its own. It is often higher than the average of the rest of the 
7:186:14463:21:20:85:546:636:144:Times:144:Times:group  by  10%  of  GDP,  and  higher  than  the  next  highest  country  by  5%  of  GDP.  For  
7:187:14560:20:21:85:545:616:144:Times:144:Times:government  savings,  China  is  one  of  the  three  highest  countries  in  recent  years.  For  most  
7:188:14665:21:31:85:470:595:144:Times:144:Times:years, however, Korea has been the clear leader in the government savings rate. 
7:189:14745:31:21:121:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:  To  summarize,  even  if  one  takes  the  flow-of-funds  data  at  face  value,  it  is  not  clear  
7:190:14849:21:20:85:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:that China’s corporate sector is the biggest contributor to the country’s current account surplus, 
7:191:14948:20:21:85:543:523:144:Times:144:Times:once one adopts a country-country perspective, especially when one looks at the net corporate 
7:192:15042:21:21:85:546:502:144:Times:144:Times:savings  rate.  Both  household  and  government  savings  must  have  played  a  quantitatively  
7:193:15140:21:30:85:344:481:144:Times:144:Times:important role in driving the current account balance.

7:195:15195:31:31:85:266:420:144:Times:144:Times:3. A Close Look at Firm-level Data 
7:196:15230:31:30:85:241:389:144:Times:144:Times:3.1 Data and summary statistics 
7:197:15261:30:21:121:543:359:144:Times:144:Times:We employ data on 1557 publicly listed firms in China and compare them with 29330 
7:198:15343:21:21:85:544:338:144:Times:144:Times:firms  in  51  other  countries  from  2002  to  2007.  The  data  source  is  the  Worldscope.  Table  1  
7:199:15450:21:21:85:547:317:144:Times:144:Times:presents  the  number  of  firms  for  each  country  in  our  sample,  together  with  national  
7:200:15548:21:20:85:545:296:144:Times:144:Times:savings/GDP,  investment/GDP,  current  account/GDP,  and  government  fiscal  balance/GDP,  
7:201:15641:20:31:85:220:276:144:Times:144:Times:averaged over 2005-2007.   
7:202:15668:31:21:121:546:245:144:Times:144:Times:A  major  advantage  of  examining  firm-level  data  is  that  we  can  better  control  for  
7:203:15763:21:20:85:539:224:144:Times:144:Times:determinants of corporate savings. An important drawback is that we exclude savings by non-
7:204:15854:20:21:85:547:204:144:Times:144:Times:listed  firms.  However,  if  the  principal  reason  for  high  corporate  savings  in  China  is  
7:205:15954:21:21:85:545:183:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesized  to  be  the  high  savings  rates  of  its  majority  state-owned  firms,  we  have  an  
7:206:16057:21:20:85:544:162:144:Times:144:Times:opportunity  to  observe  this  even  with  publicly  listed  firms  only,  since  most  big  state-owned  
7:207:16164:20:0:85:190:142:144:Times:144:Times:firms are now listed.  
8:208:16190:0:21:121:546:719:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 lists the summary statistics for variables  on  corporate  savings.    We  define  
8:209:16281:21:20:85:544:698:144:Times:144:Times:firm  gross  savings  as  profits  minus  dividends.3  Profit  is  defined  as  Net  Income  (WS  01551)  
8:210:16387:20:21:85:547:678:144:Times:144:Times:plus Depreciation (WS01151).  Dividends are the sum of cash preferred dividends (WS 05401) 
8:211:16478:21:21:85:545:657:144:Times:144:Times:and  cash  common  dividends  (WS  05376).  The  net  savings  is  gross  savings  minus  capital  
8:212:16577:21:20:85:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:expenditure  (WS  04601).  For  Chinese  listed  companies,  cash  dividends  are  the  product  of  
8:213:16678:20:21:85:542:616:144:Times:144:Times:dividends per share (WS05101) and the number of common shares (WS05301, which includes 
8:214:16765:21:21:85:545:595:144:Times:144:Times:both  tradable  and  non-tradable  shares).  To  conduct  comparisons  across  firm  ownership,  we  
8:215:16866:21:21:85:539:574:144:Times:144:Times:classify  a  firm  as  majority  state-owned  if  the  state  is  the  largest  shareholder  (when  non-
8:216:16970:21:30:85:277:553:144:Times:144:Times:tradable shares are also considered).      
8:217:17013:30:21:121:545:523:144:Times:144:Times:We  define  gross  or  net  savings  rate  as  savings  relative  to  gross  asset,  rather  than  
8:218:17112:21:21:85:544:502:144:Times:144:Times:savings  relative  to  profit,  because  firm-level  profits  can  be  zero  or  negative.  Table  2  reports  
8:219:17223:21:20:85:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:the summary statistics on the gross savings rate (gross savings/assets), its components (profit 
8:220:17319:20:21:85:545:461:144:Times:144:Times:rate  and  dividend  rate),  investment/asset,  and  net  savings/asset  for  non-financial  firms  in  
8:221:17423:21:21:85:546:440:144:Times:144:Times:China  and  other  regions  of  the  world.  A  few  features  are  noteworthy.  First,  while  the  
8:222:17524:21:20:85:544:419:144:Times:144:Times:corporate  savings  rates  in  Asia  are  somewhat  higher  on  average  than  those  outside  Asia,  the  
8:223:17631:20:21:85:545:399:144:Times:144:Times:savings  rates  by  Chinese  firms  are  not  different  from  those  in  other  Asian  economies4.  
8:224:17732:21:21:85:543:378:144:Times:144:Times:Second, within China, there is no significant difference between majority state-owned Chinese 
8:225:17826:21:31:85:534:357:144:Times:144:Times:firms and majority privately-owned Chinese firms in their median gross or net savings rates.  
8:226:17920:31:20:121:543:326:144:Times:144:Times:We  can  also  compare  dividend  payout  practices  in  Table  2.  An  important  feature  for  
8:227:18017:20:21:85:545:306:144:Times:144:Times:our  purpose  is  that  an  average  or  median  Chinese  firm  issues  dividends  no  less  than  its  
8:228:18121:21:21:85:543:285:144:Times:144:Times:counterparts in other countries. The median/mean of dividends over assets is 0.005/0.016 for 
8:229:18214:21:20:85:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:Chinese  firms,  compared  to  0/0.011  for  firms  in  other  countries.  The  percentage  of  Chinese  
8:230:18319:20:21:85:544:244:144:Times:144:Times:firms  issuing  dividends  was  52%  in  2007,  while  the  comparable  number  for  the  rest  of  the  
8:231:18424:21:16:85:546:223:144:Times:144:Times:world  was  49%.    In  other  worlds,  while  it  is  true  that  many  Chinese  firms  do  not  pay  
8:232:18527:16:20:85:231:207:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
8:233:18587:20:16:85:542:187:49:g_d0_f5:100:Times:3 We adopt this definition of firm-level corporate savings to match more closely with that of aggregate corporate 
8:234:18701:16:12:85:543:171:100:Times:100:Times:savings  in  the  flow  of  funds  data.  The  definition  of  corporate  savings  could  be  different  in  other  settings.  For  
8:235:18833:12:11:85:542:159:100:Times:100:Times:example, if the question is related to a corporation’s access to liquidity, then it would be appropriate to include 
8:236:18949:11:12:85:543:148:100:Times:100:Times:minority  stock  investment  and  inter-corporate  loans  in  addition  to  deposit  and  internal  cash  as  savings.  To  the  
8:237:19078:12:11:85:544:136:100:Times:100:Times:extent  that  these  financial  assets  are  liquid  and  significant,  corporate  savings  may  be  higher  than  currently  
8:238:19204:11:12:85:543:125:100:Times:100:Times:reported  under  our  definition.  Also,  due  to  data  limitation,  we  cannot  address  issues  like  the  contributions  to  
8:239:19333:12:11:85:544:113:100:Times:100:Times:enterprise  savings  of  cross-holdings,  subsidiary-to-parent  SOE  dividends,  repos,  M&A,  plausible  tunneling  
8:240:19450:11:12:85:168:102:100:Times:100:Times:scenarios, FDI, etc.  
8:241:19472:12:7:85:88:90:100:Times:100:Times: 
8:242:19472:7:18:85:534:83:42:g_d0_f7:100:Times:4 The difference in the corporate savings rates between Asia and the rest of the world lies in the mean but not in 
8:243:19587:18:0:85:398:65:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:the median, suggesting that the difference in mean is driven by a few outliers. 
9:244:19670:0:21:85:548:719:144:Times:144:Times:dividends,  it  is  part  of  the  common   corporate   practice   around   the   world5.   In   addition,   
9:245:19779:21:20:85:543:698:144:Times:144:Times:considering that the Chinese economy is growing at a faster rate than most economies in the 
9:246:19871:20:21:85:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:world, indicative of better investment opportunities in China, the optimal dividend payout in 
9:247:19965:21:21:85:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:China  can  be  expected  to  be  lower  than  elsewhere.  A  second  interesting  feature  comes  from  
9:248:20070:21:20:85:545:636:144:Times:144:Times:comparing  the  dividends  of  state-owned  Chinese  companies  with  those  of  non-state-owned  
9:249:20168:20:21:85:539:616:144:Times:144:Times:Chinese  companies.  State-owned  companies  issue  slightly  larger  dividends  than  non-state-
9:250:20265:21:21:85:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:owned companies. In 2007, 56% of state-owned companies issued cash dividends, while 45% 
9:251:20353:21:21:85:543:574:144:Times:144:Times:non-state-owned companies did the same. Hence the mainstream view that state-owned firms 
9:252:20442:21:20:85:543:553:144:Times:144:Times:are  particularly  reluctant  to  issue  dividends  due  to  mis-governance  is  not  consistent  with  the  
9:253:20551:20:31:85:183:533:144:Times:144:Times:summary statistics.  
9:254:20572:31:21:121:543:502:144:Times:144:Times: Corporate savings rates are affected by firm size and other factors. For example, firms 
9:255:20661:21:20:85:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:in  resource  sectors  may  have  extra  savings  due  to  commodity  price  booms  in  the  past  few  
9:256:20765:20:21:85:543:461:144:Times:144:Times:years. Also, firms in sectors with an intrinsically higher demand for external finance may also 
9:257:20861:21:21:85:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:save  more.  To  control  for  these  possibilities,  we  now  use  econometric  analyses  to  examine  
9:258:20965:21:30:85:324:419:144:Times:144:Times:whether Chinese listed firms have more savings.

9:260:21014:31:31:85:234:358:144:Times:144:Times:3.2 Econometric Specification 
9:261:21043:31:35:121:345:327:144:Times:144:Times:We start with a model for gross savings rate:

9:264:21302:21:21:85:543:240:145:Times:145:Times:measured in current US dollars. Sector dummies are at the 3-digit level based on US Standard 
9:265:21395:21:21:85:544:219:145:Times:145:Times:Industrial  Classification  (SIC  1987).  There  are  373  three-digit  (non-financial)  sectors  in  the  
9:266:21502:21:20:85:543:198:145:Times:145:Times:sample.  Year dummies control for the global trend. Based on this model, we will also check 
9:267:21594:20:21:85:545:178:145:Times:145:Times:whether  gross  savings  between  Chinese  state-owned  and  non-state-owned  companies  are  
9:268:21688:21:41:85:210:157:145:Times:145:Times:systematically different.

9:270:21776:19:19:85:542:97:42:g_d0_f7:100:Times:5 An article in the Economist magazine (Oct 3rd, 2009) mocked the dividend practices of Chinese firms by noting 
9:271:21888:19:13:85:543:78:100:Times:100:Times:that  “almost  45%  of  listed  companies  did  not  pay  a  dividend  last  year,”  without  apparently  realizing  that  the  
9:272:22016:13:0:85:347:65:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:pattern was consistent with corporate practices around the world. 
10:273:22085:0:21:121:549:719:145:Times:145:Times:We           perform           cross-country           comparisons   of   the   components   of   gross   
10:274:22191:21:20:85:544:698:145:Times:145:Times:savings:  profits  and  dividends,  using  the  same  specification  as  above.  Finally,  we  perform  
10:275:22295:20:21:85:546:678:145:Times:145:Times:comparisons  of  investment  rate  and  net  corporate  savings.  To  summarize,  we  conduct  a  
10:276:22393:21:21:85:545:657:145:Times:145:Times:sequence  of  conditional  comparisons,  using  specification  (1),  but  each  component  of  the

10:283:22687:31:21:121:545:504:145:Times:145:Times:In  Table  3,  we  report  the  results  from  a  regression  analysis  where  we  control  for  
10:284:22784:21:21:85:545:483:145:Times:145:Times:determinants  of  corporate  savings.  We  cluster  the  standard  errors  at  the  country  level.  In  
10:285:22889:21:21:85:545:462:145:Times:145:Times:Column  1,  we  compare  China  with  the  rest  of  the  world.    Chinese  firms  have  a  higher  
10:286:22990:21:20:85:547:441:145:Times:145:Times:coefficient  of  gross  savings  (as  a  share  of  gross  assets)  than  other  countries,  but  not  
10:287:23093:20:31:85:205:421:145:Times:145:Times:statistically significant.   
10:288:23122:31:21:121:543:390:145:Times:145:Times:We then compare China with each country by adding 51 country dummies, except for 
10:289:23203:21:20:85:545:369:145:Times:145:Times:the  U.S.  which  serves  as  our  baseline  case.  For  21  countries  with  the  largest  numbers  of  
10:290:23308:20:21:85:544:349:145:Times:145:Times:observations,  we  plot  their  coefficients  in  Figure  4.  We  find  that,  conditional  on  sector  and  
10:291:23417:21:21:85:544:328:145:Times:145:Times:year fixed effects and firm size, the average Chinese corporate savings rate (0.44) is close to 
10:292:23513:21:20:85:545:307:145:Times:145:Times:the  median  of  the  spectrum.  Corporations  in  India  (0.74),  Australia  (0.63)  and  the  United  
10:293:23617:20:21:85:545:287:145:Times:145:Times:Kingdom  (0.46)  all  have  higher  gross  savings  rates.  Meanwhile,  these  three  countries  all  
10:294:23719:21:21:85:545:266:145:Times:145:Times:experienced  a  current  account  deficit  during  the  sample  period.  From  2004  to  2007,  the  
10:295:23820:21:21:85:544:245:145:Times:145:Times:average  current  deficit  over  GDP  was  -1%,  -6%  and  -3%  for  India,  Australia  and  the  UK  
10:296:23922:21:20:85:543:224:145:Times:145:Times:respectively. This illustrates the idea that even with a high corporate savings rate, there need 
10:297:24019:20:31:85:244:204:145:Times:145:Times:not be a current account surplus. 
10:298:24053:31:21:121:544:173:145:Times:145:Times:Figure 4 helps to address the power of the test for the China dummy in Column 1. In 
10:299:24137:21:20:85:546:152:145:Times:145:Times:Column  1,  the  coefficient  of  the  China  dummy  is  insignificant,  so  we  cannot  reject  the  
10:300:24239:20:21:85:545:132:145:Times:145:Times:hypothesis  that  Chinese  firms  behave  in  the  same  way  as  firms  in  other  countries.    But  a  
10:301:24345:21:21:85:546:111:145:Times:145:Times:problem  of  Type  I  versus  Type  II  errors  means  we  can't  necessarily  conclude  that  the  
10:302:24445:21:20:85:545:90:145:Times:145:Times:coefficient  definitively  equals  zero  either,  and  the  data  might  be  too  noisy  to  allow  any  
10:303:24550:20:0:85:547:70:145:Times:145:Times:conclusion.  Figure  4  alleviates  this  concern  by  estimating  the  coefficient  for  each  country.    
11:304:24662:0:21:85:547:719:145:Times:145:Times:We find that China’s corporate savings rate is  not  different  from  the  global  average  after  
11:305:24761:21:30:85:459:698:145:Times:145:Times:comparing the magnitude of the China dummy with those of other countries.  
11:306:24836:30:21:121:543:668:145:Times:145:Times:So far we look at the average effect over the sample period. In Column 2, we examine 
11:307:24921:21:21:85:543:647:145:Times:145:Times:the trend in Chinese firms’ gross savings by interacting the time trend with the China dummy. 
11:308:25015:21:21:85:544:626:145:Times:145:Times:This  interaction  is  negative  (but  insignificant),  suggesting  that  the  gross  savings  of  Chinese  
11:309:25123:21:20:85:543:605:145:Times:145:Times:firms did not rise from 2002 to 2007. This pattern of a relatively flat time profile of corporate 
11:310:25221:20:21:85:545:585:145:Times:145:Times:savings  contrasts  with  the  profile  of  China’s  current  account  surplus,  which  rose  gradually  
11:311:25326:21:21:85:542:564:145:Times:145:Times:from 2002 to 2004 and more dramatically after 2005.  This is an additional feature of the data 
11:312:25421:21:20:85:544:543:145:Times:145:Times:suggesting  that  China’s  corporate  savings  rates  (relative  to  corporate  savings  rates  in  other  
11:313:25528:20:31:85:443:523:145:Times:145:Times:countries) did not go up in tandem with its rising current account surplus.  
11:314:25605:31:21:121:553:492:145:Times:145:Times:We   now   compare   state-owned   versus   non-state-owned   firms   in   Column   3.      
11:315:25697:21:20:85:543:471:145:Times:145:Times:Conditional  on  sector  and  time  fixed  effects  and  firm  size,  there  is  no  significant  difference  
11:316:25807:20:21:85:545:451:145:Times:145:Times:between  the  two  groups,  which  is  consistent  with  the  unconditional  pattern  in  Table  2.  In  
11:317:25912:21:21:85:543:430:145:Times:145:Times:Column 4, we look at the time pattern by adding the interaction of time trend and state-owned 
11:318:26006:21:20:85:543:409:145:Times:145:Times:dummy. This interaction has a negative coefficient and is significantly different from zero at 
11:319:26101:20:21:85:545:389:145:Times:145:Times:the  10%  level.  Meanwhile,  the  state-ownership  dummy  has  a  weakly  positive  coefficient.  
11:320:26200:21:21:85:544:368:145:Times:145:Times:Taken  together,  this  suggests  that  state-owned  companies  have  slightly  higher  gross  savings  
11:321:26304:21:21:85:543:347:145:Times:145:Times:rates than private firms at the beginning of the sample period, but the gap declines gradually 
11:322:26399:21:30:85:195:326:145:Times:145:Times:to become negligible.  
11:323:26422:30:21:121:544:296:145:Times:145:Times:   As  corporate  savings  is  the  difference  between  profits  and  dividend  payout,  we  now  
11:324:26520:21:21:85:279:275:145:Times:145:Times:look at the two components separately.  
11:325:26560:21:20:85:88:254:145:Times:145:Times: 
11:326:26560:20:21:85:349:234:145:Times:145:Times:3.4 Decomposing gross savings: Profits and dividends 
11:327:26612:21:21:121:543:213:145:Times:145:Times:The patterns of coefficients for profits in Table 4 are similar to those for gross savings 
11:328:26703:21:20:85:543:192:145:Times:145:Times:rates. China’s firms have somewhat higher profit but not significantly so (Column 1 of Table 
11:329:26796:20:21:85:544:172:145:Times:145:Times:4).  To  find  the  country-level  conditional  average  dividend  rate,  we  perform  a  version  of  the  
11:330:26904:21:21:85:543:151:145:Times:145:Times:regression in Column 1 by adding individual country dummies (regression results not reported 
11:331:26997:21:21:85:544:130:145:Times:145:Times:to  save  space).  We  plot  the  estimated  individual  country  fixed  effects  in  the  top  panel  of  
11:332:27104:21:20:85:543:109:145:Times:145:Times:Figure 5. China, while below the median, is not far from it. India, Australia and the U.K. still 
11:333:27201:20:0:85:315:89:145:Times:145:Times:have higher profit over asset ratios than China.  
12:334:27255:0:21:121:546:719:145:Times:145:Times:  In  Column  2  of  Table  4,  we  compare  the  trend  in  China’s  corporate  profits  rates  
12:335:27352:21:20:85:545:698:145:Times:145:Times:during  2002  to  2007  to  the  global  time  fixed  effects.    The  coefficient  on  the  interaction  
12:336:27458:20:21:85:543:678:145:Times:145:Times:between the China dummy and the time trend is statistically insignificant, suggesting that the 
12:337:27553:21:31:85:492:657:145:Times:145:Times:time profile of Chinese firms’ profit rates is not that different from the global trend.  
12:338:27643:31:21:121:544:626:145:Times:145:Times:In  Column  3  of  Table  4,  we  compare  majority  state-owned  versus  non-state-owned  
12:339:27734:21:20:85:539:605:145:Times:145:Times:firms within China. We find that majority state-owned firms have a similar profit ratio as non-
12:340:27829:20:21:85:543:585:145:Times:145:Times:state-owned  companies  over  the  sample  period.  To  see  the  time  trend,  we  add  an  interaction  
12:341:27935:21:21:85:544:564:145:Times:145:Times:term  between  the  state-ownership  dummy  and  the  time  trend.  It  appears  that  the  majority  
12:342:28037:21:20:85:543:543:145:Times:145:Times:state-owned firms used to have a higher profit rate than majority private-owned firms, but the 
12:343:28132:20:31:85:345:523:145:Times:145:Times:pattern reversed in the later part of the sample period. 
12:344:28189:31:21:121:543:492:145:Times:145:Times:Now we look at the dividend practices conditional on sector and year fixed effects and 
12:345:28276:21:20:85:545:471:145:Times:145:Times:firm  size  (Table  5).  The  coefficient  for  the  China  dummy  is  positive  but  insignificant,  
12:346:28378:20:21:85:545:451:145:Times:145:Times:suggesting  that  Chinese  firms  issue  dividends  at  an  amount  at  least  as  large  as  the  global  
12:347:28485:21:21:85:543:430:145:Times:145:Times:average. To find the country-level conditional average dividend rate, we perform a version of 
12:348:28579:21:20:85:544:409:145:Times:145:Times:the  regression  in  Column  1  by  adding  individual  country  dummies  (regression  results  not  
12:349:28680:20:21:85:544:389:145:Times:145:Times:reported).  The  estimates  of  the  individual  country  effects  are  plotted  in  the  bottom  panel  of  
12:350:28789:21:21:85:545:368:145:Times:145:Times:Figure  5.  There,  Chinese  firms’  conditional  dividend  payoff  rates,  on  average,  lie  in  the  
12:351:28893:21:21:85:544:347:145:Times:145:Times:middle:  for  example,  they  are  larger  than  those  in  France,  Germany,  Korea,  Japan  and  the  
12:352:28997:21:30:85:454:326:145:Times:145:Times:United States, but smaller than Thailand, South Africa, Brazil, and Sweden.  
12:353:29074:30:21:121:544:296:145:Times:145:Times:In  Column  2  of  Table  5,  we  add  the  interaction  term  of  a  time  trend  and  the  China  
12:354:29174:21:21:85:547:275:145:Times:145:Times:dummy.   This   interaction   term   is   negative   and   significant   but   very   small   (-0.00097),   
12:355:29282:21:20:85:544:254:145:Times:145:Times:suggesting  a  moderate  decline  over  the  sample  period.6  To  gain  further  insight,  we  compute  
12:356:29387:20:21:85:544:234:145:Times:145:Times:the fraction of listed Chinese companies that issued dividends in a year. The fraction is 55%, 
12:357:29482:21:21:85:543:213:145:Times:145:Times:49%, 55%, 47%, 50% and 52% respectively from 2002 to 2007.  In other words, there was a 
12:358:29570:21:20:85:544:192:145:Times:145:Times:mild  reduction  in  the  fraction  of  dividend-paying  firms,  but  the  change  is  overwhelmed  by  
12:359:29674:20:21:85:544:172:145:Times:145:Times:year-to-year  fluctuations.      We  also  compute  the  average  cash  dividend  per  share  (DPS)  for  
12:360:29780:21:21:85:543:151:145:Times:145:Times:Chinese firms. The average DPS increased over the years, from 4.74 in 2002 and 4.96 in 2003 
12:361:29872:21:14:85:543:130:145:Times:145:Times:to 6.34 in 2006 and 7.47 cents in 2007 (the  numbers of shares per company are held constant 
12:362:29965:14:19:85:231:116:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
12:363:30025:19:19:85:543:97:42:g_d0_f7:100:Times:6  In  October  2008,  the  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC)  required  listed  firms  that  applied  for  
12:364:30149:19:13:85:542:78:100:Times:100:Times:refinancing to pay cash dividends annually in an amount no less than 30 % of its distributed profits over the past 
12:365:30264:13:0:85:463:65:100:Times:100:Times:three years. As it is outside our sample period, we are not able to test the effect of the policy.   
13:366:30369:0:21:85:543:719:145:Times:145:Times:as  stock  splits  and  reverse  splits  and  new shares are adjusted).   Note from Column 2 in 
13:367:30465:21:20:85:543:698:145:Times:145:Times:Table 4, there is a modest (but insignificant) decline in the profit rate of Chinese firms during 
13:368:30563:20:21:85:543:678:145:Times:145:Times:the same period. In any case, recall from Column 2 of Table 3, there is no significant change 
13:369:30657:21:31:85:342:657:145:Times:145:Times:in the gross savings rate over time for Chinese firms. 
13:370:30712:31:21:121:539:626:145:Times:145:Times:In Column 3 of Table 5, we compare the dividend payout rates between majority state-
13:371:30796:21:20:85:543:605:145:Times:145:Times:owned  firms  and  other  companies,  conditional  on  the  sector  and  year  fixed  effects  and  firm  
13:372:30902:20:21:85:545:585:145:Times:145:Times:size.    Contrary  to  the  mainstream  view,  we  see  that  state-owned  companies  issue  more  
13:373:31001:21:21:85:542:564:145:Times:145:Times:dividends. The coefficient on the state ownership dummy is 0.002, significantly different from 
13:374:31096:21:20:85:543:543:145:Times:145:Times:zero at the 10% level. In Column 4 of Table 5,  we  examine  whether  and  how  the  difference  
13:375:31193:20:21:85:546:523:145:Times:145:Times:between  state-owned  and  other  firms  changes  over  time.  The  negative  but  insignificant  
13:376:31291:21:21:85:543:502:145:Times:145:Times:coefficient  on  the  interaction  term  suggests  that  there  might  be  a  narrowing  of  the  gap  over  
13:377:31400:21:30:85:338:481:145:Times:145:Times:time, but the evidence is not statistically significant.

13:379:31457:31:31:85:240:420:145:Times:145:Times:3.5 Investment and net savings  
13:380:31489:31:20:121:544:389:145:Times:145:Times:  To  understand  the  corporate  sector’s  contribution  to  a  country’s  current  account,  one  
13:381:31589:20:21:85:544:369:145:Times:145:Times:ultimately  needs  to  look  at  net  corporate  savings--the  difference  between  gross  savings  and  
13:382:31694:21:21:85:543:348:145:Times:145:Times:capital investments. We now examine China’s corporate investments over assets by using the 
13:383:31785:21:21:85:544:327:145:Times:145:Times:same  set  of  right-hand-side  variables  for  gross  savings.  In  Column  1  of  Table  6,  the  China  
13:384:31892:21:20:85:543:306:145:Times:145:Times:dummy is positive and significant at the 1% level, suggesting that Chinese firms invest more 
13:385:31985:20:21:85:544:286:145:Times:145:Times:than  the  global  average.  To  find  the  country-level  conditional  average  investment  rate,  we  
13:386:32089:21:21:85:545:265:145:Times:145:Times:perform  a  version  of  the  regression  in  Column  1  by  adding  individual  country  dummies  
13:387:32188:21:20:85:544:244:145:Times:145:Times:(regression  results  not  reported).  Again,  the  estimates  of  the  individual  country  effects  are  
13:388:32295:20:21:85:543:224:145:Times:145:Times:plotted in Figure 5 (top panel). It is clear that Chinese firms invest more than firms in all other 
13:389:32395:21:21:85:543:203:145:Times:145:Times:countries  save  two  (India  and  Canada).  From  Column  2  of  Table  6,  Chinese  firms  appear  to  
13:390:32500:21:20:85:543:182:145:Times:145:Times:decrease their investment relative to assets over time when compared with a global year fixed 
13:391:32594:20:31:85:281:162:145:Times:145:Times:effects (of generally rising investment).  
13:392:32637:31:21:121:540:131:145:Times:145:Times:In Column 3 of Table 6, we compare the conditional investment rate by majority state-
13:393:32722:21:21:85:543:110:145:Times:145:Times:owned firms with non-state owned firms in China.  Interestingly, an average state-owned firm 
13:394:32815:21:20:85:543:89:145:Times:145:Times:invests less than an average non-state firm.  The gap in the investment ratio between state and 
13:395:32911:20:0:85:464:69:145:Times:145:Times:non-state firms does not shrink over the sample period (column 4 of Table 6).  
14:396:32994:0:21:121:549:719:145:Times:145:Times:We  now  examine  the  net  savings  rate  in  Table   7.   There   is   little   evidence   that   
14:397:33094:21:20:85:543:698:145:Times:145:Times:Chinese firms have higher net savings as a share of total assets than firms in other countries. 
14:398:33190:20:21:85:545:678:145:Times:145:Times:The  estimated  coefficient  is  positive  but  insignificant  (Column  1  of  Table  7).  To  find  the  
14:399:33296:21:21:85:543:657:145:Times:145:Times:country-level  conditional  average  net  savings  rate,  we  perform  a  version  of  the  regression  in  
14:400:33404:21:20:85:546:636:145:Times:145:Times:Column  1  by  adding  individual  country  dummies  (regression  results  not  reported).  The  
14:401:33501:20:21:85:543:616:145:Times:145:Times:estimates of the individual country effects are plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 6. We see 
14:402:33597:21:21:85:545:595:145:Times:145:Times:that  China’s  net  savings  are  smaller  than  more  than  half  of  the  countries  in  the  sample,  
14:403:33702:21:21:85:547:574:145:Times:145:Times:including  India,  Australia  and  the  U.K.  From  Column  2  of  Table  6,  the  insignificant  
14:404:33800:21:20:85:543:553:145:Times:145:Times:interaction term suggests that the  gap  between  net  corporate  savings in China and the global 
14:405:33898:20:31:85:263:533:145:Times:145:Times:average has not narrowed over time. 
14:406:33934:31:21:121:544:502:145:Times:145:Times:In  Column  3  of  Table  7,  we  compare  state-owned  companies  with  non-state-owned  
14:407:34024:21:20:85:544:481:145:Times:145:Times:ones  in  China.  There  is  no  significant  difference  between  the  two  groups  on  corporate  net  
14:408:34129:20:21:85:539:461:145:Times:145:Times:savings.  Column  4  of  Table  7  suggests  that  the  net  savings  rate  might  be  higher  for  state-
14:409:34235:21:21:85:543:440:145:Times:145:Times:owned  firms  at  the  beginning  of  the  sample.    The  trend  is  negative  but  insignificant.    Since  
14:410:34345:21:20:85:543:419:145:Times:145:Times:there  is  no  difference  between  state  and  non-state  firms  averaged  over  the  entire  sample,  we  
14:411:34453:20:21:85:543:399:145:Times:145:Times:surmise that state-owned firms may have a lower net savings rate than non-state firms in the 
14:412:34546:21:21:85:543:378:145:Times:145:Times:latter part of the sample. The insignificant trend term reflects that year-to-year fluctuations are 
14:413:34646:21:31:85:328:357:145:Times:145:Times:large (producing a relatively large standard error). 
14:414:34699:31:30:85:88:326:145:Times:145:Times: 
14:415:34699:30:31:85:399:296:145:Times:145:Times:3.5 Do financial constraints raise the savings by non-state firms? 
14:416:34765:31:21:121:543:265:145:Times:145:Times:Recall that a key conclusion so far is that within China, private firms do not save less 
14:417:34854:21:20:85:545:244:145:Times:145:Times:than  state-owned  firms.  One  reason  that  private  firms  need  to  save  is  concern  for  future  
14:418:34958:20:31:85:431:224:145:Times:145:Times:financing constraints when good investment opportunities come along.  
14:419:35028:31:21:121:543:193:145:Times:145:Times:We  now  test  these  arguments.  The  first  question  is  how  to  measure  external  finance  
14:420:35125:21:20:85:544:172:145:Times:145:Times:needs  in  a  cross-country  setting.  Following  the  literature  on  empirical  corporate  finance,  we  
14:421:35232:20:21:85:546:152:145:Times:145:Times:use  an  index  for  intrinsic  dependence  on  external  finance  for  investment  (DEF_INV).  
14:422:35328:21:21:85:546:131:145:Times:145:Times:Specifically,  we  construct  a  sector-level  approximation  of  a  firm’s  intrinsic  demand  on  
14:423:35428:21:21:85:545:110:145:Times:145:Times:external  finance  for  capital  investment  following  a  methodology  developed  in  Rajan  and  
14:424:35527:21:0:85:168:89:145:Times:145:Times:Zingales (1998): 
15:425:35548:0:0:85:88:697:145:Times:145:Times: 
15:426:35548:0:8:352:504:705:145:Times:145:Times:capital expenditures - cash flow
15:427:35580:8:9:111:509:697:145:Times:145:Times:Dependence on external finance for investment = ,
15:428:35629:9:0:380:476:688:145:Times:145:Times:capital expenditures
15:429:35649:0:32:511:514:697:145:Times:145:Times: 
15:430:35649:32:20:85:546:665:145:Times:145:Times:where  Cash  flow  =  cash  flow  from  operations  +  decreases  in  inventories  +  decreases  in  
15:431:35750:20:21:85:545:645:145:Times:145:Times:receivables  +  increases  in  payables.  All  the  numbers  are  based  on  U.S.  firms,  which  are  
15:432:35853:21:21:85:543:624:145:Times:145:Times:judged to be least likely to suffer from financing constraints (during a normal time) relative to 
15:433:35951:21:20:85:544:603:145:Times:145:Times:firms  in  other  countries.  While  the  original  Rajan  and  Zingales  (1998)  paper  covers  only  40  
15:434:36058:20:21:85:543:583:145:Times:145:Times:(mainly  SIC  2-digit)  sectors,  we  expand  the  coverage  to  around  250/373  SIC  3-digit  sectors  
15:435:36163:21:31:85:253:562:145:Times:145:Times:(following Tong and Wei, 2010).   
15:436:36197:31:21:121:544:531:145:Times:145:Times:To  calculate  the  demand  for  external  financing  of  US  firms,  we  take  the  following  
15:437:36293:21:20:85:543:510:145:Times:145:Times:steps. First, every firm in the COMPUSTA USA is sorted into one of the SIC 3-digit sectors. 
15:438:36385:20:21:85:539:490:145:Times:145:Times:Second,  we  calculate  the  ratio  of  dependence  on  external  finance  for  each  firm  from  1990-
15:439:36488:21:21:85:543:469:145:Times:145:Times:2006. Third, we calculate the sector-level median from firm ratios for each SIC 3-digit sector 
15:440:36583:21:20:85:543:448:145:Times:145:Times:that contains at least 5 firms, and the median value is then chosen, to be the index of demand 
15:441:36678:20:21:85:542:428:145:Times:145:Times:for external financing in that sector. Conceptually, the Rajan-Zingales (DEP_INV) index aims 
15:442:36771:21:21:85:544:407:145:Times:145:Times:to  identify  sector-level  features,  i.e.  which  sectors  are  naturally  more  dependent  on  external  
15:443:36879:21:20:85:544:386:145:Times:145:Times:financing  for  their  business  operation.  It  ignores  the  question  of  which  firms  within  a  sector  
15:444:36989:20:21:85:544:366:145:Times:145:Times:are  more  liquidity  constrained.  What  the  DEP_INV  index  measures  could  be  regarded  as  a  
15:445:37090:21:21:85:544:345:145:Times:145:Times:“technical  feature”  of  a  sector,  almost  like  a  part  of  the  production  function.    To  capture  the  
15:446:37203:21:21:85:543:324:145:Times:145:Times:economic concept of the percentage of capital expenditure that has to be financed by external 
15:447:37297:21:20:85:425:303:145:Times:145:Times:funding, we winsorize the DEP_INV index to range between 0 and 1.  
15:448:37364:20:21:121:539:283:145:Times:145:Times:We then interact this DEP_INV index with the China dummy and later with the state-
15:449:37446:21:21:85:543:262:145:Times:145:Times:ownership dummy. The results are presented in Tables 8a and 8b. Within those sectors with a 
15:450:37538:21:20:85:543:241:145:Times:145:Times:higher external financial dependence (i.e, higher DEP_INV), Chinese firms have higher gross 
15:451:37630:20:21:85:543:221:145:Times:145:Times:savings  than  other  countries  (Column  1).  This  is  because  in  these  sectors,  Chinese  firms  are  
15:452:37738:21:21:85:543:200:145:Times:145:Times:making relatively higher profits than their global counterparts (Column 2). A reason might be 
15:453:37832:21:20:85:542:179:145:Times:145:Times:that Chinese listed firms have relatively lower financing costs. Moreover, within these sectors, 
15:454:37929:20:21:85:547:159:145:Times:145:Times:Chinese   firms   issue   relatively   higher   dividends   than   global   counterparts   (Column   3),   
15:455:38036:21:21:85:530:138:145:Times:145:Times:consistent with the argument that Chinese firms may have more access to external finance.   
15:456:38128:21:21:121:545:117:145:Times:145:Times:Another  possible  interpretation  on  the  positive  coefficient  on  the  China*DEP_INV  
15:457:38219:21:20:85:545:96:145:Times:145:Times:interaction  term  in  the  profit  function  is  that  the  contemporaneous  profit  rate  may  be  a  
15:458:38323:20:21:85:547:76:145:Times:145:Times:predictor   of   future   investment   opportunities.   This   regression   suggests   that   unexplored   
15:459:38430:21:0:85:545:55:145:Times:145:Times:investment  opportunities  are  particularly  good  for  Chinese  firms  in  sectors  with  a  higher  
16:460:38537:0:21:85:543:719:145:Times:145:Times:intrinsic    dependence    on    external    finance    (Column 2). As a result, these firms also save 
16:461:38640:21:20:85:543:698:145:Times:145:Times:more (Column 1).  To check the validity of this hypothesis, we look at Column 3 and find that 
16:462:38734:20:21:85:543:678:145:Times:145:Times:the  investment  in  these  sectors  is  not  particularly  higher  in  China.  As  a  result,  all  the  gross  
16:463:38847:21:21:85:280:657:145:Times:145:Times:savings show up as net savings as well.  
16:464:38888:21:20:121:543:636:145:Times:145:Times:Now we focus on the sample of Chinese firms and include an interaction term of state 
16:465:38973:20:21:85:544:616:145:Times:145:Times:dummy  and  external  finance  dependence.  There  we  find  that  state  companies  and  non-state  
16:466:39074:21:21:85:543:595:145:Times:145:Times:companies have similar gross savings, profits and dividends payouts,  which are not affected 
16:467:39167:21:21:85:482:574:145:Times:145:Times:by whether they are in a sector with high dependence on external finance or not.    
16:468:39251:21:20:121:545:553:145:Times:145:Times:  At  least  for  publicly  listed  firms,  there  is  no  evidence  that  those  Chinese  firms  in  
16:469:39353:20:21:85:544:533:145:Times:145:Times:sectors  that  are  intrinsically  more  dependent  on  external  finance  issue  smaller  dividends  in  
16:470:39459:21:21:85:543:512:145:Times:145:Times:order to save more than counterparts in other countries. If corporate savings reflects concerns 
16:471:39555:21:20:85:543:491:145:Times:145:Times:for credit constraints, the evidence suggests that Chinese firms are not more concerned about

16:473:39756:21:21:85:543:450:145:Times:145:Times:appear to face more credit constraints than their majority state-owned counterparts. Of course, 
16:474:39852:21:20:85:543:429:145:Times:145:Times:small non-listed private firms may very well be credit constrained and therefore need to save 
16:475:39946:20:21:85:546:409:145:Times:145:Times:more.  However,  this  is  true  everywhere  in  the  world.  In  any  case,  the  evidence  is  not  
16:476:40048:21:21:85:543:388:145:Times:145:Times:consistent  with  the  contention  that  mis-governance  in  state  firms  and  favorable  price  shocks  
16:477:40154:21:31:85:399:367:145:Times:145:Times:are the primary cause of a high and rising corporate savings rate.

16:480:40266:31:21:121:544:275:144:Times:145:Times: The  savings  rates  may  be  uneven  across  privately-owned  firms.  One  reason  may  be  
16:481:40359:21:20:85:543:254:145:Times:145:Times:different degrees of political connection by firm owners, which may result in uneven access to 
16:482:40454:20:21:85:543:234:145:Times:145:Times:financing. In other words, while private firms may have a more challenging task in accessing 
16:483:40547:21:21:85:544:213:145:Times:145:Times:finance  when  they  need  to  than  state-owned  firms,  those  private  firms  with  better  political  
16:484:40653:21:63:85:259:192:145:Times:145:Times:connections may need to save less.7

16:486:40748:19:19:85:543:110:42:g_d0_f7:100:Times:7 Other  corporate  governance  factors  may  affect  corporate  savings  too.  For  example,  Morck,  Yeung  and  Zhao  
16:487:40869:19:13:85:543:91:100:Times:100:Times:(2007)  suggest  that  enterprise  insiders  may  hide  cash  from  their  superiors  or  successors  by  tunneling  it  to  tax  
16:488:40999:13:13:85:543:78:100:Times:100:Times:havens.  This  could  induce  the  insiders  from  the  beginning  to  increase  corporate  savings  by  reducing  dividend  
16:489:41124:13:0:85:125:65:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:payoffs.   
17:490:41139:0:21:121:547:719:145:Times:145:Times:    We    examine    this    possibility    by    utilizing   a   measure   of   political   connection   
17:491:41245:21:20:85:545:698:145:Times:145:Times:constructed  by  Fan,  Wong,  and  Zhang  (2007).    The  political  connection  is  a  dummy  for  
17:492:41345:20:31:85:377:678:145:Times:145:Times:companies whose chairman is a former government official. 
17:493:41403:31:21:121:543:647:145:Times:145:Times: The results are presented in Table 9. From Column 1, it is clear that politically better 
17:494:41492:21:21:85:544:626:145:Times:145:Times:connected  private  firms  do  save  significantly  less.  As  Columns  2  and  3  reveal,  however,  the  
17:495:41599:21:20:85:544:605:145:Times:145:Times:lower level savings does not come from less dividend payout, but instead from a lower profit 
17:496:41692:20:21:85:545:585:145:Times:145:Times:rate.  In  other  words,  firms  with  better  political  connection  simply  perform  worse.  With  a  
17:497:41796:21:21:85:544:564:145:Times:145:Times:smaller  profit,  they  do  not  pay  smaller  dividends  or  do  less  investment  than  firms  without  a  
17:498:41905:21:20:85:545:543:145:Times:145:Times:strong  political  connection.  As  a  result,  these  firms  have  a  lower  gross  savings  rate  and  a  
17:499:42013:20:31:85:196:523:145:Times:145:Times:lower net savings rate.

17:501:42037:31:30:85:157:461:144:Times:144:Times:4. Conclusion 
17:502:42051:30:21:121:545:431:145:Times:145:Times:  Chinese  companies  maintain  a  high  gross  savings  rate  in  absolute  terms,  and  often  
17:503:42148:21:21:85:542:410:145:Times:145:Times:account for as big a share of GDP and household savings. This has led to the mainstream view 
17:504:42241:21:20:85:543:389:145:Times:145:Times:that (a) corporate savings in China is a key driver of its current account surplus, and (b) high 
17:505:42338:20:21:85:539:369:145:Times:145:Times:corporate  savings  is  mainly  a  result  of  high  savings  rates  by  state-owned  firms  due  to  mis-
17:506:42444:21:31:85:146:348:145:Times:145:Times:governance. 
17:507:42456:31:21:121:545:317:145:Times:145:Times:  This  paper  casts  doubt  on  both  parts  of  the  mainstream  view.  Using  the  aggregate  
17:508:42553:21:20:85:543:296:145:Times:145:Times:flow-of-funds data, we show that corporate gross savings rates are high and have been rising 
17:509:42646:20:21:85:544:276:145:Times:145:Times:in a number of countries. At least Korea and Japan tend to have substantially higher savings 
17:510:42739:21:21:85:546:255:145:Times:145:Times:rates  by  their  corporate  sectors  than  China’s.  Moreover,  relative  to  the  investment  rate  
17:511:42841:21:20:85:546:234:145:Times:145:Times:(investment/GDP),  China  has,  in  fact,  the  lowest  net  savings  rate  (gross  savings  rate  –  
17:512:42943:20:21:85:545:214:145:Times:145:Times:investment  rate)  among  the  group  of  major  economies.  It  is  the  only  country  that  had  a  
17:513:43046:21:31:85:401:193:145:Times:145:Times:negative net corporate savings rate every year during 1995-2007. 
17:514:43111:31:20:121:543:162:145:Times:145:Times: Micro firm level evidence could provide better controls for sector and year effects on 
17:515:43198:20:21:85:543:142:145:Times:145:Times:corporate savings patterns. Once we do that, we see that Chinese corporate savings rates, both 
17:516:43293:21:31:85:408:121:145:Times:145:Times:gross and net, are not that different from those in other economies. 
17:517:43362:31:21:121:543:90:145:Times:145:Times: Overall, the notion that Chinese corporate savings drives its current account surplus is 
17:518:43451:21:0:85:293:69:145:Times:145:Times:not supported by a careful look at the data.
