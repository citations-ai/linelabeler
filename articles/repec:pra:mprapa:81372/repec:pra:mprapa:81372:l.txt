2:31:968:13:13:92:522:459:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:This  paper  utilises the  newly  proposed  nonparametric causality-in-quantiles  test  to examine 
2:32:1065:13:13:92:522:446:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the  predictability  of mean  and  variance of changes  in gold prices based on inflation for  G7 
2:33:1162:13:13:92:522:433:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:countries. The causality-in-quantiles approach permits us to test for not only causality in mean 
2:34:1253:13:13:92:522:420:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:but  also  causality  in  variance. We start our  investigation  by  utilising  tests  for  nonlinearity. 
2:35:1357:13:13:92:521:407:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:These tests identify nonlinearity, showing that the linear Granger causality tests are subject to 
2:36:1454:13:13:92:522:394:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:misspecification error. Unlike tests  of misspecified  linear models,  our  nonparametric 
2:37:1542:13:13:92:522:381:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality-in-quantiles tests find causality in mean and variance from inflation to gold market 
2:38:1636:13:13:92:522:368:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:price  changes between the 0.20 quantile and  the 0.70 quantile,  implying  that  very low- and 
2:39:1725:13:13:92:522:355:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:high- price  changes in  gold  markets  are  not related  to inflation.  These changes  should  be 
2:40:1819:13:13:92:522:342:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:related  to  other  sources, such  as financial  shocks and exchange  market  shocks.  We find 
2:41:1910:13:13:92:521:329:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:support that gold serves as a hedge against inflation, but only in the mid-quantile ranges, i.e., 
2:42:2008:13:13:92:521:316:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:quantiles from 0.20 to 0.70. Our  results  show  that  gold does  not  serve  as a hedge  against 
2:43:2102:13:13:92:522:303:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:inflation during periods when gold market price changes are very low or very high, which are 
2:44:2193:13:13:92:302:290:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:respectively quiet and highly volatile periods.

3:57:2354:24:20:92:522:690:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Gold, the oldest medium of exchange, is a popular hedge (Chang et al. 2013), has symbolic 
3:58:2443:20:19:92:522:670:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:value  (Godness et  al. 2016), is a  broad  measure  of  economic  conditions  (Natanelov et  al. 
3:59:2540:19:20:92:522:651:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:2011) and is the only true standard of value, even in war and crisis times. It has a great impact 
3:60:2636:20:20:92:522:631:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:on economies and is commonly considered to be a safe haven for investment. Gold is of the 
3:61:2724:20:19:92:522:611:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:scarcest elements, representing just 0.0000001% or one part per billion. Its unique properties 
3:62:2819:19:19:92:522:592:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:make gold irreplaceable for all practical purposes. Gold is traded in one of the largest global 
3:63:2915:19:20:92:522:573:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:spot  and  futures  market. Broadly, gold  market  refers  to  the  continuous  trading  of gold 
3:64:3010:20:19:92:522:553:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:throughout the world based on the intra-day spot price, derived from over-the-counter (OTC) 
3:65:3100:19:20:92:522:534:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:trading across the world. A large futures trading also takes place in the gold market. Due to its 
3:66:3196:20:20:92:522:514:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:unique properties,  it is the most popular precious metals as  an investment, making the gold 
3:67:3289:20:19:92:521:494:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:market one of the largest global OTC markets. Gold is generally bought for diversifying risk, 
3:68:3382:19:19:92:522:475:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:especially through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. The financial market for gold 
3:69:3477:19:20:92:522:456:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:is  quite  robust,  which  allows  market  participants  to  use  gold  as  a  store  of  wealth,  an 
3:70:3579:20:19:92:336:436:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:investment, and as a source of high quality collateral. 
3:71:3634:19:20:92:95:417:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
3:72:3634:20:19:126:522:397:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:As it holds its value independently of domestic politics, its stability against fluctuating 
3:73:3724:19:20:92:521:378:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:currencies  and  peopleâ€™s  high  interest  and  confidence  over the centuries,  the  global  gold 
3:74:3821:20:19:92:522:358:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:market and its interdependency with other commodities and economic dynamics have always 
3:75:3909:19:20:92:522:339:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:attracted a  great  deal  of economic  curiosity.  Moreover,  due  to  its high profit potential and 
3:76:4006:20:19:92:522:319:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:remarkable  risk protection feature,  the  gold  market  is  receiving  increasing  attention  (Zhang 
3:77:4107:19:20:92:521:300:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:and  Wei  2010).  Therefore,  consistent  interest  in  the  gold  market  has  necessitated  inquiry 
3:78:4209:20:19:92:489:280:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:regarding its relationship with other macro-economic factors, such as oil and inflation.

3:81:4393:19:20:92:521:222:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:traditional  hedge against  inflation  (Jaffe 1989,  Dempster  and  Artigas  2009, Narayan et  al.

3:83:4582:19:20:92:521:183:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:and Lucey 2010),  relatively  few  studies  have  investigated  the causal relationship  between 
3:84:4677:20:19:92:521:163:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:inflation  and  gold  prices. To  our  knowledge, no study has employed the  nonparametric 
3:85:4765:19:20:92:522:144:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:quantile-based test that we use in this study. The nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test we 
3:86:4860:20:19:92:367:124:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:use is robust to nonlinearities, structural breaks and outliers.

4:113:7018:20:19:92:522:227:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:(2016a,  b)  to study the  predictability  of the conditional mean  and  variance  of gold  market 
4:114:7116:19:20:92:521:208:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:price changes based on inflation. The nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test combines the 
4:115:7207:20:19:92:522:188:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:test  for the nonparametric causality  of the k-th order  by  Nishiyama et  al. (2011)  with  the 
4:116:7303:19:20:92:522:169:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality-in-quantiles  test  by  Jeong et  al. (2012)  and,  hence,  can  be thought of  as a 
4:117:7396:20:19:92:522:149:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:generalization of the former. The causality-in-quantiles approach used in this study is novel in 
4:118:7490:19:20:92:522:130:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:three ways. First, it is robust to misspecification errors, as it detects the underlying linear and 
4:119:7588:20:19:92:522:110:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:nonlinear dependence  structure in the time  series under  examination. Second, using this 
4:120:7676:19:0:92:522:91:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:approach, one can test not only causality in mean (1st moment) but also causality in variance 
5:121:7764:0:20:92:521:715:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:(2nd moment). Thus, higher-order dependency can be studied. Such an examination is vital in 
5:122:7854:20:19:92:522:695:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:light  of  the fact  that, during  some  periods, causality  in  the conditional mean may  not  exist, 
5:123:7955:19:20:92:521:676:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:whereas higher-order interdependencies may be significant. This method enables us to test the 
5:124:8048:20:19:92:418:656:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:mean and variance causality links from inflation to gold price changes.

5:126:8119:20:19:126:522:617:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:In this paper, we use monthly data from the December 1979-August 2016 period. To 
5:127:8199:19:20:92:522:598:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the predictability of mean and the 
5:128:8293:20:19:92:519:578:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:volatility  of changes  in  gold  prices based  on inflation using  the  nonparametric  causality-in-
5:129:8393:19:20:92:521:559:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:quantiles  method. The  paper  obtains  new  findings on  the  effect  of  inflation  on gold  market 
5:130:8494:20:19:92:522:539:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:price  changes. Causality-in-quantiles  tests used  in  this  study usually find  causality from 
5:131:8588:19:20:92:521:520:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:inflation  to gold market  price  changes between the 0.20 quantile and the 0.70 quantile, 
5:132:8671:20:19:92:522:500:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:meaning that very low- and high-price movements in gold markets are not related to inflation. 
5:133:8762:19:20:92:522:481:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:These results should be connected to different factors such as financial shocks and exchange 
5:134:8847:20:19:92:522:461:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:market shocks. The empirical evidence shows that gold serves as a hedge against inflation, a 
5:135:8936:19:20:92:522:442:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:commonly known fact. The causality is not only in the mean (price changes) but also in the 
5:136:9027:20:19:92:522:422:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:variance,  meaning that inflation impacts both gold  market  price  changes and gold  market

5:144:9337:24:20:92:521:261:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:We  utilise  the  nonparametric  causality-in-quantiles  approach  of  Balcilar et  al. (2016a,  b),  a 
5:145:9441:20:19:92:522:241:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:novel method that expands upon the approaches of Nishiyama et al. (2011) and Jeong et al. 
5:146:9529:19:20:92:522:222:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:(2012).  This  methodology is capable  of accounting for nonlinear  causality in quantiles 
5:147:9614:20:20:92:522:202:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:through  a  hybrid  approach. The price  changes on  gold are denoted as , and  inflation is

6:172:10890:20:19:92:188:348:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:(2), can be stated as:

8:221:12992:19:20:92:522:617:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:or  higher  moments  has  some  complications, and  the  procedure  for  such  tests  should  be 
8:222:13088:20:20:92:522:597:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:carefully defined since rejection of causality in the moment  does not imply non-causality in 
8:223:13181:20:19:92:522:577:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the moment  for . We begin by employing Nishiyama et al.â€™s (2011) nonparametric 
8:224:13259:19:20:92:522:558:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Granger quantile causality method. To demonstrate the causality in higher-order moments, we 
8:225:13349:20:20:92:214:538:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:first consider the process:  
8:226:13375:20:19:92:95:518:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
8:227:13375:19:20:314:521:499:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:,        (10) 
8:228:13387:20:20:92:95:479:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
8:229:13387:20:19:92:522:459:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:where  denotes an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) process and the unknown 
8:230:13476:19:20:92:521:440:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:functions  and  satisfy  some  properties  that  are  sufficient  for  the  stationarity  of . 
8:231:13569:20:20:92:522:420:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Although this representation does not permit linear or non-linear causalities from  to , it 
8:232:13660:20:20:92:522:400:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:does  allow  to  have predictive  power  for  when  is  an  established  nonlinear 
8:233:13739:20:20:92:522:380:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:function.  The  representation  in  equation  (10)  illustrates  that  squares  for  are not 
8:234:13830:20:20:92:522:360:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:necessarily  entered into  the  nonlinear  function .  Therefore,  we re-specify  equations  (3) 
8:235:13925:20:20:92:522:340:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:and (4) into a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for causality in variance as 
8:236:14011:20:19:92:132:320:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:follows: 
8:237:14019:19:23:92:95:301:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
8:238:14019:23:27:386:518:278:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:       (11)

8:240:14039:22:20:92:95:229:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
8:241:14039:20:20:92:522:209:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:To obtain a feasible test statistic to test the null hypothesis  in equation (11), we substitute 
8:242:14132:20:19:102:522:189:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A: in equations (6) to (9) with. A problem may arise with the causality test based on the 
8:243:14219:19:20:92:521:170:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:definition given in equation (10), as there may be causality in the second moment (variance) 
8:244:14311:20:19:92:522:150:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:along with  causality  in  the  conditional first moment  (mean).  We can illustrate this  with the 
8:245:14411:19:20:92:173:131:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:following model: 
8:246:14427:20:20:92:95:111:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
8:247:14427:20:0:301:518:91:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:       (13) 
9:248:14438:0:20:92:95:715:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
9:249:14438:20:19:92:357:695:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Thus, higher-order causality in quantiles can be stated as:  
9:250:14496:19:24:160:163:676:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A: 
9:251:14496:24:26:347:515:652:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:    for            (14) 
9:252:14518:26:22:347:515:626:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:    for            (15) 
9:253:14540:22:20:92:95:604:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B: 
9:254:14540:20:20:92:522:584:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Fully incorporating the concepts, we specify that  Granger-causes  in quantile  up to the 
9:255:14626:20:20:101:522:564:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:-th moment utilising equation (14) to formulate the test statistic of equation (6) for each . 
9:256:14718:20:19:92:519:544:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Nishiyama et  al. (2011)  construct  nonparametric  Granger  causality  tests  using  the  density-
9:257:14817:19:20:92:522:525:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:weighted  approach as  in  Jeong et  al. (2012)  and  show  that  density-weighted  nonparametric 
9:258:14915:20:19:92:522:505:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:tests in higher moments have the same asymptotic normal distribution as the test for causality 
9:259:15009:19:20:92:522:486:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:in the first  moment,  although  some  stronger  moment  conditions  might  be  necessary. 
9:260:15100:20:19:92:522:466:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Nevertheless,  it  is  not  an  easy  task  to  test  for  all  jointly, as the  statistics  are 
9:261:15195:19:20:92:522:447:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:correlated  (Nishiyama et  al., 2011).  To  overcome  this  issue, one  can  follow the  sequential 
9:262:15293:20:20:92:522:427:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:testing  approach  in  Nishiyama et  al. (2011)  to  test  for  causality  in  both  models  defined  in 
9:263:15398:20:19:92:522:407:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:equations (10) and (13). In this approach, we first test for nonparametric Granger causality in 
9:264:15494:19:20:92:519:388:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the  first  moment  ( but  still  continue to test for causality  in  variance  even  if  non-
9:265:15586:20:20:92:522:368:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality  is  not  rejected.  That  is,  if  the  null hypothesis for  is  not  rejected,  then  there 
9:266:15687:20:20:92:522:348:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:might still be causality in the second moment, and thus, we conduct the tests for . This 
9:267:15774:20:19:92:522:328:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:methodology  permits  us  to  test for the  presence  of  causality  in  variance only  as  well  as 
9:268:15873:19:20:92:522:309:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality in the mean and the variance successively. That is, we can examine the existence of 
9:269:15967:20:19:92:522:289:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality in mean  and  causality in variance  sequentially.  The  empirical  analysis  of 
9:270:16054:19:20:92:522:270:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:nonparametric  causality in quantiles  requires three specifications:  the  lag  order ,  the 
9:271:16145:20:20:92:521:250:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:bandwidth , and the kernel type for  and  in equations (6) and (9), respectively. In 
9:272:16228:20:19:92:522:230:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:this study, we use the lag order of 1 based on the Schwarz information criterion (SIC) under a 
9:273:16321:19:20:92:522:211:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:VAR involving inflation and gold market price changes. Additionally, in regard to choosing 
9:274:16411:20:19:92:522:191:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:lags, the  SIC is considered to be more parsimonious than other lag-length selection criteria. 
9:275:16506:19:0:92:522:172:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:The  SIC  helps to overcome  the  issue  of  over-parameterization which usually  arises  in 
10:276:16599:0:20:92:521:715:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:nonparametric  frameworks.2 The  bandwidth value  is  chosen  by  employing  least-squares 
10:277:16688:20:20:92:492:695:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:cross-validation techniques.3 Finally, for  and , Gaussian-type kernels are used.

10:280:16795:24:20:92:522:631:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:In the empirical  analysis, we  use  the  monthly  US  dollar4 prices  of  gold  spot  and  futures

10:283:17083:20:19:92:522:572:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:represent the gold futures markets at twelve maturities (1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 4-month, 
10:284:17176:19:20:92:521:553:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:5-month, 6-month, 7-month, 8-month, 9-month, 10-month, 11-month and 12-month). The CPI 
10:285:17263:20:19:92:522:533:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:data is used in monthly  frequencies for  the period  of December  1979-August  2016 period. 
10:286:17352:19:20:92:522:514:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:The CPI series are taken from International Financial Statistics (IFS). Inflation is measured by 
10:287:17448:20:19:92:522:494:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the monthly  difference in the  log  CPI  [100*log(CPIt/CPIt-1)]. Inflation  series  are  stationary, 
10:288:17546:19:21:92:521:475:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:while  gold  spot  and  futures  price  series  are  non-stationary  in  log levels, as  indicated  by 
10:289:17647:21:19:92:522:454:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:standard unit root tests5. Since the methodology requires stationary data, we use gold market 
10:290:17741:19:20:92:522:435:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:price  change series,  which  are obtained as the  first differences  of  the  natural  logarithmic 
10:291:17837:20:19:92:522:415:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:values of the gold price series expressed as percentages. Figure 1 shows the time series plot of

10:295:18056:20:19:119:522:337:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:We begin with a brief discussion of selected key features of the series. In Table 1, we

10:300:18523:20:19:92:522:240:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:contracts. The mean of the inflation series suggests that it is lowest for Germany but gradually 
10:301:18620:19:17:92:182:221:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:increases for Italy.

10:304:18804:13:8:92:406:182:88:g_d0_f8:88:g_d0_f8:F:selecting an over-parameterized model, while the SIC is asymptotically consistent. 
10:305:18886:8:15:92:522:174:37:g_d0_f8:88:g_d0_f8:F:3 For each quantile, we determine the bandwidth  using the leave-one-out least-squares cross-validation method 
10:306:18995:15:11:92:95:159:88:g_d0_f8:37:g_d0_f8:F:of Racine and Li (2004) and Li and Racine (2004). 4
10:307:19045:11:10:95:505:148:88:g_d0_f8:88:g_d0_f8:F: We additionally performed all tests after converting spot and 1- to 12-moth futures gold prices into national

10:309:19266:11:11:92:514:127:88:g_d0_f8:88:g_d0_f8:F:Italy. The causality-in-quantiles test results obtained using gold prices in local currency units were qualitatively 
10:310:19383:11:11:92:511:116:88:g_d0_f8:88:g_d0_f8:F:the same with the results presented in the paper, the causality from inflation to gold market price changes were 
10:311:19495:11:11:92:503:105:88:g_d0_f8:88:g_d0_f8:F:even stronger for some countries. These results are not reported to save space, but available from the authors

11:325:20705:20:19:92:522:157:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Box tests indicate the existence of a first-order serial correlation in the inflation series of G7 
11:326:20804:19:20:92:521:138:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:countries, while  there  is  no  first-order serial  correlation  in  the  gold  market price  changes. 
11:327:20908:20:19:92:522:118:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:However, the Ljung-Box tests do not refute the nonexistence of a fifth-order serial correlation

14:394:26722:20:19:93:520:183:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the UK and the US. Second, there is weak evidence of predictability from inflation to gold 
14:395:26813:19:20:93:520:164:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:for Germany,  while  the  results  provide  strong  evidence  of  predictability  from  inflation  to 
14:396:26915:20:19:93:425:144:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:gold for France, with the exception of the spot market for both countries.

24:609:37484:20:19:92:521:682:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:variance have some clear differences from the results for the causality in mean. The evidence 
24:610:37578:19:20:92:521:663:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:in Figure 3 indicates that there is causality in mean and variance from inflation to gold market 
24:611:37673:20:19:92:521:643:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:price changes for Canada around the quantile ranges from 0.25 to 0.70. This result indicates 
24:612:37765:19:20:92:522:624:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:that inflation has predictive power for gold market price changes in Canada. The results for 
24:613:37857:20:19:92:521:604:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Germany,  Italy,  Japan  and  the  UK  reported  in  Figures  5,  6,  7  and  8,  respectively,  are 
24:614:37958:19:19:92:521:585:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:analogous to the findings for Canada. Thus, the evidence from Figures 5-8 shows that the null 
24:615:38052:19:20:92:521:566:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:hypothesis that inflation has no predictive power for gold market price changes is rejected at 
24:616:38146:20:19:92:521:546:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the  five  percent  significance level  around  the  quantile  range  of  0.25  to  0.70,  with  the 
24:617:38246:19:20:92:521:527:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:exceptions  of  the  lower  or  upper  quantiles  for  Germany,  Italy,  Japan, and  the  UK.  This 
24:618:38345:20:19:92:500:507:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:finding indicates that inflation has strong predictive power for gold market price changes.

24:620:38436:20:19:126:521:468:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:For France, the results in Figure 4 indicate that the null hypothesis that inflation does 
24:621:38525:19:20:92:521:449:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:not Granger-cause mean gold market price changes is rejected over the quantile range of 0.10 
24:622:38617:20:19:92:521:429:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:to  0.90,  while  the  null  hypothesis  that  inflation  does  not  Granger-cause gold  market  price 
24:623:38719:19:20:92:521:410:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:changes in  variance  is  rejected  over  the  quantile  range  of  0.10  to  0.65  for  the  gold  spot 
24:624:38823:20:19:92:521:390:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:market. These findings show that there is strong  evidence of predictability from inflation to 
24:625:38918:19:19:92:521:371:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:gold market price changes for the gold spot market. Contrary to the results for the gold spot 
24:626:39011:19:20:92:521:352:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:market case for France, the findings from futures markets at all maturities show that there is 
24:627:39106:20:19:92:522:332:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:weak evidence against the null hypothesis that inflation does not Granger-cause the mean and 
24:628:39199:19:20:92:522:313:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:variance  in gold  market  price  changes.  These estimates  reveal  weak  evidence  that  inflation 
24:629:39300:20:19:92:521:293:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Granger-causes the mean and variance in gold market price changes for gold futures markets 
24:630:39390:19:20:92:521:274:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:at all maturities for France. The results for the US reported in Figure 9 are analogous to the 
24:631:39485:20:19:92:180:254:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:results for France.  
24:632:39504:19:20:126:129:235:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A: 
24:633:39504:20:19:126:521:215:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:A:The  results of causality-in-quantiles  tests  indicate that  inflation has  predictive power 
24:634:39598:19:20:92:522:196:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:for  gold  market price  changes.  This  should  be the  case because  inflation  and  gold  market 
24:635:39697:20:19:92:521:176:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:price  changes are strongly interdependent,  as  expected.  Causality-in-quantiles  tests indicate 
24:636:39794:19:19:92:521:157:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality from the 0.20 quantile to the 0.70 quantile range in most cases. This result leads us 
24:637:39884:19:20:92:521:138:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:to conclude that the changes in low- and high-price change ranges in the gold market are not 
24:638:39973:20:19:92:521:118:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:associated with  inflation. They may  be  linked to other factors,  such as financial shocks and 
24:639:40066:19:0:92:522:99:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:exchange market shocks. Our findings support the widely regarded idea that gold is a hedge 
25:640:40155:0:20:92:521:715:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:against inflation, but they also show when the hedging role of gold breaks down. Since there 
25:641:40245:20:19:92:521:695:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:is causality in variance as in mean (price changes), it is possible to argue that the impact of 
25:642:40339:19:20:92:522:676:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:inflation on gold market volatility may lead to policy uncertainty and consequently increase 
25:643:40432:20:19:92:522:656:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:the cost of policy implementation. It also increases uncertainty among investors and leads to 
25:644:40525:19:20:92:521:637:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:higher risk premiums on gold positions. Our findings may help investors to ensure better asset 
25:645:40618:20:19:92:521:617:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:allocation in inflationary environments. In terms of the continued hoarding of general public 
25:646:40710:19:19:92:521:598:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:investment in  gold and  large gold reserves held by central banks, the findings of this study 
25:647:40803:19:20:92:521:579:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:suggest that investors should be advised to monitor and be cautious, as their confidence might 
25:648:40894:20:19:92:521:559:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:be eroded by structural changes. The evidence from this study highlights the need to account 
25:649:40985:19:20:92:521:540:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:for  nonlinearities when modelling  the  dynamics of the  gold  price-inflation  relationship. 
25:650:41078:20:19:92:522:520:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Moreover, the analysis in this study can be extended to gold hedging strategies in inflationary

25:653:41186:20:24:92:160:461:128:g_d0_f7:128:g_d0_f7:C:4. Conclusion 
25:654:41199:24:20:92:521:437:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:There  exists  an  extensive body  of literature investigating the  role of  inflation  in  predicting 
25:655:41298:20:19:92:521:417:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:developments in gold markets. We expand upon this literature by investigating the impact of 
25:656:41387:19:20:92:521:398:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:inflation on gold market price changes and gold market volatility using a novel nonparametric 
25:657:41480:20:19:92:521:378:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:causality-in-quantiles  approach. In  the  paper,  we  use monthly data for the  sample  from 
25:658:41571:19:20:92:521:359:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:December  1979  to  August  2016.  To  assess  consistency,  we  first  apply the standard  linear 
25:659:41670:20:19:92:521:339:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Granger  causality  test.  Linear  tests  might  be  misleading  because  they  ignore  nonlinear 
25:660:41768:19:20:92:521:320:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:dependence and therefore cannot detect causality from inflation to gold market price changes 
25:661:41858:20:19:92:521:300:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:when nonlinearities exist. The result of the nonlinearity test of Brock et al. (1996) indicates 
25:662:41953:19:19:92:521:281:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:that  inflation  and  gold  return  series have  a strong nonlinear dependence.  The  evidence  of 
25:663:42051:19:20:92:521:262:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:nonlinearity suggests that the linear framework to test causality is in fact misspecified, with 
25:664:42146:20:19:92:519:242:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:unreliable results from these tests. Consequently, we use a novel nonparametric causality-in-
25:665:42239:19:20:92:521:223:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:quantiles  test that combines elements of the test for  nonlinear causality  of the k-th order by 
25:666:42334:20:19:92:521:203:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:Nishiyama et al. (2011) with the causality-in-quantiles test developed by Jeong et al. (2012). 
25:667:42429:19:20:92:521:184:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:The  causality-in-quantiles approach  allows us  to test  for  causality in both the mean and the 
25:668:42523:20:19:92:521:164:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:variance  (volatility).  This approach adds additional  power  to  the  test when causality  in  the 
25:669:42621:19:20:92:522:145:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:conditional mean does not exist yet higher-order interdependencies do. Causality-in-quantiles 
25:670:42713:20:19:92:521:125:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:tests find causality from inflation to all spot and futures gold markets, as expected. Intuitively, 
25:671:42810:19:19:92:519:106:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:this should be the case because spot and futures gold markets are highly correlated. Causality-
25:672:42904:19:0:92:521:87:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:in-quantiles tests usually find causality from the 0.20 quantile to the quantile 0.70, meaning 
26:673:42999:0:20:92:521:715:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:that  very  low- and  high-gold  price movements  in  gold  markets  are  not  related  to  inflation. 
26:674:43100:20:19:92:521:695:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:These changes should be related other factors, such as financial shocks and exchange market 
26:675:43188:19:20:92:521:676:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:shocks. We find support that gold serves as a hedge against inflation, a common assumption 
26:676:43275:20:19:92:521:656:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:everywhere in the world. Our findings, however, show that the hedging power of gold does 
26:677:43363:19:20:92:521:637:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:not hold at quantiles lower than 0.20 and higher than 0.70, which corresponds very low- and 
26:678:43453:20:19:92:522:617:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:high-level gold market price change ranges. Causality is not only in the mean (price changes) 
26:679:43546:19:19:92:521:598:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:but  also  in  variance,  meaning that inflation  has an impact  on  gold  market volatility.  In 
26:680:43643:19:20:92:522:579:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:general,  our  results,  via  the  nexus  between  inflation  and the gold  market,  highlight  the 
26:681:43743:20:19:92:521:559:128:g_d0_f8:128:g_d0_f8:B:importance of detecting and modelling nonlinearity when analysing predictability via causal
