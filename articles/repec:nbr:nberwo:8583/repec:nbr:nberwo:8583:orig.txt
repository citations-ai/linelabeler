2:25:1015:42:21:108:538:539:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This paper investigates the impact historically of aggregate price shocks on financial stability in
2:26:1114:21:21:72:538:518:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the United Kingdom.  We construct an annual index of U.K. financial conditions for 1790-1999 and use
2:27:1214:21:21:72:538:497:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a dynamic probit model to estimate the effect of aggregate price shocks on the index.  We find that price
2:28:1319:21:22:72:539:476:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level shocks contributed significantly to financial instability during 1820-1931, and that inflation rate
2:29:1424:22:21:72:538:454:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shocks contributed to instability during 1972-99.  Both the nature of aggregate price shocks and their
2:30:1526:21:21:72:538:433:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact depend on the existing monetary and financial regime, but price shocks historically have been a
2:31:1628:21:92:72:207:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:source of financial instability.

3:39:2065:0:25:90:186:709:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:I. Introduction
3:40:2079:25:25:126:512:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The paramount monetary policy objective of the European Central Bank, as required by
3:41:2163:25:25:90:512:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the Maastricht Treaty, is control of inflation.  Several countries also have made inflation control
3:42:2262:25:26:90:493:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the primary goal of monetary policy, and the central banks of many countries, including the
3:43:2353:26:25:90:516:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:United Kingdom but not the United States, set explicit inflation targets.  This emphasis reflects a
3:44:2452:25:25:90:491:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:desire to avoid high and highly variable inflation that characterized the economies of many
3:45:2543:25:26:90:237:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:countries in the 1970s and 1980s.
3:46:2576:26:25:126:517:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Inflation and inflation variability impose a variety of costs on society.  Many economists
3:47:2666:25:25:90:498:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:argue that by disrupting financial markets, inflation can exacerbate business cycles or reduce
3:48:2760:25:25:90:488:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:economic growth.  Fisher (1932, 1933) was an early proponent of the view that price level
3:49:2849:25:26:90:499:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:movement is an important cause of business cycles through its effect on the real cost of debt.
3:50:2943:26:25:90:515:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Schwartz (1995, 1997) picks up this theme, arguing that unanticipated shifts from inflationary to
3:51:3040:25:25:90:507:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:disinflationary monetary policy have been an important cause of increases in loan default rates
3:52:3135:25:26:90:502:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and other forms of financial distress historically.  Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Bernanke,
3:53:3229:26:25:90:507:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Gertler and Gilchrist (1999) argue that aggregate price instability can interact with information
3:54:3326:25:25:90:508:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:asymmetries and other frictions in credit markets to exacerbate business cycles.  The lesson for
3:55:3422:25:26:90:516:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary policy, Bernanke and Gertler (1999) conclude, is that “central banks should view price
3:56:3517:26:25:90:502:279:122:g_d0_f3:48:g_d0_f3:stability and financial stability as highly complementary and mutually consistent objectives.”1
3:57:3612:25:25:126:499:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:This paper presents empirical evidence for the claim that price stability and financial
3:58:3699:25:25:90:470:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stability are complementary by investigating the impact historically of aggregate price
3:59:3786:25:26:90:488:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:disturbances on financial stability in the United Kingdom.  The U.K. is a useful case study
3:60:3877:26:25:90:494:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:because its long financial history provides the opportunity to study the relationship between
3:61:3970:25:33:90:480:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:aggregate price and financial conditions across multiple monetary and financial regimes.

3:63:4111:7:16:90:500:113:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:1   Other studies conclude that credit market frictions can cause high inflation or inflation variability to
3:64:4219:16:11:90:485:97:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:depress economic growth.  Choi, et. al. (1996), for example, argue that by lowering the real cost of
3:65:4319:11:12:90:520:86:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:borrowing, high inflation can lead to adverse selection, higher default rates, credit rationing and a reduction
3:66:4430:12:0:90:359:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:in the supply of investment capital, causing lower long-run growth.
4:67:4498:0:26:90:486:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Moreover, reasonably consistent time series data exist on the U.K. price level, output, and
4:68:4589:26:25:90:493:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary aggregates.  Still, as with all countries, long time series data on loan default rates,
4:69:4685:25:25:90:501:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:household and business failure rates, and similar measures of financial conditions that are the
4:70:4780:25:26:90:480:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:focus of this study are scarce before the 1920s.  Thus, to characterize aggregate financial
4:71:4871:26:25:90:508:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions in the U.K. over time, we turn to narrative histories, along with various fragmentary
4:72:4967:25:25:90:496:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:data, to construct an annual index of financial conditions from 1790 to 1925.  We extend the
4:73:5059:25:26:90:474:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:index forward through the end of the 20th Century using data on personal and corporate
4:74:5145:26:25:90:251:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy rates and on asset prices.
4:75:5182:25:25:126:496:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In combining narrative and quantitative sources to form a discrete index of financial
4:76:5267:25:25:90:510:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions, our approach is similar to that often used to study banking and currency crises (e.g.,
4:77:5365:25:26:90:496:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Bordo, et. al., 2001).  Crises are sudden, dramatic events that
4:78:5457:26:25:90:512:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:sometimes mark the beginning of a prolonged period of financial distress.  Our interest here lies
4:79:5554:25:25:90:502:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:with gauging the impact of aggregate price disturbances on the net worth of borrowers, rather
4:80:5647:25:26:90:512:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:than in identifying the determinants of crises.  However, a discrete index of financial conditions
4:81:5745:26:25:90:200:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:also facilitates our study.
4:82:5772:25:25:126:497:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We use our index as the dependent variable in econometric analysis of the impact of
4:83:5855:25:26:90:510:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:aggregate price shocks on financial conditions.  Because the annual index takes discrete values,
4:84:5951:26:25:90:498:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:we estimate a dynamic probit model that accommodates time series features of the data.  We
4:85:6041:25:25:90:516:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:control for changes in real output, terms of trade, liquidity, and monetary regime, and investigate
4:86:6140:25:25:90:505:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:whether the impact of price shocks was affected by regulation of the financial sector.  We find
4:87:6235:25:26:90:503:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that aggregate price shocks have been an important cause of financial instability in the United
4:88:6330:26:25:90:481:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Kingdom historically, except when war-related shocks were dominant or heavy financial
4:89:6415:25:25:90:467:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:regulation muffled the impact of macroeconomic disturbances on the financial sector.
4:90:6499:25:26:126:514:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Section II describes briefly how aggregate price shocks can disrupt financial conditions.
4:91:6588:26:25:90:483:102:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Section III presents our index of financial conditions.  Section IV describes the history of
4:92:6680:25:0:90:514:77:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial instability in the United Kingdom over our sample period and compares the index with
5:93:6775:0:26:90:493:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:various quantitative measures of financial conditions.  Section V describes our econometric
5:94:6866:26:25:90:414:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:model and Section VI presents estimation results.  Section VII concludes.
5:95:6939:25:25:90:356:659:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:II. Aggregate Price Shocks and Financial Instability
5:96:6990:25:25:126:506:634:99:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f3: Financial instability can be either a cause or a consequence of general macroeconomic
5:97:7075:25:25:90:488:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:instability.  Banking panics, for example, were a principal source of monetary contraction,
5:98:7166:25:26:90:492:584:122:g_d0_f3:48:g_d0_f3:deflation, and declines in real economic activity in the United Kingdom before the mid-19th
5:99:7257:26:25:90:511:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Century, and even later in the United States and other countries (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963;
5:100:7351:25:25:90:501:533:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Bernanke, 1983; Bernanke and James, 1991).  Macroeconomic shocks, such as a falling price
5:101:7440:25:26:90:482:508:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:level (or inflation rate) can, however, also be a source of financial distress.  Because debt
5:102:7533:26:25:90:510:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:contracts typically are written in nominal, fixed rate terms, a decline in the price level increases
5:103:7633:25:25:90:521:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the real cost of servicing outstanding debt, which can increase loan defaults and bankruptcies, and
5:104:7732:25:25:90:502:432:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:in turn put pressure on lenders.  Even a decline in the rate of inflation can cause distress if the
5:105:7831:25:26:90:513:407:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:decline is unexpected and not hedged, because some borrowers will have insufficient revenue to
5:106:7925:26:25:90:399:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:service debt that could have been repaid in the absence of disinflation.
5:107:7997:25:25:126:516:356:99:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f3: Fisher (1932, 1933) was among the first to describe the impact of a falling price level on
5:108:8087:25:26:90:514:331:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial conditions in a business cycle framework.  According to Fisher, business cycle upturns
5:109:8183:26:25:90:519:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:are triggered by exogenous factors that provide new, profitable opportunities in key sectors of the
5:110:8282:25:25:90:510:280:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:economy.  Rising prices and profits encourage more investment and also speculation for capital
5:111:8376:25:25:90:512:255:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:gains.  Debt finance through bank loans increases deposits and the money supply, and raises the
5:112:8471:25:26:90:509:230:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:price level.  A general optimism or euphoria takes hold, which increases monetary velocity and
5:113:8565:26:25:90:514:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:further fuels the expansion, while rising prices encourage further borrowing by reducing the real
5:114:8662:25:25:90:204:179:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:value of outstanding debt.
5:115:8688:25:26:126:511:154:99:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f3: The process continues until a general state of “overindebtedness” is reached, that is, the
5:116:8778:26:25:90:489:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:point at which individuals, firms, and banks generate insufficient cash flow to service their
5:117:8871:25:25:90:499:103:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:liabilities.  At this point, any shortfall in the price level from its expected value, regardless of
5:118:8971:25:0:90:518:78:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:cause, will leave borrowers unable to service their debts and lead to distress selling.  As loans are
6:119:9073:0:26:90:491:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:extinguished, bank deposits and the money supply decline, further lowering the price level.
6:120:9164:26:25:90:484:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Deflation increases the real burden of remaining debt, leading to further bankruptcies and
6:121:9254:25:25:90:505:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:declining economic activity – a process referred to as “debt-deflation.”  The process continues
6:122:9349:25:26:90:479:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:until either widespread bankruptcy has eliminated the overindebtedness or a reflationary
6:123:9437:26:25:90:522:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary policy has been adopted.  Once recovery begins, however, the whole process will repeat
6:124:9532:25:25:90:117:583:122:g_d0_f3:48:g_d0_f3:itself.2
6:125:9540:25:26:126:497:558:99:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f3: Schwartz (1988, 1995, 1997) offers an alternative explanation, focused explicitly on
6:126:9624:26:25:90:503:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary policy, of how aggregate price instability can lead to financial instability.  Schwartz
6:127:9720:25:25:90:491:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:contends that when monetary policy produces fluctuations in the inflation rate, information
6:128:9811:25:25:90:493:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:problems associated with evaluating alternative investments are made worse which, in turn,
6:129:9901:25:26:90:221:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:increases financial instability:
6:130:9933:26:12:126:495:431:99:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f3: Both [borrowers and lenders] evaluate the prospects of projects by extrapolating the
6:131:10017:12:13:126:518:419:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:prevailing price level or inflation rate.  Borrowers default on loans not because they have
6:132:10108:13:13:126:487:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:misled uninformed lenders but because, subsequent to the initiation of the project,
6:133:10191:13:12:126:517:393:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:authorities have altered monetary policy in a contractionary direction.  The original price
6:134:10282:12:13:126:513:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:level and inflation rate assumptions are no longer valid.  The change in monetary policy
6:135:10370:13:13:126:489:368:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:makes rate-of-return calculations on the yield of projects, based on the initial price
6:136:10456:13:24:126:480:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:assumptions of both lenders and borrowers, unrealizable. (Schwartz 1995, p. 24)
6:137:10535:24:26:126:516:331:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Schwartz does not model formally how changes in the inflation rate can lead to financial
6:138:10623:26:25:90:494:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:instability, but her description fits well with the “monetary misperceptions” model of Lucas
6:139:10715:25:25:90:516:280:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(1972, 1973).  In that model, individuals are unable to distinguish with certainty shifts in relative
6:140:10816:25:25:90:471:255:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:prices from changes in the aggregate price level.  This uncertainty can lead to resource
6:141:10904:25:26:90:502:230:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:misallocation, which is corrected only once the true nature of a price change becomes known.
6:142:10996:26:25:126:510:204:99:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f3: This model is easily extended to incorporate financial decisions.  Uncertainty about the
6:143:11084:25:25:90:520:179:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:nature of price changes can lead to bad forecasts of real returns to investment projects and, hence,
6:144:11184:25:26:90:513:154:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:to unprofitable borrowing and lending decisions.  Such mistakes can affect borrower defaults ex
6:145:11279:26:25:90:507:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:post.  An unanticipated disinflation, for example, can increase default rates by causing realized
6:146:11376:25:25:90:502:103:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:borrower incomes to fall below expectations.  Although disinflation causes the real income to

7:149:11629:0:26:90:497:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lenders on loans that do not default to exceed expectations, an increase in default rates could
7:150:11724:26:25:90:518:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:more than offset this gain and result in significant distress for lenders.  In the aggregate, financial
7:151:11827:25:25:90:481:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:instability is likely to be associated with disinflation because some projects will generate
7:152:11919:25:26:90:511:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:insufficient income to repay loans unless the rate of inflation equals or exceeds the rate that had
7:153:12018:26:25:90:275:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:been expected when the loans were made.
7:154:12057:25:25:126:510:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Higher than anticipated inflation, by contrast, can cause financial exuberance.  Lending
7:155:12145:25:26:90:503:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:booms can result if positive aggregate price disturbances cause borrowers and lenders to form
7:156:12238:26:25:90:473:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:optimistic expectations about future real returns to projects because of their inability to
7:157:12329:25:25:90:497:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:distinguish shifts in relative prices from changes in the aggregate price level.  Such financial
7:158:12425:25:25:90:416:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:exuberance can last only until the true path of aggregate prices is realized.
7:159:12502:25:26:126:511:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Bernanke, et. al. (1999) extend the analysis further by
7:160:12589:26:25:90:513:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:considering the implications of aggregate price shocks in the presence of credit market frictions.
7:161:12687:25:25:90:501:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders, for example, will cause a decline in
7:162:12777:25:26:90:505:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:borrower net worth to drive up agency costs and, hence, the cost of external finance.  Thus, by
7:163:12872:26:25:90:496:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:eroding the net worth of borrowers, unanticipated deflation will increase the cost of external
7:164:12966:25:25:90:498:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:finance and thereby exacerbate swings in borrowing and, hence, in investment, spending and
7:165:13056:25:26:90:121:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:output.
7:166:13063:26:24:90:307:279:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:III. An Index of U.K. Financial Conditions
7:167:13104:24:25:126:487:255:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We investigate empirically the impact of aggregate price shocks on U.K. financial
7:168:13185:25:26:90:501:230:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions historically to provide evidence on the extent to which price stability and financial
7:169:13281:26:25:90:521:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stability are complementary.  In lieu of consistent, continuous data on loan default rates, bank and
7:170:13381:25:25:90:521:179:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:firm profit rates, returns on fixed assets, and similar aspects of financial condition, we use various
7:171:13483:25:26:90:520:154:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:narrative and quantitative information to develop a comprehensive annual index of U.K. financial
7:172:13579:26:25:90:205:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions for 1790-1999.
7:173:13604:25:25:126:482:103:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Our index assigns each year from 1790 to 1999 to one of five categories: “severe
7:174:13684:25:0:90:518:78:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial distress,” “moderate distress,” “normal,” “financial expansion,” or “financial euphoria,”
8:175:13784:0:26:90:479:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:as reported in Table 1.  For 1790-1925, our principal source is the compilation of annual
8:176:13873:26:25:90:520:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:summaries of economic and financial conditions produced for several countries by Willard Thorp
8:177:13967:25:25:90:464:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(1926) in a volume for the National Bureau of Economic Research.  We compare the
8:178:14047:25:26:90:511:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:classifications based on Thorp’s summaries with available data on banking conditions, and firm
8:179:14141:26:25:90:514:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and household bankruptcies to gauge the reasonableness of our index.  Although Thorp’s (1926)
8:180:14234:25:25:90:513:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:summaries end with 1925, more quantitative information on financial conditions is available for
8:181:14329:25:26:90:522:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the period since then.  For 1926-99, we construct a five-category index from annual time series on
8:182:14427:26:25:90:344:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcies and corporate insolvencies, and asset prices.
8:183:14485:25:25:126:486:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Thorp’s (1926) annual summaries include information about prices, foreign trade,
8:184:14565:25:25:90:517:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:employment, and notable political events, as well as about financial and monetary conditions.  In
8:185:14662:25:26:90:493:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:using these summaries to derive our index, we focus exclusively on Thorp’s descriptions of
8:186:14752:26:25:90:513:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial and monetary conditions.  We give several examples below illustrating the mapping of
8:187:14846:25:25:90:315:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Thorp’s descriptions into specific index categories.
8:188:14898:25:26:126:491:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We assign years that Thorp notes had “many failures,” bank runs or panics, “tight”
8:189:14980:26:25:90:509:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary conditions, or sharp declines in asset prices, to the “severe distress” category.  To the
8:190:15078:25:25:90:503:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:“moderate distress” category, we assign years that Thorp describes in less strong terms.  Such
8:191:15172:25:26:90:498:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:years also might have had severe financial panics or distress during a portion of the year, but
8:192:15267:26:25:90:522:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:normal or financially expansionary conditions in a significant part of the year.  One such year was
8:193:15366:25:25:90:519:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1825, when rapid financial and economic expansion during the first part of the year was followed
8:194:15462:25:25:90:517:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:by severe distress marked by a stock market crash in May and banking panic in December (Neal,
8:195:15555:25:26:90:496:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1998).  We are interested in capturing the mean state of financial conditions during the year,
8:196:15649:26:25:90:497:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rather than simply identifying the occurrence of a crisis, as typically is done in studies of the
8:197:15746:25:25:90:487:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:determinants or effects of crises (e.g., Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Bordo, et. al., 2001).
8:198:15838:25:26:90:493:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Hence, we classify 1825 as a year of “moderate” financial distress, weighting implicitly the
8:199:15930:26:25:90:511:102:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:expansionary conditions of the first one-third of the year with the severely distressed conditions
8:200:16028:25:0:90:221:77:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of the year’s latter two-thirds.
9:201:16061:0:26:126:477:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Based on Thorp’s descriptions, we also classify some years as having unusually
9:202:16139:26:25:90:518:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:expansionary or euphoric financial conditions.  Such years tended to have below normal business
9:203:16234:25:25:90:515:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:failure rates and above normal increases in asset prices.  Thorp describes several years as having
9:204:16332:25:26:90:504:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:“active speculation,” “easy money,” “many new companies,” “large profits,” etc.  We classify
9:205:16424:26:25:90:478:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:such years as having “expansionary” financial conditions.  Thorp characterizes financial
9:206:16512:25:25:90:481:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions in a few years in especially glowing terms.  For example, in 1809 he reports a
9:207:16601:25:26:90:514:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:“frenzied” pace of speculation.  In 1836, he writes that there was “excited” speculation in stocks
9:208:16699:26:25:90:520:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and “active formation of joint stock companies, especially banks.”  And, in 1919 there was “rapid
9:209:16796:25:25:90:520:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:industrial expansion” and a “rapid rise in stocks,” with “boom” conditions generally.  We classify
9:210:16894:25:25:90:294:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:all three years as ones of financial “euphoria.”
9:211:16942:25:26:126:521:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For 1925-99, we construct our index from data on personal and commercial bankruptcies,
9:212:17028:26:25:90:516:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and the excess return to housing investment.  Financial distress is characterized by elevated rates
9:213:17127:25:25:90:506:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of personal and firm bankruptcy, as households and firms find it increasingly difficult to repay
9:214:17223:25:26:90:516:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:existing loans and borrow additional funds.  Similarly, years of unusually expansionary financial
9:215:17320:26:25:90:514:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions are characterized by low rates of failure.  Modern U.K. bankruptcy law dates from an
9:216:17415:25:25:90:521:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:act of 1883.  The act was revised in 1914 and again in 1976, but provided a fairly consistent set of
9:217:17515:25:26:90:522:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy rules and procedures until 1986, when a new bankruptcy law took effect.  The new act
9:218:17610:26:25:90:502:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:simplified the process of declaring bankruptcy and introduced a number of other changes that
9:219:17702:25:25:90:490:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:preclude a meaningful comparison of bankruptcy rates before and after 1986.3  Reasonably
9:220:17790:25:25:90:506:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:consistent data on corporate insolvency rates are, however, available from 1960 to the present.
9:221:17885:25:26:90:521:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Thus, in constructing our index, we use the rate of household and unincorporated firm bankruptcy
9:222:17981:26:25:90:512:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(bankruptcies per capita) for 1926-59 and the rate of corporate insolvency (insolvencies divided
9:223:18077:25:25:90:430:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:by number of firms) for 1960-99 as one component of our quantitative index.
9:224:18152:25:26:126:519:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In addition to household and firm failures, episodes of financial distress or expansion can
9:225:18243:26:0:90:494:102:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:be reflected in the movement of asset prices.  Periods of financial expansion, easy monetary
10:226:18336:0:26:90:510:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions, lending booms and high confidence levels are often characterized by relatively high
10:227:18431:26:25:90:501:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:returns on risky assets, such as real estate.  Relatively low returns on such assets, on the other
10:228:18529:25:25:90:521:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:hand, can indicate financial distress as lenders redirect their investment to safe assets.  We use the
10:229:18631:25:26:90:521:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:excess return on housing, measured as the annual percentage increase in an index of U.K. housing
10:230:18727:26:25:90:499:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:prices less the annual average market yield on consols, as an index component.  Because real
10:231:18819:25:25:90:520:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:estate purchases are often debt financed, a shock to real estate prices directly affects the net worth
10:232:18921:25:26:90:485:558:122:g_d0_f3:48:g_d0_f3:of borrowers – the aspect of financial conditions we are primarily interested in capturing.4
10:233:19013:26:25:126:482:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We construct our index of financial conditions for 1926-99 by computing annual
10:234:19091:25:25:90:521:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:deviations of the bankruptcy (insolvency) rate and excess housing returns series from their trends.
10:235:19190:25:25:90:519:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We then average the two series of deviations so that years of financial distress, for example, were
10:236:19289:25:26:90:511:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:characterized by high rates of bankruptcy (insolvency) and/or low excess returns to housing.  In
10:237:19385:26:25:90:521:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:averaging, we assign less weight to the more volatile series during subperiods of interest.  Finally,
10:238:19486:25:25:90:486:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:we assign each year to one of five categories of financial conditions based on this average
10:239:19577:25:26:90:521:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:deviation measure.  Full details on construction of the index are presented in Appendix A.  We do
10:240:19674:26:25:90:513:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:not compute an index for 1940-47 because of the unusual economic conditions in Britain during
10:241:19767:25:25:90:522:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and immediately after World War II, and we treat those years separately in our empirical analysis.

10:243:19902:25:25:126:478:280:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Before examining the relationship between aggregate price shocks and financial
10:244:19980:25:25:90:499:255:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions, as reflected by our index, we briefly compare the index with information on bank
10:245:20072:25:26:90:519:230:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:failures and bankruptcies that exist for parts of the period covered by our index.  We assign index
10:246:20171:26:26:90:514:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:categories from 1 for “severe distress” to 5 for “financial euphoria.  Figure 1 plots annual values

10:249:20522:12:16:90:512:159:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:4  We considered and rejected using the return on equities as a component of our index.  Equity purchases
10:250:20627:16:11:90:518:143:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:tend not to be highly leveraged, and so shocks to equity prices less directly affect the financial condition of
10:251:20738:11:12:90:520:132:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:borrowers and lenders.  Moreover, consistent series on equity prices are not available throughout the period
10:252:20846:12:12:90:521:120:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:of interest, and capital market issues were heavily regulated after World War II.  We also rejected measures
10:253:20954:12:11:90:516:108:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:of banking conditions.  Bank profits data are available for only a portion of the period of study, and during
10:254:21063:11:11:90:519:97:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:much of that period profit rates were influenced by mergers, market structure and implicit regulation which

11:259:21464:25:25:90:487:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:moderate or severe financial distress based on Thorp (1926) tended to have above average
11:260:21552:25:26:90:504:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:numbers of bank failures and bankruptcy rates, e.g., 1793, 1810, 1814-16, 1825-26.  Years we
11:261:21644:26:25:90:518:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:classify as having unusually expansionary or euphoric financial conditions, by contrast, tended to
11:262:21742:25:25:90:511:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:have low numbers of bank failures and low bankruptcy rates, e.g., 1802, 1808-09, 1823-24, and
11:263:21835:25:26:90:129:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1834-36.
11:264:21843:26:25:126:505:532:122:g_d0_f3:48:g_d0_f3:The most prolonged period of financial distress in the United Kingdom during the 19th
11:265:21928:25:25:90:484:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:century occurred during 1837-43.  The crisis of 1837 was preceded by a sharp increase in
11:266:22016:25:25:90:506:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:commodity prices and a stock market boom (Temin 1969; Levy-Leboyer, 1978).  The Bank of
11:267:22103:25:26:90:507:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:England raised Bank Rate in the fall of 1836 to halt an external drain, which quickly ended the
11:268:22198:26:25:90:510:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:boom, initiated a decline in the price level and led to panic and recession.  Thorp (1926, p. 160)
11:269:22296:25:25:90:516:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:describes 1837 as a year having “many failures, ... continued financial strain [and] panic.”  Easy
11:270:22394:25:26:90:504:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary conditions in 1838 were followed by “severe” tightening in 1839, along with “many
11:271:22484:26:25:90:514:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:failures” and a “gold crisis.”  1840 brought “signs of improvement” early in the year that proved
11:272:22581:25:25:90:509:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:short-lived, whereas the severe depression of 1841 was characterized by tight money and again
11:273:22674:25:26:90:505:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:“many failures.”  After having fallen to low levels during 1833-36, bankruptcy rates increased
11:274:22768:26:25:90:515:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:sharply in 1837 and again in 1840-42, though not to the levels observed during the distress years
11:275:22865:25:25:90:230:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of 1810-11, 1815-16, and 1826.
11:276:22895:25:25:126:509:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Financial distress moderated during the mid-1840s.  Financial speculation “revived” in
11:277:22981:25:26:90:487:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1844 and was “active” in 1846, according to Thorp (1926), and equity prices soared while
11:278:23069:26:25:90:513:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy rates fell off.  Severe financial distress, reflected in a sharp increase in bankruptcies,
11:279:23170:25:56:90:498:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:returned in 1847-48, but financial expansion resumed in the early 1850s.  1852, for example,

11:281:23315:7:16:90:496:90:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:5   We thank Anna Schwartz for providing annual data on bank failures and bankruptcies, which were
11:282:23413:16:0:90:315:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:compiled during the preparation of Gayer, et. al. (1953).
12:283:23472:0:26:90:469:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:witnessed “very easy” monetary conditions and “considerable activity in forming new
12:284:23555:26:25:90:210:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:enterprises” (Thorp, 1926).
12:285:23582:25:25:126:498:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Although we lack data on either bankruptcies or bank failures from 1853 to the mid-
12:286:23665:25:26:90:505:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1880s, our index reflects the well known financial history of the period.  For example, “severe
12:287:23760:26:25:90:500:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:distress” returned in 1857, when financial panic originating in the United States spread to the
12:288:23855:25:25:90:506:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:United Kingdom through correspondent banks in Liverpool.  Financial conditions improved in
12:289:23945:25:26:90:286:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1858, but remained “moderately” distressed.
12:290:23988:26:25:126:517:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The cycle of boom and bust was repeated again in the 1860s, with a period of prosperity,
12:291:24076:25:25:90:519:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rising prices and stock market speculation culminating in a banking panic in 1866 when the Bank
12:292:24171:25:25:90:488:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of England raised Bank Rate and Overend, Gurney and Company, a major discount house,
12:293:24255:25:26:90:502:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:collapsed (Batchelor, 1986).  Thorp (1926) cites “many failures,” “panic,” and the collapse of
12:294:24349:26:25:90:519:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:security speculation as the major financial disruptions of the year, and we classify the year as one
12:295:24449:25:25:90:479:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of “severe” distress.  Financial conditions remained “moderately” distressed in 1867-68.
12:296:24537:25:26:90:138:381:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:1867-1913
12:297:24546:26:25:126:518:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Figure 3 compares our index against the annual percent change in the bankruptcy rate for
12:298:24634:25:25:90:507:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1885-1913.  The U.K. enacted its first comprehensive bankruptcy law in 1883, and bankruptcy
12:299:24725:25:26:90:507:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rates were high for a few years thereafter.  Beginning about 1890, however, years classified by
12:300:24820:26:25:90:515:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:our index as having financial distress generally coincide with increases in bankruptcy rates.  The
12:301:24918:25:25:90:518:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy rate increased sharply in 1891, and remained high through 1894, a period of financial
12:302:25014:25:25:90:496:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:distress according to our index.  By contrast, the bankruptcy rate declined in 1899 and 1906,
12:303:25107:25:26:90:398:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:when our index indicates that financial conditions were expansionary.
12:304:25176:26:25:90:182:178:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:World War I to 1999
12:305:25195:25:25:126:517:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The end of World War I brought a financial “boom” in 1919, according to Thorp (1926),
12:306:25280:25:26:90:505:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:but this “feverish activity” soon gave way to tight monetary conditions, a halt to the growth of
12:307:25376:26:0:90:517:102:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bank lending and deflation.  After a year of severe financial distress in 1921, financial conditions
13:308:25478:0:26:90:509:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stabilized somewhat, but tight monetary conditions and chronic gold reserve losses plagued the
13:309:25572:26:25:90:521:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:U.K. economy for ten more years, culminating in suspension of convertibility in September 1931.
13:310:25667:25:25:126:425:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Beginning in 1926, our index of financial conditions is based on the
13:311:25735:25:26:90:521:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy/insolvency rate and the excess return on housing, as described above.  Figures 4 and 5
13:312:25832:26:25:90:518:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:plot our index and the data that underlay it for 1926-99 (excluding 1940-47).6  Years of moderate
13:313:25929:25:25:90:470:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:or severe financial distress correspond to years that had unusually high bankruptcy (or
13:314:26016:25:26:90:506:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:insolvency) rates and low excess real estate returns.  Years of financial expansion, by contrast,
13:315:26113:26:25:90:423:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:generally had low bankruptcy (or insolvency) rates and high excess returns.
13:316:26188:25:25:126:514:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Although the U.K. suffered relatively less financial distress during the Great Depression
13:317:26277:25:25:90:506:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:than many other countries, 1931 and 1932 were years of moderate distress, as reflected in high
13:318:26371:25:26:90:476:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rates of bankruptcy and stagnant housing prices.  1934, 1936, and 1939, by contrast had
13:319:26458:26:25:90:494:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:expansionary financial conditions, reflecting unusually high excess housing returns and low
13:320:26549:25:25:90:166:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy rates.
13:321:26566:25:26:126:494:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Our index resumes in 1948 when, under the influence of heavy regulation, the U.K.
13:322:26647:26:25:90:506:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial system had entered a period of stability.  Sharp increases in excess housing returns in
13:323:26744:25:25:90:368:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1957-58 account for modest financial expansion in those years.
13:324:26806:25:26:126:487:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The U.K. financial sector came under increasing strain during the 1960s, reflected
13:325:26888:26:25:90:487:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:primarily in an increase in corporate insolvency rates, but also low returns on fixed assets,
13:326:26981:25:25:90:513:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:including housing.  Sharp increases in asset prices soon followed, however, and real estate price
13:327:27078:25:25:90:478:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:spikes in 1973 and 1975 cause our index to classify financial conditions in both years as
13:328:27167:25:26:90:483:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:moderately expansionary, despite an increase in bankruptcies in 1975.7  Boom conditions

13:330:27307:7:16:90:480:171:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:6  The annual data plotted for the bankruptcy/insolvency rate and the excess return on housing are

13:332:27507:7:16:90:516:148:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:7   The U.K. stock market declined precipitously in 1974 and in terms of share prices, the mid-1970s was a
13:333:27613:16:12:90:512:132:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:period of considerable financial instability.  Corporate insolvency rates and returns to housing investment
13:334:27720:12:12:90:492:120:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:were not unusual in 1974, however, and, hence, our index classifies the year as having had “normal”
13:335:27819:12:11:90:511:108:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:financial conditions.  In addition to being a less direct indicator of the condition of borrowers, as noted in
13:336:27929:11:11:90:511:97:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:footnote 4, we do not include the return on stocks in our index in part because of the extreme volatility of
13:337:28037:11:12:90:508:86:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:U.K. share prices in the postwar era and the different regulatory controls imposed on the stock market in
13:338:28142:12:0:90:204:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:this period (see Dow, 1964).
14:339:28172:0:26:90:515:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:returned at the end of the decade.  Low rates of bankruptcy and rapid growth in real estate prices
14:340:28270:26:25:90:521:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:occurred at the inflation and cycle peak in 1979, producing a “euphoric” year on our index, which
14:341:28367:25:25:90:517:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:carried over into 1980 before a switch to tight monetary policy took hold.  The disinflation of the
14:342:28466:25:26:90:514:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:early 1980s, however, was accompanied by falling excess returns on real estate and other assets,
14:343:28562:26:25:90:438:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and with high household and business failure rates that lasted for several years.
14:344:28643:25:25:126:518:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Bank lending grew rapidly in the 1980s and household and firm debt growth accelerated.
14:345:28729:25:26:90:510:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Real estate and other asset prices began to increase sharply in the late 1980s to 1989, which our
14:346:28826:26:25:90:305:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:index classifies as a year of moderate expansion.
14:347:28875:25:25:126:505:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The boom of the late 1980s ended with the recession of 1989-92, which saw a marked
14:348:28957:25:25:90:490:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:increase in firm insolvency rates and low excess returns on risky assets, such as real estate.
14:349:29051:25:26:90:511:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Although we adjust for the increased variability of the insolvency rate over time in constructing

14:351:29243:25:26:90:385:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that our index classifies the year as one of severe financial distress.
14:352:29314:26:24:90:276:380:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:V.Empirical Analysis:  The Model
14:353:29346:24:25:126:501:356:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We use our index of financial conditions as the dependent variable in an econometric
14:354:29430:25:26:90:484:331:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:analysis of the impact of aggregate price shocks on U.K. financial conditions historically.
14:355:29521:26:25:90:493:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Because the index is categorical, we use a probit model, modified to account for time series
14:356:29613:25:25:90:518:280:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:features of the data.  The general set-up is that an observed variable, y, takes on one of J different
14:357:29715:25:25:90:480:255:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:discrete values.  A continuous latent level, y*, follows a standard time series process and
14:358:29806:25:29:90:508:230:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:determines the discrete level of y.  The mapping between the continuous latent variable and the
14:359:29901:29:29:90:516:201:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:discrete variable is yjyccttjj∈∈−categoryif*,,1di where c is a vector of cut-off parameters
14:360:29991:29:28:90:299:172:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that determine the boundaries of the categories.
14:361:30039:28:26:126:507:144:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:A basic time-series probit model of y* includes at least one autoregressive term on the

15:379:30756:25:26:90:479:534:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:to extend the model to include additional features, such as regime-switching parameters.
15:380:30844:26:25:126:491:508:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:By contrast, we use Gibbs sampling to estimate equation (1) and allow for possible
15:381:30926:25:27:90:503:483:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:regime switching.  Gibbs sampling offers a tractable method of estimating the dynamic probit
15:382:31018:27:27:90:515:456:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:model, as well as other models where the joint density of yt*and yt-1* is difficult to evaluate (see
15:383:31118:27:25:90:508:429:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Dueker 1999).  Gibbs sampling involves generating a sample of draws from a joint distribution
15:384:31211:25:27:90:520:404:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:through a sequence of draws from the respective conditional distributions.  In the present context,
15:385:31310:27:29:90:496:377:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:such data augmentation allows one to treat augmented values of ys ts*,,≠ as observed data
15:386:31399:29:29:90:520:348:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:when evaluating the conditional density of yt*.  Thus, one conditions the density of yt* on a value,
15:387:31499:29:26:90:510:319:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:instead of a density, of yt−1*, making the problem much simpler than recursive evaluation of the
15:388:31595:26:26:90:507:293:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:integral in equation (2).  Furthermore, once the latent variable has been augmented, it becomes
15:389:31690:26:25:90:520:267:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:straightforward to model any regime switching, such as conditional heteroscedasticity.  Appendix
15:390:31786:25:25:90:458:242:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:C presents details and estimates of regime switching in our dynamic ordered probit.
15:391:31869:25:26:90:190:217:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:Independent Variables
15:392:31890:26:25:126:511:191:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In accordance with the discussion in Section II, we expect that negative aggregate price
15:393:31978:25:25:90:502:166:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks increase financial distress, whereas positive shocks reduce financial distress and move
15:394:32072:25:25:90:517:141:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial conditions toward expansion and euphoria.  For 1795-1931, we identify aggregate price
15:395:32167:25:26:90:505:116:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks in terms of unanticipated movements in the price level (P*).  Under the prevailing gold
15:396:32261:26:0:90:507:90:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:standard regime of this era, the price level exhibited a stochastic trend and was generally mean
16:397:32359:0:26:90:522:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:reverting, reflecting changes in the supply and demand for gold (Bordo and Schwartz, 1999).  The
16:398:32455:26:25:90:499:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:United Kingdom permanently abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, and the U.K.
16:399:32541:25:26:90:521:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:price level has increased almost continuously since then.  Hence, for  1932-99, we identify shocks
16:400:32639:26:26:90:352:633:122:g_d0_f3:49:g_d0_f3:in terms of unanticipated changes in the inflation rate (π∗).8
16:401:32701:26:26:126:514:607:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In addition to aggregate price shocks, our econometric model controls for other possible
16:402:32789:26:25:90:503:581:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:sources of financial instability, including fluctuations in real output, liquidity and the terms of
16:403:32888:25:26:90:510:556:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:trade.  We expect that financial conditions also move away from distress toward expansion as a
16:404:32982:26:27:90:513:530:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:result of increases in the growth rates of real output (∆ lnGDP), liquidity (high-powered money)
16:405:33078:27:26:90:511:503:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(∆ lnBase), and terms of trade (export prices divided by import prices) (∆ lnTTrade).  Complete
16:406:33173:26:25:90:350:477:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:descriptions and data sources are presented in Appendix B.

16:408:33261:26:25:126:487:426:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We investigate empirically the impact of aggregate price shocks on U.K. financial
16:409:33342:25:25:90:520:401:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditions across different monetary and financial regimes.  These regimes are important because
16:410:33438:25:26:90:509:376:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:they affect both the nature of price (inflation) expectations, the frequency and size of aggregate
16:411:33536:26:25:90:508:350:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:price shocks, and extent to which unanticipated changes in the price level (inflation rate) affect
16:412:33634:25:25:90:180:325:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial conditions.
16:413:33655:25:25:126:500:300:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Whereas the formation of price level and inflation rate expectations reflect the extant
16:414:33742:25:26:90:491:275:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary regime, financial market structure and regulation can impinge on the relationship
16:415:33832:26:25:90:514:249:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:between macroeconomic disturbances and financial conditions.  Government controls over bank
16:416:33923:25:25:90:509:224:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lending and capital market issues, for example, can interfere with financial responses to market
16:417:34019:25:26:90:506:199:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:forces.  Other government policies, such as flat-rate priced deposit insurance, can interact with
16:418:34116:26:30:90:512:173:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic disturbances to exacerbate financial distress.  In the United States, for example,

16:420:34265:7:16:90:508:136:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:8   We measure price shocks using autoregressions with exponential GARCH errors (Nelson, 1991).  For
16:421:34365:16:12:90:466:120:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:1795-1931, we estimate a second-order autoregressive model of the log of the price level with
16:422:34458:12:11:90:503:108:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:EGARCH(1,1) errors.  For 1932-99, we estimate a first-order autoregressive model of the inflation rate
16:423:34560:11:11:90:497:97:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:with EGARCH(2,1) errors.  To form the aggregate price shocks, we divide the model residuals by the
16:424:34658:11:12:90:521:86:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:conditional standard deviations, so that extremely volatile periods do not receive disproportionate weight in

17:426:34797:0:26:90:514:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:deposit insurance has been cited as encouraging depository institutions to take uneconomic risks
17:427:34893:26:25:90:488:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that resulted in higher numbers of bank and thrift institution failures during the 1980s than
17:428:34986:25:25:90:521:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:otherwise might have occurred (e.g., Barth, 1991).  Our econometric analysis allows for structural
17:429:35084:25:26:90:519:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:breaks in the relationship between aggregate price shocks and financial stability at major changes

17:431:35202:25:25:126:505:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Figures 6 and 7 plot December observations on the U.K. price level during 1790-1866
17:432:35285:25:26:90:504:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and 1867-1931 alongside our index of financial conditions.  Figure 8 plots annual (December-
17:433:35377:26:25:90:501:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:December) inflation rates during 1932-99 alongside our index.9  The British pound was made
17:434:35467:25:25:90:517:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:fully convertible into gold in 1717 (Kindleberger 1984, pp. 57-60).  Britain remained on the gold
17:435:35564:25:25:90:469:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:standard until September, 1931.  With the exception of two extended periods in which
17:436:35648:25:26:90:513:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:convertibility was suspended, 1797-1820 and 1914-25, the U.K. price level exhibited little trend
17:437:35744:26:25:90:488:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:or variability, especially during the “classical” gold standard era from about 1867 to 1913.
17:438:35836:25:25:90:510:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Hence, for 1795-1931, we identify aggregate price shocks in terms of changes in the price level
17:439:35931:25:26:90:503:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(Pue).  Although we consider the periods of wartime suspension to be part of the gold standard
17:440:36025:26:25:90:517:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:regime (Bordo and Kydland, 1995), our econometric analysis does allow for a structural break in
17:441:36120:25:25:90:413:330:122:g_d0_f3:49:g_d0_f3:the impact of aggregate price shocks on financial conditions at 1820/21.10
17:442:36194:25:26:126:514:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We also test for a structural break at 1866/67.  The variability of the price level declined
17:443:36286:26:25:90:512:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:after 1866, as more of the world became linked to the gold standard and as the Bank of England
17:444:36380:25:25:90:496:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:began to act as lender of last resort.  The U.K. banking system also went through a period of
17:445:36473:25:25:90:517:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:consolidation that made it considerably more stable (Capie, 1995; Sheppard, 1971; Sykes, 1926).
17:446:36568:25:38:90:496:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The period witnessed rapid growth of new financial intermediaries, such as discount houses,
17:447:36659:38:7:90:236:166:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:                                                     
17:448:36712:7:16:90:521:159:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:9   We plot December observations of the Gayer, et. al. (1953, p. 468) index of wholesale prices of domestic
17:449:36820:16:11:90:508:143:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:and imported commodities for 1790-1844, linked to Klovland’s (1993) “market price” commodity index
17:450:36918:11:12:90:516:132:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:for 1845-90, and the Sauerbeck-Statist commodity price index for 1891-1947.  The inflation rate series for
17:451:37024:12:12:90:490:120:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:1948-99 is based on December observations of the Retail Price Index.  Alternative price indexes are
17:452:37123:12:11:90:492:108:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:available, but while their short-run fluctuations differ, all exhibit similar trends in the price level and
17:453:37230:11:11:90:512:97:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:inflation rate.  In our econometric analysis, we report results for the series plotted in Figures 8-10, as well
17:454:37341:11:7:90:271:86:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:as for an annual average cost-of-living index.
17:455:37387:7:0:90:472:79:42:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:10   We also isolate World War I (1914-18) in our econometric analysis using dummy variables.
18:456:37482:0:26:90:504:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:private banks, insurance companies and building societies, however, and the securities market
18:457:37575:26:25:90:473:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:remained active.  Financial expansion in this period was reflected in the growth of new
18:458:37662:25:25:90:506:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:intermediaries and lending booms, while financial distress was reflected in the failures of such
18:459:37758:25:26:90:231:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:institutions and their borrowers.
18:460:37791:26:25:126:502:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The next fundamental change in monetary regime occurred in September 1931, when
18:461:37870:25:25:90:495:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Britain left the gold standard following a massive loss of reserves (e.g., Eichengreen, 1992).
18:462:37964:25:26:90:510:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Since then, the U.K. price level has increased almost continuously, and for 1932-99 we identify
18:463:38059:26:26:90:484:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:aggregate price shocks as unanticipated changes in the inflation rate (πue).  We test for the
18:464:38152:26:26:90:518:506:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:possibility of a structural break at 1971/72, however, corresponding to the collapse of the Bretton
18:465:38251:26:25:90:475:480:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Woods System, as well as the beginning of a sustained period of financial deregulation.
18:466:38338:25:25:126:489:455:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:World War II brought heavy government control of the domestic financial system.
18:467:38417:25:26:90:512:430:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Capital market issues, both foreign and domestic, were regulated by a Capital Issues Committee
18:468:38511:26:25:90:511:404:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:until 1959, when controls on domestic issues were relaxed, but those on foreign issues retained.
18:469:38607:25:25:90:495:379:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Bank lending was not subject to formal controls after the war, though authorities effectively
18:470:38700:25:26:90:351:354:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:pressured banks to limit advances (Dow 1964, pp. 235-36).
18:471:38757:26:25:126:514:328:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Financial deregulation continued in the 1970s and accelerated in the 1980s.  Ceilings on
18:472:38845:25:25:90:500:303:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bank lending were eased during 1970-71, and exchange controls were removed in 1979.  The
18:473:38933:25:25:90:514:278:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1980s saw the removal of controls on bank and building society lending, and deregulation of the
18:474:39028:25:26:90:515:253:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stock exchange.  It is our conjecture that free of the draconian controls of the first three post-war
18:475:39129:26:25:90:498:227:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:decades, U.K. financial conditions became more responsive to macroeconomic disturbances,
18:476:39217:25:26:90:254:202:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:including shocks to the inflation rate.
18:477:39256:26:24:90:280:176:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:VI.Empirical Analysis:  The Results
18:478:39291:24:25:126:506:152:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We use two different price level series in our econometric analysis, and our results are
18:479:39379:25:26:90:502:127:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:sensitive to the choice.  Using December price level observations of a commodity price index
18:480:39471:26:25:90:518:101:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(retail price index for 1948-99), we find a stronger impact of price shocks on financial conditions
18:481:39570:25:0:90:521:76:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:than when we use an annual average cost-of-living index.  The principal reason for this appears to
19:482:39670:0:26:90:514:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:do with the timing of financial panics and subsequent financial distress within years.  Before the
19:483:39768:26:25:90:498:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:20th Century, financial panics often occurred at price level peaks, and prices usually declined
19:484:39863:25:25:90:512:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:sharply after the onset of panic.  The price level at the end of a crisis year could be considerably
19:485:39963:25:26:90:504:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lower than it was before the crisis occurred.  Thus, annual changes in the price level measured
19:486:40058:26:25:90:499:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:using December observations often show a price level decline when changes measured using
19:487:40146:25:25:90:520:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:annual average observations do not.  Because considerable financial distress often occurred in the
19:488:40244:25:26:90:521:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:wake of financial crises, we observe a closer correlation between financial distress and price level
19:489:40344:26:25:90:432:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:declines using December price level observations than using annual averages.
19:490:40420:25:25:126:521:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Results of our probit model estimation are presented in Table 2.  In addition to coefficient
19:491:40512:25:25:90:480:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:estimates for each independent variable, we report 90 and 95 percent confidence interval
19:492:40600:25:26:90:518:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:estimates for each coefficient.  When an interval does not include zero, the coefficient estimate is
19:493:40700:26:25:90:371:431:122:g_d0_f3:49:g_d0_f3:statistically significant at the corresponding significance level.11
19:494:40768:25:25:126:522:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We test for changes in the impact of aggregate price shocks on financial conditions across
19:495:40858:25:26:90:507:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:five periods:  1796-1820, 1821-66, 1867-1931, 1932-71, and 1972-99.  Because of the unusual
19:496:40949:26:25:90:491:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:economic conditions of the two world wars, we isolate 1914-18 and 1940-49 using dummy
19:497:41034:25:26:90:509:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:variables.  Using the December price index, the coefficient estimates on aggregate price shocks
19:498:41129:26:26:90:520:304:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(Pue, πue) are positive and statistically significant at 95 percent for 1821-66, 1867-1931, and 1972-
19:499:41230:26:25:90:492:278:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:99, indicating that positive price level shocks move financial conditions away from distress
19:500:41322:25:26:90:498:253:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:toward expansion.  Using the annual average cost-of-living index, aggregate price (inflation)
19:501:41415:26:25:90:281:227:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks are significant only during 1972-99.
19:502:41458:25:25:90:138:202:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:1796-1931
19:503:41467:25:26:126:481:177:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We find no evidence that price level shocks were an important cause of financial
19:504:41547:26:25:90:491:151:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:instability during 1796-1820.  War-related shocks appear to have been a dominant cause of
19:505:41636:25:0:90:519:126:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial distress in these years.  Of the three years of severe financial distress in this period, only
20:506:41742:0:26:90:501:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1816 followed a prolonged period of deflation (see Figure 6).   Financial distress in 1793 was
20:507:41836:26:25:90:506:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:associated with a banking panic triggered by the outbreak of war with France, and the Panic of
20:508:41930:25:25:90:513:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1797 was caused in part by fears of invasion.  Episodes of “moderate” financial distress, such as
20:509:42027:25:26:90:520:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:those of 1799-1800 and 1811-12 apparently also were caused by war events, and were not closely
20:510:42121:26:25:90:368:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:related to large declines in the price level (Gayer, et. al., 1953).
20:511:42189:25:25:126:512:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:During 1821-1931, by contrast, aggregate price shocks do appear to have contributed to
20:512:42275:25:26:90:478:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial instability.  Further, we find no evidence of a change in the marginal impact of
20:513:42365:26:25:90:490:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:aggregate price shocks between 1821-66 and 1867-1931.  As illustrated in Figures 6 and 7,
20:514:42454:25:25:90:514:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:however, the U.K. price level was considerably more stable during 1867-1913 than before 1866,
20:515:42547:25:25:90:216:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:as were financial conditions.
20:516:42576:25:26:126:519:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:One measure of the economic impact of aggregate price shocks on financial conditions is
20:517:42663:26:25:90:487:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the average size shock required to move financial conditions from one state to another.  In
20:518:42754:25:27:90:507:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:standard probit estimation, the mean of the latent variable is not recovered.  Because the Gibbs
20:519:42850:27:33:90:505:379:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:sampler used here provides inferred values (draws) of the latent variable, y*, however, we can
20:520:42944:33:0:90:480:346:122:g_d0_f3:97:g_d0_f7:calculate βσσxy/* and yy**/.σ  The former indicates the immediate change in yy
20:521:43022:0:9:456:461:353:97:g_d0_f3:97:g_d0_f3:*
20:522:43023:9:27:480:518:344:97:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:*/σ caused
20:523:43033:27:27:90:519:317:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:by a one standard deviation size price shock (“impact effect”), and the latter indicates the average
20:524:43133:27:27:90:478:290:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:distance that y* lies from the boundary between the moderate distress and normal states
20:525:43220:27:27:90:517:263:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(“average distance”).  Here we normalize distances between categories of financial conditions by
20:526:43316:27:27:90:448:236:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:defining y*=0 as the boundary between the normal and moderate distress states.
20:527:43394:27:25:126:504:209:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Based on model estimates using the December price index, for 1822-1866, the impact
20:528:43476:25:25:90:520:184:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:effect is 0.308 and the average distance is 0.260.  Thus, on average, a 0.84 standard deviation size
20:529:43576:25:26:90:517:159:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:negative price shock was necessary to cause financial conditions to deteriorate immediately from

20:532:43928:8:16:90:503:100:49:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:11   Because Gibbs sampling is a Bayesian monte carlo approach to estimation, it is standard practice to
20:533:44032:16:0:90:510:84:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:report the empirical confidence interval of the coefficients from the Gibbs iterations, rather than classical
21:534:44143:0:26:90:503:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The dynamic probit also captures the long-run effects of changes in the explanatory variables.
21:535:44237:26:25:90:522:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:With a coefficient of approximately 0.30 on the lagged dependent variable, the long-run impact of
21:536:44334:25:25:90:491:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:an aggregate price shock was roughly 1.43 times the initial impact.  Hence, a 0.59 standard
21:537:44425:25:26:90:518:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:deviation size aggregate price shock is sufficient to move financial conditions from normal to the
21:538:44523:26:25:90:260:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:moderate distress state in the long-run.
21:539:44563:25:25:126:507:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:As noted above, the impact of a given-sized price shock on financial conditions during
21:540:44649:25:26:90:518:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1867-1931 was similar to that of 1821-66, but the price level was more stable after 1866.  During
21:541:44746:26:25:90:485:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1867-1931, we estimate that a negative price shock of approximately 2.25 (1.57) standard
21:542:44834:25:25:90:501:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:deviations was required to produce immediate (long-run) deterioration in financial conditions
21:543:44927:25:25:90:519:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:from average to moderate distress (the impact effect is 0.192 and the average distance 0.432).  Of
21:544:45025:25:26:90:507:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:course, a smaller shock could tip financial conditions from the bottom half of the normal range
21:545:45120:26:25:90:519:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:into moderate distress, and a simple counterfactual analysis indicates that deflationary shocks can
21:546:45219:25:25:90:521:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:account for financial conditions being in a state of “moderate distress” in 1875, 1884, 1885, 1894,
21:547:45318:25:26:90:487:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and 1931 when they would have been “normal” had no shocks occurred in those years.  In
21:548:45404:26:25:90:520:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:addition, a deflationary shock can explain why financial conditions were characterized by “severe
21:549:45501:25:25:90:318:330:122:g_d0_f3:49:g_d0_f3:distress,” rather than “moderate distress,” in 1878.12
21:550:45555:25:26:126:520:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Another indicator of the economic impact of aggregate price shocks is the contribution of
21:551:45644:26:25:90:501:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:such shocks to the probability that financial conditions are in a particular state.  The marginal
21:552:45741:25:25:90:482:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:impact of an independent variable on the probability of being in a particular state is often
21:553:45833:25:25:90:521:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:evaluated at the mean of the data.  Here, however, it is meaningful to calculate the marginal effect
21:554:45933:25:28:90:510:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of aggregate price shocks at the boundary between the moderate distress and normal states, i.e.,
21:555:46029:28:28:90:519:176:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:where y*=0.  At this point the probability that a random disturbance will tip financial conditions
21:556:46127:28:28:90:519:148:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:into a distress state is 0.50.  Moreover, evaluating the marginal effect at y*=0 in each subperiod,

22:563:46811:26:25:90:171:681:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:across subperiods.
22:564:46829:25:30:126:512:656:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In our model, the probability of not being in one of the two states of financial distress is

23:601:48982:25:25:90:504:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:to have effectively insulated U.K. financial conditions from macroeconomic instability during
23:602:49075:25:26:90:510:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:this period.  Of course, this stability may have come at the cost of restricted access of firms and
23:603:49174:26:25:90:343:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:households to credit, and limited opportunities for savers.
23:604:49233:25:25:126:483:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For the less-regulated era, 1972-99, financial conditions were more responsive to
23:605:49314:25:26:90:511:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:inflation rate shocks.  Regardless whether we use the December or annual average values of the
23:606:49408:26:25:90:512:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:price level, inflation rate shocks have a statistically significant impact on financial conditions in
23:607:49509:25:25:90:482:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:our probit model.  Positive shocks moved financial conditions away from distress toward
23:608:49596:25:25:90:480:482:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:expansion, while negative shocks increased financial distress.  Based on December price
23:609:49683:25:26:90:495:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:observations, we estimate that a 1.93 standard deviation size negative inflation shock would
23:610:49775:26:25:90:515:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:produce an immediate deterioration of financial conditions from normal to moderate distress.  In
23:611:49871:25:25:90:514:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the long run, a 1.35 standard deviation size negative inflation shock would have the same effect.
23:612:49968:25:26:90:507:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Further, we estimate that a one standard deviation size negative inflation shock would increase
23:613:50063:26:25:90:462:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the probability of financial conditions being in a distress state from 50 to 70 percent.
23:614:50151:25:25:126:512:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The period 1972-99 was marked by high and highly variable inflation during the 1970s,
23:615:50236:25:26:90:483:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and disinflation and prolonged financial distress during the early-to-mid-1980s.  Inflation
23:616:50327:26:25:90:485:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:accelerated once again at the end of the 1980s, accompanied by a financial expansion, but
23:617:50416:25:25:90:521:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:inflation declined abruptly in the early 1990s and financial conditions deteriorated markedly, with
23:618:50515:25:25:90:508:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:especially high rates of corporate insolvency.  Finally, the end of the 1990s brought a period of
23:619:50612:25:26:90:517:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:low, stable inflation and moderate financial expansion.  The three decades of this most recent era
23:620:50710:26:25:90:517:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:seem clearly to illustrate the association between aggregate price shocks and financial instability,
23:621:50810:25:26:90:432:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and hence the impact on financial conditions of deviating from price stability.

23:623:50903:24:25:126:492:103:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The results reported in this paper support the claim that price stability and financial
23:624:50990:25:0:90:513:78:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stability are complementary.  Certainly not all episodes of extreme financial distress or euphoria
24:625:51090:0:26:90:507:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:in U.K. history were the result of aggregate price shocks, but we find compelling evidence that
24:626:51185:26:25:90:404:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:such shocks often have been an important cause of financial instability.
24:627:51257:25:25:126:505:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Outside of wartime, our empirical evidence indicates that aggregate price shocks have
24:628:51342:25:26:90:485:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:had both a statistically significant and a large impact on financial conditions in the United
24:629:51435:26:25:90:517:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Kingdom.  During the gold standard era, 1821-1931, we find that deflationary shocks to the U.K.
24:630:51530:25:25:90:482:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:price level worsened aggregate financial distress while inflationary shocks contributed to
24:631:51620:25:26:90:501:558:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:expansionary financial conditions.  And, since 1972, we find that negative shocks to the U.K.
24:632:51713:26:25:90:515:532:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:inflation rate have worsened financial distress, while the immediate effect of positive shocks has
24:633:51811:25:25:90:511:507:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:been to contribute to financial expansion.  Positive shocks, of course, are no more likely to hold

24:635:52007:25:26:90:475:457:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and extant regulatory regime would produce, any more than such shocks could hold the
24:636:52091:26:25:90:283:431:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:unemployment rate below its “natural” rate.
24:637:52134:25:25:126:511:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Our historical analysis has also highlighted how financial regimes can affect the impact
24:638:52222:25:26:90:498:381:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of macroeconomic disturbances on the financial system.  Government regulation of financial
24:639:52312:26:25:90:484:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:intermediation, e.g., lending limits, capital controls, etc., can limit the ability of firms and
24:640:52408:25:25:90:510:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:individuals to respond to market signals.  Tight regulation of the financial sector, therefore, can
24:641:52507:25:26:90:517:305:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lessen speculative financing and other forms of financial expansion that often are associated with
24:642:52605:26:25:90:504:279:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lending booms.  In doing so, they can limit the financial distress associated with unanticipated
24:643:52701:25:25:90:496:254:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:price level (or inflation) decline.  For the period of heavy government regulation of the U.K.
24:644:52795:25:25:90:510:229:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial sector after World War II, we detect no statistically significant impact of inflation rate
24:645:52895:25:26:90:516:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks on financial conditions.  We do not necessarily advocate such controls, however, because
24:646:52990:26:25:90:491:178:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:regulation undoubtedly entails costs, perhaps including slower economic growth, and a full
24:647:53080:25:25:90:504:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:analysis of the costs and benefits of financial regulation are beyond the scope of this paper.  A
24:648:53177:25:26:90:505:128:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary policy that limits movement in the price level may be a preferable means of limiting
24:649:53270:26:25:90:506:102:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:financial instability (while possibly contributing to a higher rate of growth), but regulation can
24:650:53368:25:0:90:423:77:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:affect the extent to which aggregate price shocks cause financial instability.

25:652:53480:26:13:90:501:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For 1926-39, we base our index of financial conditions on annual data on household and firm
25:653:53571:13:12:90:518:671:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy rates (bankruptcy per capita), and on the excess return on housing (annual percentage

25:655:53761:13:13:90:511:646:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:series, we compute the annual difference between each year’s rate and the de-trended mean rate
25:656:53855:13:14:90:508:633:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:for 1922-39 (()xtxt- and ()yytt-), divided by the standard deviation of annual observations
25:657:53946:14:12:90:517:619:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:over that period.  We multiply the standardized deviations for the bankruptcy rate series by –1 so
25:658:54044:12:13:90:514:607:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that smaller (more negative) observations are associated with greater distress.  We then compute
25:659:54140:13:29:90:370:594:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the annual mean of the standardized distances of the two series:

25:661:54232:31:13:90:520:534:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For 1948-99, we base the index on the corporate insolvency rate and on excess return on housing.
25:662:54328:13:12:90:488:521:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Data on corporate insolvencies are available only since 1960.  For prior years, we estimate
25:663:54419:12:13:90:508:509:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:insolvency rates using data on bankruptcies described above.  Bankruptcy and insolvency rates
25:664:54512:13:13:90:469:496:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:are highly correlated during 1960-86.  The insolvency rate is defined as the number of
25:665:54598:13:12:90:495:483:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:insolvencies divided by number of firms.  The number of firms is not available for 1980-82,
25:666:54689:12:13:90:511:471:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1984, 1985, and 1987.  Estimates for these years are interpolations fit to a spline function based
25:667:54787:13:25:90:479:458:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:on total employment, which is highly correlated with the number of firms in other years.
25:668:54875:25:13:90:499:433:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For 1948-49, we compute annual standardized distance measures for both series as described
25:669:54965:13:12:90:509:420:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:above for 1926-39.  For 1948-99, however, we take account of changes in the volatility of each
25:670:55059:12:13:90:521:408:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:underlying series. We first compute the number of standard deviations that an index component is
25:671:55155:13:13:90:512:395:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:from its linear trend.  We then estimate an AR(2) autoregressive model of these deviations from
25:672:55250:13:12:90:512:382:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:trend with exponential GARCH (1,1) errors to estimate conditional volatility.  If the conditional
25:673:55347:12:13:90:507:370:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:volatility is twice its normal level, for example, we multiply the number of standard deviations
25:674:55443:13:28:90:363:357:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that an index component lies from its linear trend by one-half:

25:676:55568:23:13:90:500:306:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In addition, in computing the annual mean of the standardized distances of the two series, we
25:677:55661:13:13:90:502:293:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:weight each series of distances by its relative conditional volatility, down-weighting the more

28:782:59588:25:25:90:304:684:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:The Gibbs sampler and conditional distributions
28:783:59635:25:25:126:521:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The Gibbs sampler is an attractive estimation procedure for the time-series probit because
28:784:59725:25:29:90:518:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the conditional distribution of the latent variable is easy to derive, given the other parameters and
28:785:59826:29:29:90:490:605:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:state variables βρ,, ,  ,  ,  ,, ,SS pq   jjj1212di= and the conditional distributions of the state
28:786:59925:29:26:90:503:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:variables are simple, given values for the latent variable and parameters.  The key idea behind
28:787:60020:26:25:90:491:550:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Gibbs sampling is that after a sufficient number of iterations, the draws from the respective
28:788:60113:25:25:90:521:525:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditional distributions jointly represent a draw from the joint posterior distribution, which often
28:789:60214:25:25:90:337:500:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:cannot be evaluated directly (Gelfand and Smith, 1990).
28:790:60269:25:26:126:506:475:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Gibbs sampling consists of iterating through cycles of draws of parameter values from
28:791:60354:26:29:90:248:449:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:conditional distributions as follows:

28:854:60717:27:25:90:521:259:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:discussed in Albert and Chib (1993), all of the necessary conditional distributions can be standard

28:856:60893:25:25:126:503:209:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We ran the Gibbs sampler a total of 8000 iterations for each model specification.  We

32:1180:67175:26:25:126:491:103:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We include two forms of regime switching in the latent variable for the time-series
32:1181:67258:25:0:90:502:78:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:probit.  First, our model allows for heteroscedasticity by way of Markov-switching variances.
33:1182:67353:0:26:90:500:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Both the explanatory variables and the data that went into the construction of the quantitative

33:1184:67543:25:29:90:506:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Therefore we introduce switching between a high and low variance level governed by a binary

33:1186:67665:29:27:126:509:601:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Second, the model includes Markov switching in the intercept,β0, to allow for shifts in

33:1227:68314:26:25:90:497:292:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:boundaries around the “normal” financial conditions category are symmetrical.  We look for
33:1228:68404:25:25:90:513:267:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:symmetry by comparing the distance between the upper bound of the “normal” category and the
33:1229:68495:25:26:90:509:242:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lower bound of the “financial euphoria” category with the distance between the lower bound of
33:1230:68588:26:25:90:500:216:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the “normal” category and the upper bound of the “severe distress” category.  That is, we ask
33:1231:68681:25:26:90:488:191:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:whether shocks of a given magnitude will move financial conditions from normal to either
33:1232:68769:26:27:90:512:165:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:extreme, or whether a larger shock is needed in one direction.  The comparison is between 0−c1
33:1233:68863:27:26:90:138:138:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and c3−c2.
33:1234:68873:26:25:126:518:112:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For both specifications, the distance from normal to financial euphoria is greater than the
33:1235:68964:25:0:90:505:87:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:distance from normal to severe distress:  28 percent greater for the December/ December price
34:1236:69059:0:26:90:505:710:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks and 18 percent greater for the annual price shocks.  The cut-offs are asymmetric in this
34:1237:69154:26:25:90:483:684:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:direction despite the fact that the distress region contains more observations (50) than the
34:1238:69246:25:25:90:513:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:moderate expansion region (36).  Taken by itself, one would expect the wider category to be the
34:1239:69341:25:26:90:511:634:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:one that had to accommodate the greatest number of observations.  We find the opposite, which
34:1240:69434:26:25:90:390:608:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:suggests that financial euphoria is more elusive than severe distress.
