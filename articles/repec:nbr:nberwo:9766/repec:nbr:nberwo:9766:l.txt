2:27:1392:25:24:71:539:585:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:We examine the effect of remittances from abroad on households’ schooling decisions using data
2:28:1486:24:24:71:539:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:for El Salvador.  Following the massive war-related emigration of the 1980’s, remittances became
2:29:1582:24:24:71:539:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:a  significant  source  of  household  income  throughout  the  1990’s.    We  use  the  Cox  proportional
2:30:1688:24:24:71:539:513:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:hazard model to examine the determinants of school attendance.  Measuring income from a source
2:31:1782:24:24:71:539:489:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:that is uncorrelated with parental schooling– remittances– , we find that remittances have a large,
2:32:1881:24:24:71:539:465:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:significant effect on school retention.  We estimate that while household income net of remittances
2:33:1980:24:24:71:539:441:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:has a small, though significant, impact on the hazard of leaving school in rural and urban areas,
2:34:2077:24:24:71:539:417:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:remittances have a much larger impact on the hazard of leaving school.  In urban areas, the effect
2:35:2175:24:24:71:539:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:of remittances is, at its smallest, 10 times the size of the effect of other income.  In rural areas, the
2:36:2280:24:24:71:540:369:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:effect of remittances is about 2.6 times that of other income.  Our finding is of interest in that it
2:37:2381:24:24:71:540:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:suggests that subsidizing school attendance, particularly in poor areas, may have a large impact on
2:38:2480:24:58:71:443:321:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:school attendance and retention, even if parents have low levels of schooling.

3:45:2706:21:21:89:524:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Globalization is generally studied from the point of view of international trade, finance or 
3:46:2799:21:21:89:518:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration.  One aspect of globalization that is less understood is that of remittances.  We 
3:47:2891:21:21:89:508:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:examine the effect of remittances on households’ schooling decisions using data for El 
3:48:2978:21:21:89:518:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Salvador.  El Salvador has significantly expanded its educational coverage after the civil 
3:49:3069:21:21:89:503:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:war that ended in 1989.  In 1997, 75 percent of rural children and 92 percent of urban 
3:50:3156:21:21:89:513:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children aged 12 were enrolled in school.  The recent higher rates of retention in school 
3:51:3246:21:21:89:515:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are a remarkable accomplishment for a country that has 30 percent illiteracy rate among 
3:52:3334:21:21:89:521:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adults aged 40 to 50, and 25 percent illiteracy among adults aged 30 to 40.  The record of 
3:53:3425:21:21:89:503:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expansion of the educational system in El Salvador during the 1960’s and 1970’s was 
3:54:3509:21:21:89:524:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dismal in comparison with the record of other developing countries.  Schultz (1989) notes 
3:55:3599:21:21:89:519:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that in the period from 1960 to 1981 El Salvador was the only country to report a decline 
3:56:3689:21:21:89:500:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:B:in expected years of schooling, from 5.63 to 5.06 years, according to the 1984 World 
3:57:3774:21:21:89:244:435:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:Development Report (table 25).

3:59:3805:21:21:89:519:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There are two dimensions of the case of El Salvador that make it unique and interesting.  
3:60:3895:21:21:89:509:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:First, the institutional setting for public policy in the educational sector is such that the 
3:61:3989:21:21:89:516:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expansion of school facilities is primarily driven by the active participation of parents in 
3:62:4082:21:21:89:511:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the allocation of public and private funds.  Parents have played a leading role financing 
3:63:4172:21:21:89:485:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the expansion of private schools, which have led the urban expansion.  To expand 
3:64:4253:21:21:89:504:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:primary school coverage in rural areas, a priority of the government in the 1990’s, the 
3:65:4341:21:21:89:512:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Ministry of Education allocates resources to parents’ associations enabling them to hire 
3:66:4430:21:21:89:226:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers and buy materials.  
3:67:4459:21:21:89:92:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
3:68:4459:21:21:89:523:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second, following the massive out migration of the 1980’s, remittances from abroad have 
3:69:4547:21:21:89:509:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:become a significant source of household income throughout the 1990’s. 1  In 1997, 14 
3:70:4632:21:21:89:512:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of rural and 15 percent of urban households received remittances from relatives 
3:71:4720:21:30:89:483:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or friends living abroad.  Income from remittances expands the household budget 
3:72:4800:30:8:89:236:111:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                           
3:73:4858:8:17:89:522:103:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1 The literature has produced a number of studies that look into the flow of remittances, its persistence (see 
3:74:4968:17:12:89:498:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:for example, Funkhouser (1992) and Montes (1990)) and its impact on the economy (see for example 
3:75:5065:12:0:89:153:74:100:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Lopez (1991)). 
4:76:5080:0:21:89:493:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constraint allowing some families to find it optimal that their children acquire more 
4:77:5166:21:21:89:310:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling than they would acquire otherwise. 
4:78:5211:21:21:89:92:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
4:79:5211:21:21:89:512:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Our sample is a cross-section of 14,286 individuals aged 6 to 24, from the 1997 Annual 
4:80:5298:21:21:89:513:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Household Survey.  This is a nationally representative sample collected by the National 
4:81:5386:21:21:89:512:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Statistics Office (Digestyc).  We use the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the 
4:82:5474:21:21:89:501:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impact of characteristics of the individual and the family—including remittances and 
4:83:5559:21:21:89:509:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income separately—on the hazard of dropping out of school.  We find that remittances 
4:84:5644:21:21:89:317:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have a significant impact on school retention.   
4:85:5693:21:21:89:92:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
4:86:5693:21:21:89:496:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The use of the Cox proportional hazard model to study school attainment with cross-
4:87:5776:21:21:89:509:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sectional data is an innovation.2  The model poses some challenges, which we address, 
4:88:5862:21:21:89:497:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and at the same time it offers several advantages over its alternatives.  First, the Cox 
4:89:5951:21:21:89:517:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proportional hazard model makes use of all the available information in observations for 
4:90:6040:21:21:89:524:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children or young adults who are enrolled in school at the time of the survey (9,547 of the 
4:91:6132:21:21:89:494:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:14,286 in our sample) as well as for those who are no longer enrolled.  One popular 
4:92:6216:21:21:89:509:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:alternative is to study school completion among older individuals, who are expected to 
4:93:6303:21:21:89:496:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have finished their formal education.  An analysis of school attainment based on the 
4:94:6388:21:21:89:509:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample of individuals aged 25 and over would be especially undesirable in El Salvador 
4:95:6474:21:21:89:525:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where there have been recent efforts to expand school enrollment throughout the country.  
4:96:6564:21:21:89:502:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second, the model yields estimates of survival functions, allowing us to establish, for 
4:97:6652:21:21:89:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example, that the 1980-83 urban birth cohort enjoyed the largest improvement in school 
4:98:6739:21:21:89:500:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attainment relative to the cohort immediately prior, and that the 1984-87 rural cohort 
4:99:6826:21:21:89:493:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:experienced, by far, the largest improvement relative to the cohort that preceded it.  
4:100:6913:21:37:89:508:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Third, the model allows very flexible specifications, and we find, for example, that the 
4:101:7002:37:7:89:236:167:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                           
4:102:7060:7:16:89:483:160:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2    There are two papers that use proportional hazard models that came to our attention recently.   
4:103:7161:16:12:89:513:144:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Inchauste (2000) analyzes Bolivian data and uses a hazard model to estimate the probability that children 
4:104:7267:12:11:89:520:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:quit school in period t+1 given that they attended school in period t.  The hazard estimates are weighted by 
4:105:7376:11:12:89:517:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the probability of being constrained (which is driven by variables such as “no financial resources”, school 
4:106:7484:12:12:89:510:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:being “too far away”, and “having to work.”) Brown and Park (2001) use proportional hazard models to 
4:107:7585:12:11:89:515:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:estimate the impact of several variables (including credit constraints) on the likelihood of dropping out of 
4:108:7694:11:12:89:470:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:school at the primary and secondary level. Neither of these papers discusses the advantages or 
4:109:7789:12:0:89:373:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:shortcomings of using Cox proportional hazard models as we do here.

5:120:8309:21:21:89:521:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finance productive investments, optimal investment in schooling is a function of net rates 
5:121:8400:21:21:89:493:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of return.  These in turn are a function of benefits and costs.  Differences in rates of 
5:122:8489:21:21:89:500:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:return arising from exogenously determined, individual-specific traits, such as innate 
5:123:8576:21:21:89:482:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ability, likely provide a partial explanation for observed differences in completed 
5:124:8660:21:21:89:484:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling across members of a given family.  Differences in rates of return due to 
5:125:8743:21:21:89:514:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:location-specific factors, such as distance to school, likely explain part of the difference 
5:126:8836:21:21:89:515:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in average completed schooling across residents of different towns.  Differences in rates

5:128:9010:21:21:89:489:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling, likely explain some of the difference in school completion levels across

5:132:9193:21:21:89:499:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:forces still apply, but households’ decisions are going to be constrained by their own 
5:133:9280:21:21:89:509:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:resources.  The Becker-Tomes (1976) model suggests that the amount poor parents are 
5:134:9364:21:21:89:508:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:willing to invest in the child’s education will be smaller than the optimum under a non-
5:135:9452:21:21:89:521:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:binding borrowing constraint, but this amount will be increasing in parental income up to 
5:136:9542:21:21:89:522:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the point at which the marginal return to investment is equal to the rate of interest.  When 
5:137:9635:21:21:89:494:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there is more than one child at home, parents also decide the allocation of resources 
5:138:9721:21:21:89:346:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across children (Behrman, Pollack, Taubman, 1991).

6:140:9773:0:21:89:507:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The literature on the schooling of children in developing countries has emphasized the 
6:141:9860:21:21:89:502:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:role of family income constraints in explaining differences in school attainment.  The 
6:142:9947:21:21:89:500:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:empirical work has found that family income, parental schooling, sex, residence, and 
6:143:10032:21:21:89:520:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:family size are important determinants of school attainment.  Behrman and Wolfe (1984) 
6:144:10119:21:21:89:482:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:use Nicaraguan data to show that family background (place of birth) and parental 
6:145:10200:21:21:89:513:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling, particularly the mother’s schooling, are important determinants of children’s 
6:146:10289:21:21:89:496:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school attainment.  Parish and Willis (1993) used Taiwanese data and found that the 
6:147:10373:21:21:89:500:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects of parental income, and the size and composition of the family were strongest 
6:148:10459:21:21:89:510:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:among older cohorts and poorer households.  They interpret this evidence as indicating 
6:149:10546:21:21:89:488:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that older cohorts and poorer households are more credit constrained than younger 
6:150:10628:21:21:89:522:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts and richer households. Lillard and Willis (1994) used Malaysian data to study the 
6:151:10718:21:21:89:487:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects of parents’ and grandparents’ schooling on children’s progress through the 
6:152:10801:21:21:89:510:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:educational system.  Their data allows them to identify separately the effect of parental 
6:153:10891:21:21:89:525:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling from the effect of other time-varying variables on children’s school attainment.  
6:154:10983:21:21:89:483:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:They find that at leas two-thirds of the impact of parental education on children’s 
6:155:11067:21:21:89:514:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling is a direct consequence of parent schooling while the remaining one-third can 
6:156:11155:21:21:89:513:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be attributed to unmeasured factors that influence educational attainment of parents and

6:159:11254:21:21:89:522:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In the absence of longitudinal data, there are two problems when attempting to isolate the 
6:160:11345:21:21:89:511:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impact of genetic ability and the household budget constraint.  First, parental schooling 
6:161:11435:21:21:89:496:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may capture simultaneously genetic ability, motivation, and the capacity to generate 
6:162:11520:21:21:89:510:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income.  Second, current income is a poor measure of the household budget constraint, 
6:163:11606:21:21:89:524:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particularly in the context of important variability in current income relative to permanent 
6:164:11699:21:21:89:491:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income, leading to a downward bias in the estimated effect of household income in 
6:165:11781:21:21:89:505:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children's schooling (Haveman and Wolfe 1995).  This ambiguity is problematic for it 
6:166:11866:21:21:89:484:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:weakens the support for income transfers as a means to improve opportunities for 
6:167:11947:21:21:89:517:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children whose parents lack schooling.  Studies that shed light on the marginal effects of 
6:168:12038:21:21:89:432:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the parental income versus schooling variables are especially valuable.

7:170:12111:0:21:89:499:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We examine a cross section of households in 1997, measure the school attainment of 
7:171:12194:21:21:89:497:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals aged 6 to 24, and estimate the impact of household characteristics on the 
7:172:12280:21:21:89:514:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard of dropping out of school.  Included in the household characteristics we measure 
7:173:12368:21:21:89:510:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are local indicators, parental schooling, income and remittances (where the last two are 
7:174:12457:21:21:89:510:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measured at the time of the survey).   The 1980’s out migration wave from El Salvador 
7:175:12543:21:21:89:511:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:was primarily motivated by political factors. The peace accord was signed in 1992, and 
7:176:12630:21:21:89:476:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration flows after 1992 are more likely to be explained by economic factors, 
7:177:12710:21:21:89:489:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including the presence of a migrant population in the United States. Therefore, our 
7:178:12794:21:21:89:518:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:observed sample may include households receiving remittances because they have a one-
7:179:12879:21:21:89:519:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time political exile relative or friend living abroad, and households receiving remittances 
7:180:12971:21:21:89:517:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because they sent a family member to work and remit income from abroad.  Remittances 
7:181:13055:21:21:89:507:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:received by the first type of household are arguably equivalent to a randomly assigned 
7:182:13142:21:21:89:440:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income transfer, while remittances received by the second type are not.

7:184:13216:21:21:89:522:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:If remittances are randomly assigned across households, our analysis provides an unusual 
7:185:13305:21:21:89:521:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity to identify separately the effect of income from that of parental schooling.  If 
7:186:13398:21:21:89:496:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration has been driven primarily by economic reasons and remittances cannot be 
7:187:13480:21:21:89:470:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:viewed as the result of random assignment, our study still makes the important 
7:188:13559:21:21:89:523:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of focusing attention on the effect of remittances on human capital formation 
7:189:13650:21:21:89:497:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and quantifies the effect on school retention rates throughout primary and secondary 
7:190:13735:21:21:89:519:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of remittances 
7:191:13827:21:21:89:377:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on an important household decision using micro-level data.

7:194:13971:21:21:89:495:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measured effect is a cleaner estimate of the impact of relaxing a household’s budget

7:196:14141:21:21:89:513:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which is typically correlated with parental schooling.  We focus on three characteristics 
7:197:14231:21:21:89:479:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of households: family income, parental schooling, and the number of school-age 
7:198:14310:21:21:89:512:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children. We separate rural and urban households because of the significant differences 
7:199:14398:21:21:89:486:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in income and schooling across the rural-urban divide.  Comparing the location of 
7:200:14480:21:0:89:520:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recipient and non-recipient households along the distribution of these variables, we show 
8:201:14571:0:21:89:487:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that all groups are likely to receive remittances.  In addition, we report the median 
8:202:14657:21:21:89:502:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:amount of remittance and show that it is remarkably stable across the various groups.

8:208:14964:21:21:89:509:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas.  Non-recipient households represent 85% of urban and 86% of rural households.

8:211:15226:21:21:89:469:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:30% of households fall in the first decile of the distribution, and the remaining 
8:212:15308:21:21:89:493:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households are roughly evenly distributed throughout the other 9 deciles.  The over-
8:213:15392:21:21:89:497:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:representation of households in the lowest decile of the income distribution does not 
8:214:15478:21:21:89:497:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:imply that recipient households are significantly more likely to be poor households.  
8:215:15564:21:21:89:517:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:These households have fewer members employed than non-recipient households so their

8:218:15811:21:21:89:517:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:received by households in each decile.  Clearly, the remittance amount is independent of

8:223:16254:21:21:89:509:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage of recipient households that fall in each decile of the income distribution of 
8:224:16344:21:21:89:510:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-recipient households by post-remittance income.  In urban areas, the percentage of 
8:225:16431:21:21:89:520:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recipient households that fall in each decile is remarkably close to 10 percent, suggesting 
8:226:16523:21:21:89:485:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that households that have relatives abroad who send remittances come from every 
8:227:16603:21:21:89:520:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:segment of the distribution of income.  There is no evidence of a pattern of self-selection 
8:228:16695:21:21:89:505:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where poor households are predominantly likely to receive funds from relatives living 
8:229:16781:21:20:89:128:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:abroad.

8:231:16847:8:18:89:523:92:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:3  In urban areas, the average recipient household has 1.35 workers against 1.7 in non-recipient household.  
8:232:16956:18:0:89:342:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:In rural areas, the corresponding averages are 1.24 and 1.66.    
9:233:17022:0:21:89:92:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
9:234:17022:21:21:89:499:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In rural areas, recipient households are slightly under-represented in the three lowest 
9:235:17110:21:21:89:524:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:deciles of the income distribution.  Note that the median remittance amount is the same in 
9:236:17201:21:21:89:509:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rural and in urban areas because it is largely determined by the expatriates’ earnings in 
9:237:17291:21:21:89:519:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the United States.  But since incomes are considerably lower in rural than in urban areas, 
9:238:17382:21:21:89:512:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances have a more pronounced effect on rural household income that shows up in 
9:239:17467:21:21:89:510:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:an under-representation of recipient households in the three lowest deciles, and a slight 
9:240:17557:21:21:89:520:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:over-representation in the top two deciles.  But the important point to note is that we find 
9:241:17650:21:21:89:502:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:no pattern of self-selection where recipient families are predominantly likely to come 
9:242:17737:21:21:89:374:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from one segment of the distribution of household income. 
9:243:17795:21:21:89:92:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
9:244:17795:21:21:89:494:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 2 shows that 28% of all households in El Salvador are female-headed.  While 
9:245:17877:21:21:89:475:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recipient households are more likely to be female-headed, 25% of non-recipient 
9:246:17956:21:21:89:496:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households are also female-headed.  An alternative measure of this relationship (not 
9:247:18041:21:21:89:499:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shown) is that 23% of female-headed households receive remittances against 11% of 
9:248:18123:21:21:89:513:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:male-headed households.  Of course, political exiles and those emigrating for economic 
9:249:18210:21:21:89:513:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reasons are typically male, so the higher incidence of female-headed households among 
9:250:18296:21:21:89:497:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recipient households is unsurprising and sheds no light on the issue of which type of 
9:251:18382:21:21:89:235:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration dominates the data. 
9:252:18412:21:21:89:92:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
9:253:18412:21:21:89:500:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 3 reports the distribution of urban and rural households by the schooling of the 
9:254:18499:21:21:89:510:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adult female in the household—head of household or spouse.  The choice of the female 
9:255:18584:21:21:89:520:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adult to represent each household is deliberate, and it allows a cleaner comparison across 
9:256:18675:21:21:89:501:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households that may or may not have an adult male present.  Migration patterns in El 
9:257:18760:21:21:89:515:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Salvador have resulted in about 30% female-headed households, and female headship is 
9:258:18845:21:21:89:477:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more common among recipient households. Therefore, a comparison of parental 
9:259:18921:21:21:89:517:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics between recipient and non-recipient households is better done controlling 
9:260:19011:21:21:89:511:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for adult female characteristics.  The urban and rural distributions of households across 
9:261:19101:21:21:89:517:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adult female schooling levels are fairly close for non-recipient and recipient households, 
9:262:19192:21:21:89:495:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:though recipient households are somewhat over-represented in the lowest schooling 
9:263:19274:21:0:89:507:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:category, 0 to 3 years of schooling.  If political exiles came from all walks of life in El 
10:264:19367:0:21:89:468:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Salvador and the exiles represent the lion’s share of those working abroad, the 
10:265:19447:21:21:89:518:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:educational distribution of the wives left behind would be similar to that of wives in non-
10:266:19538:21:21:89:516:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recipient households.  The fact that recipient households are somewhat over-represented 
10:267:19626:21:21:89:520:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the lowest schooling categories suggests that migrants for economic reasons may have 
10:268:19714:21:21:89:517:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:represented an ever increasing fraction of migration flows in the five years leading up to

10:270:19882:21:21:89:342:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution and that assortative mating dominates).

10:280:20341:21:21:89:520:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The educational system in El Salvador is organized along four levels.  Children aged 4 to 
10:281:20431:21:21:89:515:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:6 attend pre-school.  Children aged 7 to 15 attend primary education which is divided in 
10:282:20520:21:21:89:515:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three cycles of three years each, from first to ninth grade.  Children aged 16 to 18 attend 
10:283:20612:21:21:89:501:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:secondary education which goes from tenth to twelfth grade.  Table 5, based on 1997 
10:284:20696:21:21:89:484:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data, shows the enrollment of children in the school system, by age categories.

10:287:20839:8:18:89:519:209:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:4 The survey collects information on remittances, their amount and their use.  Respondents typically quote 
10:288:20945:18:12:89:510:191:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the remittances received in dollars, and these amounts are translated into local currency (colones) by the 
10:289:21052:12:12:89:493:179:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:interviewers, using the official exchange rate.  We could have also considered using the information 
10:290:21153:12:11:89:517:167:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:collected on expenditures and in particular, the amounts of remittances that are said to have been spent on 
10:291:21261:11:12:89:484:156:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:education.  Nevertheless, we decided not to use the latter variable for two reasons. First, there is a 
10:292:21364:12:12:89:509:144:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:significant discrepancy between the total amount of registered remittances and the total expenditure that 
10:293:21470:12:11:89:512:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:they afford, with total expenditure being about 30 percent higher than the recorded amount received. We 
10:294:21574:11:12:89:522:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:believe that expenditures are more likely to be measured with error, since there are several items involved.  
10:295:21684:12:12:89:521:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Second, the amount of remittances spent on education says nothing about the fact that remittances spent on 
10:296:21791:12:11:89:511:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:other items will free resources that may be ultimately spent on education.  We therefore preferred to stay 
10:297:21898:11:12:89:520:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:within the tradition of economic analysis and keep tabs on what families do about education rather than on 
10:298:22005:12:0:89:305:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the amounts they say they spend towards education.   
11:299:22059:0:21:89:514:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There has been a rapid expansion in school enrollment throughout the 1990’s (Table 6). 
11:300:22146:21:21:89:507:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Note the significant increases in rural pre-school and primary coverage, and urban pre-
11:301:22233:21:21:89:523:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school and secondary coverage.  The levels of school attainment of recent birth cohorts in 
11:302:22324:21:21:89:521:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:El Salvador are significantly higher than those of older cohorts.  This gain is the outcome 
11:303:22416:21:21:89:507:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of an important national effort, considering current standards of living in El Salvador.

11:305:22596:21:21:89:517:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:40 percent of the parents of current school-aged children completed primary education.

11:308:22772:21:21:89:508:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the young aged 12, only 80 percent of rural residents and 90 percent of urban residents 
11:309:22860:21:21:89:483:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are enrolled in primary school.  As Table 5 suggests, rates of retention in primary 
11:310:22944:21:21:89:510:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:education are relatively high, but there is slow progress through grades.  Once children 
11:311:23033:21:21:89:513:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:get to the third cycle of primary schooling, 45 percent are in the grade corresponding to 
11:312:23123:21:21:89:522:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:normal progress, 30.5 percent are behind, and 19 percent have abandoned the system (see

11:327:24073:21:21:89:475:121:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:communities took the initiative to organize their own schools, administered and

11:329:24238:21:0:89:489:79:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constrained by the low rural income base, they revealed a strong latent demand for 
12:330:24323:0:21:89:498:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:education, as well as a desire to participate in the governance of schools. In 1991, El

12:332:24497:21:21:89:485:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:chose the implementation of the same prototype as the main method of expanding

12:357:25984:7:16:89:525:157:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:5 The EDUCO program has become a very productive model for the modernization for the entire Ministry 
12:358:26085:16:12:89:526:141:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:of  Education  (Jacir  de  Lovo,  1997).    Jimenez  and  Sawada  (1998)  compared  student  achievement  on  
12:359:26195:12:12:89:525:129:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:standardized  tests  and  school  attendance  of  rural  students  in  EDUCO  schools  with  the  achievement  and  
12:360:26311:12:11:89:527:117:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:attendance  of  students  in  traditional  schools.  Their  analysis  controls  for  student  characteristics  and  
12:361:26427:11:12:89:524:106:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:selection bias, using an exogenously determined formula for targeting EDUCO schools as an instrumental 
12:362:26530:12:12:89:525:94:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:variable.  They  find  that  the  rapid  expansion  of  rural  schools  through  EDUCO  has  diminished  student  
12:363:26644:12:0:89:366:82:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:absences and has not had an adverse effect on student achievement.  
13:364:26714:0:21:89:499:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:return to schooling are the cost of school attendance—out-of-pocket and opportunity 
13:365:26798:21:21:89:519:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:costs—and the anticipated rewards in the labor market for skills acquired through formal 
13:366:26887:21:21:89:515:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling.  Parents will compare the expected returns from investing in the schooling of 
13:367:26976:21:21:89:515:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their children to the returns from alternative investments that will also increase a child’s 
13:368:27069:21:21:89:516:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:human capital, like nutrition, health care, clothing and shelter.  Poor families may find it 
13:369:27162:21:21:89:510:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:optimal to choose quite low levels of completed schooling for their children in order to 
13:370:27251:21:21:89:471:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enjoy a given level of consumption of food, health services, etc.  Low levels of 
13:371:27332:21:21:89:494:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:completed schooling imply relatively low out-of-pocket expenses for schooling and 
13:372:27414:21:21:89:514:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enable the child to start working at an early age (the legal working age in El Salvador is 
13:373:27505:21:21:89:479:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:10 years of age).  That is, in a poor country like El Salvador, the family’s budget 
13:374:27589:21:21:89:521:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constraint may play an important role in a family’s decision on school attendance of their

13:378:27777:21:21:89:516:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parents’ own schooling levels.  More educated parents may be better informed about the 
13:379:27864:21:21:89:510:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employment opportunities and wages available to those with given schooling levels, or 
13:380:27950:21:21:89:508:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may themselves enjoy the rewards the labor market offers workers with above average 
13:381:28034:21:21:89:478:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:education.  Therefore, parental schooling may play a role in a family’s choice of 
13:382:28116:21:21:89:279:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:completed schooling for their children.

13:384:28156:21:21:89:485:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Other factors that affect the perceived costs and benefits of schooling relate to the 
13:385:28242:21:21:89:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:availability of schools offering the required grade levels within a reasonable commuting 
13:386:28331:21:21:89:507:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distance from the household.  We do not know the exact location of each household or 
13:387:28416:21:21:89:488:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the geographical distribution of schools offering given grade levels.  We do know, 
13:388:28499:21:21:89:473:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:however, if a household resides in a rural area—where we expect less access to 
13:389:28578:21:21:89:507:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools—and if the dwelling has access to neither electricity nor water, suggesting the 
13:390:28666:21:21:89:501:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:household is located in a particularly remote area, or is an extremely poor household.

14:395:29016:21:21:89:511:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reference to another two factors.  First, it is reasonable to expect that parents’ decisions 
14:396:29109:21:21:89:514:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the schooling of older children are made sequentially, taking into account the child’s 
14:397:29199:21:21:89:517:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school experience.  When a child is retained in grade, the return to continued investment 
14:398:29289:21:21:89:482:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the child’s schooling is instantly reduced.  Retention in grade raises the cost of 
14:399:29375:21:21:89:506:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:completing the same grade level with no change in benefits.  As we discuss below, we 
14:400:29460:21:21:89:476:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have access to a single cross-section for El Salvador.  The survey has very good 
14:401:29541:21:21:89:505:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information on school related behavior, but we do not know at what age an individual 
14:402:29626:21:21:89:519:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:started school or if a person—in or out of school—was ever retained in grade.  While we 
14:403:29714:21:21:89:472:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would like to control for the age of children and young adults in a model of the 
14:404:29795:21:21:89:405:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:probability of their continued school attendance, we cannot do it. 
14:405:29862:21:21:89:92:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
14:406:29862:21:21:89:483:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The second factor that likely plays a role in parental decisions regarding a child’s 
14:407:29947:21:21:89:507:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling is the composition of the household.  The number and ages of siblings bears 
14:408:30033:21:21:89:500:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:heavily on the family’s resources.  In order to capture fully the budget constraint of a 
14:409:30122:21:21:89:523:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:family, income is clearly not enough.  We know the composition of each household at the 
14:410:30210:21:21:89:495:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time of the survey, but we do not know it at any other time.  In particular, we do not 
14:411:30297:21:21:89:520:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:know it at the various stages in a child’s life when the composition of the household may 
14:412:30387:21:21:89:518:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have played an important role in determining whether the child would continue on to the 
14:413:30475:21:21:89:454:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:next cycle of education, for example the second cycle (grades 4 through 6).

14:416:30573:21:21:89:515:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Our sample is a cross-section of 14,286 individuals aged 6 to 24.  We know the sex, age 
14:417:30661:21:21:89:515:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and school attainment of the individual, characteristics of the family, place of residence, 
14:418:30753:21:20:89:508:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and properties of the dwelling where they live.  We assume that children of school age 
14:419:30840:20:21:89:517:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who are not enrolled in school have dropped out of school, and use the Cox proportional 
14:420:30928:21:21:89:520:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard model to estimate the impact of characteristics of the individual and the family on 
14:421:31019:21:31:89:270:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the hazard of dropping out of school.

14:423:31229:8:17:89:508:103:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:6 Compulsory free schooling is a way to overrule parental doubts on the potential benefits of education. 
14:424:31333:17:12:89:489:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Nevertheless, in El Salvador as in most developing countries, compulsory primary education is not 
14:425:31430:12:0:89:372:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:enforced, and schooling is not free or readily available to all children.

15:428:31589:21:21:89:505:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school attainment levels, and warrants some discussion.  The Cox proportional hazard 
15:429:31674:21:21:89:521:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model is tailored for the analysis of survival-time data, and, clearly, the number of “years 
15:430:31767:21:21:89:498:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of completed schooling” does not correspond one-to-one with calendar time because 
15:431:31849:21:21:89:518:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children can be retained in grade.  The question, then, is whether the proportional hazard 
15:432:31940:21:21:89:494:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:framework is acceptable for the analysis of school attainment.  We will argue it is.

15:436:32204:21:21:89:513:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enrolled (“failed”).  We have a single cross-section and no retrospective information on 
15:437:32293:21:21:89:507:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment behavior.  Thus, we have no choice but to treat every individual who is not 
15:438:32380:21:21:89:414:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enrolled in school on the day of the survey as if they have “failed.”

15:448:32855:21:21:89:523:244:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated.  The crucial assumption in the Cox proportional hazard model is that the effect 
15:449:32946:21:21:89:366:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the covariates is proportional over the entire base line.

15:452:33089:21:21:89:497:160:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistical framework for the problem at hand.  The most obvious advantage is that it 
15:453:33175:21:21:89:494:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exploits all the available information in observations that are right-censored, that is, 
15:454:33264:21:21:89:505:118:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:observations for children or young adults who are enrolled in school at the time of the 
15:455:33352:21:21:89:506:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survey (9,547 of the 14,286 in our sample).  We can avoid the unappealing practice of 
15:456:33438:21:0:89:506:76:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:limiting the sample to individuals aged 25 and over who are expected to have finished 
16:457:33526:0:21:89:494:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their formal education.  In the case of El Salvador, this practice would be especially 
16:458:33613:21:21:89:510:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undesirable since it is only recently that the government has engaged in a bold effort to 
16:459:33703:21:21:89:479:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expand grade availability in rural areas and increase school enrollment generally 
16:460:33785:21:21:89:499:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:throughout the country.  A focus on older birth cohorts would give us no insight into 
16:461:33871:21:21:89:287:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recent educational trends in El Salvador.

16:465:34092:21:21:89:522:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:levels where dropout rates are concentrated, net of the effect of measured determinants of 
16:466:34183:21:21:89:516:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school completion.  This information may be useful for policy makers seeking to further

16:471:34469:21:21:89:496:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attended school.  This highlights another convenient feature of the Cox proportional 
16:472:34554:21:21:89:506:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard approach.  Since time, in and of itself, is not of the essence for the analysis, we 
16:473:34645:21:21:89:517:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model the determinants of “never enrolling in school” much like we model the decisions 
16:474:34732:21:21:89:524:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regarding continuing to attend school.  That is, we view “never enrolled” as the first stage 
16:475:34825:21:21:89:517:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the schooling process. Everyone in the sample “enters the study” (in the jargon of bio-
16:476:34915:21:21:89:513:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistics) through this stage which has an arbitrarily chosen length of time.  Then, there 
16:477:35007:21:21:89:506:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is a probability that a child will not “fail” and continues on to enroll in the first grade.  
16:478:35101:21:21:89:513:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Put differently, the hazard of “failing” in the “not enrolled” interval simply refers to the

16:483:35410:21:19:89:509:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in primary and secondary school.  So we focus our attention on grades 1 through 12 by

16:486:35659:17:12:89:493:118:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:exception is Filmer and Pritchet (2000).  Interestingly enough, their results show that the enrollment

16:488:35872:12:0:89:520:94:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:poor reach nearly universal enrollment in first grade, but then drop out in droves leading to low attainment

18:535:39476:21:21:89:490:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies have found, we expect that higher incomes will lower the hazard of leaving 
18:536:39559:21:21:89:504:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school.  Two questions are of interest.  First, does household income influence school 
18:537:39646:21:21:89:507:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attainment?  Second, does income from remittances have the same effect as household 
18:538:39730:21:21:89:503:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income from work in the local economy?  To answer the last question we exclude the 
18:539:39813:21:21:89:504:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittance amount from the measure of household income and include it as a separate

18:542:39970:8:17:89:511:234:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:8 The 1997 Household Survey we use does not have information on internal migration.  Issues related to 
18:543:40072:17:8:89:499:217:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:migrant families can be examined with the 1998 Household Survey that includes a migration module. 
18:544:40170:8:18:89:525:209:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:9 The  standard  of  living  in  urban  areas  of  El  Salvador  is  significantly  higher  than  in  rural  areas,  so  it  is  
18:545:40298:18:12:89:526:191:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:unclear  how  to  measure  correctly  the  impact  of  an  additional  colon  from  remittances  on  a  household’s  
18:546:40415:12:12:89:524:179:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:budget constraint.  We experimented with an alternative metric for household income and remittances.  In 
18:547:40520:12:11:89:526:167:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the  alternative  specification,  the  variable  “Location  in  the  income  distribution  (net  of  remittance)”  is  
18:548:40639:11:12:89:525:156:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:measured  in  integers  ranging  from  1  to  20  that  correspond  to  the  location  (in  intervals  of  5  centiles)  of  a  
18:549:40767:12:12:89:526:144:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:given  income  level  in  the  income  distribution,  excluding  remittances.    Thus  “Location  in  the  income  
18:550:40882:12:11:89:524:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:distribution (net of remittance)” will be equal to 1 if the household income is in the bottom 5 centiles of the 
18:551:40994:11:12:89:526:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:income  distribution  for  the  area  (urban  or  rural)  where  it  resides.    We  then  added  to  each  recipient  
18:552:41113:12:12:89:525:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:household’s  income,  the  income  from  remittances.    The  location  on  the  income  distribution  will  tend  to  
18:553:41232:12:11:89:524:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:worsen for those without remittances, and will improve for those with remittances.  The change in location 
18:554:41339:11:12:89:525:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:is  measured  in  units  of  5  centile  points  and  ranges  from  0  (for  no  change)  to  19  (for  a  change  from  the  
18:555:41465:12:0:89:524:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:lowest to the highest 5 centiles in the distribution).  “Change in location due to remittance” will be equal to 
19:556:41579:0:21:89:517:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Income from remittances will also expand the family’s budget constraint, allowing some 
19:557:41666:21:21:89:513:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families to move closer to the optimum amount of schooling for their children. We note 
19:558:41753:21:21:89:516:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the typical amount of remittances is 100 dollars, or 875 colones.  As Table 8 shows, 
19:559:41843:21:21:89:499:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the median remittance represents a more significant fraction of incomes of rural than 
19:560:41929:21:21:89:504:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:urban families: remittances represent 46 percent of household incomes for the median 
19:561:42014:21:21:89:501:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rural recipient and 27 percent for the median urban recipient household.  On average, 
19:562:42100:21:21:89:508:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances make up 49 percent and 37 percent of income for rural and urban recipient 
19:563:42186:21:21:89:149:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households. 
19:564:42198:21:21:89:92:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
19:565:42198:21:21:89:522:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In addition to controlling for household income and income from remittances, we include 
19:566:42286:21:21:89:499:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:an indicator for the presence of income from remittances (equal to 1 if the household 
19:567:42372:21:21:89:494:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:receives remittances from abroad).  We believe that the massive out-migration in El 
19:568:42456:21:21:89:487:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Salvador during the 1980’s was driven primarily by political rather than economic 
19:569:42538:21:21:89:520:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factors.  But we want to allow for the possibility that households that receive remittances 
19:570:42630:21:21:89:518:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differ systematically, for unobserved reasons, from other households.  In fact, even if the 
19:571:42722:21:21:89:509:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:initial stimulus for migrating was political, families receiving remittances have already 
19:572:42812:21:21:89:506:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:experienced direct benefits from migration.  One can argue that these families attach a 
19:573:42900:21:21:89:512:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher value to the migration option for their own children than do other families.  This 
19:574:42990:21:21:89:495:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect alone may well cause differences across families in the expected returns from 
19:575:43075:21:21:89:504:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling, and in the hazard of leaving school.  More generally, the indicator variable 
19:576:43163:21:21:89:521:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:will capture any additional effect of remittances on children’s schooling that acts through 
19:577:43255:21:53:89:499:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:channels other than the budget constraint, and any systematic differences in attitudes

19:580:43646:12:12:89:388:191:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:income distribution, that is, when excluding the amount of the remittance. 
19:581:43721:12:12:89:522:179:144:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:B:   The  hazard  model  that  uses  the  metric  described  above  yields  a  slightly  higher  value  for  the  log-
19:582:43837:12:11:89:525:167:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:likelihood  function  for  the  urban  sample,  and  a  slightly  lower  value  for  the  rural  sample.    Regarding  the  
19:583:43961:11:12:89:526:156:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:remaining coefficient estimates, they are quite invariant to the choice of metric for income and remittances.  
19:584:44072:12:12:89:524:144:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:We implemented a test proposed by Weesie (1999) that is a generalization of Hausman’s test, of the null 
19:585:44176:12:11:89:524:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:hypothesis that the remaining coefficients are equal in the two specifications.  (Note that this is not a nested 
19:586:44289:11:12:89:524:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:hypothesis.)  For the urban sample the test-statistic is equal to 12.41 and is distributed chi-squared with 6 
19:587:44399:12:12:89:524:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:degrees of freedom.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis; the p-value for the test is 0.0534.  For the rural 
19:588:44510:12:11:89:524:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:sample the test-statistic is equal to 13.08 and is distributed chi-squared with 8 degrees of freedom.  We fail 
19:589:44621:11:12:89:345:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:to reject the null hypothesis; the p-value for the test is 0.1090.

20:592:44779:21:21:89:150:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances. 
20:593:44792:21:21:89:92:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
20:594:44792:21:21:89:514:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:It should be noted that the appropriate variable that influences investment on children is 
20:595:44883:21:21:89:503:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:permanent household income.  What we use is a crude proxy of the variable, which is 
20:596:44967:21:21:89:510:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:household income in one particular year separated in two components, remittances and 
20:597:45052:21:21:89:479:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the rest.  Arguing that income and the presence of remittances are time-invariant 
20:598:45134:21:21:89:511:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:covariates is perhaps a bit heroic.  While it is probably the case that income mobility in 
20:599:45225:21:21:89:504:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:El Salvador is quite low, a question arises with respect to the stability through time of 
20:600:45315:21:21:89:521:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances vs. other income.  If remittances are more stable, they are a better measure of 
20:601:45407:21:21:89:504:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:permanent income relative to other observed income.  We return to these issues as we 
20:602:45492:21:21:89:191:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:examine the results.

20:604:45514:21:21:89:519:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There are two variables we intended to use as covariates, “year of birth” and an indicator 
20:605:45605:21:21:89:505:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variable for residence in the rural areas.  The reason for controlling for year of birth is 
20:606:45697:21:21:89:515:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simply to pick up any systematic differences between cohorts.  The differences could be 
20:607:45785:21:21:89:507:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:due to the implementation of educational reform by the government or any effects that 
20:608:45871:21:21:89:500:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the civil war of the 1980’s had on the operation of the schools or children’s ability to 
20:609:45960:21:21:89:461:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attend school.  For reasons discussed in detail in the Appendix, our preferred 
20:610:46039:21:21:89:509:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specification is one where we stratify on year of birth and we estimate separate models 
20:611:46127:21:21:89:245:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the urban and rural samples.

20:614:46250:21:21:89:478:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the four segments of the baseline hazard, and we stratify each sample on 5 strata 
20:615:46332:21:21:89:514:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:according to year of birth.  The segments are “never enrolled,” 1st through the 6th grade, 
20:616:46423:21:27:89:480:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:7th through the 9th grade, and 10th through the 12th grade.10  The four oldest strata

20:618:46567:7:17:89:528:149:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:10We  divided  the  baseline  hazard  into  the  segments  listed  in  text  based  on  the  following  considerations.    
20:619:46690:17:11:89:525:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Primary  education  is  divided  into  three  cycles  of  three  grades  each.    Therefore,  when  distance  to  school  
20:620:46812:11:12:89:524:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:becomes a problem, it is likely it will happen when a child is ready to enroll in the next cycle of primary 
20:621:46920:12:12:89:526:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:education  or  secondary  education.    In  addition,  public  education  becomes  relatively  scarce  at  the  third  
20:622:47039:12:11:89:522:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cycle of primary education, and close to half of secondary education is private.  This suggests that out-of-
20:623:47147:11:12:89:524:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:pocket  costs  of  additional  years  of  schooling  beyond  the  sixth  grade  rise  relative  to  schooling  at  younger  
20:624:47271:12:0:89:525:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:ages.    In  addition,  in  the  early  stages  of  estimation  we  divided  the  hazard  further,  allowing  for  separate  
21:625:47398:0:21:89:501:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:combine individuals born in four-year intervals: 1972 to 1975, 1976 to 1979, 1980 to 
21:626:47483:21:21:89:519:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1983, and 1984 to 1987.  The youngest stratum is for individuals born between 1988 and

21:632:47680:21:21:89:511:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates of the survival functions in Figure 1.  It is immediately apparent that children 
21:633:47771:21:21:89:512:549:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:living in urban areas have a significantly higher probability of attaining any given level 
21:634:47862:21:21:89:475:528:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of school completion than rural children do.  For example, rural children have a 
21:635:47943:21:21:89:512:507:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:probability of .60 of completing the 6th grade, compared to over .85 for urban children.  
21:636:48033:21:21:89:515:486:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The gap only widens at higher-grade levels.  Urban children have a probability of .70 of 
21:637:48122:21:21:89:480:465:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:completing the 12th grade, compared to only .30 for rural children.   The graphed 
21:638:48204:21:21:89:512:444:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:functions also highlight the more common exit points from schooling for children.  The 
21:639:48291:21:21:89:506:423:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survival functions show large declines at the 3rd, 6th, and 9th grades, especially in rural 
21:640:48383:21:21:89:120:402:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas.

21:644:48563:21:21:89:509:318:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children in the sample.  The corresponding figure is 65 percent in the rural sample.  To

21:646:48736:21:21:89:518:276:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:household effect, we compute robust estimates of variance by clustering observations on 
21:647:48824:21:21:89:182:255:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a family identifier.

21:649:48845:21:21:89:462:213:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The estimates of the determinants of the hazard of dropping out of school are 
21:650:48923:21:20:89:483:192:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:summarized in Tables 9 and 10.  The (exponentiated) coefficient for the indicator 
21:651:49005:20:21:89:504:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variable “Male” is significantly different from one in urban areas, where males are 27 
21:652:49092:21:54:89:515:151:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent more likely to drop out of school (or never enroll in school at all).  One possible

21:654:49356:11:12:89:525:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:effects  for  the  1st  through  the  3rd  grade,  and  the  4th  through  the  6th  grade.    But  we  did  not  reject  the  null  
21:655:49489:12:0:89:474:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:hypothesis that the segments could be combined into one covering the 1st through the 6th grade. 
22:656:49587:0:21:89:506:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:explanation for this finding is that boys have better labor market opportunities than do 
22:657:49676:21:21:89:404:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:girls, and thus face higher opportunity costs of attending school.  
22:658:49744:21:21:89:92:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
22:659:49744:21:21:89:514:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In rural areas, the effect of sex is not proportional over the entire baseline hazard.  Boys 
22:660:49837:21:21:89:522:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have a higher hazard than do girls of never enrolling in school and of leaving school after 
22:661:49929:21:21:89:498:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the first two cycles of primary education.  The estimated hazard ratio is 1.16, or a 16 
22:662:50017:21:21:89:521:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent higher hazard.  This effect is qualitatively similar to the estimated effect of sex in 
22:663:50112:21:21:89:521:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:urban areas.  What is puzzling is that for grades 1 through 6, the hazard of leaving school 
22:664:50204:21:21:89:501:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is 10 percent lower for boys than girls in rural areas.  The coefficients in question are 
22:665:50294:21:21:89:513:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significantly different from one another, and we do not have an explanation 
22:666:50384:21:21:89:220:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for this pattern of effects.

22:668:50415:21:21:89:518:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Interestingly, the dampening effect of higher parental schooling on the hazard of leaving 
22:669:50505:21:21:89:494:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school declines monotonically as a child reaches ever higher-grade levels.  In urban 
22:670:50590:21:21:89:501:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas, each year of additional parental schooling lowers the hazard that a child leaves 
22:671:50678:21:21:89:509:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school (or never enrolls) by 20 percent, while the child is attending one of the first two 
22:672:50769:21:21:89:519:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cycles of primary education.  Once the child is enrolled in the third cycle, 7th through the 
22:673:50862:21:21:89:518:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:9th grade, an additional year of parental schooling only lowers the hazard by 14 percent.  
22:674:50953:21:21:89:488:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:And the effect on the hazard for secondary education is lower still: 7 percent.  The 
22:675:51038:21:21:89:520:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated coefficients are statistically significantly different for the three segments of the 
22:676:51133:21:21:89:127:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard. 
22:677:51141:21:21:89:92:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
22:678:51141:21:21:89:520:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In rural areas much the same pattern is observed, though the estimated effects of parental 
22:679:51232:21:21:89:507:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling on the hazard of leaving school are smaller than they are in urban areas.  An 
22:680:51320:21:21:89:517:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:additional year of parental schooling has the largest estimated effect on the hazard that a 
22:681:51412:21:21:89:511:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:child will never be enrolled in school: the hazard drops 16 percent with each additional 
22:682:51501:21:38:89:503:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year of parental schooling.11  For children attending grades 1 through 6, an additional 
22:683:51589:38:8:89:236:124:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                           
22:684:51647:8:18:89:508:116:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:11 This may appear to be too large of an effect.  But average parental schooling in rural areas is close to 
22:685:51754:18:12:89:493:98:100:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three years of schooling.  Thus, the child of a parent with 3 years of schooling has a hazard of never 
22:686:51856:12:12:89:503:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:enrolling in school that is only 59 percent (exp(-.177×3)=.588) as high as the hazard for a child whose 
22:687:51960:12:0:89:199:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:parents have no schooling. 
23:688:51989:0:21:89:485:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year of parental schooling lowers the hazard of leaving school by 13 percent.  For 
23:689:52072:21:21:89:434:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:youngsters attending grades 7 through 12, the effect drops to 8 percent.

23:691:52145:21:21:89:477:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Despite the previous discussion, we cannot conclude that parental schooling is a 
23:692:52226:21:21:89:524:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:weightier factor for children’s schooling in urban than in rural areas.  As seen in Figure 1, 
23:693:52320:21:21:89:507:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the survival function is significantly higher in urban than rural areas; correspondingly, 
23:694:52410:21:21:89:522:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the hazard function is significantly lower in urban than rural areas.  The combined effects 
23:695:52502:21:21:89:503:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the coefficient estimates for parental schooling and the level of the baseline hazard 
23:696:52591:21:21:89:519:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:functions is illustrated in Figure 2.   We graph the estimated survival functions evaluated 
23:697:52683:21:21:89:510:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at the 10th centile, the 1st quartile, the median, the 3rd quartile and the 90th centile of the 
23:698:52779:21:21:89:520:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of parental schooling, separately for urban and rural areas.  We set income at 
23:699:52871:21:21:89:505:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the median for each area, and graph the estimated baseline survival functions for boys 
23:700:52958:21:21:89:520:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:belonging to the 1976-1979 birth cohorts (all other covariates are set to zero).  The graph 
23:701:53050:21:21:89:514:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for urban areas appears to have only 4 survival functions.  The reason for this is that the 
23:702:53142:21:21:89:516:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survival functions for the third quartile and the 90th centile overlap completely.  Clearly, 
23:703:53235:21:21:89:476:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of parental schooling on the hazard of leaving school in urban areas is 
23:704:53318:21:21:89:507:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated in the bottom half of the parental schooling distribution.  Children whose 
23:705:53406:21:21:89:517:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parents have above average schooling levels have survival probabilities close to 1, when 
23:706:53495:21:21:89:299:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evaluated at the median household income.

23:710:53717:21:21:89:516:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the estimated coefficients of parental schooling are smaller for rural parents, but the 
23:711:53810:21:21:89:502:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard of leaving school is considerably higher in rural areas.  As a result, the overall 
23:712:53900:21:21:89:516:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect of parental schooling in rural areas is quite important, and operates over the entire 
23:713:53993:21:21:89:255:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of parental schooling.

23:715:54029:21:21:89:516:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The coefficient on lack of access to water or electricity is significant in both regions and 
23:716:54122:21:21:89:497:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:much larger in urban areas.  Lacking access to basic services increases the hazard of 
23:717:54208:21:21:89:518:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leaving school (or never enrolling) by 150 percent in urban areas.  In rural areas, lacking 
23:718:54300:21:0:89:512:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:access to basic services increases the hazard of never enrolling in school by 86 percent, 
24:719:54392:0:21:89:519:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the hazard of leaving school while enrolled in the 1st through the 6th grade by 33 percent, 
24:720:54484:21:21:89:492:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and there is no effect on the hazard beyond the 6th grade.  While 38 percent of rural 
24:721:54570:21:21:89:503:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households lack water and electricity, only 5 percent of urban families lack water and 
24:722:54657:21:21:89:513:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:electricity.   Therefore, this large difference in the estimated coefficients only applies to 
24:723:54751:21:21:89:429:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the 5 percent of urban families that live in extremely poor conditions.

24:726:54913:21:21:89:519:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas.  This suggests that the household’s budget constraint plays a significant role in the

24:729:55186:21:21:89:520:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is .996, indicating that an increase in household income of 100 colones lowers the hazard

24:736:55808:21:21:89:507:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:.993, indicating that a movement from the first to the third quartile of the rural income 
24:737:55898:21:21:89:418:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution (750 to 2,225 colones) lowers the hazard by 10 percent.

24:739:55967:21:21:89:524:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:To assess the practical importance, as opposed to the statistical significance, of household 
24:740:56060:21:21:89:510:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income we graph the baseline survival functions for boys in the 1976-79 birth cohorts.  
24:741:56148:21:21:89:523:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The functions, presented in Figure 3, are evaluated at the 10th centile, 1st quartile, median, 
24:742:56243:21:21:89:519:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:3rd quartile, and 90th centile of the distribution of household income, separately for urban 
24:743:56336:21:21:89:517:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and rural areas.   Also, the functions correspond to median parental schooling: 6 years in 
24:744:56427:21:21:89:522:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:urban areas, and 2 years in rural areas.  Figure 3 makes it abundantly clear that household 
24:745:56519:21:21:89:512:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income has a very small effect on the survival functions, even though the effect is more 
24:746:56608:21:21:89:514:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pronounced for rural households.  We also examined the survival functions evaluated at 
24:747:56695:21:21:89:503:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the 1st quartile of the distribution of parental schooling.  The survival functions are of 
24:748:56786:21:0:89:481:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:course lower than those graphed in Figure 3, but they convey the same message:  
25:749:56868:0:21:89:520:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:household income has a very modest effect on the hazard of leaving school, regardless of 
25:750:56957:21:21:89:253:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the level of parental schooling.     
25:751:56994:21:21:89:92:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
25:752:56994:21:21:89:508:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:This result is consistent with previous literature.  Haveman and Wolfe (1995) review a 
25:753:57081:21:21:89:493:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:number of studies on the determinants of years of schooling based on U.S. data and 
25:754:57164:21:21:89:513:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:report that income elasticities have been found to be low and estimated in a wide range, 
25:755:57253:21:21:89:509:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from .02 to .2.  They believe this result is likely explained by the measurement error in 
25:756:57343:21:21:89:496:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the household income variable.  At the same time, Hill and Duncan (1987) carefully 
25:757:57426:21:21:89:506:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure household income and report that a 10 percent increase in household income, 
25:758:57510:21:21:89:516:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:after controlling for a number of other variables, is associated with an increase in school 
25:759:57602:21:21:89:251:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attainment of less than 1 percent. 
25:760:57637:21:21:89:95:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:  
25:761:57639:21:21:89:518:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Now we turn our attention to remittances.  As we explained earlier, we estimate separate 
25:762:57728:21:21:89:504:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects for income from remittances and from other sources to examine the possibility 
25:763:57814:21:21:89:494:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the source of the income matters for the choice of schooling levels of children.  
25:764:57901:21:21:89:497:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Economic theory suggests that the source of income should not matter—a dollar is a 
25:765:57984:21:21:89:129:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dollar.   
25:766:57994:21:21:89:92:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
25:767:57994:21:21:89:507:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We estimate a significant and large effect of income from remittances.  In urban areas, 
25:768:58082:21:21:89:507:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the median remittance (875 colones) lowers the hazard that a child will never enroll in 
25:769:58170:21:21:89:515:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school, or will leave school while enrolled in the 1st through the 6th grade, by 54 percent 
25:770:58262:21:22:89:486:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(exp(−.0877×8.75) = .46).  The estimated effect for the remaining segments of the 
25:771:58344:22:21:89:492:245:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard, grades 7th through 12th, is .965, or 27 percent when evaluated at the median 
25:772:58429:21:21:89:512:224:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittance amount.  So the effect is half as high for children beyond the 6th grade as for 
25:773:58520:21:21:89:500:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children below the 7th grade.  Note that the estimated coefficients for the two income 
25:774:58607:21:21:89:517:182:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects are statistically significantly different from one another.  More importantly, there 
25:775:58700:21:21:89:490:161:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is an enormous difference in the magnitude of the effects depending on the income 
25:776:58782:21:21:89:516:140:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:source: the effect of remittances is, at its smallest, 10 times the size of the effect of other

25:779:58945:8:18:89:520:92:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:12 We estimated a hazard model where the effect of income was allowed to differ between households that 
25:780:59048:18:0:89:511:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:do and do not receive remittances.  For the urban sample, the test statistic for the null hypothesis that the

26:782:59160:21:21:89:509:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In rural areas, the median remittance lowers the entire baseline hazard by 14 percent.    
26:783:59250:21:22:89:465:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:That is, the hazard of a child leaving school (or failing to enroll) is 14 percent 
26:784:59333:22:21:89:495:644:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(exp(−.0171×8.75) = .86) lower if the child’s family receives the median remittance 
26:785:59417:21:21:89:468:623:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:amount.  The estimated coefficients for the two income effects are statistically 
26:786:59498:21:21:89:515:602:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly different from one another, and the magnitudes of the effects are not close: 
26:787:59589:21:21:89:454:581:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of remittances is 2.6 times higher than the effect of other income. 
26:788:59668:21:21:89:92:560:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
26:789:59668:21:21:89:520:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:If income from remittances is more stable than other sources of income, a likely situation 
26:790:59759:21:21:89:504:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for rural households, income from remittances is a better proxy for permanent income 
26:791:59844:21:21:89:515:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than is other income and this may explain the difference in estimated effects.13  Another 
26:792:59934:21:21:89:519:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possible explanation for the difference is that remittances recipients may exhibit a higher 
26:793:60026:21:21:89:515:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:propensity to spend on their children’s schooling out of remitted funds than other funds, 
26:794:60116:21:21:89:509:434:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:perhaps because the expatriate family member has made it a condition for the financial 
26:795:60203:21:21:89:476:413:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:support.  In any case, whether the source of the income makes a difference is an 
26:796:60284:21:21:89:498:392:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:empirical issue, regardless of our ability to tell a story that accounts for the observed 
26:797:60374:21:21:89:137:371:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:behavior.

26:799:60384:21:21:89:499:329:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The presence of remittances in the urban areas has no effect on the hazard of leaving 
26:800:60470:21:21:89:495:308:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school, after controlling for the amount of the remittance, so the variable “Receives 
26:801:60556:21:21:89:504:287:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittance” does not appear among the covariates.  This means that urban households 
26:802:60640:21:21:89:487:266:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that receive remittances from abroad do not differ systematically from other urban 
26:803:60723:21:21:89:482:245:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households with regards to the schooling of their children, though the funds from 
26:804:60805:21:21:89:507:224:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances have a vastly larger effect on the hazard of leaving school than funds from 
26:805:60893:21:21:89:159:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other sources.

26:810:61298:12:12:89:502:123:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:same result applies for rural households, in which case the test statistic is equal to 1.58, with a p-value 
26:811:61405:12:8:89:151:111:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:equal to 0.209. 
26:812:61421:8:17:89:506:103:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:13 Edwards (2000) reports that the fraction of households that receive remittances has been remarkably 
26:813:61523:17:12:89:509:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:stable –between 14.4 and 15.6 percent- between 1992 and 1997.  This is the short time period for which 
26:814:61626:12:0:89:487:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:remittances income is measured in the national household survey that measures living standards.    
27:815:61727:0:21:89:488:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The presence of remittances in rural households has a large effect on the hazard of 
27:816:61811:21:21:89:521:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leaving school.  Children in those households have a 24 percent lower hazard.  That is, in 
27:817:61902:21:21:89:513:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rural areas the source of income matters less than in urban areas, but the mere existence 
27:818:61992:21:21:89:510:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of remittances as an income source tends to reduce the hazard of leaving school.  Rural 
27:819:62080:21:21:89:495:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families receiving remittances appear, then, to differ systematically from other rural 
27:820:62167:21:21:89:520:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families in that, all else constant, their children show a lower hazard of leaving school, at 
27:821:62261:21:21:89:174:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:all grade levels.

27:824:62371:21:21:89:503:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dollars (the median amount in both areas) is greater for children in urban than in rural 
27:825:62460:21:21:89:511:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:households.  In urban areas a remittance of 875 colones (100 dollars) lowers the hazard 
27:826:62548:21:21:89:518:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by 54 percent for children below the 7th grade, and 27 percent for youngsters beyond the 
27:827:62637:21:21:89:504:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:6th grade.  In rural areas, the same remittance amount, combined with the effect of the 
27:828:62725:21:21:89:519:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presence of the remittance, lowers the hazard by 25 percent at all grade levels.  To gauge 
27:829:62816:21:21:89:499:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:whether the effect of remittances is of practical importance, in Figure 4 we graph the 
27:830:62903:21:21:89:479:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:baseline survival functions for boys in the 1976-79 birth cohorts, evaluated at no 
27:831:62986:21:21:89:512:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittance and at the median remittance of 875 colones.  The functions are evaluated at 
27:832:63074:21:21:89:509:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the median of parental schooling and household income, separately for urban and rural 
27:833:63160:21:21:89:515:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas.  Note that in the case of rural children, the survival function showing the effect of 
27:834:63253:21:21:89:486:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the median remittance includes the effect of the presence of the remittance itself.

27:837:63427:21:21:89:514:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:function.  But note that the survival function evaluated at the median parental schooling

27:839:63606:21:21:89:521:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the remittance to have an effect.  And yet, it has the effect of raising the survival function 
27:840:63701:21:21:89:505:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to near 1.  In rural areas, the effect of a remittance in the median amount is substantial 
27:841:63792:21:19:89:243:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and operates at all grade levels.

28:846:64018:0:21:89:509:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We report the survival functions corresponding to our preferred specification in Tables

28:848:64196:21:21:89:522:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:birth cohorts in Figures 5 through 8.  Following the same procedure used for the previous 
28:849:64286:21:21:89:519:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:figures, we graph baseline functions where parental schooling and household income are 
28:850:64373:21:21:89:512:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:set to their median values for each area.  The survival and hazard functions, then, apply 
28:851:64463:21:21:89:516:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to boys living in dwellings with access to water or electricity and whose household does

28:856:64772:21:21:89:514:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:birth cohort in the urban areas) implies that a child has a .971 probability of enrolling in 
28:857:64865:21:21:89:499:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the first grade.  It also implies that, for that birth cohort, we estimate that .029, or 2.9 
28:858:64958:21:21:89:320:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent, of that cohort never enrolled in school.

28:861:65096:21:21:89:523:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than the functions for earlier cohorts.  This does not mean that grade attainment levels are 
28:862:65189:21:21:89:520:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:declining for recent birth cohorts.  Recall that we include everyone between the ages of 6 
28:863:65280:21:21:89:518:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and 24 in the sample.  A high fraction of children aged 6 and 7 are not enrolled in school 
28:864:65371:21:21:89:515:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in 1997.  This is not a surprise.  The distribution of ages for children enrolled in the first 
28:865:65466:21:21:89:488:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grade shows many children aged 7 and 8 and even older children.  We observe the 
28:866:65546:21:21:89:515:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children born in 1990 when they are 7 years old, and a large fraction of this group is not 
28:867:65637:21:21:89:497:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enrolled in school yet, which explains the estimates of the survival functions for this

28:873:66000:21:21:89:523:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survival function for the 4th grade increases from .902 for those born in the years 1972-75 
28:874:66092:21:21:89:483:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to .941 for those born in 1984-87, in urban areas.  The improvement is even more 
28:875:66173:21:0:89:500:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pronounced in rural areas.  The estimate increases from .445 to .797, implying a near 
29:876:66261:0:21:89:493:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:doubling of the probability that rural children will enroll in the 4th grade or beyond, 
29:877:66349:21:21:89:483:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bringing the survival probabilities much closer to those observed in urban areas.

29:880:66519:21:21:89:503:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimate of the survival function for the 7th grade increases from .808 for the 1972-75 
29:881:66607:21:21:89:511:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts to .929 for the 1984-87 cohorts.  The improvement is even more pronounced in 
29:882:66692:21:21:89:510:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rural areas.  For grade level 7, the estimate of the survival function increases from .192 
29:883:66783:21:21:89:515:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the earliest cohort to .773 for children born in 1984-87, a four-fold increase, and one 
29:884:66875:21:21:89:514:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that makes the probability of enrolling in the 7th grade in rural areas considerably closer 
29:885:66967:21:21:89:250:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to those observed in urban areas.

29:888:67090:21:21:89:499:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points in urban areas, and increased three-fold in rural areas, between the

29:890:67258:21:21:89:339:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:probability is .884 in urban and .333 in rural areas.

29:893:67393:21:21:89:522:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Focusing on the survival function at the 6th grade, in urban areas we see a steady, gradual 
29:894:67485:21:21:89:522:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rising of the survival probability as we move from the earliest to the most recent cohorts.  
29:895:67578:21:21:89:518:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, in rural areas we see little improvement for the 1976-79 cohorts compared to 
29:896:67668:21:21:89:496:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the 1972-75 cohorts.  But then we see a big upward shift of the survival function for 
29:897:67754:21:21:89:516:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those born in 1980-83, and an even bigger shift for the 1984-87 cohort.  More generally, 
29:898:67843:21:21:89:507:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the survival functions for the urban areas suggest that the 1980-83 cohorts enjoyed the 
29:899:67931:21:21:89:519:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:largest improvement relative to the cohort immediately prior.  In rural areas, the 1984-87 
29:900:68022:21:21:89:516:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts experienced, by far, the largest improvement relative to the cohort that preceded 
29:901:68112:21:21:89:508:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:it. Clearly, improvements in retention rates were delayed in rural compared with urban 
29:902:68199:21:21:89:120:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas.

29:904:68206:21:21:89:511:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There is another interesting aspect to the timing of the improvement in school retention 
29:905:68295:21:21:89:506:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rates.  Note that the children born in the years 1980 to 1983—the cohorts enjoying the 
29:906:68382:21:0:89:514:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:largest relative improvement in urban areas—were aged 6 to 9 in 1989, the year that the 
30:907:68472:0:21:89:496:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:civil war ended.  Those children were at the beginning of their school careers, and it 
30:908:68559:21:21:89:513:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appears that they benefited greatly from the ending of the civil war.  Put differently, the 
30:909:68651:21:21:89:517:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:civil war probably disrupted significantly the functioning of schools and impoverished a 
30:910:68740:21:21:89:481:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large number of families with the unfortunate consequence that many children of 
30:911:68820:21:21:89:502:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling age in the decade of the 1980’s received very little schooling.  The delayed 
30:912:68907:21:21:89:497:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:improvement in school retention rates in rural areas perhaps can be explained by the 
30:913:68992:21:21:89:522:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:severity of the effects of the civil war and the fact that it took longer for things to go back 
30:914:69088:21:21:89:486:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to normal in the rural areas.  Another contributing factor may be the higher rate of 
30:915:69173:21:21:89:300:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retention in grade in rural than urban areas.

30:918:69305:21:21:89:482:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:urban area show that improvement in retention rates has been concentrated in the 
30:919:69386:21:21:89:517:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:traditional “exit” points.  There has been scant progress up through the 5th grade, but the 
30:920:69478:21:21:89:516:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hazard has decreased significantly at the 6th and 9th grades, as we move from the earliest 
30:921:69569:21:21:89:479:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to the more recent cohorts.  In sharp contrast, in rural areas the improvement has 
30:922:69652:21:21:89:225:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:occurred at all grade levels.

30:927:69787:21:21:89:516:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model.  This technique is particularly attractive to examine data for El Salvador because 
30:928:69877:21:21:89:491:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there has been a significant expansion in school attainment in the recent years. The 
30:929:69962:21:21:89:517:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates reveal immense progress in school retention rates for recent birth cohorts in El

30:933:70148:21:21:89:499:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts enjoyed the largest improvement relative to the cohort immediately prior.  In 
30:934:70234:21:21:89:514:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rural areas, the 1984-87 cohorts experienced, by far, the largest improvement relative to 
30:935:70324:21:21:89:499:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the cohort that preceded it.  Clearly, improvements in retention rates were delayed in 
30:936:70411:21:21:89:517:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rural compared with urban areas.  The cohorts enjoying the largest relative improvement 
30:937:70499:21:0:89:500:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in urban areas were aged 6 to 9 in 1989, the year the civil war ended.  These children 
31:938:70588:0:21:89:503:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were luckier than their older siblings were; they benefited from government efforts to 
31:939:70675:21:21:89:516:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase enrollment in primary schooling, especially in rural areas.  These efforts were a

31:944:70982:21:21:89:509:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is especially interesting in El Salvador, because of the significant differences in school

31:946:71165:21:21:89:504:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retention would generally take several generations, and would continue in spite of the 
31:947:71252:21:21:89:241:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expansion of school facilities.   
31:948:71286:21:21:89:92:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
31:949:71286:21:21:89:495:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Among the factors that affect the costs and benefits of schooling we are particularly 
31:950:71372:21:21:89:511:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interested in the effect of income and the possible impact of remittances.  The evidence 
31:951:71461:21:21:89:522:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from El Salvador sends a powerful message regarding the impact of the budget constraint 
31:952:71549:21:21:89:514:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on school retention rates.  We find that budgets have a small, though significant, impact 
31:953:71639:21:21:89:501:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the hazard of leaving school in rural and urban areas. But we find that remittances 
31:954:71726:21:21:89:514:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have a much larger impact on the hazard of leaving school.  In urban areas, the effect of 
31:955:71816:21:21:89:501:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances is, at its smallest, 10 times the size of the effect of other income.  In rural 
31:956:71908:21:21:89:512:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas, the effect of remittances is about 2.6 times that of other income.   In addition, the 
31:957:72001:21:21:89:513:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presence of remittances—irrespective of amounts—lowers the hazard of leaving school 
31:958:72085:21:21:89:314:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in rural areas but has no effect in urban areas.  
31:959:72135:21:21:89:92:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
31:960:72135:21:21:89:492:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Our finding that parental schooling has a significant effect on the hazard of leaving 
31:961:72221:21:21:89:511:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school is consistent with previous literature.  As others have argued, parental schooling 
31:962:72311:21:21:89:496:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may simultaneously capture genetic ability, motivation, and the capacity to generate 
31:963:72396:21:21:89:482:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income.  This ambiguity is problematic for it weakens the policy implications for 
31:964:72478:21:21:89:506:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:improving opportunities for children who lack schooling.  We measure income from a 
31:965:72561:21:21:89:515:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:source that is not directly correlated with parental schooling—remittances, and find that 
31:966:72651:21:21:89:499:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remittances have a larger effect than other types of income on school retention.  This 
31:967:72738:21:21:89:506:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that relaxing the budget constraint of poor households does have an effect on 
31:968:72825:21:0:89:457:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children’s school attainment, even if parents have low levels of schooling.

48:1620:88973:21:21:89:498:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:El Salvador is a relatively small and densely populated country; the fact that internal 
48:1621:89061:21:21:89:521:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration is significant does not justify that assumption.  Nevertheless, we tested the null 
48:1622:89154:21:21:89:472:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis that the urban and rural samples can be combined and the estimated 
48:1623:89232:21:21:89:516:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients are equal for the two samples.  We reject the null hypothesis, with a p-value 
48:1624:89323:21:21:89:516:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the test statistic equal to 0.00.  As a second check, we tested the null hypothesis that, 
48:1625:89417:21:21:89:520:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:while the underlying baseline hazards differ for the urban and rural samples, the effect of 
48:1626:89509:21:21:89:523:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the covariates on the hazards are the equal for the two samples.  Once again, we reject the 
48:1627:89601:21:21:89:403:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:null hypothesis, with a p-value for the test statistic equal to 0.00.

48:1629:89671:21:21:89:509:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The crucial assumption in the Cox proportional hazard model is that the hazard ratio is 
48:1630:89759:21:21:89:516:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proportional over the entire base line.  For example, if the hazard of leaving school is 30 
48:1631:89851:21:21:89:504:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent higher for boys than for girls, the proportional hazard assumption implies that 
48:1632:89939:21:21:89:523:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this ratio is the same in the first grade, the fifth grade, or at any grade level.  In our search 
48:1633:90037:21:21:89:472:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for a parsimonious specification, we paid special attention to the validity of the 
48:1634:90120:21:21:89:515:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proportionality assumption.  We tested the assumption for each individual covariate and 
48:1635:90208:21:21:89:220:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conducted a global test.14

49:1641:90590:0:21:89:493:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The testing revealed that the proportionality assumption was invalid for at least one 
49:1642:90676:21:21:89:454:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:covariate in the urban and the rural samples.  We relaxed the assumption of 
49:1643:90752:21:21:89:519:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proportionality by allowing the covariates to have different effects over four segments of 
49:1644:90843:21:21:89:499:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the baseline hazard.  The segments are “never enrolled,” 1st through the 6th grade, 7th 
49:1645:90930:21:21:89:511:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:through the 9th grade, and 10th through the 12th grade.15  When we repeated the tests we 
49:1646:91019:21:21:89:474:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:found that the variable “year of birth” continued to fail the proportionality test.  
49:1647:91104:21:21:89:505:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Consequently, we estimated separate models for the urban and rural samples allowing 
49:1648:91188:21:21:89:491:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:separate effects for the four segments of the baseline hazard, and we stratified each 
49:1649:91274:21:21:89:492:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample on individual year of birth.  Inspection of the estimated baseline hazard and 
49:1650:91359:21:21:89:469:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survival function for each stratum revealed that it is reasonable to combine the 
49:1651:91440:21:21:89:493:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:observations into 5 strata according to year of birth.  The four oldest strata combine 
49:1652:91527:21:21:89:507:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals born in four-year intervals: 1972 to 1975, 1976 to 1979, 1980 to 1983, and 
49:1653:91614:21:21:89:498:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1984 to 1987.  The youngest stratum is for individuals born between 1988 and 1990.

49:1655:91697:21:21:89:498:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The next step in the specification search involved testing the null hypothesis that the 
49:1656:91785:21:21:89:496:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect of the covariates is the same for all the strata.  We estimated a fully interacted 
49:1657:91875:21:21:89:488:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model, where the effect of each covariate was allowed to differ between strata and 
49:1658:91958:21:21:89:506:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:segments of the baseline hazard, separately for the urban and rural samples.  Then, we 
49:1659:92045:21:21:89:506:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated the model that imposes the constraints contained in the null hypothesis.  For 
49:1660:92133:21:21:89:518:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the urban sample, the likelihood ratio test results in rejection of the null hypothesis.  The 
49:1661:92227:21:21:89:514:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:test statistic is equal to 97.69 with 69 degrees of freedom, and a p-value equal to 0.013.  
49:1662:92319:21:21:89:508:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:When we allow the effects to differ for the youngest stratum, those born between 1988 
49:1663:92405:21:67:89:514:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and 1990, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the effects of the covariates are equal 
49:1664:92498:67:7:89:236:179:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                           
49:1665:92556:7:16:89:528:172:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:15We  divided  the  baseline  hazard  into  the  segments  listed  in  text  based  on  the  following  considerations.    
49:1666:92679:16:12:89:525:156:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Primary  education  is  divided  into  three  cycles  of  three  grades  each.    Therefore,  when  distance  to  school  
49:1667:92801:12:12:89:524:144:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:becomes a problem, it is likely it will happen when a child is ready to enroll in the next cycle of primary 
49:1668:92909:12:11:89:526:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:education  or  secondary  education.    In  addition,  public  education  becomes  relatively  scarce  at  the  third  
49:1669:93028:11:12:89:522:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cycle of primary education, and close to half of secondary education is private.  This suggests that out-of-
49:1670:93136:12:12:89:524:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:pocket  costs  of  additional  years  of  schooling  beyond  the  sixth  grade  rise  relative  to  schooling  at  younger  
49:1671:93260:12:11:89:525:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:ages.    In  addition,  in  the  early  stages  of  estimation  we  divided  the  hazard  further,  allowing  for  separate  
49:1672:93385:11:12:89:525:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:effects  for  the  1st  through  the  3rd  grade,  and  the  4th  through  the  6th  grade.    But  we  did  not  reject  the  null  
49:1673:93518:12:0:89:474:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:hypothesis that the segments could be combined into one covering the 1st through the 6th grade. 
50:1674:93616:0:21:89:521:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the remaining 4 strata.  The test statistic is equal to 55.79 with 58 degrees of freedom, 
50:1675:93710:21:21:89:246:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and a p-value equal to 0.558.16

50:1677:93744:21:21:89:511:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We continued testing nested hypotheses aimed at simplifying the specification as much 
50:1678:93830:21:21:89:518:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as possible.  Finally, we reduced the original specification that had 93 separate effects to 
50:1679:93923:21:21:89:508:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one with 10 effects.  The covariates in our preferred specification for the urban sample

50:1696:94842:21:21:89:403:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, we drop it from the specification for the urban sample.

50:1699:94967:8:18:89:513:174:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:16 We use six covariates: indicators for sex, lack of access to basic services, and presence of remittances, 
50:1700:95075:18:11:89:513:156:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:parental schooling, location on the income distribution, and change in the location due to the remittance.  
50:1701:95183:11:13:89:519:145:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:We allow the effects to differ for four segments of the hazard.  Therefore, in principle, the set of estimated 
50:1702:95294:13:11:89:503:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:coefficients for each stratum has 24 (6 × 4) coefficients.  Note that that two tests described in text only 
50:1703:95402:11:12:89:512:121:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:differ by 11 degrees of freedom.  The reason is that there are no observations in the later segments of the 
50:1704:95510:12:12:89:516:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:baseline hazard for the younger birth cohorts—no one born in 1988 is in the 7th grade or beyond by 1996, 
50:1705:95615:12:11:89:508:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the survey year.  Also, there are no observations with “no access to basic services” falling in the second 
50:1706:95722:11:12:89:494:86:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:segment of the hazard.  Consequently, we can only estimate 11 separate parameters for the youngest 
50:1707:95821:12:0:89:422:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:stratum, which explains the difference of 11 degrees of freedom between the tests.

52:1752:99063:21:21:89:521:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intuitive appeal.  As a child progresses through the school system, the child’s own school 
52:1753:99154:21:21:89:513:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:experience will weigh more heavily, and the parents’ schooling will weigh less heavily, 
52:1754:99242:21:21:89:514:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the evaluation of the returns to additional schooling for the child.  In the sociology of 
52:1755:99335:21:21:89:497:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:education literature, the declining effect of “family background” variables (typically 
52:1756:99422:21:21:89:513:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parental schooling and family income) on ever-higher school grade transitions has been 
52:1757:99509:21:21:89:506:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interpreted as “dynamic selection bias.”  In other words, family background correlates 
52:1758:99596:21:21:89:514:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with unobserved factors like ability, and as the group of students who attain ever-higher

52:1767:100258:21:21:89:479:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:it require ad hoc distributional assumptions before inferences regarding dynamic 
52:1768:100339:21:0:89:520:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:selectivity bias can be made.  They estimate a logit model and an ordered discrete-choice

53:1770:100519:21:21:89:520:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because they allow a comparison of parameter estimates with and without corrections for

53:1775:100801:21:21:89:504:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correction makes scant difference for primary and secondary schooling.  The effect of 
53:1776:100887:21:21:89:491:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correcting for selectivity is concentrated in graduating from high school and higher 
53:1777:100972:21:21:89:514:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schooling levels.  Moreover, in their preferred specification, the ordered discrete-choice 
53:1778:101063:21:21:89:507:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model, the estimates of the density of “ability” at various schooling levels suggest that 
53:1779:101153:21:21:89:516:498:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the density for high school graduates is only slightly to the right of the baseline density.  
53:1780:101247:21:21:89:519:477:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We interpret Cameron and Heckman’s results as suggesting that dynamic selectivity bias 
53:1781:101334:21:21:89:485:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is unimportant in primary and secondary schooling.  Indeed, in most countries the 
53:1782:101416:21:21:89:486:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:curriculum is set at a level of difficulty that allows near universal graduation from 
53:1783:101502:21:21:89:435:414:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:primary school and very high graduation rates from secondary school.

53:1785:101573:21:21:89:516:372:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:For several reasons, we have elected not to implement a correction for selectivity.  First, 
53:1786:101665:21:21:89:518:351:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the evidence discussed in the paragraph above suggests that dynamic selectivity bias is a 
53:1787:101755:21:21:89:515:330:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:minor problem for the analysis of grades 1 through 12, the grades we examine.  Second, 
53:1788:101842:21:21:89:524:309:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:our results do not conform to the typical pattern found in logit models: our estimate of the 
53:1789:101935:21:21:89:510:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect of family income declines for higher grade levels in rural but not in urban areas.  
53:1790:102026:21:21:89:518:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Third, assume we found a lowering of the hazard of leaving school in grades 1 through 6 
53:1791:102114:21:21:89:523:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and an increase in the hazard of leaving school after the 6th grade over time.  It is possible 
53:1792:102209:21:21:89:519:225:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the increase in the hazard beyond the 6th grade would be due to a “worsening” of the 
53:1793:102299:21:21:89:488:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pool of students because of higher retention rates in grades 1 through 6.  We could 
53:1794:102383:21:21:89:499:183:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conclude erroneously that matters have gotten worse in grades 7 through 12.  But we 
53:1795:102467:21:21:89:503:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have found no such pattern.  We estimate improvements in retention rates at all grade 
53:1796:102553:21:0:89:412:141:144:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:B:levels as we move from the oldest to the most recent birth cohorts.
