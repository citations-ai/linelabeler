2:38:2216:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:B:Using  data  on  exogenous  liquidity  losses  generated  by  the  fraud  and  failure  of  a  cash-in-transit 
2:39:2327:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:B:firm, we  demonstrate  a  causal  impact  on  firms’  trade  credit  usage.  We  find  that  firms  manage 
2:40:2433:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:B:liquidity  shortfalls by  increasing  the  amount  of  drawn  credit  from  suppliers  and  decreasing  the 
2:41:2540:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:B:amount issued to customers. The compounded trade credit adjustments are at least as great, if not 
2:42:2637:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:B:greater than corresponding adjustments in cash holdings, suggesting that trade credit positions are 
2:43:2736:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:B:economically  important  sources  of  reserve liquidity.  The  underlying  mechanism  in  trade  credit 
2:44:2839:14:42:72:491:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments is in part due to shifts in credit durations—both upstream and downstream.

3:68:3292:0:34:72:191:708:17:Times:17:Times:C:1    Introduction
3:69:3309:34:22:72:526:674:12:Times:12:Times:B:Do firms use their trade credit positions to handle shortfalls in liquidity?  Theoretical and em-
3:70:3406:22:22:72:526:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:pirical research has shown that corporate cash holdings play a prominent role in firms’ liquidity
3:71:3503:22:22:72:526:630:12:Times:12:Times:B:management  by  ensuring  funding  of  future  investments,  see,  e.g.,  Almeida,  Campello,  and
3:72:3601:22:21:72:526:608:12:Times:12:Times:B:Weisbach (2004), and as a buffer against shortfalls in liquidity, see Acharya, Davydenko, and
3:73:3694:21:22:72:526:587:12:Times:12:Times:B:Strebulaev (2012).  It is intuitive that firms’ choices of buffer liquidity levels hinge on a range
3:74:3793:22:22:72:526:565:12:Times:12:Times:B:of capital structure attributes;  bankruptcy risk and cash flow volatility to mention two prime
3:75:3888:22:21:72:526:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:candidates, and obviously also to what extent firms can access outside funding, be it market or
3:76:3983:21:22:72:526:522:12:Times:12:Times:B:bank financing, cf. Sufi (2007). Less recognized is that firms’ trade credit positions give rise to
3:77:4082:22:22:72:526:500:12:Times:12:Times:B:sizable financial assets and liabilities on their balance sheets, and thereby provide opportunities
3:78:4181:22:21:72:526:478:12:Times:12:Times:B:for firms to extract liquidity from their suppliers and customers by adjusting these positions;
3:79:4276:21:22:72:526:457:12:Times:12:Times:B:for instance, by postponing payments on their trade credit obligations (accounts payable), or by
3:80:4372:22:22:72:447:435:12:Times:12:Times:B:promoting prompt payments on their trade credit claims (accounts receivable).
3:81:4449:22:21:89:525:413:12:Times:12:Times:A:It  is  thus  conceivable  that  adjustment  capacity  at  the  trade  credit  margins—next  to  cash
3:82:4550:21:22:72:526:392:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings—can potentially function as an important source of reserve liquidity. This perspective
3:83:4645:22:22:72:526:370:12:Times:12:Times:B:has in part been put forward by Wilner (2000) and Cuñat (2007), who propose that trade credit
3:84:4738:22:21:72:526:348:12:Times:12:Times:B:networks can function as a liquidity insurance mechanism by allocating liquidity from suppliers
3:85:4833:21:22:72:526:327:12:Times:12:Times:B:to constrained counterparties further down the supply chain; that is, firms’ ability to exploit their
3:86:4934:22:22:72:525:305:12:Times:12:Times:B:accounts payable to accrue liquidity.1Cuñat (2007) argues that suppliers, incentivized by the
3:87:5027:22:21:72:526:283:12:Times:12:Times:B:rents from maintaining long-term relationships, may choose to support downstream counterpar-
3:88:5119:21:22:72:526:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:ties that experience temporary liquidity shocks.  The idea is that firms experiencing a liquidity
3:89:5216:22:22:72:526:240:12:Times:12:Times:B:shock can offset the impact by postponing payments on the trade credit claims held by its sup-
3:90:5310:22:21:72:526:218:12:Times:12:Times:B:pliers,  a temporary default if you will;  or,  alternatively,  by increasing the maturity of future
3:91:5410:21:22:72:526:197:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit contracts; both measures will generate liquidity, without necessarily affecting the
3:92:5506:22:22:72:526:175:12:Times:12:Times:B:volume of input purchases.  Here we go one step further to envision an insurance mechanism,
3:93:5597:22:21:72:526:153:12:Times:12:Times:B:in which upstream and downstream firms are connected to each other as if in an implicit risk
3:94:5689:21:22:72:526:132:12:Times:12:Times:B:sharing arrangement. We suggest that such a liquidity insurance mechanism may operate sym-
3:95:5779:22:18:72:526:110:12:Times:12:Times:B:metrically, by also allocating liquidity from unconstrained customers to otherwise constrained
3:96:5873:18:14:85:525:92:7:Times:10:Times:F:1Closely related, Boissay and Gropp (2013) empirically show that firms experiencing late customer payments
3:97:5979:14:9:72:526:78:10:Times:10:Times:F:are more likely to postpone their own payments to suppliers, illustrating that trade credit chains may function as
3:98:6093:9:0:72:269:69:10:Times:10:Times:F:an insurance mechanism against liquidity shocks.
4:99:6142:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:counterparties further up the supply chain; that is, firms can manage their accounts receivable
4:100:6237:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:to generate liquidity.  We should, from the downstream perspective, expect that firms can seek
4:101:6331:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:to generate additional liquidity by reducing the amount of issued trade credit to their customers
4:102:6428:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:by reversing the measures that apply upstream;  i.e., either reducing net days on issued trade
4:103:6522:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit contracts, or by proactive monitoring and management of outstanding contracts to avoid
4:104:6615:22:21:72:209:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:overdue customer payments.
4:105:6641:21:22:89:525:578:12:Times:12:Times:A:More generally one can envision that firms in a risk sharing network are subject to idiosyn-
4:106:6733:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:cratic, firm-specific shocks and to sectoral or macro aggregate shocks. If there were no obstacles
4:107:6831:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:to such risk sharing, idiosyncratic shocks would be pooled away, internally, within the network,
4:108:6927:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:leaving management of aggregate shocks to group level cash management or to external formal
4:109:7018:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:bank relationships.   No doubt in practice there are obstacles to and hence more limited risk
4:110:7111:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:sharing;  obstacles such as limited information and limited commitment.   In particular,  firms
4:111:7206:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:may threaten non-cooperation, e.g., to pull out of the network if they are unwilling to provide
4:112:7301:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:the requisite liquidity of the implicit sharing rules.  But such a threat might be mitigated by
4:113:7396:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:potential loss of established relationships within the current supply chain, given pre-established
4:114:7494:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:specificity in inputs, tailored monitoring technologies, and so on.  Risk sharing is better, the
4:115:7590:22:22:72:526:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:more specific these relationships are.  Nevertheless, threats may not be sufficient, and on some
4:116:7686:22:21:72:526:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:paths of shock realizations firms will file legal claims for recovery or be forced themselves to
4:117:7782:21:22:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:consider bankruptcy.  In sum, we are allowing both an ex ante risk sharing perspective and an
4:118:7875:22:22:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:ex post contagion perspective, simultaneously.  This then is the overall framework we have in
4:119:7968:22:21:72:526:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:mind. Which of these various forces we can plausibly identify in data is the empirical quest of
4:120:8063:21:22:72:121:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:this paper.
4:121:8074:22:22:89:525:231:12:Times:12:Times:A:The main challenge is to demonstrate that adjustments at trade credit margins can be caused
4:122:8165:22:22:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:by firms’ increased liquidity needs, while ruling out potentially confounding factors, such as
4:123:8259:22:21:72:526:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes in demand and supply conditions in the supply-chain. We conduct the empirical analy-
4:124:8351:21:22:72:526:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:ses on two primary data sets.  On the one hand, we use a population-wide data set on Swedish
4:125:8443:22:22:72:526:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:corporate firms. For our purpose, this data set has two distinct advantages. Firstly, for a (small)
4:126:8542:22:21:72:526:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:sub-sample of the firms, we can evaluate the impact of exogenous liquidity shocks imposed by
4:127:8634:21:22:72:526:101:12:Times:12:Times:B:the fraud and failure of a large cash-in-transit firm.  Secondly, the data set covers the universe
4:128:8732:22:0:72:526:79:12:Times:12:Times:B:of Swedish firms, which enables an evaluation covering the full spectrum of firms, from very
5:129:8825:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:small firms to large ones.  On the other hand, we make use of the familiar Compustat data for
5:130:8918:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:very large, publicly traded U.S. corporations, which have been used in many previous empirical
5:131:9012:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:contributions to this literature. By conducting the empirical analyses—when possible—on two
5:132:9103:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:data sets that concern hugely divergent firm-sizes, we hope to achieve results that are general in
5:133:9201:22:22:72:271:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:nature and not size-, nor country-specific.
5:134:9244:22:21:89:525:599:12:Times:12:Times:A:The empirical setup comprises three steps. Firstly, simply to quantify orders of magnitude,
5:135:9335:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:we apply a variance decomposition approach similar to that proposed by Asdrubali, Sorensen,
5:136:9426:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Yosha (1996).   The variance decomposition framework allows us to evaluate the extent
5:137:9515:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:to which variations in cash flow shortfalls are associated with shifts in various asset and lia-
5:138:9611:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:bility components of firms’ balance sheets.  Our findings suggest that cash flow shortfalls are
5:139:9706:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:indeed associated with drawdowns in cash holdings and reductions in the amounts of issued
5:140:9795:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit to customers, but the amount of drawn trade credit from suppliers also decreases,
5:141:9889:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:which is counterintuitive from a liquidity perspective.  However, one pressing concern for the
5:142:9983:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:interpretation of the variance decomposition estimates is that they may reflect shifts in demand
5:143:10079:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:and supply conditions—over and above increased liquidity needs—which points to a quest for
5:144:10169:21:22:72:152:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:causal inference.
5:145:10186:22:22:89:525:361:12:Times:12:Times:A:Secondly—which brings us to our main contribution—we examine effects of alternative,
5:146:10270:22:21:72:526:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:and arguably exogenous,  liquidity shocks.  To this end, we make use of Abadie and Imbens
5:147:10359:21:22:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2006) nearest-neighbor matching approach to explore the liquidity shocks that the fraudulent
5:148:10452:22:22:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:scheme and subsequent bankruptcy event of the Swedish cash-in-transit firm Panaxia imposed
5:149:10542:22:21:72:526:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:on its corporate clients.   We can compare the adjustments in cash holdings and trade credit
5:150:10634:21:22:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:positions in response to these liquidity shocks for the clients—the treated firms—with the ad-
5:151:10728:22:22:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:justments undertaken by a group of control firms. This event thus allows us to establish a plau-
5:152:10824:22:22:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:sible exogenous and causal inference for the role of trade credit in firms’ liquidity management.
5:153:10921:22:21:72:526:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:Moreover,  using data on applications for issuance of injunction to settle overdue trade debt,
5:154:11015:21:22:72:526:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:we can examine the nature of firms’ behavior underlying trade credit adjustments: namely, that
5:155:11109:22:22:72:526:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:reserve liquidity is extracted upstream by postponement of trade credit payments to suppliers,
5:156:11203:22:21:72:507:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:and downstream by attempting enforcement of repayment of overdue debt from customers.
5:157:11288:21:22:89:525:101:12:Times:12:Times:A:The Panaxia event study provides a slightly different picture, as to the relative importance of
5:158:11383:22:0:72:526:79:12:Times:12:Times:B:the liquidity sources that we are interested in. Contrary to the previous variance decomposition
6:159:11480:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:results, we find that both trade credit margins play important roles and increases in accounts
6:160:11574:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:payable are more pronounced than reductions in accounts receivable, while adjustments in cash-
6:161:11668:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings remain important.  Moreover, the compounded adjustment from the two trade credit
6:162:11757:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:margins—the increase in drawn credit, plus the reduction in outstanding credit—is of a similar
6:163:11851:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:magnitude as the adjustment in cash holdings, suggesting that trade credit margins make for
6:164:11942:22:21:72:253:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:important sources of reserve liquidity.
6:165:11981:21:22:89:525:578:12:Times:12:Times:A:We go on to investigate the underlying mechanism of the adjustments in trade credit posi-
6:166:12070:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:tions and find that they in part are due to shifts in trade credit durations—both upstream and
6:167:12164:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:downstream. More specifically, the propensity to default on due trade credit increases for firms
6:168:12260:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:that are hit by the liquidity shock, which is consistent with the documented increase in accounts
6:169:12357:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:payable.  Likewise, treated firms also tend to increase efforts to enforce payment of overdue
6:170:12450:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit from their customers, which is consistent with the observed reductions in receiv-
6:171:12544:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:ables.  Moreover, the complexity of the event gives rise to differential treatments, which can
6:172:12638:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:be exploited for identification.  Thus,  a sub-group of the treated firms were only exposed to
6:173:12732:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:the fraudulent scheme undertaken by Panaxia, but did not suffer losses in its subsequent fail-
6:174:12826:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:ure.  By using this variation in treatment, and also the variation in loss-size across the firms in
6:175:12925:22:22:72:526:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:the sub-group receiving full treatment, we confirm the intuitively appealing notion that larger
6:176:13020:22:21:72:518:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments in trade credit positions result, when firms are exposed to more liquidity distress.
6:177:13116:21:22:89:525:318:12:Times:12:Times:A:In our final empirical section, we return to measuring firms’ liquidity needs by means of cash
6:178:13210:22:22:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:flow shortfalls. We do so by regressing cash flow shortfalls on changes in cash holdings, and on
6:179:13306:22:21:72:526:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes in trade credit positions, while controlling for demand conditions in the supply-chain,
6:180:13401:21:22:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:and a host of other potentially important factors. This setup enables a broad characterization of
6:181:13498:22:22:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms’ usage of liquidity sources and thereby provides an evaluation of the external validity of
6:182:13594:22:22:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:our event study results.  The conditional model results for both Swedish and U.S. firms align
6:183:13687:22:21:72:526:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:closely with the previous exogenous liquidity shock results; firms subject to shortfalls in cash
6:184:13783:21:22:72:526:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:flow reduce their cash holdings, considerably increase their accounts payable, and moderately
6:185:13876:22:22:72:526:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:reduce their accounts receivable.  The compounded adjustments at the trade credit margins are
6:186:13969:22:21:72:526:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:greater than corresponding adjustments in cash holdings.  Thus, these results suggest that the
6:187:14063:21:22:72:411:101:12:Times:12:Times:B:observed responses in firms’ trade credit margins are general in nature.
6:188:14135:22:0:89:525:79:12:Times:12:Times:A:This  paper  aims  to  contribute  to  the  vast  literature  on  firms’  choices  of  cash  holdings,
7:189:14238:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:and liquidity management in general.  Influential papers include Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and
7:190:14331:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:Williamson (1999), Almeida et al.  (2004), and Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009), which study
7:191:14421:22:21:72:525:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms’ choices of cash holdings in light of their access to external funding.2Our paper is also
7:192:14516:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:close to Acharya et al.  (2012), who investigate the relationship between firms’ cash holdings
7:193:14610:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:and their default risks, suggesting a positive one. That is, all else equal, higher default risks in-
7:194:14711:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:centivize firms to hold more cash, to safeguard against adverse liquidity shocks. We emphasize
7:195:14805:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:that firms—in addition to cash holdings and external financing—have trade credit assets and li-
7:196:14900:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:abilities that can be transformed into liquidity. To better understand how firms handle liquidity
7:197:14997:22:21:72:447:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:shocks, it is therefore important to also account for their trade credit positions.
7:198:15080:21:22:89:525:513:12:Times:12:Times:A:As noted above,  the role of trade credit for firms’ liquidity management has partly been
7:199:15169:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:put forward by Cuñat (2007), who proposes that trade credit links function as a liquidity insur-
7:200:15265:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:ance mechanism by allocating liquidity from unconstrained suppliers to constrained customers
7:201:15357:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the form of accounts payable.  Cuñat shows empirically that large declines in firms’ cash
7:202:15449:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings are correlated with increases in their accounts payable.  Our paper extends this view
7:203:15543:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:by providing causal insights on how liquidity shocks impact on firms’ cash and trade credit
7:204:15634:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:positions—both upstream and downstream—enabling an evaluation of the relative importance
7:205:15722:22:22:72:195:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:of these liquidity sources.
7:206:15749:22:21:89:525:339:12:Times:12:Times:A:Another  partly  related  literature  considers  the  role  of  liquidity  provisioning  within  busi-
7:207:15851:21:22:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:ness  groups,  see,  e.g.,  Almeida,  Kim,  and  Kim  (2015),  Gopalan,  Nanda,  and  Seru  (2007),
7:208:15950:22:22:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:Karaivanov, Ruano, Salas, and Townsend (2010), Samphantharak (2009). Gopalan et al. (2007),
7:209:16041:22:21:72:526:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:for example, show that firms belonging to business groups engage in risk sharing where inter-
7:210:16134:21:22:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:group cash transfers is used to support distressed firms within the group.  Furthermore, on the
7:211:16229:22:22:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:household side, Kinnan and Townsend (2012) use data on rural Thai households and show that
7:212:16319:22:22:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:indirect access to bank financing, through inter-household borrowing, mitigates income risk by
7:213:16413:22:21:72:526:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:reducing the association between income fluctuations and consumption. In analogy, our results
7:214:16506:21:22:72:526:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggest that firms engage in risk sharing through informal ties with their suppliers and customers
7:215:16604:22:22:72:526:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the supply-chain.  However, liquidity provisioning in trade credit networks is nevertheless
7:216:16698:22:21:72:526:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:also associated with costs. Such costs have been highlighted in the financial network literature,
7:217:16795:21:18:72:526:101:12:Times:12:Times:B:arguing that counterparty exposures may cause shock propagation and—in extension—potential

8:220:17076:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2015).  Empirically, from a trade credit perspective, Jacobson and von Schedvin (2015) use
8:221:17167:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:Swedish firm data similar to the current data to study firm-failure propagation in trade credit
8:222:17262:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:chains.  They show that suppliers who are exposed to credit losses due to failing customers,
8:223:17354:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:are in turn subject to an elevated risk of failure. Hence, the financial networks of suppliers and
8:224:17452:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:customers arising through trade credit have two closely related features;  ex-ante risk sharing
8:225:17547:21:22:72:516:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:through liquidity provisioning, on the one hand, and ex-post failure propagation on the other.
8:226:17641:22:22:89:525:556:12:Times:12:Times:A:The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.  The next section details our various
8:227:17732:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:data resources,  and provides some descriptive statistics.   Section 3 presents the variance de-
8:228:17828:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:composition analysis and results.  In Section 4 we describe the results from the analyses of the
8:229:17924:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:liquidity shocks from the fraud and failure event of the cash-in-transit firm Panaxia.  Section
8:230:18019:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:5 covers modeling of cash flow shortfalls, and an exploration of cross-sectional heterogeneity.
8:231:18114:21:52:72:171:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:Section 6 concludes.
8:232:18134:52:34:72:323:396:17:Times:17:Times:C:2    Data and Descriptive Statistics
8:233:18170:34:22:72:526:362:12:Times:12:Times:B:As described in the previous section, our empirical analysis involves firm-level data from both
8:234:18265:22:22:72:526:340:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sweden and the U.S.. The two data sets concern firms that are widely different in scope and size,
8:235:18362:22:21:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:yet they separately bring onboard distinct features; but nevertheless, as we will subsequently
8:236:18456:21:22:72:526:297:12:Times:12:Times:B:demonstrate, they often yield strikingly similar results.  The Swedish data set covers the entire
8:237:18553:22:22:72:526:275:12:Times:12:Times:B:corporate sector (currently some 330,000 firms in the stock) and is dominated by small- and
8:238:18644:22:21:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:medium-sized enterprises.  Importantly, it allows for an evaluation of the exogenous liquidity
8:239:18738:21:22:72:526:232:12:Times:12:Times:B:shortfalls generated by the Panaxia event.  That is, for a small sub-sample of Swedish, mostly
8:240:18832:22:22:72:526:210:12:Times:12:Times:B:retail, firms we are able to consider effects of an exogenous liquidity shock caused by the fraud
8:241:18929:22:21:72:526:188:12:Times:12:Times:B:and failure of a large cash-in-transit firm, for which we believe identification is unambiguous.
8:242:19025:21:22:72:526:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:Furthermore,  the U.S. Compustat data cover large public corporations and serve as a useful
8:243:19116:22:22:72:526:145:12:Times:12:Times:B:benchmark that facilitates interpretations of our results in the light of the empirical literature
8:244:19214:22:0:72:398:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:hitherto. In what follows, we provide the details of our data sources.
9:245:19285:0:30:72:185:708:14:Times:14:Times:C:2.1    Swedish data
9:246:19304:30:22:72:526:678:12:Times:12:Times:B:The Swedish firm data set is an unbalanced panel consisting of almost 4.7 million yearly obser-
9:247:19399:22:22:72:525:656:12:Times:12:Times:B:vations on the stock of (on average over time) roughly 270,000 Swedishaktiebolag, or corporate
9:248:19493:22:21:72:525:634:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms, as recorded between January 1,1989, and December31,2013, hence covering a period of

9:252:19855:21:22:72:526:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:at Bolagsverket, the Swedish Companies Registration Office (SCRO). Swedish corporate firms
9:253:19945:22:22:72:526:526:12:Times:12:Times:B:are also required to submit an annual financial statement to the SCRO, covering balance-sheet
9:254:20038:22:21:72:526:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:and income-statement data in accordance with the European Union standards.  The financial
9:255:20127:21:22:72:526:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:statements, provided to us by Upplysningscentralen AB (UC), the leading credit bureau in Swe-
9:256:20220:22:22:72:526:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:den, constitute the backbone of the panel data set analyzed below. In Sweden, as in many other
9:257:20314:22:21:72:526:439:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries, firms have considerable discretion in choosing a time period for which their financial
9:258:20411:21:22:72:526:418:12:Times:12:Times:B:statements will apply. A large fraction of the firm-year observations in our sample concern fiscal
9:259:20509:22:22:72:526:396:12:Times:12:Times:B:periods starting in the middle of a calendar year. We deal with this by interpolating the financial
9:260:20608:22:21:72:525:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:statements so that their fiscal periods align with calendar years.3Firms with total assets and
9:261:20702:21:22:72:526:353:12:Times:12:Times:B:real sales below SEK 100,000 (deflating by means of consumer prices, using year 2010 prices
9:262:20793:22:22:72:526:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:as a basis), financial firms, and utilities are omitted.  In order to avoid detrimental effects from
9:263:20893:22:21:72:524:309:12:Times:8:Times:B:outlier observations, all firm-specific variables are winsorized with respect to the 1stand the 99th
9:264:20993:21:22:72:526:288:12:Times:12:Times:B:percentiles. In addition, in order to ensure that the sample is the same across all specifications,
9:265:21092:22:18:72:501:266:12:Times:12:Times:B:we drop firm-years that lack necessary data points for one or several of our specifications.
9:266:21184:18:14:85:525:248:7:Times:10:Times:F:3The data set, or similar versions of it, has been used extensively in previous research, c.f. Jacobson, Lindé, and

9:269:21519:10:10:71:525:215:10:Times:10:Times:F:have been transformed to conform to standardized calendar year fiscal periods.  The shares of shorter (less than
9:270:21631:10:10:71:525:205:10:Times:10:Times:F:12 months) and longer (more than 12 months) statements are both around 5 percent.  Whereas shorter than the
9:271:21738:10:10:71:525:195:10:Times:10:Times:F:stipulated minimum of 6 months happen, statements covering a longer period than the allowed maximum of 18
9:272:21843:10:10:71:525:185:10:Times:10:Times:F:months are very rare.   Over time,  the annual shares of shorter/longer statement periods have come down from
9:273:21952:10:10:71:525:175:10:Times:10:Times:F:about 8 percent to currently around 4 percent. Thus, an overwhelming majority of statements concern a period of
9:274:22063:10:9:71:525:165:10:Times:10:Times:F:12 months.  However, out of the 90 percent of the total number of statements, only 48 percentage points coincide
9:275:22175:9:10:71:525:156:10:Times:10:Times:F:with a calendar year, and hence 42 percentage points refer to other 12 month periods.  In these calculations we
9:276:22286:10:10:71:525:146:10:Times:10:Times:F:have allowed for a given calendar year to begin in mid-December the previous year, and end in mid-January the
9:277:22395:10:0:71:131:136:10:Times:10:Times:F:following year.
10:278:22411:0:30:72:434:708:14:Times:14:Times:C:2.2    The cash-in-transit firm Panaxia, its fraud and failure
10:279:22473:30:22:72:526:678:12:Times:12:Times:B:The literature to which this paper aims to contribute, is concerned with the effects of liquidity
10:280:22570:22:22:72:526:656:12:Times:12:Times:B:shocks. Empirical contributions—including the current paper—have to this end often made use
10:281:22661:22:21:72:526:634:12:Times:12:Times:B:of shortfalls in firms’ cash flows as a proxy measure.  Not necessarily because this is an ideal
10:282:22757:21:22:72:526:613:12:Times:12:Times:B:measure of events whose impact we want to gauge, but rather because shifts in cash flow can
10:283:22848:22:22:72:526:591:12:Times:12:Times:B:readily be calculated for all firms in the samples employed.  However, considerable allowance
10:284:22941:22:21:72:526:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:for  potential  endogeneity  issues  is  called  for;  cash  flow  shortfalls  may  well  reflect  adverse
10:285:23047:21:22:72:526:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:shifts in demand conditions in the supply-chain, as well as aging and depreciating capital stocks
10:286:23144:22:22:72:526:526:12:Times:12:Times:B:resulting in declining productivity.  In search for a cleaner—or more exogenous, if you will—
10:287:23237:22:21:72:526:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:measure of shocks to liquidity, we will evaluate the case of the Swedish cash-in transit firm
10:288:23330:21:22:72:526:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:Panaxia, its fraudulent behavior and subsequent failure in 2012—with dire consequences for its
10:289:23424:22:22:72:526:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:customers. The triggered losses were non-negligible, taken as shares of customers’ total assets,
10:290:23520:22:21:72:526:439:12:Times:12:Times:B:and it can be argued that the surprise element was almost complete, suggesting an exogenous
10:291:23611:21:22:72:526:418:12:Times:12:Times:B:event that is close in nature to the concept of an economic shock.  Although it is a matter of
10:292:23705:22:22:72:526:396:12:Times:12:Times:B:a one-time event affecting a relatively small number of firms,  we can nevertheless use it to
10:293:23798:22:21:72:526:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:establish causality for the mechanisms gearing firms liquidity positions that we wish to unravel.
10:294:23895:21:22:89:525:353:12:Times:12:Times:A:Panaxia was one of three leading cash-in-transit firms operating in Sweden.  It serviced its
10:295:23987:22:22:72:526:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:customers—mostly, but not exclusively, in the retail sector—by collecting their daily receipts at
10:296:24084:22:21:72:526:309:12:Times:12:Times:B:their premises. Collected receipts were then delivered to a bank depot for counting, and within
10:297:24179:21:22:72:526:288:12:Times:12:Times:B:one to two days, Panaxia credited the firms’ bank accounts for the due funds. That is, according
10:298:24275:22:22:72:526:266:12:Times:12:Times:B:to the contracts between Panaxia and its customers,  the latter would upon handing over the
10:299:24366:22:21:72:526:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash for transportation to the depot hold a claim on the former, until a transfer of funds to the
10:300:24463:21:22:72:451:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:customers’ bank accounts had been carried out within a maximum of two days.
10:301:24538:22:22:89:525:201:12:Times:12:Times:A:In 2009, Panaxia faced financial distress in the form of a drastic contraction in the lending
10:302:24631:22:21:72:526:179:12:Times:12:Times:B:provided by its creditors.   This was a consequence of rising operational losses—in turn,  the
10:303:24725:21:22:72:526:158:12:Times:12:Times:B:result of an aggressive pricing strategy designed to increase Panaxia’s market shares. To coun-
10:304:24820:22:22:72:526:136:12:Times:12:Times:B:teract the contraction in external financing, Panaxia began to finance its operations by means
10:305:24914:22:21:72:526:114:12:Times:12:Times:B:of withholding its customers’ funds for additional days.   Over time,  this scheme of delayed
10:306:25007:21:22:72:526:93:12:Times:12:Times:B:installments escalated, and in the months prior to the bankruptcy that was finally declared on
10:307:25101:22:0:72:526:71:12:Times:12:Times:B:September 5, 2012, customers could face waiting times as long as 10 to 12 days before Panaxia
11:308:25195:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:had transferred the due funds to their bank accounts.  Figure 1 shows the average number of
11:309:25286:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:bank days over time required by Panaxia to transfer the due funds generated in cash collection
11:310:25380:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:to their clients’ bank accounts.  There is a distinct initial level shift; the number of bank days
11:311:25478:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:increased from two in the beginning of 2010, to five days towards the end of that year. From the
11:312:25574:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:beginning of 2011 and towards the bankruptcy event, there is a slightly upward-sloping trend
11:313:25666:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:such that the average delivery time reached almost six days in the months prior to the failure.
11:314:25761:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:The sustainability of this Ponzi scheme hinged on Panaxia’s ability to maintain the size of its
11:315:25856:22:31:72:279:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:customer base through competitive pricing.
11:316:25898:31:31:231:365:525:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Figure 1 about here.]
11:317:25927:31:22:89:525:494:12:Times:12:Times:A:It is a fair question to ask whether the customers did not understand what was going on, or
11:318:26018:22:22:72:526:472:12:Times:12:Times:B:react to the drastically increased delivery periods.  They did, but very few actually ended their
11:319:26115:22:21:72:525:450:12:Times:12:Times:B:contracts with Panaxia.4The general credibility of Panaxia can be appreciated by considering
11:320:26207:21:22:72:526:429:12:Times:12:Times:B:the fact that Sveriges Riksbank (the central bank of Sweden),  even in early 2012 signed an
11:321:26298:22:22:72:526:407:12:Times:12:Times:B:agreement with Panaxia for purchases of coin collection and distribution services.  This agree-
11:322:26393:22:21:72:526:385:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment was in place up until the arrest of the CEO of Panaxia,  shortly before the bankruptcy,
11:323:26485:21:22:72:368:364:12:Times:12:Times:B:although no services were ever purchased by the central bank.
11:324:26546:22:22:89:525:342:12:Times:12:Times:A:The consequences of Panaxia’s failure were severe for its customers. We have acquired the
11:325:26635:22:21:72:526:320:12:Times:12:Times:B:identities of the firms that were exposed to the failure from the bankruptcy trustee and from
11:326:26728:21:22:72:526:299:12:Times:12:Times:B:four banks that were involved in the bankruptcy.  At the time of the failure, our records cover
11:327:26823:22:22:72:526:277:12:Times:12:Times:B:1,270 customers that had outstanding claims on Panaxia from collections of daily proceeds from
11:328:26917:22:21:72:526:255:12:Times:12:Times:B:more than 5,000 collection sites. After omitting firms for which we cannot establish an identity
11:329:27013:21:22:72:526:234:12:Times:12:Times:B:(34); banks and financial firms (12); non-limited liability firms (179) for which we do not have
11:330:27109:22:22:72:526:212:12:Times:12:Times:B:accounting data; pharmacies (137) which were mostly startups in the period 2009–2010 due to
11:331:27200:22:22:72:526:190:12:Times:12:Times:B:a deregulation of the pharmacy-market that took place mid-year 2009; and firms with missing
11:332:27291:22:17:72:525:168:12:Times:12:Times:B:accounting data for the period 2008–2013 (303), we obtained a final sample of 605 firms.5The
11:333:27383:17:13:85:526:151:7:Times:10:Times:F:4The bankruptcy trustee describes a setup where the Panaxia’s management instructed the customer-support
11:334:27487:13:10:71:525:138:10:Times:10:Times:F:staff to inform customers complaining about the prolonged delivery times that the holdups were simply due to
11:335:27595:10:10:71:525:128:10:Times:10:Times:F:technical problems. Figure A1 shows the number of collected receipts at a monthly frequency for the period 2006–
11:336:27707:10:10:71:525:118:10:Times:10:Times:F:2011. The figure shows a sharp increase in collected receipts from January 2006 to July 2008, and a stable pattern
11:337:27821:10:10:71:525:108:10:Times:10:Times:F:hovering around 120,000 collected receipts in the period from July 2008 to December 2013.  Thus,  this figure
11:338:27930:10:7:71:383:98:10:Times:10:Times:F:indicates that the number of customers was stable from mid-2008 and onward.
11:339:28005:7:14:85:525:91:7:Times:10:Times:F:5In the final sample,  we have also omitted one treated firm that displayed an abnormally large number of
11:340:28110:14:9:71:525:77:10:Times:10:Times:F:overdue payments in 2009.  For this treated firm, the number of overdue payments was amongst the largest in the
11:341:28221:9:0:71:211:68:10:Times:10:Times:F:entire population of Swedish firms.
12:342:28257:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:average (median) exposure-to-assets amounted to 3.9 (2.0) percent. Not all of these firms were
12:343:28351:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:affected by the bankruptcy; while 489 firms incurred a loss, 116 firms were fully compensated
12:344:28444:22:21:72:525:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:by their banks.6However,  all of Panaxia’s customers were potentially exposed to the fraud
12:345:28534:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading up to the bankruptcy and suffered from temporary,  but recurring liquidity shortfalls.
12:346:28628:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:These exposures—the fraud and the failure—constitute an event period, or shock, which we
12:347:28716:22:21:72:505:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:make use of to establish a causal impact of liquidity losses on firms liquidity management.
12:348:28807:21:22:89:525:578:12:Times:12:Times:A:Furthermore, in the Panaxia analysis, we also make use of a data set provided by UC on
12:349:28893:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:applications for issuance of injunctions for settlement of overdue trade credit claims.  These
12:350:28987:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:data were originally collected by the Swedish Enforcement Agency, which provides legal sup-
12:351:29078:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:port to trade creditors (suppliers) for the management of their unsettled trade credit claims. For
12:352:29176:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:the period 2008Q1—2013Q1, we observe, at a daily frequency, the universe of submitted ap-
12:353:29265:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:plications for issuance of injunctions by all Swedish suppliers.  Moreover, for a shorter period
12:354:29361:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:2010Q1–2013Q1, we observe all Swedish corporate customers that are subject to applications
12:355:29451:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:for issuance of injunctions, also at a daily frequency.  These data enable an evaluation of shifts
12:356:29549:22:44:72:394:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:in trade credit repayment behavior, both upstream and downstream.
12:357:29614:44:30:72:160:360:14:Times:14:Times:C:2.3    U.S. data
12:358:29630:30:22:72:526:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:Our sample of American firms consists of all firms that appear in Compustat at some point be-
12:359:29723:22:21:72:525:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:tween January 1,1989, and December31,2013, subject to the following restrictions.  Firstly,
12:360:29814:21:22:71:525:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:we exclude all firm-years for which total assets or sales are not strictly positive; cash holdings
12:361:29912:22:22:71:525:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:are larger than total assets; and annual sales or asset growth is larger than 100 percent.  Sec-
12:362:30008:22:21:71:525:243:12:Times:12:Times:B:ondly, we exclude financial firms (NAICS codes beginning with 52) and utilities (NAICS codes
12:363:30100:21:22:71:515:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:beginning with 22). Finally, we restrict the sample to firms incorporated in the United States.
12:364:30195:22:22:89:525:200:12:Times:12:Times:A:As for the Swedish sample, we avoid detrimental effects from outlier observations by win-
12:365:30284:22:18:71:525:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:sorizing all firm-specific variables with respect to the 1stand the 99thpercentiles.  In addition,
12:366:30382:18:13:85:525:160:7:Times:10:Times:F:6From the bankruptcy trustee we obtained a list of firms with outstanding claims on Panaxia at the time of the
12:367:30492:13:10:71:525:147:10:Times:10:Times:F:bankruptcy.  The list contained the names of the customers and the size of the outstanding claims.  To be able to
12:368:30605:10:10:71:525:137:10:Times:10:Times:F:match these firms with the accounting data, we obtained the organization numbers from name searches in the Re-
12:369:30715:10:10:71:525:127:10:Times:10:Times:F:triever Business data base (the legal names for Swedish corporate firms are unique, which enables an unambiguous
12:370:30827:10:10:71:525:117:10:Times:10:Times:F:matching). This matching resulted in a comprehensive coverage. For one particular case, we only observe the sum
12:371:30938:10:10:71:525:107:10:Times:10:Times:F:of the claims held by a group of 231 franchise firms belonging to the same franchisor (the Reitan Group). For these
12:372:31053:10:10:71:525:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:franchise firms, we backed out the Panaxia-related losses from their yearly accounting statements.  Moreover, the
12:373:31166:10:10:71:525:87:10:Times:10:Times:F:four banks provided information on names, organization numbers, and outstanding claims for the firms that they
12:374:31276:10:0:71:271:77:10:Times:10:Times:F:compensated for losses in the Panaxia bankruptcy.
13:375:31327:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:we drop firm-years that lack necessary data points for one or several of our specifications. This
13:376:31424:22:45:72:470:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:leaves us with a sample of 9,497 firms and a total of 74,235 firm-year observations.
13:377:31508:45:29:72:229:641:14:Times:14:Times:C:2.4    Descriptive statistics
13:378:31537:29:22:72:526:612:12:Times:12:Times:B:Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the variables of the two main data sets underlying this
13:379:31636:22:22:72:526:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:paper. It is quite striking how the firm size distributions differ between the sets; Swedish firms
13:380:31734:22:21:72:526:568:12:Times:12:Times:B:are substantially smaller than the U.S. counterparties. U.S. firms’ cash holdings are smaller, pos-
13:381:31833:21:22:72:526:547:12:Times:12:Times:B:sibly reflecting an economy of scale effect in firm cash management. Distributions for accounts
13:382:31928:22:22:72:526:525:12:Times:12:Times:B:payable are similar, with means at 12 and 11 percent for Swedish and U.S. firms, respectively.
13:383:32022:22:21:72:526:503:12:Times:12:Times:B:Likewise, the accounts receivable variables are also close; although Swedish firms on average
13:384:32115:21:22:72:526:482:12:Times:12:Times:B:extend marginally more trade credit to sales than do U.S. firms.  Finally, despite the huge dif-
13:385:32211:22:22:72:526:460:12:Times:12:Times:B:ferences in firm size across the two data sets, the percentiles of returns on assets are remarkably
13:386:32310:22:21:72:526:438:12:Times:12:Times:B:close, with median values around 7 to 8 percent, although on average Swedish firms are slightly
13:387:32405:21:22:72:526:417:12:Times:12:Times:B:more profitable.  Hence, our empirical evaluation will cover the spectrum from small private
13:388:32497:22:22:72:526:395:12:Times:12:Times:B:Swedish firms to large public U.S. firms, enabling findings that are general and not country-,
13:389:32591:22:34:72:153:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:nor size-specific.

13:393:32757:22:21:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:work similar to that of Asdrubali, Sorensen, and Yosha (1996) and quantify the contributions
13:394:32849:21:22:72:526:210:12:Times:12:Times:B:from the components on firms’ balance sheets—with a focus on cash holdings and trade credit
13:395:32940:22:22:72:290:188:12:Times:8:Times:B:positions—to manage shortfalls in cash flow.7
13:396:32985:22:21:89:525:166:12:Times:12:Times:A:The framework is constructed as follows. We split a firm’s balance sheet into six parts. On
13:397:33076:21:22:72:526:145:12:Times:12:Times:B:the asset side, we consider cash holdings, accounts receivable, and other assets. The component
13:398:33171:22:18:72:526:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:labeled other assets is defined as total assets minus cash holdings and receivables, thus including
13:399:33270:18:14:85:525:105:7:Times:10:Times:F:7This variance decomposition approach has been widely used.  On the household side, Townsend and Sam-
13:400:33371:14:10:72:526:91:10:Times:10:Times:F:phantharak (2009) use, based on the household budget identity, a version of the approach to decompose variation
13:401:33482:10:9:72:526:81:10:Times:10:Times:F:in consumption and investment deficits.  On the corporate side, Khanna and Yafeh (2005) provide an application
13:402:33592:9:0:72:315:72:10:Times:10:Times:F:towards measurement of risk sharing within business groups.
14:403:33653:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:items such as, e.g., fixed assets and inventories. On the liability side, we have accounts payable,
14:404:33752:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:total liabilities (defined as liabilities excluding payables), and equity. According to the inherent
14:405:33852:22:21:72:525:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:logic of the balance sheet identity, a given cash flow outcome in yeartmust yield adjustments
14:406:33945:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the six balance sheet components such that the asset and liability balance is preserved.  To
14:407:34040:22:32:72:329:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:illustrate this, we will consider the following identity:
14:408:34097:32:32:72:359:589:12:Times:12:g_d0_f6:B:(1)S-B1+B2+:::+B6;

14:414:34546:22:22:89:525:449:12:Times:12:Times:A:By demeaning the components—eS=S-Sand~Bi=Bi-Bi—in Eq. (1), and multiplying

14:428:34803:32:21:71:525:278:12:Times:12:Times:B:Hence, the variation in cash flow shortfalls is decomposed into the sum of co-movements be-
14:429:34894:21:22:71:525:257:12:Times:12:Times:B:tween cash flow shortfalls and each of the six balance sheet components.  Our estimate of the

14:432:35168:21:18:71:525:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:signed to the equity component,B6.10The balance sheet components are constructed so that a
14:433:35258:18:14:85:525:174:7:Times:10:g_d0_f12:F:8The  variables  are  defined  as  follows:S=-Cash flow;B1=-(Casht-Casht-1);B2=
14:434:35337:14:11:72:525:160:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:-(Receivablest-Receivablest-1);B3=-(Otherassetst-Otherassetst-1);B4=Payablest-

14:436:35508:10:10:72:525:139:10:Times:10:Times:F:defined asEBITDAminus taxes, interest expenses, and depreciations and amortizations; and changes in equity
14:437:35614:10:10:72:526:129:10:Times:10:Times:F:correspond to the flows of dividend payments, stock issuance and repurchases, shareholder contributions, and other
14:438:35728:10:7:72:287:119:10:Times:10:Times:F:components in the equity section of the balance sheet.
14:439:35782:7:13:85:525:112:7:Times:10:Times:F:9Correspondingly, a negativeS—positive cash flow—equals the sum of:increasesin the asset components
14:440:35881:13:10:72:525:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:cash  holdingsB1,  accounts  receivableB2,  and  other  assetsB3;  and  ofdecreasesin  the  liability  components
14:441:35994:10:8:72:274:89:10:Times:10:Times:F:accounts payableB4, liabilitiesB5, and equityB6.
14:442:36042:8:13:82:525:81:7:Times:10:g_d0_f12:F:10Consequently, we can estimate the contribution of the equity component by regressing(S-B1-B2-:::-B5)
14:443:36144:13:0:72:93:68:10:Times:10:Times:F:onS.

15:447:36286:29:22:72:526:612:12:Times:12:Times:B:Our results on decomposition of firm-level cash flow shortfall variation are summarized in Table
15:448:36382:22:22:72:526:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:2. The table shows estimates for the balance sheet components in Eq. (3), based on the Swedish
15:449:36476:22:21:72:526:568:12:Times:12:Times:B:and U.S. samples.  We have constructed the balance sheet components so that positive coeffi-
15:450:36568:21:22:72:526:547:12:Times:12:Times:B:cients for the components on the asset side indicate that cash flow shortfalls are associated with
15:451:36666:22:22:72:526:525:12:Times:12:Times:B:downward adjustments in these variables, e.g., reduced cash holdings; and positive coefficients
15:452:36761:22:21:72:526:503:12:Times:12:Times:B:for the components on the liability side indicate that declines in cash flow are associated with
15:453:36857:21:22:72:269:482:12:Times:12:Times:B:upward adjustments, e.g., increased debt.
15:454:36898:22:22:89:525:460:12:Times:12:Times:A:Following Townsend and Samphantharak (2009), we start by applying an approach where
15:455:36981:22:21:72:526:438:12:Times:12:Times:B:the contribution of each component is estimated in time series regressions at the firm-level, thus
15:456:37079:21:22:72:526:417:12:Times:12:Times:B:yielding firm-individual estimates for each balance sheet component.   Columns (I) and (IV)
15:457:37170:22:22:72:526:395:12:Times:12:Times:B:report quartiles in the empirical distributions of the coefficients for the six balance sheet com-
15:458:37268:22:21:72:526:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:ponents, for the Swedish and U.S. firms, respectively.  For Swedish firms, on the asset side,
15:459:37361:21:22:72:526:352:12:Times:12:Times:B:the results show that cash flow shortfalls mainly appear to be associated with decreases in cash
15:460:37457:22:22:72:526:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings and in other assets; the medians show a reduction in cash by 17.7 percent and other
15:461:37549:22:21:72:526:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:assets by 14.6 percent. On the liability side, Swedish firms primarily increase equity, 18.9 per-
15:462:37646:21:22:72:526:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:cent at the median. Looking at the upper quartile draws attention on the asset side to decreases
15:463:37742:22:22:72:526:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:in other assets, while the lower quartile with negative signs reminds us that many balance sheet
15:464:37838:22:21:72:526:243:12:Times:12:Times:B:movements are codetermined in potentially complicated stratetgies.  On the liability side the
15:465:37931:21:22:72:526:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:upper quartile is also reflecting increasing liabilities.  The effects for accounts receivable and
15:466:38029:22:22:72:526:200:12:Times:12:Times:B:payable are miniscule.  Turning to U.S. firms, on the assets side, the estimates show that cash
15:467:38124:22:21:72:526:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:flow shortfalls are associated with reductions in cash, receivables, and in particular other assets.
15:468:38224:21:22:72:526:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:Whereas, on the liability side, cash flow shortfalls are associated increases in equity inflows and,
15:469:38324:22:22:72:526:135:12:Times:12:Times:B:with a negative sign, decreases in payables and liabilities. Judging from the latter, payables and
15:470:38422:22:34:72:419:113:12:Times:12:Times:B:liabilities are not used for handling of cash flow shortfalls for U.S. firms.
15:471:38499:34:0:234:364:79:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Table 2 about here.]
16:472:38529:0:22:89:525:708:12:Times:12:Times:A:We proceed to estimate average—across firms and over time—contributions for the balance
16:473:38616:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:sheet  components  on  the  basis  of  pooled  firm-  and  year-fixed  effects  regressions.   Columns
16:474:38718:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:(II) and (V) report results for the Swedish and the U.S. sample, respectively.  For the Swedish
16:475:38813:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms, cash flow shortfalls are associated with decreases in other assets and increases in equity.
16:476:38911:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:The estimates for U.S. firms are slightly different from the Swedish ones.  Cash flow shortfalls
16:477:39007:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:are associated with decreases in all the asset components;  and increases in equity.  Counter-
16:478:39101:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:intuitively we note significant reductions in accounts payable and liabilities for positive cash
16:479:39197:22:22:72:248:556:12:Times:8:Times:B:flow shortfalls, with negative signs.11
16:480:39236:22:21:89:525:534:12:Times:12:Times:A:Regressing units of cash flow shortfalls on unit changes in the balance sheet components
16:481:39324:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:may result in estimates that pre-dominantly reflect regularities of the largest firms in the sam-
16:482:39421:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:ple.  That is, in terms of units of SEK, or USD, large firms—by simply being large—will tend
16:483:39513:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:to record large amounts of cash flow shortfalls and large changes in their balance sheet compo-
16:484:39608:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:nents, and therefore greatly influence the estimated slope coefficients.  One way to control for
16:485:39704:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:heterogeneity in firm size is to the scale the variables by firms’ total assets. To this end, Columns
16:486:39805:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:(III) and (VI) report variance decomposition results where all variables are scaled by assets in
16:487:39901:21:22:72:525:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:yeart-1.  The coefficients for Swedish firms show that cash, receivables and liabilities play
16:488:39994:22:22:71:525:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:more prominent roles, when controlling for the size of the firms.  Thus, the cash flow variation
16:489:40090:22:21:71:525:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:is associated with a 36 percent adjustment in cash holdings, 14 percent in accounts receivable,
16:490:40185:21:22:71:525:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:and 5.3 percent in liabilities.  Accounts payable has a small—but significant—negative coeffi-
16:491:40279:22:22:71:525:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:cient, suggesting perhaps that, increases in cash flow shortfalls are associated with reductions in
16:492:40378:22:21:71:525:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:payables, which very well could reflect shifts in demand conditions in the supply chain. That is,
16:493:40475:21:22:71:525:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms facing declines in demand, reduce their input purchases, which yield a reduction in their
16:494:40570:22:22:71:525:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:account payables.  Moreover, the results are overall similar for U.S. firms, with the exceptions
16:495:40666:22:22:71:480:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:that cash holdings exhibit substantially smaller and equity substantially larger effects.
16:496:40755:22:21:89:525:187:12:Times:12:Times:A:Taken  together,  the  coefficients  for  our  three  key  objects  provide  slightly  mixed  results
16:497:40856:21:22:71:525:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:across the two samples.  Swedish firms may rely on cash to manage cash flow shortfalls,  or
16:498:40947:22:22:71:525:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:at least that is an interpretation, whereas U.S. firms, on the other hand, appear to rely less on
16:499:41044:22:18:71:525:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash in response to cash flow shortfalls.  For the two trade credit margins, we see that receiv-

17:503:41408:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:ables exhibits positive and payables negative associative properties for both the Swedish and
17:504:41501:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:U.S. firms.  However, it is important to note that causal interpretations of these results are un-
17:505:41599:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:warranted. That is, cash flow shortfalls may well reflect shifts in demand and supply conditions
17:506:41695:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the supply-chain—rather than increased liquidity needs—which could affect the amounts of
17:507:41786:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:drawn and issued trade credit in a fashion unrelated to liquidity management.  Suppose a firm
17:508:41879:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:is experiencing a shortfall in cash flow due to a sudden drop in demand for its output.  It is
17:509:41973:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:conceivable that in response the firm may want to cut down on input purchases, which will be
17:510:42065:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:reflected as a decrease in accounts payable, to match a lower output level.  We therefore pro-
17:511:42159:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:ceed to the second part of the empirical analysis, where we gauge the impact of a plausibly
17:512:42250:21:52:72:395:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:exogenous liquidity shock on firms’ cash and trade credit positions.

17:520:42771:30:22:72:526:266:12:Times:12:Times:B:As noted in our discussion above, cash flow shortfalls are invariably associated with changes in
17:521:42867:22:21:72:526:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:the demand and supply conditions that prevail for firms’ operations, and will consequentially
17:522:42960:21:22:72:526:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:contain elements of an endogenous nature.  It is therefore warranted to challenge and qualify
17:523:43053:22:22:72:526:201:12:Times:12:Times:B:results obtained for cash flow shortfalls by replacing these with a liquidity shock that is con-
17:524:43149:22:21:72:526:179:12:Times:12:Times:B:ceivably exogenous with respect to demand and supply conditions in the supply-chain. To this
17:525:43241:21:22:72:526:158:12:Times:12:Times:B:end, we will examine the shifts in cash holdings and trade credit positions for firms that suf-
17:526:43336:22:22:72:526:136:12:Times:12:Times:B:fered liquidity losses—temporary and permanent—in connection with the fraud and subsequent
17:527:43426:22:21:72:435:114:12:Times:12:Times:B:failure of the Swedish cash-in-transit firm Panaxia in the period 2010–2012.
17:528:43502:21:22:89:525:93:12:Times:12:Times:A:Panaxia’s fraudulent scheme and failure is assumed to have negatively affected its corpo-
17:529:43591:22:0:72:526:71:12:Times:12:Times:B:rate clients—the treated firms.  We calculate the average treatment effect for the treated firms
18:530:43689:0:22:72:525:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:(ATT) on the set of variables of interest, using a nearest-neighbor matching estimator proposed
18:531:43784:22:22:71:525:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:by Abadie and Imbens (2006).  The treatment period is taken to be 2010–2012; since Panaxia
18:532:43874:22:21:71:525:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:began its practice to postpone payments in early 2010 and then failed about 30 months later in
18:533:43968:21:22:71:525:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:September 2012. The nearest-neighbor matching ensures that we compare outcomes for treated
18:534:44058:22:22:71:525:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms with outcomes for otherwise similar control firms. Each treated firm is matched with one
18:535:44152:22:21:71:525:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:control firm, using a set of matching variables comprising firm-specific characteristics and a
18:536:44246:21:22:71:525:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:five-digit industry classifier.12We select our matching variables based on covariates that are
18:537:44340:22:22:71:525:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:commonly  used  as  control  variables  in  the  literatures  on  cash  holdings  and  on  trade  credit.
18:538:44445:22:21:71:525:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  selected  set  of  matching  variables  is:  cash  flow-to-assets;  log  of  assets;  sales  growth;
18:539:44550:21:22:71:525:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:debt-to-assets; tangible assets-to-assets;  inventories-to-assets; log of firm age; cash-to-assets;
18:540:44649:22:22:71:525:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:payables-to-assets;  and receivables-to-assets.  The matching is performed with respect to the
18:541:44743:22:21:71:525:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:2009-outcomes of the matching variables.  To ensure parallel pre-treatment event trends,  we
18:542:44835:21:22:71:512:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:also match on 2008-outcomes of cash-to-assets, payables-to-assets, and receivables-to-sales.
18:543:44927:22:22:89:525:426:12:Times:12:Times:A:Our aim is to gauge impacts of postponed payments, and subsequent losses, on treated firms.
18:544:45018:22:21:71:525:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:For this purpose, we consider the following difference-in-difference estimator of yearly adjust-
18:545:45114:21:22:71:525:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:ments  in  the  treatment  and  post-treatment  periods  for  the  outcome  variablesCash=Assets,
18:546:45211:22:29:71:284:361:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:B:Payables=Assets, andReceivables=Sales:
18:547:45249:29:28:71:417:332:12:Times:12:g_d0_f6:B:(4)-yt= (-yT reatedt--yT reatedt-1)-(-yControlt--yControlt-1);
18:548:45311:28:22:72:525:304:12:Times:12:Times:B:where-yT reatedi;tis the mean of an outcome variable for the treated firms in yeartand-yControli;tis
18:549:45411:22:22:72:525:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:the mean of the same outcome variable for the matched control firms in yeart.13We calculate
18:550:45502:22:21:72:526:260:12:Times:12:Times:B:the yearly adjustments for the treatment period 2010–2012, and for the post-treatment period
18:551:45594:21:22:72:526:239:12:Times:12:Times:B:2013.  In addition to yearly adjustments, we also calculate difference-in-difference estimators
18:552:45689:22:29:72:504:217:12:Times:12:Times:B:of cumulative adjustments over multiple years for the treatment and post-treatment period:
18:553:45779:29:28:72:418:188:12:Times:12:g_d0_f6:B:(5)Tyt= (-yT reatedt--yT reated2009)-(-yControlt--yControl2009):
18:554:45843:28:22:89:525:160:12:Times:12:Times:A:The estimators of yearly and cumulative adjustments offer causal insights on how liquidity
18:555:45933:22:16:72:526:138:12:Times:12:Times:B:shortfalls affect firms’ cash-to-assets, payables-to-assets, and receivables-to-sales.  Moreover,
18:556:46030:16:14:82:525:122:7:Times:10:Times:F:12We apply the following matching model specification. Firstly, the Mahalanobis weighting matrix is selected to
18:557:46141:14:10:72:526:108:10:Times:10:Times:F:control for the differences in scale between the matching variables. Secondly, we use matching with replacement,
18:558:46253:10:10:72:526:98:10:Times:10:Times:F:which implies that a given control firm can potentially be matched to multiple treated firms.  To ensure correct
18:559:46365:10:7:72:295:88:10:Times:10:Times:F:inference, standard errors are clustered at the firm-level.
18:560:46424:7:13:82:525:81:7:Times:10:Times:F:13Relating payables to assets and receivables to sales is a common convention in the trade credit literature, see,
18:561:46538:13:0:72:199:68:10:Times:10:Times:F:e.g., Petersen and Rajan (1997).
19:562:46572:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:we further explore the underlying mechanisms of adjustments in payables and receivables by
19:563:46662:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:considering outcome variables related to overdue trade credit payments—both upstream and
19:564:46750:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:downstream.  To this end, we use data from the Swedish Enforcement Agency on applications
19:565:46839:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:for the issuance of an injunction to settlement of outstanding claims.  These data provide an
19:566:46932:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:opportunity to assess whether the treated firms to a larger extent than the control firms delayed
19:567:47029:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:payments to suppliers, i.e., upstream adjustments. In other words, upstream firms submitted an
19:568:47123:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:application for issuance of an injunction to recover late payments. Also, we can assess whether
19:569:47218:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:the treated firms to a greater extent than control firms,  submitted applications for injunction
19:570:47314:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:issuance, i.e., downstream adjustments. In other words, if treated firms tried to recover delayed
19:571:47411:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:payments more quickly.  Finally, we examine magnitudes in effects, conditional on the size of
19:572:47504:22:44:72:395:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:the liquidity losses incurred; to be discussed in greater detail below.
19:573:47575:44:30:72:467:447:14:Times:14:Times:C:4.2    Sample compositions for treated and matched control firms
19:574:47639:30:22:72:526:417:12:Times:12:Times:B:Descriptive statistics for the matching variables are reported in Table 3. The table shows that the
19:575:47738:22:21:72:526:395:12:Times:12:Times:B:treated and matched control firms exhibit characteristics that are quite similar, which warrants
19:576:47834:21:22:72:526:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:the quality of the matching.   The only dimension in which the treated and control firms are
19:577:47926:22:22:72:526:352:12:Times:12:Times:B:significantly different in means is receivables-to-sales, whereas debt-to-asset ratios also differ
19:578:48024:22:21:72:526:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:significantly  according  to  the  median  test.   To  ensure  that  our  results  are  not  influenced  by
19:579:48131:21:22:72:526:309:12:Times:12:Times:B:pre-treatment differences between the treated and control firms, we complement our baseline
19:580:48222:22:34:72:526:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates using the bias-corrected matching estimators proposed by Abadie and Imbens (2011).
19:581:48314:34:34:234:364:253:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Table 3 about here.]
19:582:48342:34:21:89:525:219:12:Times:12:Times:A:Furthermore, Figure 2 shows differences in means between treated and control firms for the
19:583:48432:21:22:72:526:198:12:Times:12:Times:B:three key outcome variables in each year during:  the pre-treatment period (2007–2009); treat-
19:584:48526:22:22:72:526:176:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment period (2010–2012); and post-treatment period (2013). The confidence bands in the figure
19:585:48619:22:21:72:526:154:12:Times:12:Times:B:shows that average cash holdings coincided for treated and control firms in the pre-treatment
19:586:48712:21:22:72:526:133:12:Times:12:Times:B:period. However, in the treatment period we see a downward shift for the difference in average
19:587:48806:22:22:72:526:111:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash holdings, i.e., average cash for treated firms is significantly smaller than average cash for
19:588:48904:22:21:72:526:89:12:Times:12:Times:B:controls. A similar treatment shift, but in the other direction, is observed for accounts payable;
19:589:49002:21:0:72:526:68:12:Times:12:Times:B:differences in averages are insignificant in the pre-treatment period,  followed by an upward
20:590:49097:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:shift during the treatment period.  Consistent with the descriptive statistics in Table 3, the fig-
20:591:49196:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:ure further shows that treated firms held significantly less accounts receivable on average in all
20:592:49294:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:periods.  Nevertheless, the figure displays a distinct downward trend in receivables during the
20:593:49389:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:treatment period, suggesting that treated firms altered their receivables more than control firms
20:594:49486:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:did. Thus, Figure 2 provides initial evidence that treated firms used their cash holdings and trade
20:595:49585:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit margins to overcome the Panaxia liquidity shock. Moreover, one potential concern is that
20:596:49680:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash holdings for treated firms may display a downward trend in the pre-treatment period, and
20:597:49773:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:thereby compromise identification.  We investigate this formally below, and verify that treated
20:598:49868:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:and control firms display trends for the outcome variables in the pre-treatment period that are
20:599:49963:21:35:72:196:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:not significantly different.

20:601:50020:44:30:72:199:434:14:Times:14:Times:C:4.3    Baseline results
20:602:50043:30:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:We now proceed with a presentation of our baseline results.  Table 4 reports estimates of the
20:603:50136:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:yearly and cumulative adjustments according to Equations (4) and (5), for our three key outcome
20:604:50231:22:22:72:525:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables. Panel A shows results for cash holdings,Cash=Assets. The estimates of the yearly
20:605:50322:22:21:72:525:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments effects,-t, in Columns (I) to (IV) show statistically significant reductions in cash
20:606:50418:21:22:72:525:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings in the first two years of the treatment period.   The cumulative effect estimates,Tt,
20:607:50512:22:22:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:show that the yearly declines in cash in 2010-2011 result in persistently lower cash holdings
20:608:50605:22:21:72:526:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the final year of the treatment period and in the post-treatment year.  Columns (V) to (VIII)
20:609:50701:21:22:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:report bias-corrected matching estimators, where differences in the matching variable outcomes
20:610:50795:22:22:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:between treated and control firms are accounted for in the estimation, see Abadie and Imbens
20:611:50887:22:21:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2011). The bias-corrected effects are very similar to the ones reported in Columns (I) to (IV),
20:612:50983:21:22:72:526:188:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggesting that the latter are not confounded by differences in characteristics between the treated
20:613:51082:22:22:72:526:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:and control firms.  In addition, Column (IX) shows test results indicating that the treated and
20:614:51177:22:21:72:526:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:control firms have parallel cash holding trends in the pre-treatment period 2007-2009, which is
20:615:51272:21:18:72:491:123:12:Times:8:Times:B:a sufficient condition for a causal interpretation of the average treatment effect results.14
20:616:51365:18:17:82:525:105:7:Times:10:Times:F:14We apply the test of parallel pre-trends proposed by Mora and Reggio (2015).   More specifically,  for the
20:617:51473:17:0:72:294:88:10:Times:10:g_d0_f12:F:period 2007–2013, we estimate the modelE[yit] =-+

21:625:51749:28:21:89:525:680:12:Times:12:Times:A:Results for accounts payable,Payables=Assets, are reported in Panel B. The estimates of
21:626:51836:21:22:72:525:659:12:Times:12:Times:B:the yearly adjustments effects,-t, reported in Columns (I) to (IV) show an increase in 2011 of
21:627:51930:22:22:72:526:637:12:Times:12:Times:B:1 percentage point and an enhanced increase of 1.8 percentage points in 2012.  These yearly
21:628:52021:22:21:72:525:615:12:Times:12:Times:B:effects result in a cumulative adjustment effects,Tt, of 2.8 percentage points in 2012 and 2.5
21:629:52115:21:22:72:526:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:percentage points in the post-treatment year. Columns (V) to (VIII) show that the results persist
21:630:52212:22:22:72:526:572:12:Times:12:Times:B:for the bias-corrected estimates and Column (IX) indicates that treated and control firms have
21:631:52306:22:21:72:369:550:12:Times:12:Times:B:parallel pre-treatment trends with respect to accounts payable.
21:632:52369:21:22:89:525:529:12:Times:12:Times:A:Panel C reports results for accounts receivable,Receivables=Assets.  The estimates of the
21:633:52458:22:22:72:526:507:12:Times:12:Times:B:yearly  adjustment  effects  point  to  an  initial  contraction  of  0.2  percentage  points  in  the  first
21:634:52567:22:21:72:526:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:year  of  the  treatment  period  and  an  enhanced  contraction  of  0.6  percentage  points  in  2012.
21:635:52671:21:22:72:525:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:Accordingly, the estimates of the cumulative effects,Tt,show that the downward trend in re-
21:636:52762:22:22:72:526:442:12:Times:12:Times:B:ceivables amounts to an accumulated reduction of 0.9 percentage points in 2012, which persists
21:637:52856:22:21:72:525:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the post-treatment year.15The bias-corrected estimators reported in Columns (V) to (VIII)
21:638:52948:21:22:72:526:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:show that treatment effects for receivables are somewhat enhanced, once we account for the
21:639:53038:22:22:72:526:377:12:Times:12:Times:B:slight differences in the amount of issued trade credit between treated and controls in the pre-
21:640:53134:22:21:72:526:355:12:Times:12:Times:B:treatment period, cf. Table 3. Finally, the test for parallel pre-trends in Column (IX) shows that
21:641:53232:21:22:72:254:334:12:Times:12:Times:B:the identifying assumption is fulfilled.
21:642:53272:22:22:89:525:312:12:Times:12:Times:A:The point estimates of the cumulative adjustments in 2012,T2012,  suggest that the mag-
21:643:53359:22:21:71:525:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:nitude of upstream adjustments is larger than that of downstream adjustments.  One obvious
21:644:53449:21:22:71:525:269:12:Times:12:Times:B:concern in a comparison of relative size for the two effects is that payables are scaled with as-
21:645:53546:22:22:71:525:247:12:Times:12:Times:B:sets, whereas receivables are scaled with sales.  Scaling accounts receivable by assets instead,
21:646:53642:22:21:71:525:225:12:Times:12:Times:B:provides a better ground for such a comparison; and in estimation using receivables-to-assets
21:647:53735:21:22:71:525:204:12:Times:12:Times:B:we obtain a cumulative effect (t-value) in 2012,T2012, of-0.010 (-1.8), which is close to the
21:648:53828:22:22:71:525:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimate for sales-scaled receivables of-0.009 (-3.2). A statistical test for the difference in ab-
21:649:53927:22:21:71:525:160:12:Times:12:Times:B:solute adjustment between payables-to-assets and receivables-to-assets, show that adjustments
21:650:54020:21:22:71:525:139:12:Times:12:Times:B:in payables indeed dominate receivables, with ap-value of 0.058.  Furthermore, to gauge the
21:651:54111:22:16:71:525:117:12:Times:12:Times:B:relative importance of cash versus trade credit margins, we can compare the size of compounded
21:652:54205:16:14:82:525:101:7:Times:10:Times:F:15The negative effect on receivables is in line with the findings in Bakke and Whited (2012).  They explore
21:653:54312:14:10:72:526:87:10:Times:10:Times:F:the impact of cash shortfalls triggered by mandatory pension contributions on a wide set of firm characteristics.
21:654:54425:10:9:72:526:77:10:Times:10:Times:F:Consistent with our result, they document that funding violations, causing liquidity shortfalls, are associated with
21:655:54541:9:0:72:211:68:10:Times:10:Times:F:reductions in receivables-to-assets.
22:656:54579:0:22:72:525:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments in net trade credit positions (i.e.,(Payables-Receivables)=Assets) with the size
22:657:54671:22:22:72:525:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:of adjustments in cash holdings.  The estimated cumulative adjustment (t-value) in net trade
22:658:54763:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit in 2012 is 0.037 (3.2). Testing for the difference in absolute adjustment between cash and
22:659:54860:21:22:72:525:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:net trade credit yields ap-value of 0.242, indicating that the adjustments at the two trade credit
22:660:54958:22:22:72:447:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:margins are jointly of a similar magnitude as the adjustments in cash holdings.
22:661:55037:22:21:89:525:599:12:Times:12:Times:A:Although firms clearly make use of both upstream and downstream liquidity extraction—
22:662:55122:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:independently or simultaneously—it is conceivable why operating the accounts payable margin
22:663:55213:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:may provide a more effective measure to raise liquidity and explain why we find that upstream
22:664:55306:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:dominate  downstream adjustments.   Through upstream  adjustments,  firms  can readily  offset
22:665:55400:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:liquidity shocks by immediate postponement of due payments to suppliers, and withhold money
22:666:55491:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:until additional inflows of funds are obtained.  If the amount of liquidity extracted upstream
22:667:55585:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:proves insufficient to offset the shock, the firm may continue to roll over its overdue trade credit
22:668:55685:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:debt until the impact of the original liquidity shock is neutralized.  Intuitively, the ability for
22:669:55784:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms to roll over overdue trade credit debt hinges on their suppliers’ willingness to overlook
22:670:55879:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:late payments, that is, on the absence of obstacles to the functioning of (implicit) risk sharing
22:671:55976:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:networks.  In downstream adjustments, firms can extract liquidity by reducing the trade credit
22:672:56070:22:22:72:526:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:maturities in new contracts to prompt faster future payments from customers. But that will free
22:673:56165:22:21:72:526:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:up liquidity only with a lag. An alternative measure is to proactively manage outstanding claims,
22:674:56262:21:22:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  avoid  late  payments  from  customers.   We  will  shortly  study  these  underlying  adjustment
22:675:56363:22:22:72:321:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:mechanisms closer, both upstream and downstream.
22:676:56411:22:21:89:525:274:12:Times:12:Times:A:To sum up, the baseline results show that the retention of customer funds and the subsequent
22:677:56503:21:22:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:bankruptcy-related losses caused Panaxia’s customers to reduce their cash holdings, increase the
22:678:56599:22:22:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:amount of drawn trade credit from suppliers, and contract the amount of issued trade credit to
22:679:56693:22:22:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:customers.  In terms of magnitudes, the joint impact for the two trade credit margins is on par
22:680:56788:22:21:72:526:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:with adjustments in cash holdings; and upstream trade credit adjustments dominate downstream
22:681:56880:21:45:72:470:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments. Thus, trade credit is an important source of reserve liquidity for firms.
22:682:56966:45:29:72:252:121:14:Times:14:Times:C:4.4    Underlying mechanisms
22:683:56994:29:22:72:526:92:12:Times:12:Times:B:Liquidity shocks cause the observed adjustments in treated firms’ trade credit positions. We will
22:684:57091:22:0:72:526:70:12:Times:12:Times:B:now explore our key presumption for the nature of firms’ behavior underlying these adjustments:
23:685:57188:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:namely, that reserve liquidity is extracted upstream by postponement of trade credit payments to
23:686:57284:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:suppliers, and by enforcing repayment of outstanding debt to customers downstream. Whereas
23:687:57374:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:these two types of actions may well be privately conducted between trade credit parties, they
23:688:57467:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:will ever so often involve a third party, the Swedish Enforcement Agency (Kronofogdemyn-
23:689:57555:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:digheten), and leave behind publicly available records.  The Enforcement Agency offers legal
23:690:57647:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:support to Swedish trade creditors (suppliers) for the management of their unsettled trade credit
23:691:57744:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:claims.  The creditor can submit an application to the Enforcement Agency for the issuance
23:692:57834:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:of an injunction to settlement of the outstanding claim.  If approved, the Enforcement Agency
23:693:57927:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:will then notify the debtor for prompt payment within a fortnight; and take further measures to
23:694:58022:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:enforce payment should the debtor persist in dishonoring the claim after notification. Applying
23:695:58117:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:for an injunction to settlement is normally the creditor’s last resort and typically occurs when a
23:696:58215:22:21:72:425:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:claim has been overdue for an extended period—several weeks, or longer.
23:697:58286:21:22:89:525:448:12:Times:12:Times:A:We have, from the Swedish Enforcement Agency, obtained data on applications for the is-
23:698:58373:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:suance of injunctions to settlement of outstanding claims, submitted by the universe of Swedish
23:699:58468:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:corporate firms. The data include details on the date of submission and the identities of involved
23:700:58566:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:parties so that unambiguous merging with the treated and control firms of the Panaxia event is
23:701:58660:22:22:72:526:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:straight forward. The merged data set provides an opportunity to assess whether treated firms to
23:702:58756:22:21:72:526:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:a greater extent than control firms have been subjects to applications for injunction issuance due
23:703:58854:21:22:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:to unpaid debts, i.e., the upstream perspective. We can also consider the downstream perspective
23:704:58950:22:22:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:and examine whether treated firms to a greater extent than control firms submitted applications
23:705:59045:22:21:72:526:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:for injunction issuance, i.e., took action to enforce repayment of overdue issued debt. The En-
23:706:59140:21:22:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:forcement Agency data are somewhat restricted in that we can observe applications faced by
23:707:59230:22:22:72:526:231:12:Times:12:Times:B:treated and control firms in the full period 2008Q1–2013Q4; whereas applications submitted
23:708:59320:22:22:72:526:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:by treated and control firms are observed in the period 2010Q1–2013Q1, nonetheless providing
23:709:59412:22:21:72:526:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:a full coverage of the treatment period (in which we have aggregated daily observations to a
23:710:59504:21:22:72:148:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:quarterly level).
23:711:59521:22:22:89:525:144:12:Times:12:Times:A:Figure 3 offers graphical illustration of the extensive and intensive margins of applications
23:712:59614:22:21:72:526:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:for injunction to settle overdue payments faced (upper panels) and issued (lower panels) by
23:713:59705:21:22:72:526:101:12:Times:12:Times:B:treated and control firms.  The upper left panel suggests that the fraction of firms that delayed
23:714:59802:22:0:72:526:79:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit payments increased amongst treated relative to control firms; and the upper right
24:715:59898:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:panel shows an even more pronounced divergence, when we account for the number of delayed
24:716:59987:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:payments that resulted in an application. Moreover, the lower left panel shows that the fractions
24:717:60084:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:of treated and control firms that in each quarter acted to enforce payment of overdue debt are
24:718:60178:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:fairly similar over the event period.  However, when considering the number of applications—
24:719:60270:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:the intensive margin—displayed in the lower right panel, we find that treated firms consistently
24:720:60366:22:30:72:516:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:submit more applications in the treatment period, with the exception of one quarter, 2011Q1.
24:721:60458:30:30:231:365:569:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Figure 3 about here.]
24:722:60487:30:21:89:525:539:12:Times:12:Times:A:Table 5 reports estimates of the quarterly changes,-t, and cumulative effects,Tt, for the four
24:723:60581:21:22:71:525:518:12:Times:12:Times:B:measures reported in Figure 3. Given that Panaxia began to withhold its customers’ funds in the
24:724:60676:22:22:71:525:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:second quarter of 2010 (cf. Figure 1), we take the first quarter of 2010 as a pre-treatment quarter,
24:725:60776:22:21:71:525:474:12:Times:12:Times:B:when calculating cumulative effects on applications for injunction due to overdue trade credit.
24:726:60871:21:22:71:525:453:12:Times:12:Times:B:Column (II) shows statistically significant larger cumulative fractions for treated firms facing
24:727:60967:22:22:71:525:431:12:Times:12:Times:B:applications in the quarters 2010Q4, 2011Q1, 2011Q3, 2013Q1 and in 2013Q2.  This pattern
24:728:61055:22:21:71:525:409:12:Times:12:Times:B:is pronounced in Column (IV), where the number of applications due to firms’ overdue debt
24:729:61144:21:22:71:525:388:12:Times:12:Times:B:is considered; significantly more applications for treated firms now occur in two out of three
24:730:61238:22:22:71:525:366:12:Times:12:Times:B:quarters in the event period. The tests of parallel pre-trends indicate no significant differences in
24:731:61339:22:21:71:525:344:12:Times:12:Times:B:trends between treated and control firms in the outcome variables prior to the event. Thus, these
24:732:61436:21:22:71:525:323:12:Times:12:Times:B:results suggest that late payments are indeed one driver of the increase in payables documented
24:733:61531:22:30:71:202:301:12:Times:12:Times:B:in Table 4 for treated firms.
24:734:61560:30:30:234:364:271:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Table 5 about here.]
24:735:61588:30:22:89:525:241:12:Times:12:Times:A:Moreover,  Columns (V) and (VI) show results for the differences in fractions of treated
24:736:61676:22:21:71:525:219:12:Times:12:Times:B:and control firms that in a given quarter attempt enforcement of settlement with non-paying
24:737:61767:21:22:71:525:198:12:Times:12:Times:B:customers.  Largely,  no significant effects occur at this margin,  except a slight increase of 2
24:738:61864:22:22:71:525:176:12:Times:12:Times:B:percentage points for treated firms in the last quarter of 2011.  However, when considering the
24:739:61959:22:21:71:525:154:12:Times:12:Times:B:intensive margin and the number of applications submitted,  according to Column (VIII), we
24:740:62049:21:22:71:525:133:12:Times:12:Times:B:see that the cumulative measures in quarters 2011Q4 and 2012Q2 are significant, and estimated
24:741:62142:22:22:71:505:111:12:Times:12:Times:B:effects are substantial—albeit not significant—in several other quarters in the event period.
24:742:62235:22:21:89:525:89:12:Times:12:Times:A:To sum up,  this sub-section has demonstrated,  or shed light,  on how firms’ adjustments
24:743:62324:21:0:71:525:68:12:Times:12:Times:B:of their trade credit positions are played out.  Upstream, we find that more treated firms than
25:744:62421:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:control firms are inclined to postpone trade credit payments when we evaluate at the extensive
25:745:62515:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:margin. We find even stronger effects pointing to delinquency behavior for treated firms, when
25:746:62609:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:we  measure  at  the  intensive  margin.   Adjustments  of  accounts  receivable—the  downstream
25:747:62705:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:perspective—which was found to be more moderately used in firms’ liquidity management in
25:748:62793:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:Table 4, is also associated with weaker evidence of firms actively trying to enforce payment
25:749:62885:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:from stalling customers.  However, at the intensive margin, we find that treated firms in two
25:750:62978:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:quarters submit a significantly larger number of applications for injunction. Hence, adjustments
25:751:63074:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  trade  credit  positions  in  the  course  of  firms  dealing  with  liquidity  shocks  are  associated
25:752:63181:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:with  extension  and  contraction  of  credit  in  the  time  dimension,  in  the  up-  and  downstream
25:753:63284:21:45:72:196:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:perspectives, respectively.
25:754:63311:45:30:72:311:468:14:Times:14:Times:C:4.5    Responses conditional on loss-size
25:755:63352:30:21:72:526:438:12:Times:12:Times:B:Magnitudes of adjustments in cash and at the trade credit margins should depend positively
25:756:63442:21:22:72:526:417:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  the  sizes  of  firms’  incurred  losses  in  the  Panaxia  failure.   That  is,  whereas  the  fraud  in
25:757:63551:22:22:72:526:395:12:Times:12:Times:B:postponing transfers of funds to client accounts is certainly expected to have a negative impact
25:758:63647:22:21:72:526:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:on firms’ liquidity positions, the point-in-time realization of a large loss when Panaxia finally
25:759:63744:21:22:72:526:352:12:Times:12:Times:B:went  bankrupt  should  yield  a  larger  negative  and  more  persistent  impact.   This  conceivable
25:760:63846:22:22:72:526:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:conjecture will be examined next and we will consider two cases:  firstly, firms that incurred
25:761:63940:22:21:72:526:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:losses versus no losses; and secondly, incurring firms’ responses conditional on the size of their
25:762:64038:21:22:72:526:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:losses.   For the first case we divide the treated firms into two groups:  firms that were fully
25:763:64134:22:22:72:526:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:compensated by their bank in 2012; and firms that incurred losses in 2012.  Thus, the firms in
25:764:64228:22:21:72:526:243:12:Times:12:Times:B:the two groups experienced the same fraud treatment in 2010 and 2011—delayed payments—
25:765:64314:21:22:72:526:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:but a differential treatment in the bankruptcy year 2012. For the second case we will leave out

25:767:64431:22:21:89:525:178:12:Times:12:Times:A:Table  6  reports  results  for  the  two  groups;  Columns  (I)  to  (V)  correspond  to  the  group
25:768:64532:21:22:72:526:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:of treated firms that were fully compensated in 2012 and Columns (VI) to (X) correspond to
25:769:64622:22:22:72:526:135:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  group  of  treated  firms  that  incurred  losses  in  2012.   The  results  for  the  former  show  a
25:770:64729:22:21:72:526:113:12:Times:12:Times:B:downward shift in the firms’ cash holdings in 2011 and a subsequent reversal in 2012, so that
25:771:64822:21:22:72:526:92:12:Times:12:Times:B:the estimated cumulative cash effect that year is not significantly different from zero. A similar
25:772:64920:22:0:72:526:70:12:Times:12:Times:B:pattern is observed for accounts payable, where the cumulative adjustments indicate an increase
26:773:65017:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  2011,  followed  by  an  insignificant  accumulated  effect  in  2012.   The  results  for  accounts
26:774:65121:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:receivable show that a temporary downward adjustment occurred in 2012;  but the estimates
26:775:65210:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the cumulative effects are insignificant throughout the treatment and post-treatment periods,
26:776:65306:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:indicating that these firms did not make any significant adjustments in the amount of issued
26:777:65398:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit as compared with the positions held in 2009.  Shifting now to the results for firms
26:778:65494:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:that did incur losses when Panaxia failed in 2012, we find that adjustments in cash holdings and
26:779:65590:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit positions persist in 2012 and in the post-treatment year.  Thus, the results in Table
26:780:65688:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:6 suggest that the postponement fraud underlies the observed adjustments in the first two years
26:781:65783:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the treatment period and applies to both groups of firms, whereas the existence of failure
26:782:65876:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:losses caused the adjustments to persist, or even increase, in the last treatment year and in the
26:783:65973:22:35:72:167:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:post-treatment year.
26:784:65993:35:34:234:364:456:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Table 6 about here.]
26:785:66021:34:22:89:525:422:12:Times:12:Times:A:For the sub-sample of firms that incurred losses in 2012,  we can deepen the analysis by
26:786:66109:22:22:72:525:400:12:Times:12:Times:B:evaluating whether the size of the adjustment depends on the size of the loss.16We do this by
26:787:66202:22:21:72:526:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimating the cumulative adjustment effect between 2009 and 2012, conditional on the size of
26:788:66295:21:22:72:525:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:the loss.17Columns (I) in Table 7 shows an insignificant relationship between the size of a loss
26:789:66391:22:22:72:526:335:12:Times:12:Times:B:and associated adjustment in cash holdings, whereas Columns (II) and (III) show that larger
26:790:66482:22:21:72:526:313:12:Times:12:Times:B:losses are associated with significantly larger increases in payables as well as larger decreases
26:791:66579:21:22:72:526:292:12:Times:12:Times:B:in receivables, in the statistical sense. These results indicate that the trade credit margins indeed
26:792:66680:22:22:72:526:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:played an important role in absorbing the impact of the incurred losses and the larger the loss,
26:793:66776:22:34:72:243:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:the larger are resulting adjustments.

27:803:67379:34:22:72:526:674:12:Times:12:Times:B:In  the  final  step  of  the  empirical  analysis,  we  introduce  a  set  of  conditional  models  geared
27:804:67486:22:22:72:526:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:towards capturing the responses to liquidity distress measured by cash flow shortfalls, and es-
27:805:67581:22:22:72:526:630:12:Times:12:Times:B:timated on the full Swedish and U.S. samples.  The purpose of the analyses in this section is
27:806:67674:22:21:72:526:608:12:Times:12:Times:B:twofold. Firstly, we structure the empirical evaluation to seek external validity for the results in
27:807:67774:21:22:72:526:587:12:Times:12:Times:B:the previous section, by quantifying the impacts of cash flow shortfalls on the liquidity positions,
27:808:67874:22:22:72:526:565:12:Times:12:Times:B:while controlling for a host of factors that may otherwise matter for firms’ cash and trade credit
27:809:67972:22:21:72:526:543:12:Times:12:Times:B:positions, such as demand fluctuations in the supply-chain, growth prospects, investment and
27:810:68064:21:22:72:526:522:12:Times:12:Times:B:debt financing. If results for cash flow shortfalls and the Panaxia liquidity shocks come through
27:811:68161:22:22:72:526:500:12:Times:12:Times:B:in broadly similar ways for Swedish firms, we may then infer that the conditional analysis of
27:812:68254:22:21:72:526:478:12:Times:12:Times:B:this section gives results which are substantially similar to the Panaxia experiment,  i.e.,  that
27:813:68352:21:22:72:526:457:12:Times:12:Times:B:endogeneity concerns for cash flow shortfalls here are not overwhelming for our purposes.  In
27:814:68445:22:22:72:526:435:12:Times:12:Times:B:other words, cash flow shortfalls can be taken to reasonably well approximate exogenous liq-
27:815:68537:22:21:72:526:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:uidity shocks in the current context. As a next step, we can then cautiously interpret differences
27:816:68635:21:22:72:526:392:12:Times:12:Times:B:and similarities between Sweden and the U.S.. Secondly, this modelling approach—conducted
27:817:68724:22:22:72:526:370:12:Times:12:Times:B:on large samples—provides a suitable framework for examining cross-sectional heterogeneity
27:818:68814:22:21:72:526:348:12:Times:12:Times:B:in firm- and industry-characteristics for the impacts of cash flow shortfalls on firms’ liquidity
27:819:68911:21:34:72:340:327:12:Times:12:Times:B:management. Our model-specifications are on the form:
27:820:68964:34:33:72:453:293:12:Times:12:g_d0_f6:B:(6)-yi;t=\rShortfalli;t+-Sales growthi;t+-Xi;t+I-i;t+"i;t;

27:823:69192:22:21:72:525:216:12:Times:12:Times:B:of firm-characteristics; and-i;tis a vector of firm- and time-fixed effects.  The vector of firm-
27:824:69289:21:22:72:525:195:12:Times:12:Times:B:characteristics,Xi;t, includes a set of control variables that is commonly used in the corporate
27:825:69385:22:22:72:525:173:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash literature.18Controlling for sales growth is a key feature of the model. That is, the results
27:826:69483:22:21:72:526:151:12:Times:12:Times:B:for payables and receivables presented in the variance decomposition analysis may very well
27:827:69574:21:19:72:526:130:12:Times:12:Times:B:reflect shifts in demand conditions in the supply-chain rather than responses due to changing
27:828:69667:19:13:82:525:111:7:Times:10:Times:F:18The set of firm-characteristics mimic that of Eq. (9) in Almeida et al. (2004), including: the natural logarithm
27:829:69781:13:11:72:525:98:10:Times:10:Times:F:of total assets (Sizei;t);  capital expenditures (Expendituresi;t);  changes in non-cash and non-trade credit net
27:830:69894:11:11:72:525:87:10:Times:10:Times:F:working capital (-NWCi;t); and changes in non-accounts payable short term debt (-ShortDebti;t). For the U.S.
27:831:70002:11:0:72:525:76:10:Times:10:Times:F:data we also include the market value scaled by the book value of assets (Qi;t); and acquisitions (Acquisitionsi;t).
28:832:70120:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:liquidity needs.  Thus, by controlling for sales growth, our ambition is that the coefficient for
28:833:70217:22:22:72:440:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash flow shortfalls,\r, should reflect responses to changes in liquidity needs.
28:834:70297:22:21:89:525:664:12:Times:12:Times:A:We consider the same set of outcome variables,y, as in the Panaxia analysis:Cash/Assets;
28:835:70385:21:22:72:525:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:Payables/ Assets; andReceivables/Sales.  Since the conditional regressions capture yearly ad-
28:836:70478:22:22:71:525:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:justments and the Panaxia analysis evaluates adjustments over a three year period, capturing
28:837:70570:22:21:71:525:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:both delayed payments and subsequent losses, it is not obvious how a comparison of the ef-
28:838:70660:21:22:71:525:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:fects from the two liquidity shocks should be interpreted.  However, we adopt the following
28:839:70751:22:22:71:525:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:criterion: results showing that firms cash flow shortfalls are associated with drawdowns in cash
28:840:70847:22:21:71:525:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings (\r <0), increases in payables (\r >0), and contractions in receivables (\r <0)—with
28:841:70940:21:22:71:525:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:upstream adjustments dominating downstream adjustments; and joint adjustments at the trade
28:842:71030:22:22:71:525:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit margins being roughly of the same magnitude as the ones in cash holdings—would be
28:843:71118:22:44:71:295:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:deemed consistent with the event study results.
28:844:71165:44:30:71:221:425:14:Times:14:Times:C:5.1    External validation
28:845:71191:30:22:71:525:395:12:Times:12:Times:B:Panel A in Table 8 reports the conditional model results for coefficients obtained when estimat-
28:846:71287:22:21:71:525:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:ing Eq.  (6) on the sample of Swedish firms.  Column (I) shows results for changes in firms’
28:847:71379:21:22:71:525:352:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash holdings,-y=  -Cash=Assets.   The obtained coefficient show that declines in cash
28:848:71465:22:22:71:525:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:flow is significantly associated with declines in cash holdings.  By calculating the average, es-
28:849:71562:22:21:71:525:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:timated impact of a given reduction in cash flow,  we can infer the economic significance of
28:850:71654:21:22:71:525:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:shortfalls in cash flow on cash holdings.  Thus, we find that a one-standard-deviation decline
28:851:71748:22:22:71:525:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the cash flow variable is associated with (-0:097-0:201=0:232 =) 8.4 percent decline, at
28:852:71839:22:21:72:526:243:12:Times:12:Times:B:the mean, in cash holdings.  In Column (II) we report results for changes in firms’ accounts
28:853:71931:21:22:72:525:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:payable,-y= -Payables=Assets.  The obtained coefficient is positive and statistically sig-
28:854:72021:22:22:71:525:200:12:Times:12:Times:B:nificant, and indicates that cash flow shocks are associated with increased amounts of drawn
28:855:72113:22:21:71:525:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade  credit.   A  one-standard-deviation  decline  in  the  cash  flow  variable  is  associated  with
28:856:72217:21:22:71:525:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:(0:124-0:201=0:115  =) 21.6 percent increase, at the mean, in the amounts of drawn trade
28:857:72305:22:22:71:525:135:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit.  The effects for receivables,-y=  -Receivables=Sales, is reported in Column (III).
28:858:72395:22:21:71:525:113:12:Times:12:Times:B:We find a coefficient that is negative and statistically significant, hence showing that declines
28:859:72492:21:22:71:525:92:12:Times:12:Times:B:in cash flow are associated with reduced amounts of issued trade credit.  The magnitudes of
28:860:72583:22:0:71:525:70:12:Times:12:Times:B:the coefficient implies that a one-standard-deviation larger cash flow shortfall is associated with
29:861:72684:0:22:72:525:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:(-0:052-0:201=0:161 =) 6.5 percent decline, at the mean, in accounts receivable.  Thus, the
29:862:72775:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimated cash flow effects have signs that coincide with the Panaxia event study results re-
29:863:72868:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:ported in the previous section; that is, drawdowns in cash holdings, increases in payables, and
29:864:72963:21:35:72:480:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:reductions in receivables, which concurs with the first part of our validation criterion.
29:865:73052:35:35:234:364:608:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Table 8 about here.]
29:866:73080:35:21:89:525:573:12:Times:12:Times:A:As a further comparison we evaluate the relative magnitudes of upstream and downstream
29:867:73166:21:22:72:526:552:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments.   To  control  for  the  difference  in  scaling  variables,  we  calculate  the  effect  for
29:868:73272:22:22:72:525:530:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes in receivables-to-assets,-y=  -Receivables=Assets, which gives a coefficient (t-
29:869:73360:22:21:72:525:508:12:Times:12:Times:B:value) of-0:033(-37:8). At-test for the difference in the absolute changes between payables-
29:870:73452:21:22:72:526:487:12:Times:12:Times:B:to-assets and receivables-to-assets shows that the upstream adjustments are significantly larger
29:871:73548:22:22:72:525:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:in magnitude, with ap-value of 0.000.  Moreover, to measure the relative importance of cash
29:872:73639:22:21:72:526:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:and trade credit, we can compare the compounded adjustments in the net trade credit position
29:873:73731:21:22:72:525:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:(i.e.,-(Payables-Receivables)=Assets) with  adjustments  in cash holdings.   The adjust-
29:874:73819:22:22:72:525:400:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment (t-value) of net trade credit is estimated to 0.157 (136.8).  Testing for the difference in
29:875:73915:22:21:72:526:378:12:Times:12:Times:B:absolute adjustment between cash and net trade credit, shows that the compounded adjustments
29:876:74007:21:22:72:525:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:at the trade credit margins significantly dominate the ones in cash holdings, with ap-value of
29:877:74101:22:22:72:526:335:12:Times:12:Times:B:0.000.  Thus, the conditional model estimates indicate effects which according to our criterion
29:878:74196:22:21:72:526:313:12:Times:12:Times:B:are consistent with the effects documented in the event study analysis.  However, one excep-
29:879:74288:21:22:72:526:292:12:Times:12:Times:B:tion is that the conditional model indicates that joint adjustments at the trade credit margins
29:880:74383:22:22:72:526:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:dominate adjustments in cash holdings, whereas these two are not significantly different in the
29:881:74478:22:21:72:526:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:Panaxia analysis.  This discrepancy could be due to the difference in sample sizes between the
29:882:74572:21:22:72:516:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:two approaches, where the coefficients in the conditional models are more sharply estimated.
29:883:74664:22:22:89:525:205:12:Times:12:Times:A:Table 8, Panel B, reports results for the U.S. firms.  The signs of the coefficients for cash
29:884:74757:22:21:72:526:183:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings  and  the  two  trade  credit  margins  coincide  with  the  ones  reported  for  the  Swedish
29:885:74860:21:22:72:526:162:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms. Comparing the point estimates suggest that the effects are less pronounced for U.S. firms
29:886:74956:22:22:72:526:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:as compared with Swedish ones; however, the estimates of economic significance are close in
29:887:75047:22:21:72:526:118:12:Times:12:Times:B:magnitude across the two samples.  In particular, adjustment effects at the accounts receivable
29:888:75142:21:22:72:526:97:12:Times:12:Times:B:margin  virtually  coincide,-6.5  versus-6.0  percent,  for  Sweden  and  the  U.S.,  and  adjust-
29:889:75240:22:0:72:526:75:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment effects at the payables margin upstream, are very close, although somewhat stronger for
30:890:75334:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:Swedish firms at 21.6 versus 18.3 percent.  But, adjustments of cash-holdings diverge more;
30:891:75425:22:22:72:525:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:U.S. firms adjust less at-5.4 versus-8.4 percent.  A potential explanation for the difference
30:892:75518:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:in economic significance of adjustment in cash-holdings across the two samples is the huge dif-
30:893:75613:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:ference in firm-size between the samples; Swedish firms are considerably smaller than the U.S.
30:894:75707:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:ones (cf. Table 1), and in recognition of the close link between firm-size and firms’ constraints
30:895:75804:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:for raising external funding, see, e.g., Hadlock and Pierce (2010), it is conceivable that Swedish
30:896:75902:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms depend more on internal cash than do U.S. firms; the latter with access to the most so-
30:897:75995:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:phisticated financial markets in the world, and for this sample of huge Compustat firms external
30:898:76091:22:21:72:525:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:funding may well be associated with approximately zero constraints.19Furthermore, applying
30:899:76181:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:the same tests on the U.S. as for the Swedish sample above, shows that upstream adjustments
30:900:76272:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:are significantly more pronounced than downstream adjustments, and joint adjustments at the
30:901:76363:22:21:72:359:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:trade credit margins dominate adjustments in cash holdings.
30:902:76422:21:22:89:525:448:12:Times:12:Times:A:Overall our results for cash flow shortfalls line up with the previous liquidity shock results,
30:903:76517:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:and thus support the presumption that the found effects are manifestations of increased liquidity
30:904:76614:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:needs; that is cash flow shortfalls can serve as a measure of firms’ liquidity distress.  The esti-
30:905:76713:21:22:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:mated measures of economic significance of effects are found to be remarkably similar across
30:906:76805:22:45:72:449:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:the Swedish and U.S. samples, indicating that our results have general bearing.
30:907:76884:45:29:72:283:316:14:Times:14:Times:C:5.2    Cross-sectional heterogeneity
30:908:76920:29:22:72:526:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:The conditional models—estimated on large samples—provide a suitable framework for exam-
30:909:77008:22:22:72:526:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:ining cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm- and industry-characteristics for the impacts of cash
30:910:77105:22:21:72:526:243:12:Times:12:Times:B:flow shortfalls on firms’ liquidity management.  We will firstly explore the notion that firms
30:911:77199:21:22:72:526:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:with stronger relationship-ties towards suppliers and customers rely more on adjustment capac-
30:912:77293:22:22:72:526:200:12:Times:12:Times:B:ity at the trade credit margins, and secondly consider whether trade credit adjustments hinges on
30:913:77390:22:21:72:526:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms’ relative exposure to business cycle variation. To this end, we apply a set of sample-splits
30:914:77488:21:22:72:526:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:and estimate Eq.  (6) for sub-samples on the basis of the degree of specialized inputs used by
30:915:77582:22:18:72:526:135:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms and on firms’ exposures to aggregate risk.  More specifically, for each split-variable, we
30:916:77678:18:14:82:525:117:7:Times:10:Times:F:19This argument was put forward by Rajan and Zingales (1998), for the construction of their empirical industry-
30:917:77789:14:9:72:526:103:10:Times:10:Times:F:level measure of external financing dependence. That is, given absence of constraints to externally fund operations
30:918:77904:9:10:72:526:94:10:Times:10:Times:F:across industries, variation in de facto funding can be attributed to the nature of the industry and not to the compo-
30:919:78022:10:0:72:196:84:10:Times:10:Times:F:sition of firms that belong to it.
31:920:78058:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:sort the firms into empirical distributions for each year and construct two sub-samples related
31:921:78153:22:22:72:409:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:to the bottom 30 percent and on the top 30 percent of the distributions.
31:922:78225:22:21:89:525:664:12:Times:12:Times:A:To study firm-heterogeneity with respect to the degree of specialized input usage, we adopt
31:923:78316:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:a measure of specialized inputs used by Giannetti,  Burkart,  and Ellingsen (2011) in a simi-
31:924:78409:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:lar  context.   It  is  defined  at  the  industry-level  and  provides  the  fraction  of  firm  total  inputs
31:925:78520:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:that is classified as differentiated goods and services, as opposed to standardized goods and ser-
31:926:78618:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:vices, where the distinction between differentiated and standardized rests on Rauch (1999), who
31:927:78713:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:considered items with clear reference price listings as standardized.  The estimates show that
31:928:78807:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:Swedish firms (Panel A) using more specialized inputs, adjust their trade credit margins—both
31:929:78900:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:upstream and downstream—to a larger extent as compared with firms that obtain standardized
31:930:78990:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:inputs. These results are overall consistent with the presumption that rent-seeking from mainte-
31:931:79086:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:nance of long-term relationships incentivize firms to support counterparties in the supply chain.
31:932:79183:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:However, the effects estimated for the U.S. firms (Panel B) indicate no significant differences
31:933:79278:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:with respect to the degree of specialized inputs.  Hence, suggesting that relationship-specific
31:934:79373:22:21:72:526:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:investments may play a more prominent role for small- and medium sized firms, as compared
31:935:79462:21:29:72:148:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:with large ones.
31:936:79478:29:28:234:364:354:12:Times:12:Times:A:[Insert Table 9 about here.]
31:937:79506:28:22:89:525:326:12:Times:12:Times:A:Finally, the adjustment capacity at the trade credit margins may potentially depend on the
31:938:79596:22:21:72:526:304:12:Times:12:Times:B:extent to which firms’ suppliers and customers are able to provide support when needed. More
31:939:79688:21:22:72:526:283:12:Times:12:Times:B:specifically, the suppliers and customers of a firm are less likely to be able to provide support if
31:940:79788:22:22:72:526:261:12:Times:12:Times:B:they are in distress at the same time as the firm. This logic suggests that adjustment capacity at
31:941:79886:22:21:72:526:239:12:Times:12:Times:B:the trade credit margins as a source of reserve liquidity increases for firms that are less exposed
31:942:79985:21:22:72:526:218:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  aggregate  risk  factors  facing  their  suppliers  and  customers.   Along  these  lines,  Acharya,
31:943:80089:22:22:72:526:196:12:Times:12:Times:B:Almeida, and Campello (2013) show that firms that are more exposed to aggregate risk, favor
31:944:80180:22:21:72:526:174:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash over credit lines, since cash flow shortfalls are more likely to occur in times when banks
31:945:80275:21:22:72:203:153:12:Times:12:Times:B:contract their credit supply.
31:946:80304:22:22:89:525:131:12:Times:12:Times:A:To explore this presumption,  we measure a firm’s exposure to aggregate risk as the cor-
31:947:80392:22:21:72:526:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:relation over time between its yearly cash flows and the yearly average cash flows across all
31:948:80485:21:17:72:525:88:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms in the sample.20A large correlation suggests an enhanced aggregate risk exposure.  The
31:949:80577:17:0:82:525:71:7:Times:10:Times:F:20-i=Corr(Cash flowi;t; Agg Cash flowt).  Hence, our measure of aggregate risk exposure captures the
32:950:80679:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:coefficients for Swedish firms (Panel A) indicate that firms with low exposure to aggregate risk,
32:951:80776:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:draw less on their cash holdings, and more on their accounts payable. The estimated effects are
32:952:80871:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:very small in magnitude, which may reflect that economy-wide average cash flow is a very im-
32:953:80963:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:precise measure of the aggregate risk faced by firms. Nevertheless, the differences in effects at
32:954:81060:22:22:72:526:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:the trade credit margins are more pronounced for U.S. firms (Panel B), whereas there is no sta-
32:955:81155:22:21:72:526:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:tistical difference in the adjustments of cash holdings.  Hence, these results are consistent with
32:956:81253:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:the presumption that firms rely more on adjustment capacity at their trade credit margins when
32:957:81347:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:the suppliers and customers are more likely to be able to provide the desired reserve liquidity.
32:958:81443:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:We conclude that these results suggest that firms tend to rely more on trade credit adjustments
32:959:81538:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:if their cash flow shortfalls occur when aggregate cash flow in the economy is sound.  In other
32:960:81633:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:words, if their suppliers and customers are more likely to be able to provide reserve liquidity,
32:961:81729:22:52:72:283:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:and not be liquidity-constrained themselves.
32:962:81773:52:34:72:187:417:17:Times:17:Times:C:6    Conclusions
32:963:81789:34:21:72:526:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:Resent research has shown that the buffer motive plays a prominent role for firms’ choices of
32:964:81882:21:22:72:526:362:12:Times:12:Times:B:cash holdings. Another conceivably important source of reserve liquidity is adjustment capacity
32:965:81977:22:22:72:526:340:12:Times:12:Times:B:at the trade credit margins—accounts payable and receivable—on firms’ balance sheets. In this
32:966:82070:22:21:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:paper, we empirically gauge how trade credit positions, next to cash holdings, are used by firms
32:967:82166:21:22:72:526:297:12:Times:12:Times:B:to curb the impacts of shortfalls in liquidity.  To this end, we evaluate the impact of liquidity
32:968:82263:22:22:72:526:275:12:Times:12:Times:B:shocks that the fraud and failure of a large Swedish cash-in-transit firm imposed on its clients.
32:969:82360:22:21:72:526:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:This unique event provides an opportunity to derive causal inference on the roles played by cash
32:970:82456:21:22:72:376:232:12:Times:12:Times:B:holdings, and trade credit margins to handle liquidity shortfalls.
32:971:82522:22:22:89:525:210:12:Times:12:Times:A:Our contribution can be summarized by the following main findings. Firms handle adverse
32:972:82609:22:21:72:526:188:12:Times:12:Times:B:liquidity shocks by drawing down on their cash holdings, by increasing the amount of drawn
32:973:82699:21:22:72:526:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit from suppliers (payables), and by decreasing the amount of issued credit to suppliers (re-
32:974:82796:22:22:72:526:145:12:Times:12:Times:B:ceivables).  In terms of magnitudes, upstream adjustments dominate downstream adjustments;
32:975:82886:22:21:72:526:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the compounded adjustment at the two trade credit margins is found to be of the same order
32:976:82980:21:10:72:526:102:10:Times:10:Times:F:degree of firms’ pro-cyclicality.  The more pro-cyclical, the more exposed.  That is, the approach hinges on an
32:977:83091:10:10:72:526:92:10:Times:10:Times:F:assumption that the firms’ trading partners collectively converge to the average of all firms.  But on all accounts,
32:978:83207:10:10:72:526:82:10:Times:10:Times:F:the average yearly cash flow for the trading partners—which we cannot observe—should be expected to follow the
32:979:83317:10:0:72:376:72:10:Times:10:Times:F:business cycle, provided that the number of trading partners is large enough.
33:980:83396:0:22:72:526:708:12:Times:12:Times:B:as adjustments in cash holdings, suggesting that trade credit positions indeed provide important
33:981:83492:22:22:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:sources of reserve liquidity.   Moreover,  by exploring the underlying mechanism of the trade
33:982:83585:22:21:72:526:664:12:Times:12:Times:B:credit  adjustments,  we  find  evidence  suggesting  that  the  observed  changes  are  due  to  shifts
33:983:83689:21:22:72:526:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the time dimension, where firms in need of liquidity increase durations on the trade credit
33:984:83783:22:22:72:308:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:contracts upstream and reduce them downstream.
33:985:83829:22:21:89:525:599:12:Times:12:Times:A:We further explore the external validity of our event study results by a broad evaluation of
33:986:83921:21:22:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustments in cash holdings and trade credit positions following cash flow shortfalls.  Consis-
33:987:84017:22:22:72:526:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:tent with our event study findings—and when controlling for demand conditions in the supply-
33:988:84109:22:21:72:526:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:chain—we  find  that  cash  flow  shortfalls  are  associated  with  decreases  in  cash  holdings,  in-
33:989:84213:21:22:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:B:creases in payables, and reductions in receivables, and again the former dominates the latter;
33:990:84307:22:22:72:526:491:12:Times:12:Times:B:moreover, the compounded adjustments at the trade credit margins are greater than adjustments
33:991:84400:22:21:72:526:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:in cash.  These results are documented for a sample covering the universe of predominantly
33:992:84490:21:22:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:B:small- and medium-sized Swedish corporate firms, as well as for a sample consisting of large,
33:993:84583:22:22:72:526:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:publicly traded U.S. firms,  which suggests that they are general in nature and not size-,  nor
33:994:84678:22:0:72:152:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:country-specific.
