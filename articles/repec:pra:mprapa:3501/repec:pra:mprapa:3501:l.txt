2:11:276:28:27:72:75:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
2:12:276:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We  examine  whether  hedging  effectiveness  is  affected  by  asymmetry  in  the  return  distribution 
2:13:381:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by applying tail specific metrics to compare the hedging effectiveness of short and long hedgers 
2:14:478:28:27:71:542:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:using  Oil  futures  contracts.  The  metrics  used  include  Lower  Partial  Moments  (LPM),  Value  at 
2:15:583:27:28:71:542:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Risk  (VaR)  and  Conditional  Value  at  Risk  (CVAR).  Comparisons  are  applied  to  a  number  of 
2:16:685:28:27:71:542:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging  strategies  including  OLS  and  both  Symmetric  and  Asymmetric  GARCH  models.  Our 
2:17:781:27:28:71:542:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:findings  show  that  asymmetry  reduces  in-sample  hedging  performance  and  that  there  are 
2:18:878:28:28:71:542:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:significant  differences  in  hedging  performance  between  short  and  long  hedgers.  Thus,  tail 
2:19:979:28:27:71:542:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:specific performance metrics should be applied in evaluating hedging effectiveness. We also find 
2:20:1076:27:28:71:542:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that  the  Ordinary  Least  Squares  (OLS)  model  provides  consistently  good  performance  across 
2:21:1177:28:27:71:542:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:different   measures   of   hedging   effectiveness   and   estimation   methods   irrespective   of   the 
2:22:1284:27:28:71:293:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:characteristics of the underlying distribution.

3:35:2019:0:28:71:175:723:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:1. Introduction 
3:36:2035:28:27:72:75:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
3:37:2035:27:28:72:543:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:A  large  literature  has  developed  in  the  evaluation  of  futures  based  hedging  strategies.  The 
3:38:2140:28:27:71:542:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dominant hedging framework uses the variance  as the risk measure and the optimal hedge ratio 
3:39:2234:27:28:71:542:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(OHR)  has,  therefore,  become  synonymous  with  the  minimum  variance  hedge  ratio  (see,  for 
3:40:2334:28:28:71:542:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:example  Lien  and  Tse,  2002,  for  a  comprehensive  survey).  A  shortcoming  of  the  variance  risk 
3:41:2440:28:27:71:542:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:measure is that it cannot distinguish between positive and negative returns and therefore it does 
3:42:2538:27:28:71:542:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not provide an accurate measure of risk for asymmetric distributions. Given asymmetry, hedging 
3:43:2633:28:27:71:542:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness  metrics  that  cannot  distinguish  between  tail  probabilities  may  be  inaccurate  in 
3:44:2738:27:28:71:208:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:terms of risk measurement.  
3:45:2766:28:28:71:74:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
3:46:2766:28:27:71:528:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In the literature on optimal hedging, two broad strands have emerged that address these issues. 
3:47:2862:27:28:71:542:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The first approach is the use of hedging estimation methods that seek to minimise some measure 
3:48:2957:28:27:71:542:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of risk other than the variance. These include LPM and methods relating to VaR and CVaR. The 
3:49:3050:27:28:71:542:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:second approach is the use of hedging estimation methods that allow for asymmetry in the return 
3:50:3146:28:28:71:542:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distribution. Of these, asymmetric extensions to the GARCH class of models have been applied 
3:51:3239:28:27:71:542:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in a number of studies (see, for  example, Brooks  et al, 2002). However no study  has  addressed 
3:52:3337:27:28:71:542:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  issue  of  hedging  effectiveness  under  conditions  of  asymmetry  by  combining  these  models, 
3:53:3441:28:27:71:542:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:together with hedging effectiveness methods that measure tail probabilities. This study addresses 
3:54:3539:27:28:71:348:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this, and differs from prior research in a number of ways. 
3:55:3598:28:28:71:74:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
3:56:3598:28:27:71:542:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Firstly,  we  apply  tail  specific  hedging  effectiveness  measures  together  with  estimation  methods 
3:57:3705:27:28:71:542:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that  allow  for  asymmetry  to  Oil  spot  and  futures  contracts.  This  allows  us  to  compare  the 
3:58:3810:28:27:71:542:88:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging effectiveness of short and long hedgers under conditions of asymmetry. Oil commodity 
3:59:3903:27:0:71:542:61:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:markets  were  chosen  as  they  are  particularly  suited  for  an  examination  into  the  effects  of 
4:60:4009:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:asymmetry  on  hedging  effectiveness  given  their  distributional  characteristics  and  in  particular, 
4:61:4116:28:27:71:542:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:their  tendency  to  be  non-symmetrically  distributed  (see,  for  example,  Baillie  and  Myers,  1991, 
4:62:4223:27:28:71:542:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Lien and Wilson, 2001). The  cash prices of Oil tend toward excess skewness  given the volatile 
4:63:4319:28:27:71:542:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nature  of  the  market  and  the  underlying  supply  conditions.  Also,  since  the  futures  price  of  a 
4:64:4428:27:28:71:542:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commodity is driven by  storage costs and the  convenience  yield, the relationship between them 
4:65:4525:28:28:71:542:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:may  give  rise  to  asymmetric  returns.  Secondly,  we  use  empirical  data  based  on  distributional 
4:66:4631:28:27:71:542:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:characteristics whereby a symmetric and an asymmetric dataset were chosen specifically so as to 
4:67:4727:27:28:71:446:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:compare hedging effectiveness for both normal and asymmetric distributions. 
4:68:4803:28:27:71:74:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
4:69:4803:27:28:71:542:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The  hedging  estimation  models  used  are;  na√Øve  hedge,  rolling  window  OLS  hedge,  and  two 
4:70:4903:28:28:71:542:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bivariate  GARCH  models  including  an  asymmetric  GARCH  model.  Four  different  hedging 
4:71:4996:28:27:71:542:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness metrics are applied. These are based on; Variance, LPM, VaR; and CVaR. With the 
4:72:5090:27:28:71:542:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exception  of  the  variance,  these  metrics  can  account  for  asymmetries  as  they  can  measure  both 
4:73:5198:28:27:71:542:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:left tail and right tail probabilities. This approach allows us to comprehensively examine hedging 
4:74:5297:27:28:71:542:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness  of  both  short  and  long  hedgers  for  both  symmetric  and  asymmetric  distributions 
4:75:5402:28:28:71:542:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  to  see  whether  there  is  a  dominant  OHR  estimation  method  that  emerges  across  a  broad 
4:76:5506:28:27:71:265:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:range of hedging effectiveness metrics.  
4:77:5547:27:21:71:74:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
4:78:5547:21:27:71:539:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Our most important finding is that the presence of skewness in the return distribution reduces in-
4:79:5645:27:28:71:542:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sample  hedging  effectiveness.  Therefore  hedges  may  fail  during  stressful  market  conditions 
4:80:5746:28:28:71:542:178:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:when  they  are  most  required.  We  also  find  significant  differences  between  the  hedging 
4:81:5844:28:27:71:542:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness of short and long hedgers for each of the tail specific measures we apply, with the 
4:82:5942:27:28:71:542:123:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:differences  being  more  pronounced  for  the  skewed  distribution.  This  implies  that  hedgers  who 
4:83:6047:28:27:71:542:95:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fail to use tail specific hedging performance metrics may chose inefficient hedging strategies that 
4:84:6147:27:0:71:542:68:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:result in them being mishedged vis a vis their hedging objectives. Our results also show that the 
5:85:6246:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:OLS  model  yields  the  best  overall  performance  irrespective  of  the  distributional  characteristics 
5:86:6354:28:27:71:542:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  the  index  being  hedged,  or  the  hedging  effectiveness  criteria  being  applied.  Based  on  this 
5:87:6462:27:28:71:542:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:finding,  it  would  appear  that  there  is  little  to  be  gained  in  terms  of  hedging  efficiency  from  the 
5:88:6578:28:27:71:542:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:use  of  more  complicated  hedging  strategies  such  as  asymmetric  GARCH  models  and  that  a 
5:89:6677:27:28:71:524:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:simple hedging solution based on OLS is adequate for both normal and skewed distributions.

5:91:6769:28:27:71:542:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The  remainder  of  the  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  In  section  2  we  outline  the  models  used  for 
5:92:6877:27:28:71:542:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:estimating  optimal  hedge  ratios.  In  Section  3  we  describe  the  metrics  for  measuring  hedging 
5:93:6982:28:27:71:542:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness.  Section  4  describes  the  data  and  summary  statistics.  Section  5  presents  our 
5:94:7085:27:28:71:347:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:empirical findings. Section 6 summarises and concludes.

5:96:7141:28:27:71:194:419:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:2. Hedging Models 
5:97:7158:27:28:71:542:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The  OHR  is  defined  in  the  literature  as  the  ratio  that  minimises  the  risk  of  the  payoff  of  the 
5:98:7271:28:32:71:377:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedged portfolio. The payoff of a hedged portfolio is given as:  
5:99:7336:32:34:158:525:332:7:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:A:fsrrb-+ (short hedger)         (1a) 
5:100:7365:34:32:158:526:298:7:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:A:fsrrb+- (long hedger)        (1b) 
5:101:7392:32:32:71:542:266:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:where srand fr  are  the  returns  on  the  spot  and  futures  respectively,  and bis  the  estimated 
5:102:7495:32:27:71:542:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:OHR.  We  define  a  short  (long)  hedger  as  being  long  (short)  the  spot  asset  and  short  (long)  the 
5:103:7607:27:28:71:542:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:futures asset. In this study we utilise five different methods for estimating OHR‚Äôs. The simplest 
5:104:7705:28:27:71:542:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:models  are  a  Hedge  Ratio  (HR)  of  zero  (no  hedge)  and  a  1:1  or  Na√Øve  hedge  ratio  where  each 
5:105:7814:27:28:71:542:152:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:unit of the Oil contract is hedged with equivalent units of the futures contract. The third method 
5:106:7913:28:28:71:542:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:we  use  is  an  OLS  HR  using  the  slope  coefficient  of  a  regression  of  the  spot  on  the  futures 
5:107:8022:28:27:71:542:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:returns.  An  OHR  estimated  by  OLS  was  first  used  by  Ederington  (1979)  and  has  been  applied

6:109:8240:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:because  it  assumes  that  the  OHR  is  constant  whereas  time-varying  volatility  is  the  rule  for 
6:110:8346:28:27:71:542:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:financial time series and as the OHR depends on the conditional distribution of spot and futures 
6:111:8443:27:28:71:542:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:returns, so too should the hedge ratio. We therefore use a rolling window OLS model to account 
6:112:8538:28:29:71:271:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for time varying effects. This is given as:

6:123:8988:28:28:71:402:403:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:varying. These are a symmetric and an asymmetric GARCH model.

7:153:9946:28:27:71:542:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:diagonal.  This  means  that  the  conditional  variance  of  the  spot  returns  depends  only  on  past 
7:154:10052:27:28:71:542:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:values  of  itself  and  past  values  of  the  squared  innovations  in  the  spot  returns.  The  conditional

7:156:10273:28:27:71:542:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:have  similar  structures.    Because  of  the  diagonal  restriction  we  use  only  the  upper  triangular

7:159:10595:27:29:71:543:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:estimated.  This  is  subject  to  the  requirement  that  the  variance-covariance  matrix is  positive

7:163:10824:27:28:71:542:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The second GARCH model that we use is an asymmetric extension of the SDVECH model. We 
7:164:10910:28:27:71:542:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:require  both  a  symmetric  and  an  asymmetric  GARCH  model  since  we  are  examining  their

7:166:11111:28:27:71:542:230:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model is that it is able to capture the asymmetries both within and between Oil spot and futures 
7:167:11208:27:28:71:542:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:markets.  It  therefore  allows  for  different  volatility  response  to  negative  and  positive  returns 
7:168:11316:28:28:71:542:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which  means  that  dynamic  hedging  strategies  will  differ  from  those  models  that  impose 
7:169:11414:28:27:71:542:147:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:symmetry.  The  asymmetric  GARCH  model  we  use  builds  on  the  univariate  GJR  asymmetric 
7:170:11510:27:28:71:542:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:GARCH  model  of  Glosten  et  al,  (1993).  The  GJR  model  allows  the  variance  to  respond 
7:171:11607:28:27:71:542:92:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:differently  to  positive  and  negative  return  innovations  through  the  use  of  an  additional  term 
7:172:11714:27:0:71:542:65:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:designed to capture asymmetries. The multivariate model is similar to that used in de Goeij and 
8:173:11811:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Marquering  (2004).  It  differs  from  the  SDVECH  model  by  changing  the  equations  for  the

8:192:12641:28:28:71:542:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:al, 2004). However, the performance of these models has been mixed. Over short time horizons

9:229:14540:28:27:71:542:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The  use  of  the  variance  as  a  measure  of  risk  has  been  criticised  because  it  fails  to  distinguish 
9:230:14654:27:28:71:542:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between  the  tails  of  the  distribution  and  therefore  fails  to  differentiate  in  performance  terms 
9:231:14763:28:28:71:542:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between  short  and  long  hedgers.  Where  distributions  are  asymmetric,  the  variance  will  over  or 
9:232:14870:28:27:71:542:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:underestimate  risk.  It  is  therefore  not  an  adequate  measure  of  risk  for  hedgers  except  where 
9:233:14977:27:28:71:542:231:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distributions are symmetric. Also, Lien (2005) argues that the reason that the literature finds that 
9:234:15078:28:27:71:542:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  OLS  hedging  strategies  tend  to  perform  as  well  or  better  than  more  complex  estimation 
9:235:15182:27:28:71:542:176:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:models  such  as  GARCH,  can  be  attributed  to  the  use  of  the  Ederington  effectiveness  measure. 
9:236:15288:28:28:71:542:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Demirer  (2005)  argues  that  the  variance  performance  criterion  is  only  valid  for  OLS  based 
9:237:15391:28:27:71:542:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging  strategies  and  that  using  it  to  evaluate  non-OLS  OHR‚Äôs  will  lead  to  the  incorrect 
9:238:15495:27:28:71:404:93:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:conclusion that OLS OHR‚Äôs are the best from a hedging perspective. 
9:239:15562:28:0:71:74:65:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
10:240:15563:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Therefore, while the variance based measure is appropriate where the hedger seeks to minimise 
10:241:15657:28:27:71:542:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:variance,  in  practice,  hedgers  may  seek  to  minimise  some  measure  of  risk  other  than  the 
10:242:15759:27:28:71:542:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:variance.    We  therefore  use  three  additional  hedging  effectiveness  metrics  that  will  allow  us  to 
10:243:15870:28:27:71:542:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:make  a  robust  comparison  of  different  hedging  models  under  both  symmetric  and  asymmetric

10:247:16094:27:28:71:542:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:shortcoming in the variance measure. The LPM distinguishes between the left and right tail of a 
10:248:16190:28:27:71:542:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distribution and can, therefore, measure risk in the presence of asymmetries as it is a function of 
10:249:16290:27:28:71:542:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the underlying distribution (Bawa, 1975).  The LPM measures the probability of falling below a

10:261:16603:28:27:71:543:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:return parameter. The value of - will depend on the level of return or loss that is acceptable to the 
10:262:16705:27:28:71:542:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investor. Some values of - that may be considered are, zero or the risk free rate of interest. For a 
10:263:16806:28:28:71:543:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedger a small negative return may be acceptable to reflect the cost of hedging. The parameter n

11:275:17901:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:therefore serves as an intuitive measure of  risk that is in line with the  risk preferences of many 
11:276:18002:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investors  (Lee  and  Rao,  1988).  Price  and  Nantell  (1982)  in  a  comparison  of  LPM  and  variance 
11:277:18109:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:based measures of hedging effectiveness, find that they provide equivalent measures for normal 
11:278:18204:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distributions  but  that  the  LPM  differentiates  for  distributions  that  are  asymmetric  as  it  is  a  tail 
11:279:18319:27:28:72:543:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:specific  measure  that  measures  the  left  and  right  tail  probabilities  independently.  A  number  of 
11:280:18428:28:27:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:studies  have  compared  the  hedging  effectiveness  of  short  and  long  hedgers  using  the  LPM 
11:281:18529:27:28:72:543:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:methodology  (see,  for  example,  Demirer  and  Lien,  2003,  and  Demirer  et  al,  2005).  The  results 
11:282:18636:28:28:72:543:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from these studies indicate that hedging effectiveness for long hedgers differs from that of short 
11:283:18735:28:27:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedgers  with  long  hedgers  deriving  more  benefit  from  hedging  in  terms  of  risk  reduction  as 
11:284:18840:27:28:72:543:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:measured by reduced LPM‚Äôs. Other studies that use the LPM include Lien and Tse (1998), who 
11:285:18931:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:examined  the  consequences  of  time-varying  conditional  heteroskedasticity  on  optimal  LPM 
11:286:19028:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:based hedge ratios. They find that the optimal LPM hedge ratios are, on average, smaller than the 
11:287:19126:28:28:72:542:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:minimum-variance  hedge  ratios. Lien  and  Tse  (2000)  argue that  the  minimum-variance  hedge 
11:288:19222:28:27:72:543:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:strategy  is  inappropriate  for  investors  who  are  strongly  risk  averse  such  as  those  with  utilities 
11:289:19334:27:28:72:543:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that  reflect  the  higher  orders  of  magnitude  allowed  for  by  the  LPM.    Since  the  majority  of 
11:290:19441:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedgers  seek  to  limit  losses,  it  may  therefore,  be  appropriate  for  hedgers  to  seek  to  minimise  a 
11:291:19554:27:28:72:543:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:risk measure that is tail specific. Two additional metrics that are closely related to the LPM and 
11:292:19653:28:28:72:543:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which also have similar advantages as measures of risk for hedging are VaR and CVaR. Both of 
11:293:19746:28:27:72:543:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these  measures  are  also  tail  specific  and  may  be  used  to  measure  downside  risk.  These  are 
11:294:19851:27:28:72:197:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered in due course.

12:296:19879:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We  calculate  the  lower  partial  moment  using  a  target  return  of  zero  since  the  general  aim  of 
12:297:19988:28:27:72:542:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging is to avoid negative outcomes. We also use n=3 as the order of LPM, as this corresponds 
12:298:20084:27:28:72:543:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to  a  strongly  risk  averse  investor.  The  metric  we  apply  to  evaluate  hedging  effectiveness  based

12:317:20413:38:28:72:542:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The third hedging effectiveness metric is VaR2. This is the loss level of a portfolio over a certain 
12:318:20514:28:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:period that will not be exceeded with a specified probability. VaR has two parameters, the time 
12:319:20610:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:horizon  (N)  and  the  confidence  level  (x).  Generally  VaR  is  the  (100-x)th  percentile  of  the 
12:320:20715:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:portfolio over the next N days. We calculate VaR using 99=x and1=N. This corresponds to 
12:321:20803:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  first  percentile  of  the  return  distribution  of  each  portfolio  over  a  one-day  period  which  is

12:339:21143:39:27:72:543:260:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:A  shortcoming  in  VaR  is  that  it  is  not  a  coherent  measure  of  risk,  as  it  is  not  subadditive.  In 
12:340:21258:27:28:72:546:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:practice  this  means  that  two  portfolios  may  have  the  same  VaR  but  different  potential  losses.  
12:341:21367:28:27:72:542:205:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This is because VaR does not account for losses beyond the (100-x)th percentile. We address this 
12:342:21464:27:28:72:543:178:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by  estimating  an  additional  performance  metric;  Conditional  Value  at  Risk  (CVaR)  that 
12:343:21561:28:33:72:408:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:addresses the shortcoming in VaR as it is a coherent measure of risk.  
12:344:21632:33:7:71:217:117:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
12:345:21690:7:16:71:522:110:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:1 The percentage reduction in the relevant performance measure is generally compared with a no-hedge position 
12:346:21800:16:11:71:506:94:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:however there may be some cases where a no-hedge position does not yield the worst hedging performance, 
12:347:21904:11:7:71:509:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:whereby the comparison is than made against the hedging model that yields the worst hedging performance.  
12:348:22010:7:7:71:513:76:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:2 VaR can be viewed as a special case of the LPM in equation (11) setting n=0. By fixing the probability LPM
12:349:22118:7:10:512:536:69:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:0, the 
12:350:22125:10:0:72:346:59:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:corresponding VaR can be calculated. Therefore VaR = F-1(LPM0).  
13:351:22192:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Coherent measures of risk are subadditive. What this means is that the risk of two positions when 
13:352:22290:28:27:72:543:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:added together is never greater than the sum of the risks of the two individual positions (see, for 
13:353:22390:27:28:72:543:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:example,  Artzner  et  al,  1999).  Few  studies  in  the  hedging  literature  have  applied  VaR  as  a 
13:354:22496:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging effectiveness measure, however, Giot and Laurent (2003) use both the VAR and CVaR 
13:355:22586:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:measures  to  examine  the  risk  of  short  and  long  trading  positions  over  a  one  day  time  horizon. 
13:356:22696:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:They  estimate  volatility  using  both  symmetric  and  asymmetric  GARCH  type  approaches.  Their 
13:357:22797:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:findings  show  that  symmetric  models  underperform  models  that  account  for  asymmetry; 
13:358:22891:27:28:72:371:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:however, their analysis is only applied to unhedged positions. 
13:359:22954:28:27:72:75:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
13:360:22954:27:28:72:482:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:CVaR is the expected loss conditional that we have exceeded the VaR. It is given as: 
13:361:23039:28:28:72:527:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:  CVaR = E[L|L> VaR]         (14) 
13:362:23066:28:27:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This measures the expected value of our losses, L, if we get a loss in excess of the VaR. CVaR is 
13:363:23164:27:28:72:543:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferable  to  the  VaR  because  it  estimates  not  only  of  the  probability  of  a  loss,  but  also  the 
13:364:23276:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:magnitude of a possible  loss.  In calculating CVaR we use the 1% confidence level which gives 
13:365:23371:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:us  the  expected  shortfall  beyond  the  1%  VaR.  The  performance  metric  we  use  to  evaluate 
13:366:23472:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging  effectiveness  is  the  percentage  reduction  in  CVaR  as  compared  with  a  no  hedge

13:385:23738:27:0:71:390:146:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to examine hedging effectiveness under conditions of asymmetry. 
14:386:23804:0:28:71:197:723:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:4. Data Description 
14:387:23823:28:27:71:74:695:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C: 
14:388:23823:27:28:71:542:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Our data consist of daily commodity Oil cash and futures data. Oil was chosen as it potentially 
14:389:23919:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exhibits  significant  asymmetric  effects  based  on  the  reasons  discussed  earlier,  because  it  is  the 
14:390:24030:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:largest  traded  commodity  in  the  world  in  terms  of  monetary  value,  because  of  its  economic 
14:391:24134:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:importance  and  because  it  is  widely  hedged.  It  is  therefore  a  suitable  asset  to  use  in  an 
14:392:24240:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:examination  into  the  effects  of  asymmetry  on  hedging.  The  oil  contract  used  is  the  NYMEX 
14:393:24343:27:28:72:543:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:West  Texas  Light  Sweet  Crude  which  was  chosen  as  it  is  used  as  an  international  oil  pricing 
14:394:24451:28:27:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:benchmark  given  its  liquidity  and  price  transparency.  All  data  was  obtained  from  Commodity 
14:395:24554:27:28:72:543:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Systems  and  daily  returns  were  calculated  as  the  differenced  logarithmic  prices.  A  continuous 
14:396:24660:28:28:72:543:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:series was formed with the contract being rolled over by volume. This means that the price of the 
14:397:24758:28:27:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:largest traded contract by volume was used and that the price switched from one contract to the 
14:398:24854:27:28:72:481:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:next when that contract‚Äôs volume fell below the volume of the next traded contract.

14:400:24940:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Since we are examining the influence of asymmetry and its effects on hedging effectiveness, we 
14:401:25035:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:have  used  an  innovative  approach  in  choosing  the  data.  The  oil  contract  and  the  sample  period 
14:402:25144:28:27:72:543:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  chosen  on  the  basis  of  their  distributional  characteristics  as  we  required  data  with  both 
14:403:25253:27:28:72:543:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:symmetric  and  asymmetric  distributions.  A  single  oil  contract  was  used  for  the  sample  period 
14:404:25359:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from  1  January  2000  ‚Äì  31  December  2001.  We  broke  down  the  data  into  two  separate  periods, 
14:405:25465:27:28:72:543:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:one symmetric and one asymmetric. The first dataset corresponds to the period 1 January 2000 ‚Äì 
14:406:25560:28:28:72:543:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:31 December 2000 and is termed Period 1. The second dataset corresponds to the period from 1 
14:407:25653:28:27:72:360:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:January 2001 ‚Äì 31 December 2001 and is termed Period 2.  
14:408:25710:27:28:72:75:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
14:409:25710:28:27:72:543:88:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:For  each  period,  the  first  160  observations  comprise  the  in-sample  period.  The  remaining  100 
14:410:25816:27:0:72:543:61:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:observations  were  used  to  facilitate  out-of-sample  comparisons.  Summary  statistics  for  the  data 
15:411:25925:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are  displayed  in  Table  I.  The  characteristics  of  the  return  distributions  for  both  series  are 
15:412:26033:28:27:72:543:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:markedly different. From table 1, we can see that period 1 is non-symmetric and is characterised 
15:413:26130:27:28:72:543:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by  negative  skewness.  In  contrast,  Period  2  can  be  characterised  as  Gaussian  given  the 
15:414:26230:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:insignificant  skewness  figure  and  our  failure  to  reject  the  hypothesis  of  normality  based  on  the 
15:415:26341:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Bera-Jarque  statistic.  The  use  of  a  symmetric  period  also  allows  us  to  compare  the  hedging 
15:416:26446:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness  under  Gaussian  market  conditions  of  each  of  the  different  models  using  the

15:436:27222:9:9:71:533:333:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:zero would indicate a symmetric distribution. The kurtosis statistic measures the shape of a distribution as compared with a normal distribution. 
15:437:27368:9:10:71:531:324:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Figures reported for kurtosis are for excess kurtosis where a value of zero would indicate a normal distribution.  The Bera-Jarque (B-J) statistic 
15:438:27515:10:9:71:532:314:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:combines skewness and kurtosis to measure normality.  LM is the Lagrange Multiplier test proposed by Engle (1982). The test statistic for B-J, 
15:439:27658:9:9:71:514:305:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:LM tests are distributed -2. Stationarity is tested using the Dickey-Fuller unit root test.  *Denotes Significance at the 1% level. **Denotes

15:443:27829:14:27:71:542:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The data were  checked  for stationarity using Dickey  Fuller unit root tests. As expected, the log 
15:444:27929:27:28:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:returns for both series are stationary. Stationarity is important as a non-stationary series may lead 
15:445:28031:28:28:72:543:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to spurious regressions and invalidate the estimated optimal hedge ratios. LM tests were used to 
15:446:28128:28:27:72:543:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:check  for  heteroskedasticity  with  only  the  futures  returns  for  Period  2  showing  significant

15:448:28331:28:27:72:319:115:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging strategies that assume a constant variance.

17:488:29393:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Figure  1  reveals  significant  differences  between  the  OHR‚Äôs  for  the  different  models  for  both 
17:489:29499:28:27:72:543:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:periods. The gap between the GARCH model OHR‚Äôs for the asymmetric period is to be expected 
17:490:29590:27:28:72:543:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:however  there  is  also  a  large  difference  between  the  OHR‚Äôs  for  the  GARCH  models  for  the 
17:491:29693:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:symmetric period. This indicates that although the Period 2 dataset is symmetric as measured by 
17:492:29789:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:skewness, there may still be an asymmetric response to positive and negative return innovations 
17:493:29885:28:28:72:546:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that is being picked up by  the asymmetric  GARCH model and this is considered in due course.  
17:494:29980:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The OHR‚Äôs also appear to be stationary, therefore, while we would expect to see different model 
17:495:30076:27:28:72:543:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging  performance  for  each  of  the  different  models,  the  performance  gap  may  be  narrow  in 
17:496:30181:28:27:72:133:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:many cases.

17:500:30406:27:28:72:543:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:data (Period 2). Statistical comparisons are made using Efrons (1979) bootstrap methodology by 
17:501:30501:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:employing t-tests of the differences between short and long hedgers based on the point estimates 
17:502:30598:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of our results. This approach is also adopted in tests of model hedging effectiveness and allows 
17:503:30695:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:us  to  make  statistical  as  well  as  economic  inferences  from  our  results.  Comparisons  are  carried 
17:504:30805:28:27:72:516:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:out both in-sample and out-of-sample and across each of the hedging effectiveness metrics.

17:506:30897:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Examining  first  general  hedging  performance,  we  can  observe  large  differences  in  hedging 
17:507:30997:27:28:72:543:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness  for  the  asymmetric  and  symmetric  datasets.  General  hedging  performance  across 
17:508:31099:28:28:72:543:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:all  models  and  risk  measures  is  worse  for  the  asymmetric  period.  For  example,  variance 
17:509:31199:28:27:72:543:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reductions for the symmetric period are of the order of 95% as compared with an average of 29% 
17:510:31294:27:28:72:543:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in-sample  for  the  asymmetric  period  when  all  hedging  models  are  used.  This  finding  persists  if 
17:511:31403:28:27:72:543:88:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:we  use  the  tail  specific  measures  with  average  differences  in  hedging  performance  between  the 
17:512:31510:27:0:72:543:61:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:symmetric and asymmetric periods of 27% and 31% for short and long hedgers respectively. We 
18:513:31604:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:derive  a  number  of  conclusions  from  this  result.  First,  the  in-sample  hedging  performance  is 
18:514:31710:28:27:72:543:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:much  better  for  symmetric  distributions  suggesting  that  hedging  oil  commodity  using  futures  is 
18:515:31817:27:28:72:543:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  limited  use  during  volatile  periods  where  returns  may  be  skewed.  Secondly,  hedging 
18:516:31915:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness  for  oil  commodities  in  general  is  not  as  good  as  for  other  assets  such  as  equity 
18:517:32026:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indices.   This   may   be   attributed   to   the   relationship   between   spot   and   futures   prices   in 
18:518:32139:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commodities markets which may be volatile depending on changes in the underlying supply and 
18:519:32231:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand conditions. An interesting result is that hedging is not as effective in reducing VaR and 
18:520:32328:27:28:72:543:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:CVaR  as  it  is  at  reducing  the  LPM,  with  differences  in  hedging  effectiveness  typically  ranging 
18:521:32437:28:27:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from  15%-50%.  We  can  also  see  that  the  different  hedging  models  yield  poor  performance  in 
18:522:32541:27:28:72:543:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:terms  of  reducing  the  VaR  and  especially  the  CVaR.  Using  the  best  performing  models  for 
18:523:32643:28:28:72:543:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:example, the in-sample results for the skewed period 1 series indicate only an 11% reduction in 
18:524:32739:28:27:72:396:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the CVaR for short hedgers and a 29% reduction for long hedgers.  
18:525:32805:27:28:72:75:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
18:526:32805:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:These  results may be  related to the ability  of the  VaR and CVaR metrics  to model extreme tail 
18:527:32904:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:events whereas the LPM is a more general metric that doesn‚Äôt pick up the most extreme outliers 
18:528:32999:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in  the  same  way4.  This  result  indicates  that  hedging  Oil  commodities  may  be  quite  limited  in 
18:529:33107:28:27:72:543:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reducing extreme losses as measured by the VaR or CVaR. These hedging effectiveness metrics 
18:530:33199:27:28:72:543:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:may  therefore  be  appropriate  for  use  by  strongly  risk  averse  investors  as  a  measure  of  risk  for 
18:531:33311:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distributions that may be skewed by a small number of observations. A key point is that hedges 
18:532:33406:27:28:72:543:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:may  not  be  as  effective  in  volatile  markets  that  are  skewed.  In  hedging  terms,  this  means  that 
18:533:33517:28:28:72:543:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investors may face the risk that their hedges will not fulfil their function of risk reduction during 
18:534:33619:28:49:72:529:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stressful markets conditions when they are most needed. When we examine the out-of-sample  
18:535:33710:49:7:71:217:94:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
18:536:33768:7:16:71:524:87:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:4 While each of these measures is one sided, the LPM with a  target rate set t=0 will include all observations less 
18:537:33884:16:12:72:511:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:than 0, whereas both the VaR and CVaR calculated at the 1% interval will include only extreme observations 
18:538:33991:12:0:72:236:59:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:located in the left tail of the distribution.

20:611:36848:0:28:71:542:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The second comparison we make is between the hedging performance of short and long hedgers 
20:612:36939:28:27:72:543:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for  asymmetric  as  compared  to  symmetric  periods.  For  Period  1  (Asymmetric)  the  hedging 
20:613:37038:27:28:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness differences between short and long hedgers are significant at the 1% level in every

20:615:37231:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are significant in only 50% of cases in-sample and 69% of cases out-of-sample. The differences 
20:616:37326:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between short and long hedgers even for the symmetric period indicate that one must be careful 
20:617:37421:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  using  the  skewness  statistic  to  measure  asymmetry  as  positive  and  negative  skewness  may 
20:618:37525:27:28:72:543:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cancel each other out. It also indicates the importance of using tail specific hedging effectiveness 
20:619:37626:28:27:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:metrics  irrespective  of  the  characteristics  of  the  return  distribution.  This  finding  is  supported

20:623:37917:27:28:72:543:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging  models.  We  compare  the  results  for  Period  1  and  Period  2  to  see  whether  the 
20:624:38016:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distributional characteristics will have an effect on the hedging effectiveness of different models. 
20:625:38117:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In-sample, the best overall hedging model for the asymmetric Period 1 is the OLS model in 50% 
20:626:38211:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  cases.  This  result  applies  to  both  short  and  long  hedgers.  The  best  overall  model  for  the 
20:627:38320:28:27:72:543:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:symmetric  Period  2  is  the  SDVECH  model.  Out-of  sample  results  indicate  that  the  OLS  and 
20:628:38422:27:28:72:543:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ASDVECH models are the best overall performers for periods 1 and 2 respectively.  While this 
20:629:38515:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demonstrates that the OLS and GARCH models tend to provide better hedging performance than 
20:630:38606:27:28:72:543:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a na√Øve hedge, a key issue is whether there are significant differences in the performance of the 
20:631:38704:28:28:72:543:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:different  hedging  models.  To  test  this  we  compared  the  performance  of  the  different  hedging 
20:632:38809:28:27:72:543:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:models  again  employing  Efrons  (1979)  bootstrap  methodology.  We  find  significant  differences 
20:633:38911:27:28:72:543:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between model hedging performances in almost 70% of cases both in-sample and out-of-sample 
20:634:39002:28:27:72:543:88:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:however if we exclude the no-hedge model, this figure drops by around 10%. Looking just at the 
20:635:39097:27:0:72:538:61:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:OLS and GARCH models, we can see that there is little to choose between them as the absolute

21:739:41713:9:9:72:542:78:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:example  the  best  hedging  model  in  terms  of  risk  reduction  for  Period  1  in-sample  is  the  OLS  model  in  four  out  of  eight  cases  for  both  sets  of

22:742:41998:28:27:72:404:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:attributable to the low incidence of heteroskedasticity of our sample.

22:744:42069:28:27:71:539:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Table 4 provides a summary of the best performing models.  Examining both in-sample and out-
22:745:42161:27:28:71:527:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of-sample results, we can see that for an asymmetric distribution the OLS model is clearly the  
22:746:42257:28:28:71:542:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:best  performer  across  all  hedging  effectiveness  metrics.  For  a  symmetric  distribution  the  OLS 
22:747:42363:28:27:71:542:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model again performs strongly although the GARCH models perform best in a small majority of 
22:748:42455:27:28:71:542:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cases.  This  is  clear  evidence  of  the  failure  of  the  asymmetric  GARCH  model  to  provide  better 
22:749:42563:28:27:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging performance for skewed distributions. The failure of the asymmetric GARCH model to 
22:750:42654:27:28:72:543:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:provide better performance for asymmetric distributions contrasts with that of Giot and Laurent 
22:751:42750:28:28:72:543:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(2003).  This  may  relate  to  the  earlier  point  relating  to  the  ability  of  the  ASDVECH  model  to 
22:752:42859:28:27:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model positive and negative return innovations separately, however, this is not the same as being 
22:753:42957:27:28:72:543:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:able  to  model  skewness  in  the  distribution.    Taken  together  with  the  results  from  table  3,  we 
22:754:43067:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:would have to conclude that there is little to be gained from the more complex GARCH models 
22:755:43159:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in performance terms over the simpler OLS model irrespective of the characteristics of the return 
22:756:43257:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distribution. This finding supports the broad literature on optimal hedging and indicates that the 
22:757:43356:28:27:72:543:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:OLS  model  provides  an  efficient  outcome  across  a  selection  of  risk  measures.  It  is  therefore  in 
22:758:43467:27:28:72:543:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:support  of  the  criticism  by  Lien  (2005)  who  suggests  that  the  failure  of  more  complicated 
22:759:43571:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedging estimation models to outperform OLS are a result of the widespread use of the variance 
22:760:43666:27:0:72:167:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reduction criterion. 
23:761:43689:0:28:71:248:723:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:6. Summary and Conclusions 
23:762:43716:28:27:71:74:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
23:763:43716:27:28:71:542:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This paper compares the hedging effectiveness of commodity oil futures for both symmetric and 
23:764:43810:28:27:72:543:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:asymmetric distributions. We also compare the hedging effectiveness of short and long hedgers 
23:765:43904:27:28:72:543:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:using  a  variety  of  hedging  estimation  methods.  A  gap  in  the  literature  on  optimal  hedging  is 
23:766:44012:28:28:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:addressed  by  applying  a  comprehensive  set  of  hedging  effectiveness  measures  that  are  tail 
23:767:44114:28:27:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:specific. We find that in-sample hedging effectiveness is significantly reduced by the presence of 
23:768:44213:27:28:72:543:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:skewness in the return distribution. This is an important finding as it indicates that hedging may 
23:769:44312:28:27:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not be as effective during volatile periods and therefore investors may not be effectively hedging 
23:770:44411:27:28:72:291:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:during the periods when they most require it. 
23:771:44457:28:28:72:75:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
23:772:44457:28:27:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We also find larger differences in hedging performance between the short and long hedgers  for 
23:773:44552:27:28:72:543:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the asymmetric distribution when compared with a symmetric distribution. Therefore the use of 
23:774:44646:28:27:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:one-sided  hedging  performance  measures  that  are  consistent  with  modern  risk  management 
23:775:44743:27:28:72:543:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:techniques  such  as  VaR  and  CVaR  is  to  be  recommended,  as  the  traditional  variance  reduction 
23:776:44849:28:28:72:543:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:criterion  is  not  adequate  and  will  provide  inaccurate  measures  of  risk  for  different  types  of 
23:777:44957:28:27:72:543:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hedgers. Also, we find that the best hedging estimation model to emerge is the OLS model. This 
23:778:45052:27:28:72:543:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:provides  the  best  overall  hedging  performance  across  all  measures  of  hedging  effectiveness  for 
23:779:45159:28:27:72:543:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:both  short  and  long  hedgers.  While  the  GARCH  models  perform  well  for  the  symmetric 
23:780:45255:27:28:72:543:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distribution, the differences in performance as compared with the OLS model are not significant. 
23:781:45352:28:28:72:543:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We also find that employing a GARCH model that allows for asymmetries yields no significant 
23:782:45444:28:27:72:543:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:improvement  in  performance.  This  finding  suggests  that  there  is  little  economic  benefit  to  be 
23:783:45551:27:28:72:543:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:gained  by  the  use  of  more  complex  hedging  estimation  models  over  the  simpler  OLS  model 
23:784:45652:28:27:72:360:88:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:irrespective of the characteristics of the return distribution.
