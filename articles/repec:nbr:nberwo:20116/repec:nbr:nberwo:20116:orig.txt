3:41:2160:0:27:73:184:708:144:Times:144:Times:I. INTRODUCTION 
3:42:2175:27:28:108:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:The key parameter used in policy contexts to assess the benefits of policies that reduce 
3:43:2264:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:mortality risks is the value of a statistical life (VSL).1  This measure of the risk-money tradeoff 
3:44:2364:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:for small risks of death has become the standard approach used by government agencies to value 
3:45:2459:28:28:71:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:reductions in mortality risks. The emphasis in the United States is on VSL estimates derived 
3:46:2552:28:27:71:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:from labor market studies of VSL based on the tradeoff between wages and worker fatality rates.  
3:47:2649:27:28:71:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:Countries such as the U.K. for which the labor market studies are less reliable often rely on 
3:48:2743:28:27:71:245:515:144:Times:144:Times:stated preference estimates of VSL. 
3:49:2779:27:28:107:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:Typically, U.S. government agencies draw on the results of different studies in deriving 
3:50:2868:28:28:71:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:their VSL estimate for policy.  In some cases, this procedure has involved averaging the results 
3:51:2965:28:27:71:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:across studies based on a survey of the literature or a meta-analysis, while in others the agency 
3:52:3063:27:28:71:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:has used the results of a meta-regression analysis to control for different variables that may affect 
3:53:3165:28:27:72:511:377:144:Times:144:Times:the estimated VSL, such as the average income of the sample.  Among the meta-regression 
3:54:3253:27:28:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:analyses that have been relied upon by U.S. government agencies in recent years are those by 
3:55:3346:28:27:72:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:Mrozek and Taylor (2002), Viscusi and Aldy (2003), and Kochi, Hubbell, and Kramer (2006).  
3:56:3437:27:28:72:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:Agencies also may refer to more than one meta-regression analysis as the basis for its VSL 
3:57:3528:28:28:72:495:267:144:Times:144:Times:estimate.  These meta-regression analyses serve to combine the results of different VSL 
3:58:3616:28:27:72:485:239:144:Times:144:Times:estimates and to facilitate adjustments in the VSL to tailor the results to the particular 
3:59:3707:27:28:72:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:populations whose preferences are being valued by, for example, controlling for the different 
3:60:3801:28:64:72:333:184:144:Times:144:Times:countries for which the estimates have been derived.   
3:61:3856:64:8:72:218:120:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
3:62:3916:8:15:72:517:112:42:Times:100:Times:1 Viscusi (2014) presents an inventory of 98 government regulations and the associated VSL used to assess the 
3:63:4026:15:12:72:528:97:100:Times:100:Times:policy impacts.  The most frequently represented agencies are the Environmental Protection Agency, the Dept. of 
3:64:4138:12:11:72:496:85:100:Times:100:Times:Transportation, and the Food and Drug Administration.  Ashenfelter (2006) also stresses the broad policy 
3:65:4243:11:0:72:214:74:100:Times:100:Times:applicability of the VSL estimates. 
4:66:4282:0:27:108:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:An additional factor that can be taken into account through meta-regression analyses is 
4:67:4370:27:28:72:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for the effect of publication bias (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012).  Publication 
4:68:4463:28:27:72:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:selection bias could result from either the selection of estimates that the researcher chooses to 
4:69:4561:27:28:72:481:626:144:Times:144:Times:report or to the unwillingness of peer reviewed journals to publish results outside the 
4:70:4649:28:28:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:conventional range of VSL estimates or which appear to be implausible.  Guided by economic 
4:71:4740:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:theory, researchers may be reluctant to report negative estimates for VSL, which are inconsistent 
4:72:4838:27:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:with the basic theory of compensating differentials that jobs posing higher levels of risk will only 
4:73:4939:28:27:72:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:be attractive to workers if these jobs provide additional pay.  There also may be biases in the 
4:74:5035:27:28:71:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:opposite direction as several early estimates of the VSL were based on labor market studies 
4:75:5127:28:28:71:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:using the Society of Actuaries mortality data for people in different occupations, as opposed to 
4:76:5224:28:27:71:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:the occupation-specific risk.  Use of the Society of Actuaries data as a proxy for the worker’s 
4:77:5320:27:28:71:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:job-related risk overstated the average job-related fatality rate by an order of magnitude and led 
4:78:5419:28:27:71:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:to very low estimates of VSL, which potentially induced an anchoring bias in terms of estimates 
4:79:5515:27:28:71:293:350:144:Times:144:Times:that researchers viewed as being reasonable.   
4:80:5562:28:27:107:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:There have been more meta-analyses of VSL than any other economic subject, and this 
4:81:5646:27:28:71:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:interest in turn has stimulated two studies of the effects of publication selection bias on VSL.  
4:82:5744:28:28:71:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:These explorations of the role of publication bias with respect to VSL have indicated that such 
4:83:5840:28:27:71:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:biases are statistically significant and could have a fundamental effect on the estimated VSL.  
4:84:5936:27:28:71:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) estimated the effect of publication bias on labor market 
4:85:6033:28:27:71:498:184:144:Times:144:Times:estimates of the VSL and found that correction for publication selection bias reduces the 
4:86:6123:27:28:71:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:estimated VSL by 70-80 percent.  Making such an adjustment for policy assessments could 
4:87:6211:28:28:71:510:129:144:Times:144:Times:dramatically reduce the assessed benefits of reduced mortality risks.  This quite substantial 
4:88:6305:28:0:71:530:101:144:Times:144:Times:estimated publication selection bias effect will be examined in my analysis below.  The similar 
5:89:6404:0:27:72:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:meta-regression analysis of the effect of publication selection bias on the estimated income 
5:90:6497:27:28:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity of VSL by Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Viscusi (2014) likewise found estimates of 
5:91:6588:28:27:72:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant publication bias.  However, while the estimates of the bias-corrected 
5:92:6684:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:income elasticity of VSL were below the mean income elasticity estimate in the literature, they 
5:93:6780:28:28:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:were similar to the meta-regression analysis range in Viscusi and Aldy (2003) in which there was 
5:94:6877:28:27:72:296:570:144:Times:144:Times:no correction for publication selection effects. 
5:95:6926:27:28:108:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:A principal theme of this article is that much of the role of the publication selection bias 
5:96:7019:28:27:72:480:515:144:Times:144:Times:can be traced to studies based on earlier eras of fatality rate data.  The available U.S. 
5:97:7109:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:occupational fatality rate measures have evolved from voluntary reporting of fatalities to the U.S. 
5:98:7209:28:28:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:Bureau of Labor Statistics (BSL), to reliance on fatality rates based on partial samples of the 
5:99:7305:28:27:72:487:432:144:Times:144:Times:working population, and most recently, to the use of a comprehensive Census of Fatal 
5:100:7390:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:Occupational Injuries (CFOI) undertaken by the BLS.  The CFOI is a comprehensive census of 
5:101:7481:28:27:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:all worker fatalities.  Construction of the CFOI requires that the BLS validate every fatality as 
5:102:7579:27:28:71:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:being job-related using multiple data sources such as death certificates, workers’ compensation 
5:103:7675:28:27:72:224:322:144:Times:144:Times:records, and coroners’ reports.  
5:104:7708:27:28:108:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:Because the CFOI data consist of individual records of fatalities, researchers have used it 
5:105:7800:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:to construct much more precise measures of the fatality rate that can be matched to the worker in 
5:106:7898:28:27:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:the employment sample.  Whereas previous BLS job fatality data pertained to average fatality 
5:107:7991:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:rates by industry, it is now possible to construct fatality rates by very refined dimensions such as 
5:108:8092:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:industry, occupation, age, gender, race, and immigrant status.2 For example, some studies have 
5:109:8187:27:28:72:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:constructed a fatality rate stratified by 50 industries and by 10 occupations so that both industry 
5:110:8287:28:32:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:and occupational variations in the fatality rate are taken into account.  Using multiple years of 
5:111:8385:32:8:72:218:97:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
5:112:8445:8:15:72:542:89:42:Times:100:Times:2 Viscusi (2013) reviews these studies using CFOI data and the different dimensions on which the article constructed 
5:113:8562:15:0:72:255:74:100:Times:100:Times:the fatality rate and matched it to the worker. 
6:114:8613:0:27:72:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:CFOI data to have an adequate sample size, it is feasible to construct risk estimates for such 
6:115:8708:27:28:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:narrowly defined categories.  Most previous labor market studies of VSL before the advent of the 
6:116:8805:28:27:72:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:CFOI data relied on industry level data and, in effect, assumed all jobs within an industry were 
6:117:8902:27:28:71:139:626:144:Times:144:Times:equally risky. 
6:118:8917:28:28:107:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:In recognition of the superiority of the CFOI fatality rate measure in estimates of the 
6:119:9005:28:27:71:516:570:144:Times:144:Times:VSL, the U.S. Dept. of Transportation (2013) has adopted for policy evaluation purposes an 
6:120:9096:27:28:71:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:average of VSL estimates from nine labor market studies based on the CFOI data rather than 
6:121:9187:28:27:71:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:relying on a meta-regression analysis including studies based on less reliable risk measures.  As 
6:122:9285:27:28:71:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:this paper will demonstrate, VSL estimates derived using the CFOI data will exhibit a differing 
6:123:9381:28:28:71:434:460:144:Times:144:Times:performance with respect to estimates of publication selection bias as well. 
6:124:9458:28:27:107:506:432:144:Times:144:Times:Section II introduces the four data sets used in the aggregate level meta-regression 
6:125:9543:27:28:71:481:405:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.  To maintain comparability to Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) and 
6:126:9627:28:27:71:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Viscusi (2014), I use the meta-regression sample of Bellavance, 
6:127:9718:27:28:71:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:Dionne, and Lebeau (2009) as the starting point in my analysis, but I also augment this sample 
6:128:9813:28:27:71:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:with different samples of additional studies.  The meta-regression estimates in Section III 
6:129:9905:27:28:71:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:indicate a statistically significant publication selection bias effect, but the estimated VSL after 
6:130:10005:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:adjusting for this bias is much greater for studies using the CFOI data.  In Section IV I construct 
6:131:10105:28:27:71:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:a new data set based on a large sample of individual regression results using the CFOI data.  The 
6:132:10203:27:28:71:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude and statistical significance of publication selection bias varies across the different 
6:133:10300:28:27:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:specifications and is not statistically significant based on models with clustered standard errors 
6:134:10399:27:28:71:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:and including either fixed effects or random effects.  In all specifications, the extent of the bias 
6:135:10500:28:28:71:531:129:144:Times:144:Times:for the CFOI is well below the 70-80 percent publication bias estimate found by Doucouliagos, 
6:136:10594:28:0:71:538:101:144:Times:144:Times:Stanley, and Giles (2012) for VSL studies.  The main result is that the publication-bias corrected 
7:137:10696:0:27:72:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:estimates using the CFOI data are very similar to the estimated values that are relied on for

7:140:10808:27:28:70:334:626:144:Times:144:Times:II. AGGREGATE META-ANALYSIS DATA SETS 
7:141:10845:28:28:108:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:The first set of examination of the role of publication selection bias will utilize four data 
7:142:10939:28:27:72:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:sets.  Each of these data sets is based on a “best-set” approach in that a best or preferred single 
7:143:11039:27:28:71:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:estimate from each study is generally used.  Sample 1 is the Bellavance, Dionne, and Lebeau 
7:144:11131:28:27:71:499:515:144:Times:144:Times:(2009) meta-regression analysis sample used in the publication selection bias analysis of 
7:145:11221:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) and Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Viscusi (2014).  That 
7:146:11314:28:28:71:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:sample consists of 39 VSL estimates drawn from 37 different studies.  Sample 2 augments 
7:147:11402:28:27:71:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:Sample 1 by including estimates from 14 VSL studies using the estimates from studies using the 
7:148:11497:27:28:71:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:CFOI data that were not included in Sample 1.  The additional estimates incorporated in the 
7:149:11589:28:27:71:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:sample are all based on the semi-logarithmic wage equation estimates using the author’s 
7:150:11677:27:28:71:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:preferred specification.  Sample 3 adds to Sample 2 the six studies that were included in the 
7:151:11771:28:27:71:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:meta-analysis of labor market estimates in Viscusi and Aldy (2003) but which are not already 
7:152:11864:27:28:71:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:included in Sample 2.  Finally, Sample 4 restricts Sample 3 to only those studies using U.S. data, 
7:153:11963:28:28:71:220:267:144:Times:144:Times:leading to a sample size of 39. 
7:154:11995:28:27:107:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 summarizes the sample characteristics for the variables that will play some role 
7:155:12084:27:28:71:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:in the analysis.  The average of the VSL estimates ranges from $10 million for Sample 4 to $12 
7:156:12179:28:27:71:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:million for Samples 1-3, where all estimates in this article are in $2010 based on the CPI-U.  Due 
7:157:12278:27:28:71:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:to the skewed nature of the distribution, the sample mean is above the median VSL of $8.9 
7:158:12368:28:28:71:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:million ($2010) in the meta-analysis in Viscusi and Aldy (2003).  Interestingly, the lowest 
7:159:12460:28:0:71:512:101:144:Times:144:Times:observed VSL estimates among the four samples considered here are for the U.S. Sample 4 
8:160:12551:0:27:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:notwithstanding the positive income elasticity of VSL.  This result is not too surprising in that 
8:161:12649:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:the explanatory variables included in the U.S. analyses are often more comprehensive including, 
8:162:12745:28:27:72:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:for example, a measure of workers’ compensation benefits and the nonfatal injury rate, each of 
8:163:12840:27:28:72:383:626:144:Times:144:Times:which may affect the estimated compensation for fatality risks.   
8:164:12906:28:28:108:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:The two variables that will be used to capture publication selection bias effects are the 
8:165:12996:28:27:72:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:standard error (Std. Error) and the Variance of the VSL estimates.  The average standard errors 
8:166:13092:27:28:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:of the VSL estimates are about one-third of the size of the VSL estimates for all four samples.   
8:167:13190:28:27:108:494:515:144:Times:144:Times:Three other variables will be included in various regression analyses.  The most 
8:168:13271:27:28:72:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:important of these is CFOI, which is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 for VSL 
8:169:13365:28:28:72:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:estimates based on CFOI fatality rate data, and 0 otherwise.  The share of studies in the different 
8:170:13465:28:27:72:507:432:144:Times:144:Times:samples relying on CFOI data ranges from a low of 8 percent for Sample 1 to a high of 44 
8:171:13554:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:percent for Sample 4, with Samples 2 and 3 being intermediate cases with just under one-third of 
8:172:13651:28:27:72:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:the studies based on CFOI data.  The Ln Income variable is the natural log of the sample’s 
8:173:13742:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:average income level.  Workers’ Compensation is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 
8:174:13839:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:if the wage equation included a workers’ compensation variable, and 0 otherwise.  About one-
8:175:13931:27:28:72:463:295:144:Times:144:Times:fifth of the studies controlled for the effect of Workers’ Compensation on wages. 
8:176:14013:28:28:108:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:One can obtain a general sense of the possible presence of a publication selection bias by 
8:177:14104:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:considering a funnel plot of the VSL estimates in which the precision of the estimate (the inverse 
8:178:14203:27:28:72:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:of the standard error) is on the vertical axis and the VSL (in millions of $2010) is on the 
8:179:14295:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:horizontal axis.  Meta-regression analyses of VSL generally assume that the estimates reported 
8:180:14390:27:28:72:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:are an unbiased sample.  If there is no publication bias and the assumptions underlying the 
8:181:14482:28:28:72:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:regression model are satisfied, the estimates should be independent of their standard error and 
8:182:14578:28:0:71:515:101:144:Times:144:Times:should be symmetrically distributed around the mean estimated value.  This property is best 
9:183:14673:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:suited to analyzing situations in which there is a single true population parameter.  The funnel 
9:184:14770:27:28:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:plot approach excludes the influence of other factors in the analysis that may influence the 
9:185:14863:28:27:72:506:653:144:Times:144:Times:estimates such as the presence of substantial heterogeneity in the levels of VSL across the 
9:186:14955:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:different samples.  The shape of the distribution should be similar to that of an inverted funnel if 
9:187:15056:28:28:72:313:598:144:Times:144:Times:there are no selection effects or reporting biases.   
9:188:15110:28:27:108:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 1 presents a funnel plot of VSL estimates for Sample 3.  The circles indicate 
9:189:15195:27:28:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:estimates based on the CFOI data, and the triangles indicate estimates using other fatality rate 
9:190:15292:28:27:72:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:data.  The funnel plot is highly skewed, with the outliers in terms of both precision and size of 
9:191:15390:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:the VSL estimates being from studies that did not use the CFOI data.  The non-CFOI studies 
9:192:15481:28:28:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:have estimates along the vertical axis with low VSL and high precision as well as estimates 
9:193:15573:28:27:72:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:along the horizontal axis with low precision and high VSL.  The very low estimates of VSL are 
9:194:15667:27:28:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:the most precisely estimated.  The CFOI estimates are more tightly clustered with more moderate 
9:195:15763:28:27:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:levels of precision and less extreme VSL estimates. Notably, the distribution of VSL estimates is 
9:196:15861:27:28:72:478:350:144:Times:144:Times:truncated as none of the estimates is negative, which is consistent with the theory of 
9:197:15948:28:27:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:compensation differentials.  However, given the pattern of VSL estimates that are often clustered 
9:198:16046:27:28:72:499:295:144:Times:144:Times:along the vertical axis, one would have expected similar clustering for negative values if 
9:199:16137:28:28:72:340:267:144:Times:144:Times:negative values had not been selectively screened out.   
9:200:16194:28:27:108:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:Best-set sample analyses are not well-suited to analyzing the possibility of negative VSL 
9:201:16284:27:28:72:482:212:144:Times:144:Times:estimates.  The emphasis of the best-set sample approach is on the author’s preferred 
9:202:16370:28:27:72:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:specification.  This approach will tend truncate the distribution and omit any negative VSL 
9:203:16462:27:28:72:507:157:144:Times:144:Times:estimates, as negative VSL results are unlikely to be an economist’s chosen specification.  
9:204:16554:28:28:72:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:However, the all-set CFOI sample in Section IV that utilizes a comprehensive set of regression 
9:205:16649:28:0:72:519:101:144:Times:144:Times:results finds that negative VSL estimates sometimes are published despite being inconsistent 
10:206:16745:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:with theoretical predictions.  Similarly, the underlying studies that comprise the Bellavance et al. 
10:207:16846:27:28:72:336:681:144:Times:144:Times:(2009) sample likewise include some negative values.

10:209:16902:27:28:66:474:626:144:Times:144:Times:III. META-REGRESSION ESTIMATES OF PUBLICATION SELECTION BIAS 
10:210:16962:28:28:108:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:The tests for publication bias will involve a series of different regressions involving a 
10:211:17052:28:27:71:512:570:144:Times:144:Times:similar methodology where these models adhere to the accepted norms for meta-regression 
10:212:17140:27:28:71:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:analyses of publication selection effects (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012).  In the basic model in 
10:213:17238:28:27:71:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:which the Std. Error is included in the equation to account for publication selection bias, the 
10:214:17334:27:28:71:190:488:144:Times:144:Times:equation takes the form: 
10:215:17359:28:28:71:686:460:144:Times:144:Times:                                                VSLi = α0 + α1 Std. Errori + εi.                                                    (1)                                                    
10:216:17546:28:27:107:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:A statistically significant estimate of α1 is evidence of publication selection effects in that 
10:217:17642:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:the reported VSL estimates are correlated with the estimated Std. Error as opposed to having a 
10:218:17737:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:symmetrically distributed funnel plot.  This coefficient is the regression analysis counterpart of 
10:219:17836:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:the funnel asymmetry test.  The estimated VSL after adjusting for publication selection effects is 
10:220:17935:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:given by the constant term α0. Thus, as the Std. Error goes to zero, the constant term equals the 
10:221:18033:27:28:72:390:295:144:Times:144:Times:expected value of VSL corrected for publication selection effects. 
10:222:18100:28:28:108:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:One can undertake a similar analysis using the Variance of the VSL estimate rather than 
10:223:18188:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:the Std. Error.  Simulation studies suggest that the inclusion of the Variance in the equation is a 
10:224:18288:27:28:72:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:preferable correction for the role of publication selection effects (Stanley and Doucouliagos 
10:225:18382:28:27:72:374:184:144:Times:144:Times:2012).  The Variance counterpart to equation 1 takes the form: 
10:226:18445:27:0:72:688:157:144:Times:144:Times:                                                VSLi = β0 + β1 Variancei + ei.                                                     (2)                                                     
11:227:18635:0:27:108:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:As in the case of equation 1 using the Std. Error, the coefficient β1 reflects the influence 
11:228:18728:27:28:72:499:681:144:Times:144:Times:of publication selection effects.  The constant term β0 is the estimated VSL corrected for 
11:229:18819:28:27:72:213:653:144:Times:144:Times:publication selection effects. 
11:230:18850:27:28:108:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:To capture the potential effect of the CFOI fatality rate data on estimates of the VSL, I 
11:231:18940:28:28:72:467:598:144:Times:144:Times:explore two additional specifications in which the CFOI variable is also included: 
11:232:19023:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:                                     VSLi = α0′ + α1′ Std. Errori + α2′ CFOIi + εi′  (3) 
11:233:19112:27:28:72:92:543:144:Times:144:Times:and 
11:234:19116:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:                                     VSLi = β0′ + β1′ Variancei + β2′ CFOIi + ei′.  (4) 
11:235:19203:27:28:108:495:488:144:Times:144:Times:The coefficients α1′ and β1′ reflect the influence of publication selection effects.  
11:236:19289:28:28:72:488:460:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, the constant terms α0′ and β0′ will correspond to the estimated average VSL 
11:237:19376:28:27:71:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for both publication bias and the use of CFOI data.  One can readily calculate this 
11:238:19472:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:average VSL estimate and its confidence interval based on the estimated constant term and its 
11:239:19566:28:27:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:standard error.  However, my main interest here is whether the use of CFOI data affects the 
11:240:19658:27:28:72:499:350:144:Times:144:Times:estimated VSL after accounting for publication bias effects.  In particular, are α2′ and β2′ 
11:241:19750:28:27:71:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant, and how do they influence the average VSL?  Conditional on using the 
11:242:19846:27:28:71:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:much more reliable CFOI data, what is the estimated VSL?  That mean value is given by α0′ + α2′ 
11:243:19941:28:28:71:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:for the Std. Error formulation and by β0′ + β2′ for the variance formulation.  When reporting the 
11:244:20039:28:27:71:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:VSL and its confidence interval for the equations including the CFOI variable I will do so for 
11:245:20134:27:28:71:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:estimates in which the CFOI variable take on a value of 1 and publication selection effects are 
11:246:20230:28:27:72:159:184:144:Times:144:Times:set equal to zero.  
11:247:20250:27:28:108:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:The errors associated with the different VSL estimates are likely to exhibit substantial 
11:248:20339:28:28:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:heterogeneity.  As a result, the estimates of equations 1 – 4 will utilize a weighted least squares 
11:249:20439:28:0:72:518:101:144:Times:144:Times:(WLS) model using the inverse of the variance of each of the VSL estimates as the weights.  
12:250:20535:0:27:72:498:708:144:Times:144:Times:This approach is known as the precision-effect estimate with standard error (Stanley and 
12:251:20624:27:28:72:185:681:144:Times:144:Times:Doucouliagos 2012).    
12:252:20647:28:27:108:526:653:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 reports the estimates of the Standard Error versions of the model in equation 1 
12:253:20735:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:and equation 3 for each of the four samples.  In every instance there is evidence of statistically 
12:254:20834:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:significant publication bias effects.  These biases are all positive, indicating that the effect of the 
12:255:20938:28:27:72:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:bias is to boost the estimated VSL.  The magnitudes of the coefficients of the Std. Error terms 
12:256:21034:27:28:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:range from 3.2 to 3.4 in Panel A and from 2.9 to 3.1 in Panel B.  The size of the publication bias 
12:257:21133:28:27:72:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:effect is noteworthy since a coefficient of 2 or more in the Std. Error version of the model is 
12:258:21229:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:generally viewed as a sign of substantial publication bias (Doucougliagos, Stanley, and Giles

12:260:21330:28:27:108:525:432:144:Times:144:Times: The mean estimates of the VSL implied by the constant terms in the four equations in 
12:261:21416:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:Panel A of Table 2 all indicate a VSL on the order of $1 million, about an order of magnitude 
12:262:21510:28:27:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:below the mean values for each sample in Table 1. The findings in Panel B of Table 2 likewise 
12:263:21604:27:28:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:indicate publication bias effects that have somewhat smaller point estimates than in Panel A.  
12:264:21699:28:27:72:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:The constant term estimates remain in a similar range around $1 million except for Sample 4 for 
12:265:21795:27:28:72:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:which the constant term is small and not statistically significant.  Notably the CFOI variable is 
12:266:21893:28:28:72:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:strongly significant in all instances, implying a CFOI premium above the average publication 
12:267:21986:28:27:72:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:bias-adjusted VSL of $2.5 million for Sample 1 to $4.1 million for the U.S. sample of studies in 
12:268:22083:27:28:72:123:212:144:Times:144:Times:Sample 4. 
12:269:22093:28:27:108:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:The 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) for VSL at the bottom of each panel in Table 2 
12:270:22181:27:28:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:do not include the average VSL for each of the samples.  However, in the case of estimates based 
12:271:22278:28:0:72:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:on the CFOI data in Panel B of Table 2 the upper end of the confidence intervals is higher than in 
13:272:22381:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:Panel A and closer to many estimates of VSL in the literature, as it is in the $5 million to $6 
13:273:22477:27:28:72:142:681:144:Times:144:Times:million range. 
13:274:22492:28:27:108:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:The counterpart estimates of equations 2 and 4 based on the Variance rather than the Std. 
13:275:22582:27:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:Error appear in Table 3.  These values, which are the empirically preferred estimates based on 
13:276:22677:28:28:72:489:598:144:Times:144:Times:studies of the relative performance of Std. Error and Variance approaches to capturing 
13:277:22764:28:27:72:507:570:144:Times:144:Times:publication selection effects, consistently indicate a strong publication bias effect in every 
13:278:22859:27:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:equation.  However, the constant terms that reflect the average VSL excluding the role of all 
13:279:22953:28:27:72:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:other variables in the equation are larger in Table 3 than in Table 2.  For Panel A these average 
13:280:23051:27:28:72:488:488:144:Times:144:Times:VSL amounts range from $2.1 million in Sample 1 to $3.7 million in Sample 4. These 
13:281:23134:28:28:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:differences in the constant terms in Panel A can be traced to the greater share of CFOI estimates 
13:282:23232:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:in some of the samples, particularly Sample 4.  The intercepts reported for the Panel B equations 
13:283:23330:27:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:that include the CFOI variable are tightly clustered in the $1.8 million - $1.9 million range.  The 
13:284:23430:28:27:72:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:CFOI variables are positive and all strongly statistically significant, with the average CFOI 
13:285:23524:27:28:72:318:350:144:Times:144:Times:premium ranging from $3.9 million - $4.7 million. 
13:286:23574:28:27:108:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:The estimated VSL levels based on the Variance versions of the models are greater than 
13:287:23661:27:28:72:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:the VSL estimates for the Std. Error models in Table 2.  The Panel A estimates in Table 3 imply 
13:288:23757:28:28:72:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:average VSL amounts of $2 million to $4 million, with a high of $6 million for the upper end of 
13:289:23853:28:27:72:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:the confidence interval for Sample 4.  However, after accounting for the influence of CFOI 
13:290:23944:27:28:72:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:estimates in Panel B of Table 3, the mean of the VSL estimates is in the $6 million to $7 million 
13:291:24042:28:27:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:range, which still reflects substantial publication bias effects, but the extent of the bias is less 
13:292:24143:27:28:71:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:than in Panel A. The upper ends of the VSL confidence intervals are $8 million to $9 million, 
13:293:24237:28:28:71:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:which remain below the sample means but are much closer to these values than the overall 
13:294:24326:28:0:71:177:101:144:Times:144:Times:effects from Panel A. 
14:295:24352:0:27:108:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:The final set of regression estimates using these four samples includes several different 
14:296:24442:27:28:71:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:explanatory variables.  In particular, I add the Ln Income of the sample and whether the study 
14:297:24537:28:27:71:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:included a Workers’ Compensation variable.  The Ln Income variable should have a positive 
14:298:24627:27:28:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:effect due to the positive income elasticity of VSL, and Workers’ Compensation should have a 
14:299:24720:28:28:71:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:negative effect as this form of insurance coverage reduces wage premiums for risk.  These 
14:300:24810:28:27:71:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:equations differ from those reported in Table 3 of Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) in 
14:301:24904:27:28:71:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:that instead of a time trend variable I include the CFOI indicator.  Thus, the effect of the CFOI 
14:302:25002:28:27:71:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:variable is broken out separately, and the average effects on the intercept of all previous eras of 
14:303:25102:27:28:71:322:488:144:Times:144:Times:fatality rate data are reflected in the constant term.   
14:304:25159:28:28:107:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:The rationale for distinguishing CFOI apart from a temporal trend is that the role of the 
14:305:25249:28:27:71:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:temporal trend is that the studies have become refined over time, particularly in terms of the 
14:306:25344:27:28:71:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:fatality rate data that they use.  There have been several improvements in the fatality rate data 
14:307:25442:28:27:71:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:that influence the VSL.  Consider, for example, the effect on the VSL of the transition from the 
14:308:25539:27:28:71:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:early BLS industry fatality rate data to the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality data, which 
14:309:25637:28:27:71:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:was a precursor to the CFOI data developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
14:310:25733:27:28:71:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:Health.  Use of this newer fatality rate variable alone led to a doubling of the estimated VSL 
14:311:25828:28:28:71:504:267:144:Times:144:Times:based on estimates of otherwise identical equations, due to the reduction in the amount of 
14:312:25919:28:27:71:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:measurement error in the fatality rate variable (Moore and Viscusi 1988).  Indeed, the important 
14:313:26016:27:28:71:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:role of measurement error in the fatality rate measure had been a prominent, long-standing theme 
14:314:26113:28:27:71:377:184:144:Times:144:Times:in the VSL literature dealing with studies in the pre-CFOI era.3

14:319:26539:15:11:72:519:85:100:Times:100:Times:These critiques either predated the use of CFOI data in labor market estimates of VSL or were not aware of the 
14:320:26650:11:0:72:353:74:100:Times:100:Times:CFOI data and did not include the CFOI-based studies in the critique. 
15:321:26724:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:zero, the value of CFOI equal to 1, and with all other variables evaluated at their mean values for 
15:322:26824:27:28:72:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:the sample.  The mean VSL estimates range from $4 million to $5 million for the Std. Error 
15:323:26915:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:formulations of the model in Panel A of Table 4 to a range from $7 million to $8 million for the 
15:324:27012:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:Variance version.  The broadest confidence intervals for the VSL estimates are for Sample 1, for 
15:325:27109:28:28:71:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:which the range is from $2 million to $8 million for the Std. Error formulation, and from $5 
15:326:27202:28:27:71:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:million to $12 million for the Variance formulation.  The narrowest confidence interval range is 
15:327:27299:27:28:71:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:for the U.S. Sample 4, where the range is $3 million to $5 million for the Std. Error formulation 
15:328:27397:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:and $5 million to $8 million for the model in which the Variance is used to capture publication 
15:329:27493:27:28:72:504:488:144:Times:144:Times:bias selection effects.  The role of publication selection bias is statistically significant and 
15:330:27590:28:28:72:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:reduces the VSL, but the VSL estimates based on CFOI data are at levels more similar to the 
15:331:27682:28:27:72:256:432:144:Times:144:Times:observed distribution in the literature.

15:333:27725:28:27:69:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:IV. PUBLICATION SELECTION BIAS ESTIMATES FOR A SAMPLES OF CFOI STUDIES 
15:334:27795:27:28:107:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:Given the difference in the publication bias-corrected estimates of the VSL for the studies 
15:335:27887:28:27:71:502:322:144:Times:144:Times:based on the CFOI data, it is useful to explore the role of publication bias using a sample 
15:336:27979:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:consisting of only studies that utilized the CFOI data.  However, rather than focusing on a single 
15:337:28078:28:28:72:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:preferred estimate from each study, I include a comprehensive set of  regression estimates, thus 
15:338:28175:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:avoiding any selection effects in terms of which estimates are included in the meta-regression 
15:339:28270:27:28:72:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.  Unlike the best-set approach, this “all-set” sample incorporates the entire range of 
15:340:28366:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:estimates from a particular study and their heterogeneity.  The resulting sample consists of 487 
15:341:28463:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:observations drawn from 15 different studies.  The Appendix summarizes the list of the studies 
15:342:28558:28:0:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:used in this analysis and the procedure for constructing this sample.  The estimated VSL for the 
16:343:28659:0:27:72:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:CFOI sample is fairly similar to that for Samples 1-4, with a mean value of $14.013 million and 
16:344:28755:27:28:72:240:681:144:Times:144:Times:a standard error of $6.246 million. 
16:345:28791:28:27:108:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 2 provides the funnel plot of the VSL estimates for the CFOI sample.  There is 
16:346:28877:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:some positive skewness in the distribution, as there was in Figure 1, but much of the distribution 
16:347:28976:28:28:72:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:exhibits more of a reasonable funnel shape than in Figure 1.  The large number of estimates in 
16:348:29071:28:27:72:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:the $5 million to $15 million VSL range displays a funnel-shaped distribution.  The estimates in 
16:349:29168:27:28:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:this range also exhibit the greatest precision. Unlike Figure 1 in which there were no negative 
16:350:29264:28:27:72:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:VSL estimates, Figure 2 includes several negative values.  There is also less clustering of 
16:351:29356:27:28:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:estimates along the vertical axis than in Figure 1, as there are fewer outliers observed in Figure 2 
16:352:29457:28:28:72:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:in terms of estimates with very low VSL and high precision.  Nevertheless, the distribution of 
16:353:29552:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:VSL estimates is positively skewed as many of the more extreme estimates in Figure 2 stem 
16:354:29642:27:28:72:545:405:144:Times:144:Times:from unique aspects of the particular studies, which we will account for in the statistical analysis.  
16:355:29745:28:27:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:The principal outliers that induce skewness in the distribution are the large positive estimates that 
16:356:29847:27:28:72:346:350:144:Times:144:Times:are also coupled with relatively low levels of precision.   
16:357:29907:28:27:108:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:The CFOI sample analysis includes estimates of several different models for both the Std. 
16:358:29997:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:Error and the Variance formulations of the model.  The first equation to be estimated is the basic 
16:359:30096:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:equation 1 for Std. Error and equation 3 for Variance, using a WLS approach.  Because there are 
16:360:30192:28:27:72:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:multiple observations for any particular study, in brackets we report the pertinent clustered 
16:361:30286:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:standard errors where the errors are clustered on the particular article. The robust standard errors 
16:362:30387:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:are reported in parentheses.  All coefficient estimates and the associated confidence intervals that 
16:363:30488:27:28:72:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:are reported for this sample include both the robust standard errors as well as the clustered 
16:364:30582:28:0:72:150:129:144:Times:144:Times:standard errors. 
17:365:30603:0:27:108:529:708:144:Times:144:Times: The second estimation approach is a fixed effects model including fixed effects for the 
17:366:30692:27:28:72:497:681:144:Times:144:Times:different articles s in the sample.  This approach captures the article-specific factors that 
17:367:30786:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:influence the average estimated VSL for the sample.  These influences include differences in 
17:368:30879:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:sample composition as well as differences in econometric specification.  Thus, we report fixed 
17:369:30974:28:28:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:effects estimates for the Std. Error model of the equation for this unbalanced panel, given by 
17:370:31069:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:                                         VSLis = α0′′ + α1′′ Std. Erroris + as + εis  (5) 
17:371:31159:27:28:72:266:543:144:Times:144:Times:and for the Variance model we estimate 
17:372:31198:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:                                         VSLis = β0′′ + β1′′ Varianceis + bs + eis.  (6) 
17:373:31287:27:28:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:We also estimate each of these equations using a random effects framework where the article-
17:374:31379:28:28:71:481:460:144:Times:144:Times:specific intercepts as and bs are random effects in the model rather than fixed effects. 
17:375:31468:28:27:72:534:432:144:Times:144:Times: Although both fixed effects and random effects models are reported below, based on the 
17:376:31555:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:Hausman test one can reject the hypothesis that the article-specific effects are uncorrelated with 
17:377:31654:28:27:71:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:the other regressors in the equation.  The differences between the coefficients in the models are 
17:378:31752:27:28:71:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:strongly statistically significant at the 0.000 level for the Std. Error model and at the 0.002 level 
17:379:31854:28:27:71:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:for the Variance model.  Thus, for this sample the fixed effects model estimates are consistent, 
17:380:31951:27:28:71:304:295:144:Times:144:Times:but the random effects model estimates are not.  
17:381:32000:28:28:71:503:267:144:Times:144:Times: Table 5 reports the estimation results for the Std. Error models in Panel A and the 
17:382:32084:28:27:71:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:Variance models in Panel B.  For both the Std. Error and Variance specifications based on WLS, 
17:383:32179:27:28:71:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:the publication selection bias terms are statistically significant and positive, as in the previous 
17:384:32279:28:27:71:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:estimates based on more aggregative data.  The magnitudes of the publication bias effects are 
17:385:32373:27:28:71:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:considerably diminished.  For the estimates in Panel A the coefficients of the Std. Error term 
17:386:32468:28:28:71:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:range from 0.3 to 0.7, whereas the earlier results were about one and half time the size of the 
17:387:32564:28:0:71:518:101:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient level of 2 that is a sign of substantial publication bias.  For the estimates utilizing 
18:388:32668:0:27:72:498:708:144:Times:144:Times:either a fixed effects or a random effects model, the publication bias terms are no longer 
18:389:32759:27:28:71:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant based on the clustered standard errors that account for the multiple 
18:390:32854:28:27:71:195:653:144:Times:144:Times:observations per article.   
18:391:32882:27:28:107:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:The intercept terms, which are the estimates of the VSL after accounting for the influence 
18:392:32973:28:28:71:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:of publication selection bias, are about an order of magnitude greater than the earlier results for 
18:393:33073:28:27:71:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:the Std. Error model estimates in Table 2 and at least five times greater than the intercepts for the 
18:394:33175:27:28:71:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:Variance model estimates in Table 3.  The mean estimated VSL based on the Std. Error models 
18:395:33267:28:27:71:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:ranges from $9 million to $12 million, and for the Variance model the estimates are from $9 
18:396:33359:27:28:71:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:million to $14 million.  The upper ends of the confidence intervals reach a high value of $16 
18:397:33453:28:28:71:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:million for the fixed effects Std. Error model and $15 million for the fixed effects Variance 
18:398:33547:28:27:71:107:432:144:Times:144:Times:model. 
18:399:33554:27:28:107:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:The adjustments for article-specific differences using either a fixed effects or a random 
18:400:33644:28:27:71:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:effects model lead to higher estimates of VSL than the WLS results.  In the case of the Variance 
18:401:33741:27:28:71:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:specifications, the confidence interval for the VSL based on the WLS estimates lies below and 
18:402:33835:28:27:71:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:does not overlap with the confidence intervals based on either the fixed effects or random effects 
18:403:33934:27:28:71:113:295:144:Times:144:Times:model.   
18:404:33943:28:28:71:516:267:144:Times:144:Times: The reduction in the mean value of VSL from the sample mean of $14 million to the 
18:405:34025:28:27:71:491:239:144:Times:144:Times:levels shown in Table 5 produces estimated values of the VSL similar to those used by 
18:406:34111:27:28:71:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:government agencies based on the most reliable estimates.  The publication bias selection 
18:407:34201:28:27:71:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:adjustment and the accounting for article-specific differences dampen the influence of some of 
18:408:34296:27:28:71:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:the more extreme outliers.  For example, the VSL estimates exploiting the panel data aspect of 
18:409:34391:28:28:71:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:the Panel Study of Income Dynamics reported in Kniesner et al. (2012) are considerably smaller 
18:410:34486:28:0:71:532:101:144:Times:144:Times:than the overall estimates using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in Kniesner, Viscusi, and 
19:411:34584:0:27:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:Ziliak (2006) in which there is no accounting for worker-specific effects.  Thus, the publication-
19:412:34682:27:28:71:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:corrected estimates of the VSL lie in a quite reasonable range based on the characteristics of the 
19:413:34781:28:27:71:119:653:144:Times:144:Times:studies.    
19:414:34793:27:28:71:83:626:144:Times:144:Times:    
19:415:34797:28:28:69:169:598:144:Times:144:Times:V. CONCLUSION 
19:416:34810:28:27:107:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:These findings indicate a potentially statistically significant role of publication bias in 
19:417:34902:27:28:71:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:estimates of the value of a statistical life.  The bias adjustment may be quite substantial.  This 
19:418:35001:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:result holds for the best-set samples based on individual estimates from a large series of studies 
19:419:35100:27:28:71:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:as well as in some specifications for the all-set sample of regression results based solely on the 
19:420:35199:28:28:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:CFOI fatality rate data.  However, the clustered standard error results for the all-set estimates 
19:421:35297:28:27:71:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:using either fixed effects or random effects models based on studies relying on the CFOI data do 
19:422:35394:27:28:72:359:405:144:Times:144:Times:not indicate statistically significant publication bias effects. 
19:423:35459:28:27:108:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:In assessing the implications of the meta-regression analyses for estimates of VSL, the 
19:424:35547:27:28:72:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:role of different eras of fatality rate data is consequential.  The estimates for four different 
19:425:35644:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:samples of studies found that there was a CFOI premium of $2 million - $4 million for the Std. 
19:426:35739:27:28:72:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:Error model estimates and $4 million - $5 million for the Variance model estimates. These 
19:427:35829:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:higher values are consistent with the reduced measurement error associated with the CFOI data. 
19:428:35924:28:27:108:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:The estimates based solely on the individual regression results utilizing individual 
19:429:36009:27:28:72:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:regression estimates and the CFOI data generate larger VSL estimates than the results of the 
19:430:36102:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:more broadly based best-set samples.  The estimated mean values are $9 million - $12 million 
19:431:36195:27:28:72:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:for the Std. Error equations and $9 million to $14 million for the Variance equations, which are 
19:432:36292:28:28:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:below the sample mean estimate of the VSL using the CFOI data of $14 million.  However, the 
19:433:36384:28:0:72:540:101:144:Times:144:Times:estimated publication-bias corrected estimates of VSL are very similar to or somewhat above the 
20:434:36484:0:27:72:495:708:144:Times:144:Times:$9.1 million level for VSL adopted for policy assessment purposes by the U.S. Dept. of 
20:435:36571:27:28:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:Transportation (2013) based on its review of a series of VSL studies using CFOI data.  An 
20:436:36661:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:inventory by Viscusi (2014) of the VSL amounts used from 1985 to 2013 in 98 U.S. regulatory 
20:437:36753:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:impact analyses found that agencies employed levels of VSL that ranged from $1.2 million to 
20:438:36845:28:28:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:$9.6 million in $2010.  Early policy assessments of the VSL were at the low end of this range, 
20:439:36940:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:and more recent policy values have been at or near the upper end of that range.  Even these high 
20:440:37037:27:28:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:levels that have been used for policy purposes are consistent with the mean publication-bias 
20:441:37130:28:27:72:325:515:144:Times:144:Times:corrected estimates of VSL based on the CFOI data. 
20:442:37181:27:28:108:531:488:144:Times:144:Times: The confidence intervals for the estimated VSL based on the CFOI data are reasonably 
20:443:37267:28:28:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:tight, but they sometimes include the average VSL amount for the entire sample.   Nevertheless, 
20:444:37363:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:the publication-bias corrected estimates of VSL for the CFOI sample produces estimates more in 
20:445:37458:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:line with the average VSL levels that are generated once high estimate outliers are excluded.     
20:446:37556:28:27:72:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:Accounting for publication selection effects reduces the VSL to the levels that are consistent 
20:447:37651:27:28:72:498:350:144:Times:144:Times:with the studies in the literature that are generally viewed as most reliable based on their 
20:448:37744:28:27:72:187:322:144:Times:144:Times:econometric approach.

21:450:37773:0:27:72:289:708:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix. Description of the CFOI Data Set 
21:451:37816:27:28:108:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:The CFOI sample is based on the individual regression results reported in 15 articles. A 
21:452:37905:28:27:72:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:detailed review of the characteristics of these CFOI studies appears in Viscusi (2013). The 
21:453:37997:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:sample included VSL estimates from the following articles: Aldy and Viscusi (2008), Evans and 
21:454:38091:28:28:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:Schaur (2010), Hersch and Viscusi (2010), Kniesner and Viscusi (2005), Kniesner et al. (2012), 
21:455:38186:28:27:72:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:Kniesner, Viscusi, and Ziliak (2006, 2010, 2014), Scotton (2013), Scotton and Taylor (2011), 
21:456:38279:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:Viscusi (2003, 2004 2013), Viscusi and Aldy (2007), and Viscusi and Hersch (2008).  Note that 
21:457:38373:28:27:72:434:515:144:Times:144:Times:the VSL estimates have been transformed to 2010 dollars using the CPI-U. 
21:458:38446:27:28:108:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:In some cases, the paper did not include information that made it possible to calculate the 
21:459:38538:28:28:72:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:standard error (SE) of the VSL.  In the case of Kniesner and Viscusi (2005), and estimates in 
21:460:38632:28:27:72:515:432:144:Times:144:Times:Kniesner et al. (2012), the procedure used followed that of Bellavance, Dionne, and Lebeau 
21:461:38723:27:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:(2009).  The first stage involves an OLS regression of SE(VSL) on sample size.  Based on saving 
21:462:38819:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:the constant term (α) and the coefficient of sample size (β), the SE(VSL) is calculated based on 
21:463:38916:27:28:72:321:350:144:Times:144:Times:the equation: SE(VSL) = VSLx[α + β sample size]. 
21:464:38965:28:27:108:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:One estimate of $158 million VSL ($2010) from Scotton and Taylor (2011) was excluded 
21:465:39050:27:28:72:497:295:144:Times:144:Times:because it pertained only to a specific, narrowly defined class of fatalities--homicides to 
21:466:39142:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:transportation drivers—rather than typical job accidents affecting a broad class of workers.  Two 
21:467:39240:28:27:72:529:239:144:Times:144:Times:studies—Leeth and Ruser (2003) and Kochi and Taylor (2011)—were excluded because of the 
21:468:39328:27:28:72:346:212:144:Times:144:Times:infeasibility of constructing standard errors for the VSL.
