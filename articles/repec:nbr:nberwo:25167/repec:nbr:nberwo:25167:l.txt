2:32:1685:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:We  extend  the  control  function  approach  of  Altonji  and  Mansfield  (2018)  to  allow  for  multiple 
2:33:1793:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:group levels and complementarities. Our analysis provides a foundation for causal interpretation 
2:34:1889:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:of  multilevel mixed  effects  models  in  the  presence  of  sorting.  In  our  empirical  application,  we 
2:35:1997:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:obtain  lower  bound estimates  of  the  importance  of  school  and  commuting  zone  inputs  for 
2:36:2095:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:education  and  wages.  A  school/location combination  at  the  90th  versus  10th  percentile  of  the 
2:37:2199:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:school/location  quality  distribution  increases the  high  school  graduation  probability  and  college 
2:38:2305:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:enrollment  probability  by  at  least  .06  and  .17,  respectively. Treatment  effects  are  heterogeneous 
2:39:2413:14:42:71:476:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:across subgroups, primarily due to nonlinearity in the educational attainment model.

3:59:2909:0:27:91:190:732:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1    Introduction
3:60:2926:27:17:107:523:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Designers of policy interventions often must choose whether to target neighborhoods, schools,
3:61:3019:17:16:91:523:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or broader local or regional areas.  They would like to know which policies are most effective for
3:62:3117:16:17:91:523:672:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each area, but research has been very slow in providing answers (Katz 2015). In this paper, we focus
3:63:3217:17:16:91:523:655:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the more modest goal of measuring the overall importance of neighborhoods, schools, and local
3:64:3313:16:17:91:523:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:areas for adult outcomes. Information about where inequality arises provides guidance about where
3:65:3410:17:19:91:494:622:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the most potential progress can be made, even if it does not provide a specific plan of action.
3:66:3505:19:16:107:523:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The efficacy of particular policies and the relative importance of neighborhood vs.  school.  vs.
3:67:3602:16:17:91:523:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:broader local area factors is likely to vary across students.  For example, school-level dropout pre-
3:68:3703:17:16:91:523:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vention policies may improve outcomes for struggling students but not stronger or better-supported
3:69:3801:16:17:91:523:554:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:students,  while  opening  a  satellite  campus  of  a  flagship  research  university  might  benefit  high
3:70:3909:17:16:91:523:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:achieving low income students the most.  Such considerations motivate us to work with a multi-
3:71:4003:16:16:91:523:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level mixed effects (MME) model in which individual characteristics interact with observed and
3:72:4097:16:20:91:280:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobserved school and area characteristics.
3:73:4140:20:16:107:523:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The use of MME models (also known as hierarchical linear models and random coefficients
3:74:4227:16:17:91:523:469:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models) was stimulated by interest in the interplay among the student, classroom, and school factors
3:75:4327:17:16:91:523:452:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that determine educational outcomes.1However,  the MME literature is mindful of but does not
3:76:4419:16:16:91:523:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:address sorting bias arising from school and neighborhood choice. As Durlauf (2004) and Graham
3:77:4513:16:17:91:523:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2018)  emphasize,  differences  in  outcomes  across  neighborhoods  combine  the  causal  effects  of
3:78:4616:17:16:91:523:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood with differences across neighborhoods in the observed and unobserved attributes of
3:79:4711:16:20:91:498:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:children that matter for their outcomes. Sorting poses similar problems for assessing schools.
3:80:4805:20:16:107:523:367:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our main methodological contribution is to address the sorting problem present in MME mod-
3:81:4895:16:17:91:523:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:els.  We do this by using a flexible production function specification and a rich but tractable model
3:82:4996:17:16:91:523:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of school and neighborhood choice to derive exact formulas relating the slope parameters and error
3:83:5094:16:16:91:523:318:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:component variances of a standard MME specification to the corresponding production function pa-
3:84:5190:16:17:91:523:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rameters. We then use these formulas combined with MME estimates to characterize the importance
3:85:5285:17:19:91:490:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of school and location choices for students’ long-run education and labor market outcomes.
3:86:5375:19:17:107:523:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We postpone precise statements of our theoretical results and the assumptions, but the questions
3:87:5471:17:16:91:523:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about MME models that we address and the answers that we give may be summarized as follows.
3:88:5562:16:36:91:324:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Consider the following MME level regression model:

4:100:6618:17:16:91:523:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients and error variances are defined to be what one recovers using a random effects estimator

4:105:7031:17:16:91:523:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sorting-driven differences across school/locations in unobserved student characteristics as well as

4:107:7233:17:19:91:142:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameters.
4:108:7244:19:16:107:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We then build upon and extend to an interactive setting the control function approach of Altonji
4:109:7340:16:17:91:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Mansfield (2018) (hereafter,  AM). In particular,  they show that even a flexible version of a
4:110:7438:17:16:91:523:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:standard multinomial choice model implies a relationship between school/neighborhood averages of
4:111:7534:16:17:91:523:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed student characteristics and averages ofunobservedstudent characteristics. Consequently,
4:112:7630:17:16:91:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school/neighborhood averages of observed student characteristics(XXXg)can serve as controls for the
4:113:7729:16:17:91:523:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:averages of unobserved student characteristics that would otherwise bias estimates of the importance
4:114:7829:17:19:91:247:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of school and neighborhood effects.
4:115:7864:19:16:107:523:395:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:A:Under somewhat stronger assumptions (discussed below) we show that the coefficient vectorrrr2

4:128:9053:19:17:107:523:179:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also show that AM’s expression forGGG2, the coefficient vector on the main effects of observed
4:129:9150:17:16:91:523:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school and area characteristics, remains unchanged when observed and unobserved interactions are
4:130:9246:16:17:91:523:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:introduced to the production function.  Specifically,  it picks up the causal effect of the observed
4:131:9346:17:16:91:523:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school and area characteristics plus a second component that reflects their association with unob-
4:132:9444:16:17:91:523:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:served school and area characteristics that affect outcomes. It is not contaminated by sorting bias or
4:133:9546:17:0:91:523:96:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobserved interactions.  AM’s result that school and neighborhood error componentsvgare simi-

5:135:9744:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Finally, we also justify a causal interpretation for a random slope coefficient onMithat captures
5:136:9841:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the interaction of an observed student characteristic with an index of unobserved school and area

5:138:9954:19:17:107:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Taken together, these identification results reveal that even in the presence of endogenous sorting
5:139:10053:17:16:91:523:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of individuals to groups, multilevel mixed effects estimates can distinguish among four sources of
5:140:10151:16:17:91:523:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the variation in outcomes. The sources are individual contributions that are common across groups,
5:141:10249:17:16:91:523:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group contributions that are common across individuals, contributions that consist of interactions
5:142:10347:16:16:91:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between student and group inputs, and a set of ambiguous contributions (associated withXXXgGGG1)
5:143:10443:16:17:91:523:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that either reflect common group inputs or group-averages of individual inputs.  We then show that
5:144:10541:17:16:91:523:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this decomposition is sufficient to generate meaningful (albeit conservative) answers to two key
5:145:10637:16:17:91:523:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions.   How much do the schools and locations we choose for our children matter for their
5:146:10731:17:16:91:523:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes?  And how much does the importance of schools and locations depend on the students’
5:147:10823:16:19:91:200:516:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and parents’ own inputs?
5:148:10847:19:17:107:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:A:As in AM’s analysis, the use of school/location averages of observed student characteristicsXXXg
5:149:10943:17:16:91:523:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to control for school/location averages of unobserved characteristics is likely to lead to an under-
5:150:11043:16:17:91:523:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statement of the importance of school and neighborhood.  The main reason is that by treating the
5:151:11139:17:16:91:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:averages as controls that absorb sorting bias, we are discarding the main effects of peers on out-
5:152:11237:16:17:91:523:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:comes.  A second reason is that the group averages will absorb a portion of the unobserved school
5:153:11334:17:16:91:523:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or area components that are uncorrelated with the observed components and are correlated with the
5:154:11431:16:17:91:523:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amenities that families sort on. Consequently, our analysis only places a lower bound on the overall
5:155:11531:17:19:91:352:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:importance of school and area factors for student outcomes.
5:156:11590:19:16:107:523:362:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We use the above analysis as the theoretical foundation to interpret MME model estimates from
5:157:11683:16:17:91:523:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two cohort-specific panel surveys, the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS88)
5:158:11779:17:16:91:523:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the Educational Longitudinal Survey of 2002 (ELS2002). These data sets provide a rich set of
5:159:11875:16:17:91:523:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:student characteristics for samples of students from each of a large sample of schools. Students are
5:160:11975:17:16:91:523:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:followed for several years, which permits investigation of longer run outcomes such as high school
5:161:12073:16:16:91:523:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:graduation, attendance at a four year college, and attainment of a college degree.  In addition, they
5:162:12174:16:20:91:432:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contain location of residence (ZIP code or block group) and school identifiers.
5:163:12253:20:16:107:523:244:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We use the multilevel model estimates to measure the consequences of exposure to a low-quality
5:164:12347:16:17:91:523:228:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school versus a high-quality school, and a low-quality commuting zone versus a high-quality com-
5:165:12443:17:16:91:523:211:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:muting zone.  Here we define “quality” narrowly as collections of attributes that contribute to the
5:166:12542:16:16:91:523:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes we consider (educational attainment or log wages).  Our main results concern the “treat-
5:167:12639:16:17:91:524:179:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ment effects” of 10th-to-90thpercentile shifts in school quality, in commuting zone quality, and in
5:168:12738:17:16:91:523:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:combined school and commuting zone quality.   First,  we consider average effects.   We take the
5:169:12834:16:17:91:523:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average over the student population of the effect of a 10th-to-90thpercentile shift in the combined
5:170:12933:17:16:91:523:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school/commuting zone environment. Such a shift increases the high school graduation probability
5:171:13029:16:17:91:523:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by 0.088 in NELS88 and by about 0.061 in ELS2002 (which has a higher baseline graduation rate–
5:172:13123:17:0:91:523:96:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0.92).  The effect of the school treatment is 0.06 in NELS and about 0.044 in ELS. The values for
6:173:13221:0:19:91:469:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the 10th-to-90thquantile shift in commuting zone quality are between 0.039 and 0.067.
6:174:13306:19:16:107:523:713:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For  the  college  enrollment  probability,  the  combined  school  and  commuting  zone  treatment
6:175:13405:16:17:91:523:697:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect is between 0.17 and 0.18 for both NELS and ELS. The values for the school treatment are
6:176:13499:17:16:91:523:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about 0.125, while the values for the commuting zone treatment are about 0.115 in each dataset.
6:177:13594:16:17:91:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The effects of the combined treatment, the school treatment and the commuting zone treatment on

6:179:13785:16:17:91:523:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and 0.046 in NELS and around 0.085,  0.070,  and 0.065 in ELS). For wage rates at age 25,  the
6:180:13879:17:16:91:523:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:combined school and commuting zone treatment ranges between 11 and 12 percent. The values for
6:181:13972:16:16:91:523:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the school treatment range from 6.2 to 7.1 percent.  The commuting zone effects range from 7.8 to
6:182:14069:16:17:91:523:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:10.7 percent.  Overall, the results suggest that large changes in school and commuting zone inputs
6:183:14167:17:19:91:466:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can make a substantial difference for students’ educational attainment and wage rates.
6:184:14253:19:17:107:523:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also present estimates of school and commuting zone “treatment” effects for particular pop-
6:185:14347:17:16:91:523:529:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ulation groups:  blacks, Hispanics, whites with single mothers who did not attend college, whites
6:186:14444:16:16:91:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with two resident parents with college degrees, as well as for students at each percentile of an index
6:187:14546:16:17:91:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of student level variables that predict the outcomes.  We do not find strong evidence that wages or
6:188:14645:17:16:91:523:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the latent indices governing the binary educational attainment outcomes depend on the interaction
6:189:14742:16:17:91:523:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between observed student characteristics and characteristics of the school and commuting zone,
6:190:14836:17:16:91:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:although we cannot rule out modest interactions.  Nevertheless, we do find important differences
6:191:14932:16:17:91:523:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in treatment effects across students.  The heterogeneity is primarily due to the fact that the probit
6:192:15033:17:16:91:523:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function that we use for the education outcomes naturally imposes greater sensitivity to school and
6:193:15132:16:17:91:523:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:location environment for students predicted to be close to the decision margin.  Specifically, high
6:194:15231:17:16:91:523:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school graduation rates of subpopulations that tend to be disadvantaged are particularly sensitive to
6:195:15332:16:16:91:523:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the external environment, while few students from advantaged subpopulations are near the margin.
6:196:15428:16:17:91:523:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For college enrollment and college graduation, superior school and commuting zone inputs are im-
6:197:15524:17:16:91:523:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:portant for all, but particularly important for students near or above the middle of the distribution of
6:198:15628:16:20:91:229:316:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:student and family background.
6:199:15658:20:16:107:523:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, we provide a richer picture of sorting than is possible with two level models featuring
6:200:15754:16:16:91:523:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual  and  school  (Coleman  et  al.   1966;  Jencks  and  Brown  1975;  Betts  1995;  Altonji  and
6:201:15859:16:17:91:523:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Mansfield 2011; Alexander and Morgan 2016) or individuals and neighborhood (Solon et al. 2000).
6:202:15954:17:16:91:523:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We find that segregation by student quality (defined by an index of characteristics that promote
6:203:16050:16:17:91:523:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:education and wages) is primarily across schools and commuting zones rather then within ZIP code
6:204:16146:17:16:91:523:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or block group among schoolmates. Our variance decompositions of educational attainment and
6:205:16237:16:17:91:523:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages consistently show that individual level factors account for the lion’s share of the variance,
6:206:16336:17:16:91:523:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with school and commuting zone level variation making modest contributions, and neighborhood
6:207:16428:16:16:91:523:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level factors playing a smaller role.  For example, in ELS2002 for college attendance, the within-
6:208:16526:16:17:91:523:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood (block group) share is 71.4 percent, while the neighborhood share is 3.1 percent, the
6:209:16624:17:16:91:523:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school share is 15.9 percent, and the commuting zone share is 9.7 percent. School and commuting
6:210:16719:16:17:91:523:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zone account for about 9 and 6 percent of the variance in log wages respectively, and block group
6:211:16816:17:0:91:523:99:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:within a school accounts for about 3%.  Within a school there is very little clustering in any of our
7:212:16918:0:19:91:228:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes at the ZIP code level.

7:233:18804:17:16:91:523:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Graham (2018).5Many of the papers emphasize that estimates of the impacts of particular
7:234:18895:16:16:91:523:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics, such as percent minority, segregation measures, and poverty rates on socioeconomic

7:236:19095:17:16:91:523:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bias. A good example is Card and Rothstein (2007), who carefully address the issue in their analysis

7:244:19801:16:19:91:523:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood effects on student outcomes. They obtain small estimates, in contrast to Chyn (2018).

9:293:24415:17:16:91:523:655:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the discussion here so that the assumptions required for identification of the main effects of school

9:295:24622:17:16:91:523:622:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  AM)  will  be  clear.We  use  the  terms  “area”  or  “location”  to  refer  to  the  joint  influence  of
9:296:24732:16:16:91:523:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood and commuting zone inputs. Throughout the paper, matrices, vectors, and matrix- or

9:301:25193:16:16:91:523:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also implicitly involves the choice of a commuting zonec.  In our main specification we assume

11:375:30389:33:16:107:523:536:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The proof is in AM. Proposition 1 states that the sorting model introduced in this section implies
11:376:30487:16:17:91:523:520:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the vectorXXXgcan serve as a set of controls forXXXUg.  This is key to distinguishing the causal
11:377:30588:17:16:91:523:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effects of school and location on outcomes from sorting on unobservable student characteristics that
11:378:30688:16:16:91:523:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:affect these outcomes.  The intuition behind the proposition is thatXXXUgandXXXgare related acrossg
11:379:30787:16:17:91:523:471:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:because bothXXXiandXXXUiinfluence tastes forAAAg. As a result the meansXXXUgandXXXgare both functions
11:380:30888:17:16:91:523:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ofAAAg, and under A1-A5, the maps fromAAAgtoXXXgand fromAAAgtoXXXUgdetermines a map fromXXXgto
11:381:30982:16:20:91:196:438:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:C:XXXUgthat takes form (7).9
11:382:31008:20:16:107:523:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:AM provide a detailed discussion of the assumptions. We will not repeat that discussion here, but
11:383:31105:16:16:91:523:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a few words about A4 and A5 are in order. A sufficient condition for A4 is that the joint distribution
11:384:31207:16:17:91:523:386:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of[XXXi,,,XXXUi,,,QQQi]is a member of the continuous elliptical class.  This class includes the normal, the
11:385:31314:17:16:91:523:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Laplace,  and  the  multivariate  exponential  power  family.   In  our  applicationXXXiincludes  several
11:386:31419:16:17:91:523:353:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discrete variables, so the sufficient condition will not be satisfied. AM show that if the assumption
11:387:31520:17:16:91:523:336:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:fails, an approximation error will appear in (7) that is likely to contribute to the error componentvg
11:388:31622:16:17:91:523:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of (1) and lead to some upward bias in our estimator of the importance of school/location effects.
11:389:31720:17:19:91:432:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:But AM also provide reasons to believe the approximation error will be small.
11:390:31797:19:16:107:523:284:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We consider the spanning condition A5 to be the key assumption for Proposition 1; it ensures
11:391:31889:16:17:91:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thatXXXgfully determinesXXXUg. Roughly speaking, two conditions must hold forXXXUgto be a function
11:392:31987:17:16:91:523:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ofXXXg. The first is that the number of elements ofXXXimust be greater than or equal to the number of
11:393:32088:16:17:91:524:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amenities thatXXXiand/orXXXUiaffect tastes for.  Otherwise,AAAgand thusXXXUgwill vary conditional on
11:394:32188:17:19:91:115:218:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:C:XXXg.10
11:395:32195:19:23:107:524:199:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The second condition is that there cannot exist any elements ofXXXUithat are both uncorrelated
11:396:32289:23:15:107:524:176:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:9Note that the proposition characterizes the relationship betweenexpected valuesof observable and unobservable
11:397:32399:15:11:91:523:161:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:student characteristics conditional on choice of school and neighborhood;  the exact linear dependence need not hold
11:398:32515:11:11:91:523:150:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:when samples of students are taken at each school.  However, AM provide a monte carlo analysis suggesting that (7) is
11:399:32632:11:11:91:523:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:a good approximation even with samples of 20 students at each school (around the number observed per school used to
11:400:32747:11:8:91:261:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:constructXXXsin the samples we employ below).
11:401:32792:8:14:103:523:120:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:10The plausibility of the first condition depends on the number and breadth of coverage of the variables inXXXi.  The
11:402:32909:14:11:91:524:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:condition implies that the number of factors that determineXXXgis less than or equal toL. AM formally test this restriction
11:403:33032:11:0:91:314:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:and find that the number of factors is considerably less thenL.

12:406:33302:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution of these remainingXXXUielements across schools in a way thatXXXgcannot predict. While
12:407:33400:16:16:91:523:683:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this condition is untestable without further structure, we have struggled to find an example of an
12:408:33498:16:39:91:522:667:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:unobserved variable that would cause its violation given the rich set ofXXXivariables that we have.11

12:412:33842:16:16:91:523:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:counterpart from AM but 1) introduces potential interactions or complementarities between indi-

14:507:41993:28:16:107:524:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We now return to the MME model (1) for the outcomeYithat we started with in the introduction,

14:511:42381:16:17:91:523:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and error components estimated via a random effects procedure allow us to divide the contribu-

14:513:42571:16:17:91:523:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consists of the main effect of student inputs on the outcome.  Its effect is common across groups
14:514:42668:17:16:91:523:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(school/location combinations).  The second component consists of the main effect of group-level
14:515:42764:16:17:91:523:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inputs.  These effects are common to all students.  The third consists of interactions between stu-
14:516:42863:17:16:91:523:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dent inputs and group inputs.  The fourth component is associated with the control functionXXXg.  It

15:525:43712:17:16:91:523:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:among the roles of unobserved neighborhood characteristics, unobserved school characteristics, and

16:577:46903:29:16:107:523:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Assumption  A6  says  thatD ̃xUiDMiis  uncorrelated  with[XXXg,ZZZ2g].   It  addresses  a  potentially
16:578:47005:16:17:91:523:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important identification problem.  The variation that identifies interaction effects in our estimating
16:579:47107:17:16:91:523:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equation consists of differences in the strength of the relationship between individual characteris-
16:580:47207:16:16:91:523:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tics and outcomes across groups with different values of group characteristics (e.g. student-teacher
16:581:47307:16:17:91:523:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ratio).  Suppose that the covariance between parental income (observed) and parental motivation
16:582:47402:17:16:91:523:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(unobserved) is larger in schools with smaller student-teacher ratios.  In this case, parental income
16:583:47503:16:17:91:523:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:may predict greater increases in outcomes at schools with smaller student-teacher ratios because
16:584:47599:17:16:91:523:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parental income better predicts parental motivation at such schools, even if students of richer par-
16:585:47699:16:17:91:523:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ents are not differentially sensitive to low student-teacher ratios.  If one added the interaction term

16:587:47900:16:17:91:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ifMiwas parental income, and student-teacher ratio was part ofZZZ2g, then the interaction coefficient
16:588:48001:17:0:91:456:99:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:rrr2would be affected. Such a mechanism would yield spurious “interaction” effects.
17:589:48086:0:16:107:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Assumption A6 rules out this possibility. As a result, any differential impact ofMiacross groups
17:590:48182:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with different values ofXXXgorZZZ2gcan be interpreted as evidence of true student-group interactions
17:591:48282:17:19:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rather than evidence of differential sorting-induced joint distributions of[DDDXXXi,,,DDDXXXUi]across groups.
17:592:48391:19:16:107:524:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A6 is a statement about the residual componentD ̃xUiof the unobservableDxUi, and so is not
17:593:48481:16:17:91:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:directly testable.  How plausible is it?  Note first that since (12) is a projection equation,D ̃xUiis
17:594:48583:17:16:91:523:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:orthogonal toDDDXXXi.  Thus the population mean ofD ̃xUiDMiis 0 becauseDMiis a linear function of
17:595:48680:16:17:91:523:631:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:DDDXXXi.It is possible, however that the relationship betweenDDDXXXUiandDDDXXXiand thusDMivaries across
17:596:48783:17:19:91:448:614:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:g. If in addition,E(D ̃xUiDMi|g)varies systematically withXXXgorZZZ2g, A6 will fail.
17:597:48867:19:16:107:524:595:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The model of school/location choice implies that the distribution ofXXXUiandXXXivaries with the

17:599:49059:17:16:91:523:562:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:varies linearly withXXXg,  this need not imply a violation of A6,  since A6 fully allows the means
17:600:49157:16:17:91:523:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ofMi,XXXiandXXXUito vary acrossgand even systematically withZZZ2g.  A6 can also accommodate

17:602:49341:16:16:91:519:513:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:together in the same way in each group.  Then any differential covariance betweenDMiandDDDXXXUi
17:603:49436:16:17:91:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across groups is stripped out byDDDXXXiΠΠΠDDDXXXUiDDDXXX,leaving no correlation betweenDMiand the residual

17:605:49554:19:17:107:523:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We have not found sufficient conditions concerning the distribution ofAgand[XXXi,XXXUi,QQQi]such
17:606:49650:17:16:91:523:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that A6 is exactly satisfied.  In Online Appendix B4 we describe and present results from monte

17:609:49954:17:16:91:523:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals per group.  We show that departures from A6 are truly negligible in this example:  the

17:611:50122:20:16:107:523:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A7 strengthens a zero correlation property to statistical independence.  To see this, note that the

17:614:50422:16:16:91:524:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rules out the possibility thatXXXgorZZZ2gmight be predictive of the value of the average interaction

17:620:51002:17:16:91:523:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contexts. Furthermore, we show in Online Appendix B4 that A7 nearly holds in the sorting process
17:621:51098:16:17:91:523:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:used in our monte carlo simulations, and the minor violations produce no discernable bias in the

18:656:54024:19:16:107:523:158:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:First we need to define additional projection coefficients that appear in Proposition 3.  Let the

19:667:54579:49:16:107:523:478:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:A:The proof is in Online Appendix B2. Proposition 3 states that under A1-A7 the coefficientsGGG1

19:670:54860:17:16:91:523:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consists of the causal peer effects ofXXXgandXXXUgplus the part of the effect of unobserved group inputs

20:713:57721:24:17:107:523:326:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To this point we have lumped neighborhood-level, school-level, and CZ-level variables together

21:749:60823:17:17:91:523:251:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:GGG2=ΓΓΓ2+ΠΠΠzU2gZZZ2gfrom Proposition 3.  Next, note thatzU2g≡ZZZNU2nΓΓΓNU2+ZZZSU2sΓΓΓSU2+ZZZCU2cΓΓΓCU2, and
21:750:60932:17:17:91:523:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thatZZZS2sis the school subvector ofZZZ2g.   IfZZZNU2nΓΓΓNU2is clustered at the school level and predictable
21:751:61040:17:17:91:524:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:byZZZS2s, this will be reflected in the columns ofΠΠΠzU2gZZZ2gcorresponding toZZZS2s.As a result, Proposition
21:752:61149:17:17:91:523:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:3 says that the school componentGGGS2ofGGG2will pick up part ofZZZNU2NΓΓΓNU2. Similarly, ifZZZNU2nΓΓΓNU2or

21:754:61359:16:17:91:523:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:example, if the commuting zones that feature many colleges have schools with better principals on
21:755:61456:17:30:91:524:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average, and this advantage is not predictable based on the observed school characteristicsXXXsand
21:756:61554:30:14:103:523:120:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:15One could define a school effect for a particular type of commuting zone, or an effect of the marginal distribution of
21:757:61674:14:11:91:523:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:commuting zone characteristics. We lack the statistical power to identify such effects, especially given the large number
21:758:61795:11:0:91:419:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of possibilities and the lack of guidance from prior literature, so we do not pursue this here.
22:759:61892:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:ZZZS2s, then it will be reflected inGGGC2ifZZZ2cincludes a variable capturing the number of colleges in the

22:763:62192:16:17:91:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:served school inputs that cluster at the CZ level.  For example, if the commuting zone containing
22:764:62289:17:16:91:524:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Boston has schools with better average principal quality than would be predicted byXXXgandZZZ2g,
22:765:62385:16:19:91:269:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thenvcwill be higher for the Boston CZ.
22:766:62424:19:17:107:524:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Similar issues also affect interpretation of the interaction coefficientsrrrS2andrrrC2.  Proposition 3
22:767:62526:17:17:91:523:595:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:states thatrrr2=ρρρ2+ΠΠΠZZZU2gZZZ2gρρρUUU222,whereΠΠΠZZZU2gZZZ2gis defined in (15).  The CZ subvectorrrrC2ofrrr2will
22:768:62642:17:17:91:523:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:capture not just interactions involvingZZZCU2c,but also part of interactions involvingZZZNU2nandZZZSU2sto

22:770:62829:19:16:107:523:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:What about CZ-level unobservables represented byZZZCU2cΓΓΓCU2c? If the full set of commuting zone
22:771:62926:16:17:91:523:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:averages ofZZZN2nandZZZS2swere included inZZZC2c, then we could rule out the possibility that any unob-
22:772:63029:17:16:91:524:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:served commuting zone inputs could project onto eitherZZZS2norZZZS2sand be captured byGGGN2orGGGS2.
22:773:63128:16:17:91:523:493:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This is because neighborhoods and schools are nested within commuting zones.  More generally,
22:774:63221:17:16:91:523:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with nested levels, one can prevent unobservable inputs from being captured by regressors (includ-
22:775:63319:16:17:91:523:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing interactions) associated with lower levels of aggregation by including the appropriate higher
22:776:63416:17:16:91:523:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level averages of lower-level characteristics. Thus, with nested levels one could in principle place a
22:777:63518:16:16:91:523:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lower bound on the relative importance of inputs at the lowest level (neighborhoods in our empirical
22:778:63618:16:17:91:523:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work) and an upper bound on the relative importance of inputs at the highest level (CZs). We seek
22:779:63715:17:16:91:523:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to approximate this approach, though we cannot fully implement it due to concerns about overfitting
22:780:63814:16:39:91:284:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:given limited numbers of units at each level.

22:783:63954:24:17:107:523:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We use two panel data sets, the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS88)
22:784:64043:17:16:91:523:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the Educational Longitudinal Survey of 2002 (ELS2002).16These data sources possess a num-
22:785:64136:16:17:91:523:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ber of common properties that make them well-suited for our analysis. First, each samples an entire
22:786:64235:17:16:91:523:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cohort of American students.  The cohorts are students who were 8thgraders in 1988 for NELS88,
22:787:64329:16:16:91:523:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and 10thgraders in 2002 for ELS2002.  Second, each source provides a representative sample of
22:788:64422:16:17:91:523:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:American 8thgrades and high schools,  respectively,  and samples of students are selected within
22:789:64518:17:16:91:523:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each school.  Public, private, and parochial schools are represented.17Enough students are sam-
22:790:64613:16:18:91:523:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pled from each school to permit construction of estimates of the school means of a large set of
22:791:64708:18:12:103:387:154:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:A:16The section draws heavily on Section 5 of AM, with some material verbatim.
22:792:64784:12:14:103:523:142:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:17We include private schools because they are an important part of the education landscape.  The model in Section 2
22:793:64899:14:11:91:523:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:implies that we should include group averages for the neighborhood/school pairs to control for sorting on unobservables,
22:794:65019:11:11:91:524:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:but that is not practical, because sample sizes are too small. We includeXXXsfor the school and census-based demographic
22:795:65139:11:11:91:524:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:variables at the ZIP code or block group level, which we denoteXXXneven though they include characteristics of residents
22:796:65259:11:0:91:205:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:who are not students or parents.
23:797:65293:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:student-specific variables and to provide sufficient within-school variation to support the variance
23:798:65393:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decomposition described below. Third, each survey administered questionnaires to school adminis-
23:799:65489:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:trators in addition to sampling individuals at each school.  This provides us with a rich set of both
23:800:65590:16:16:91:523:683:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual-level and school-level variables to examine, allowing a meaningful decomposition of ob-
23:801:65688:16:17:91:523:667:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:servable versus unobservable variation at both levels of observation.  Fourth, each survey contains
23:802:65787:17:16:91:523:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information on the student’s location of residence.  In the case of NELS, we observe the student’s
23:803:65885:16:17:91:523:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ZIP code in grade 8.  In ELS, we observe the student’s census block and ZIP code of residence in
23:804:65981:17:16:91:523:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:grade 10.  Observing residential location is critical for characterizing the relative contributions of
23:805:66083:16:17:91:523:601:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood versus school inputs as well as the relative importance of neighborhood versus school
23:806:66181:17:16:91:523:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amenities in driving student sorting. Finally, each survey collects follow-up information from each
23:807:66280:16:16:91:523:568:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:student past high school graduation, facilitating analysis of the impact of high school environment
23:808:66379:16:17:91:523:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on outcomes economists and policymakers particularly care about: educational attainment and wage
23:809:66475:17:19:91:114:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rates.
23:810:66481:19:17:107:523:516:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:While there is considerable overlap in the survey questionnaires associated with NELS88 and
23:811:66572:17:16:91:523:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ELS2002, we chose not to restrict attention to the set of variables that are available and measured
23:812:66671:16:16:91:523:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consistently across the two datasets.  This is because the efficacy of the control function approach
23:813:66771:16:17:91:523:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depends on the richness and diversity of our student-level measures, and using the intersection of
23:814:66869:17:16:91:523:450:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the two datasets limits the diversity of student characteristics.  In practice, the variables lists are
23:815:66972:16:17:91:523:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:similar,  as one can see in Appendix A1.    Section 5.3 describes the process by which we chose
23:816:67067:17:16:91:523:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which variables to include inXXXi,XXXn,XXXs,XXXc,ZZZS2s, andZZZC2c.  Unfortunately, the panel surveys do
23:817:67171:16:17:91:523:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not contain neighborhood-level variables, though we do merge in Census-based and LODES-based
23:818:67263:17:19:91:411:384:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood-level demographic averages to bolster the control function.
23:819:67335:19:16:107:523:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Coding  of  most  of  the  variables  is  straightforward,  but  in  some  cases  variables  are  the  first
23:820:67443:16:17:91:523:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:principal components constructed from the responses to batteries of questions about topics such as
23:821:67541:17:16:91:523:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the home environment, school policies for reducing dropout rates, and quality of school facilities,
23:822:67640:16:20:91:153:316:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:among others.
23:823:67653:20:16:107:523:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As AM discuss, a drawback of the surveys is that the number of students sampled per school is
23:824:67746:16:16:91:523:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only about 24 for NELS and 20 for ELS.18Simulation results in AM indicate that samples of this
23:825:67840:16:17:91:523:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:size may reduce to a small degree the ability of sample school averages of observable characteristics
23:826:67941:17:16:91:523:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to serve as an effective control function for variation in average unobservable student contributions
23:827:68042:16:17:91:523:231:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:across schools. In Online Appendix B4 we present additional simulations featuring estimates ofGGG2
23:828:68140:17:16:91:523:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:andrrr2from specifications in whichXXXgis formed using only 10, 20, or 40 individuals per group. We
23:829:68239:16:17:91:523:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show that the estimates are close to the corresponding true values unless the correlation between the
23:830:68340:17:16:91:524:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amenity factors and the elements ofZZZ2gis quite high.  In this case the use of small samples causes
23:831:68440:16:16:91:524:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:slight underestimates of the magnitude of the interaction coefficientsrrr2and overestimates of the
23:832:68538:16:20:91:240:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude of the main effectsGGG2.
23:833:68572:20:20:107:523:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We restrict our samples to those individuals whose school administrator filled out a school sur-

24:838:69014:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the other explanatory variables to preserve the sample size, since no other single variable is critical

24:841:69172:24:16:107:523:626:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:HSGRAD is an indicator for whether a student has a high school diploma (not including a GED)
24:842:69264:16:17:91:523:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as of two years after the high school graduation year of his/her cohort. ENROLL is an indicator for

24:846:69655:17:19:91:149:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about age 25.

24:852:70128:16:17:91:523:440:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to estimate the variance components of the mixed level models using weights.  One might want to
24:853:70223:17:16:91:523:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:use weights for three reasons. The first is to account for the stratified sampling regime used by the
24:854:70324:16:16:91:523:407:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample designers. The second is differential attrition associated with the explanatory variables. The
24:855:70425:16:17:91:523:391:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:third is because follow-up probabilities are based on outcomes.  The slope parameter estimates are
24:856:70523:17:16:91:523:374:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not sensitive to weighting, but we do not know whether weighting would affect the estimates of the
24:857:70621:16:33:91:210:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:error component variances.

24:859:70701:24:16:107:524:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:AM discuss the principles governing variable selection.XXXishould include variables that directly
24:860:70798:16:17:91:523:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:affect the outcome and/or are correlated with unobserved student level characteristics that affect the
24:861:70900:17:16:91:523:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcome.  We focus attention on a “full” specification which includes inXXXimeasures of student
24:862:70995:16:17:91:523:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:behavior, parental expectations, and student academic ability (standardized test scores). Such mea-
24:863:71094:17:16:91:523:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sures may be influenced directly by school and location inputs, so including them could cause an
24:864:71190:16:17:91:523:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:underestimate of the contribution of school and location inputs.  As a result, our lower bound esti-
24:865:71290:17:16:91:523:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mates will be too conservative. On the other hand, excluding such measures could instead cause an
24:866:71387:16:21:91:523:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:overestimate of the contribution of location- and school-level inputs if the more limited set of student

24:869:71673:8:14:103:523:142:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:20This partly contributes to the higher mean of COLLBA than ENROLL in NELS: the mean of ENROLL among
24:870:71773:14:11:91:523:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:sample members of the 3rd follow-up survey in NELS is 0.353 vs.   0.327 among those in the 2nd follow-up (when
24:871:71883:11:11:91:523:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the outcome is determined), suggesting some differential attribution is taking place.  However, transfers from two-year
24:872:72002:11:11:91:523:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:colleges and other delayed entrants to four year college could also account for a higher graduation than enrollment rate,
24:873:72123:11:0:91:242:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:given the way these outcomes are defined.
25:874:72166:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observables no longer satisfies the spanning conditionA5 stated in Proposition 1. In that case, there
25:875:72267:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:would exist differences in average unobservable student contributions to outcomes across schools
25:876:72363:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that are not predicted by the vector of school averages of observable characteristics. We also discuss
25:877:72465:16:16:91:523:683:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results for a “basic” specification that only includes student-level characteristics that are unlikely to
25:878:72570:16:20:91:381:667:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be affected by the neighborhood and high school the child attends.
25:879:72636:20:16:107:561:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For purposes of the control function,XXXgshould contain aggregates ofXXXiat the(n,s)school/neighborhood

25:887:73353:16:16:91:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for neighborhood characteristics and thus lead to sorting.  These areXXXnorXXXsvariables regardless
25:888:73452:16:17:91:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of whether the source is aggregates of the student micro data, Census data, or administrative data
25:889:73550:17:16:91:523:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the schools.  Unfortunately, we do not observe any neighborhood-level variables that are not
25:890:73647:16:17:91:524:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:population aggregates, so we do not include anyZZZN2nvariables in our empirical work.  As a result,
25:891:73746:17:16:91:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:below we primarily focus attention on the impact of shifts in school- and commuting zone-level
25:892:73840:16:17:91:524:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatments. If the composition variables included inXXXnandXXXsare sufficiently rich to plausibly sat-
25:893:73942:17:16:91:523:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:isfy the spanning assumption A5, then the coefficients on commuting-zone demographic averages

25:895:74130:17:16:91:524:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the assumptions of the model. In this case such averages may be considered part ofZZZC2c, since they
25:896:74230:16:19:91:488:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are likely to only absorb the impacts of unobserved causal commuting zone characteristics.
25:897:74320:19:17:107:523:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As  AM  discuss,  group-level  variables  such  as  a  school’s  frequency  of  fights  or  average  test
25:898:74425:17:16:91:523:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:scores that capture earlier outcomes that were jointly produced by both individual- and group-level
25:899:74524:16:17:91:523:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variables fall in a grey area.  We exclude such variables entirely from the baseline specification on
25:900:74625:17:16:91:523:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the grounds that they are determined by other observed and unobserved variables in the model.  We

25:902:74822:16:17:91:523:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the skill of teachers and the administration have a large effect on fighting and/or test scores,
25:903:74922:17:19:91:512:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:assigning these measures to the control function leads to conservative estimates of group effects.

25:906:75211:24:15:103:523:187:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:21As AM discuss, in principle the control function variables can be augmented with aggregates of outcome-irrelevant

25:909:75467:8:14:103:523:153:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:22In preliminary work we experimented with a grouped backward stepwise regression procedure to pare down the
25:910:75575:14:11:91:523:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:variable sets at each unit level.  One could also consider other procedures, such as group lasso (Meier et al.  2008; Yuan
25:911:75697:11:11:91:523:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:and Lin 2006).   Ultimately,  we chose not to use these procedures because of uncertainty about how to do statistical
25:912:75814:11:11:91:523:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:inference, about the computational feasibility, about statistical properties of a bootstrap procedure that accounts for both
25:913:75938:11:11:91:523:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:variable selection and sampling error given variable choice, and about how to correct for finite sample bias in the variance
25:914:76062:11:0:91:389:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:estimates. The three step estimation method we use is computationally demanding.

26:919:76438:16:17:91:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the demands of estimating our model are also substantial given the lack of prior information about

26:921:76632:16:17:91:523:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates is reduced by the need to work with a fairly large number ofZZZS2sandZZZC2cvariables, along

28:1083:84850:22:14:103:523:222:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:24Specifically, we assign prior distributions from which our slope parameters and random effect variances are drawn,
28:1084:84966:14:11:91:523:208:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:and use Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the means of the posterior distributions governing these parame-
28:1085:85083:11:11:91:523:197:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:ters. We use these posterior means in place of the fixed parameters defined in (23) when reporting results and computing
28:1086:85203:11:11:91:523:186:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:estimates of the impact of alternative group-level treatments below. The estimates are not very sensitive to modest changes

28:1090:85630:11:8:91:264:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:estimates of the other index standard deviations.
28:1091:85679:8:14:103:523:131:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:26The same issue arises in linear regression with one normally distributed error component.  In this case, the MLE
28:1092:85793:14:11:91:523:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:estimator of the error variance is the sum of squared residuals divided by the sample size. The unbiased estimator adjusts
28:1093:85915:11:11:91:523:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:for degrees of freedom by dividing by the sample size minus 1 plus the number of regressors. This is a restricted maximum
28:1094:86036:11:0:91:523:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:likelihood estimator (REML). Unfortunately, the REML estimator does not exist for multilevel probit models.  AM use

29:1098:86434:17:16:91:523:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the permanent component.  Consequently, we estimate the variance of the permanent component

29:1102:86802:19:17:107:523:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The standard errors in the paper are based on a bootstrap approach encompassing the entire

29:1105:87091:17:16:91:523:562:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:fact that the coefficients that define the index variables used in the second step are estimated.28

29:1108:87410:16:16:91:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:surprisingly, the disparity is even greater for the variance component estimates based on them, which

29:1111:87711:16:17:91:523:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the bootstrap distribution of our estimated variance components. The distribution of the estimates

29:1113:87911:16:17:91:523:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less sensitive to the issue.  More work on the best way to implement bias corrections and perform

29:1116:88089:23:17:107:523:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Here we describe the simple variance decomposition procedure that we use to 1) provide an
29:1117:88178:17:16:91:523:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:initial, descriptive sense of the relative importance of inputs at each level (individual, neighborhood,
29:1118:88282:16:17:91:523:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school, commuting zone) in determining the outcomes of interest, and 2) assess the degree to which
29:1119:88380:17:37:91:497:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amenities at the neighborhood, school, and commuting zone level are driving student sorting.

29:1121:88589:11:11:91:523:260:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:unbiased estimators and the ML estimators in the case of a continuous outcome. We explored the possibility of extending
29:1122:88708:11:11:91:523:249:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:AM’s approach to the four level case, but were not able to find (or derive) the necessary formulas for four-level ML and
29:1123:88828:11:8:91:232:238:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:REML variance component estimators.
29:1124:88863:8:14:103:523:230:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:27If the bias-adjusted estimate of a variance is negative, we set it to 0.  The bias-adjusted estimate of the covariance
29:1125:88983:14:11:91:523:216:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:between two terms is set to 0 if the estimate of the variance of one of the terms is 0. If the correlation between two terms
29:1126:89107:11:11:91:523:205:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:implied by bias-adjusted estimates exceeds 1 in absolute value, we adjust the covariance to make the correlation 1 in
29:1127:89224:11:8:91:145:194:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:absolute value.
29:1128:89239:8:14:103:523:186:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:28The standard error estimates are based on re-sampling commuting zones with replacement.  To preserve the size
29:1129:89350:14:11:91:523:172:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:distribution of the samples of students from particular commuting zones, we divide the sample into ten CZ sample size
29:1130:89467:11:11:91:523:161:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:classes and resample CZs within class. For CZs in the largest size class, we break the CZs into two groups, each containing
29:1131:89590:11:11:91:523:150:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:half the schools.  We sample these half CZs instead to prevent any one bootstrap cluster from accounting for too large a
29:1132:89710:11:11:91:523:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:share of the sample.  Due to the considerable computational burden of the model estimation and the simulations relative
29:1133:89829:11:11:91:523:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:to the computer resources available for use with the restricted-use versions of ELS and NELS, we use 200 replications
29:1134:89946:11:11:91:523:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:to form the bootstrap estimates.  Furthermore, we use fewer (8) MCMC chains of length 500 rather than the 30 chains
29:1135:90061:11:11:91:523:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of length 1000 that we use to compute the point estimates after first verifying that estimates are not very sensitive to this
29:1136:90186:11:0:91:329:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:choice. This might lead to an overstatement of the standard errors.
30:1137:90255:0:16:107:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To simplify the empirical analysis we define neighborhoods to be nested within schools, which
30:1138:90348:16:17:91:524:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are themselves nested within commuting zones.29We use a version of our estimating equation with
30:1139:90443:17:29:91:218:699:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:interaction terms excluded.30

30:1141:90558:33:30:107:415:637:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One can then write the outcome as the sum of orthogonal components:
30:1142:90625:30:32:217:523:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:Yi= (Yi−Yn)+(Yn−Ys)+(Ys−Yc)+Yc.(27)
30:1143:90660:32:30:107:405:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Because the components in (27) are mutually orthogonal,Var(Yi)is:
30:1144:90725:30:32:169:523:545:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:Var(Yi) =Var(Yi−Yn)+Var(Yn−Ys)+Var(Ys−Yc)+Var(Yc)(28)
30:1145:90778:32:17:107:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We are not able to fully characterize sorting on both observed and unobserved student level char-

30:1148:91070:17:16:91:524:463:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to analyze the structure of sorting on the index of observable characteristicsXXXiBBBthat best predicts

30:1151:91293:30:16:91:523:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To our knowledge,  we are the first to perform such a decomposition based on commuting zone,

30:1156:91699:17:16:91:523:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, they do not permit one to easily gauge the impact that a substantial improvement in exter-

30:1158:91894:16:17:91:523:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to models with student-specific slopes AM’s methodology for converting variance components into

30:1160:92086:16:19:91:324:216:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we describe the three distinct treatments we consider.
30:1161:92140:19:14:103:523:197:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:29In the empirical work our narrowest definition of neighborhood is the census block group. In a few cases, students
30:1162:92256:14:11:91:523:183:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:from the same block group choose different schools.  We treat students from the same block group who attend different
30:1163:92373:11:11:91:523:172:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:schools as if they live in different block groups by using school-block group combinations as our definition of a neigh-
30:1164:92493:11:11:91:523:161:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:borhood.  Nesting neighborhood within school is required by the routine we use to estimate the variances of the error
30:1165:92610:11:11:91:523:150:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:components.  But it may diminish the precision of our estimates of neighborhood and school effects on outcomes.  The
30:1166:92726:11:11:91:523:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:same issue arises when ZIP code is the neighborhood definition. Note that the choice model in Section 2 allows families
30:1167:92845:11:8:91:312:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:who live in a given neighborhood to choose different schools.

31:1172:93264:23:17:107:523:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:First, we evaluate the expected change in outcomes associated with moving a randomly cho-

31:1175:93554:17:16:91:523:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the true distribution of combined school/commuting zone quality may be defined as the distribution

33:1300:101959:20:16:107:523:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As we discuss in detail in Section 8.1.1, part of the differential sensitivity for binary outcomes

33:1303:102270:16:16:91:523:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is because some subpopulations have more students near the decision margin (as evidenced by dif-

33:1307:102500:17:16:91:523:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Section 7.2 then presents estimates of the interaction coefficients and the standard deviations of

34:1325:103973:19:16:107:523:452:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The main finding across data sets and outcomes is that individual-level factors account for the
34:1326:104068:16:17:91:523:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lion’s share of the variance, with school and commuting zone level variation making modest con-
34:1327:104163:17:16:91:523:419:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tributions,  and neighborhood level factors playing a smaller role.   In the case of HSGRAD, the
34:1328:104259:16:17:91:523:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual-level component accounts for 81.9% [77.5,  85.0] of the outcome variance for NELS,
34:1329:104352:17:16:91:523:386:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:81.6%  [75.2,  85.0]  for  the  ELS  block  group  specification,  and  85.6%  [77.2,  87.1]  for  the  ELS
34:1330:104459:16:16:91:523:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ZIP code specification.  The percentage of variance at the individual level is similar for wages and
34:1331:104559:16:17:91:523:354:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:slightly lower for college graduation. Interestingly, individual level factors are somewhat lower for
34:1332:104660:17:16:91:523:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:enrollment in a four-year college, averaging 72.3% across NELS and the two ELS specifications.
34:1333:104754:16:20:91:289:321:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:We do not have a good explanation for this.34
34:1334:104799:20:16:107:523:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The school level accounts for a substantial fraction of the variance in education outcomes. The
34:1335:104894:16:17:91:523:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average of the NELS and the ELS estimates is 9.7% for high school graduation, 15.9% for 4 year
34:1336:104988:17:16:91:523:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:enrollment, and 10.8% for COLLBA. For wages, the estimates are about 9.0% for ELS but only
34:1337:105078:16:19:91:162:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:3.1% for NELS.
34:1338:105092:19:17:107:523:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Variation at the commuting zone level accounts for between 3.9% and 6.6 of the latent variable
34:1339:105186:17:16:91:523:216:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for high school graduation, about 10% for college enrollment, between 6.2% and 7.9% for college
34:1340:105281:16:19:91:313:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:graduation and between 6.2% and 7.6% for wages.
34:1341:105328:19:17:107:523:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We were surprised to find that differences across neighborhoods among students attending the
34:1342:105420:17:16:91:523:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same schools do not account for much variation, even at the census block level. In the ZIP code case,
34:1343:105521:16:17:91:523:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the percentage varies between 0.6% and 1.3% across education outcomes. For wages the estimates
34:1344:105615:17:14:103:523:131:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:34It bears repeating that we are not using sampling weights due to computational difficulties in the second step and
34:1345:105731:14:11:91:523:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:so are not accounting for differences in designs of the ELS and NELS samples.  This could contribute to differences in
34:1346:105849:11:11:91:523:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the estimates across ELS and NELS, although we noted earlier that the first step estimates of parameters involving the
34:1347:105967:11:0:91:243:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:observables are not sensitive to weighting.
35:1348:106012:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are 0.7% for NELS and 1.1% for ELS. The ELS block group estimates are larger:  2.2% for HS-
35:1349:106103:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:GRAD, 3.1% for ENROLL, and 2.4% for COLLBA and 3.2% for wages. While the relatively small
35:1350:106192:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood component is surprising, this does not necessarily mean that neighborhood effects
35:1351:106286:16:16:91:523:683:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and neighborhood-level sorting are unimportant.  Alternatively, the high and low quality neighbor-
35:1352:106384:16:17:91:523:667:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hoods might be sufficiently grouped within school attendance zones that most of the variation in
35:1353:106480:17:16:91:523:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood inputs is across schools. As discussed in sections 4.5.1 and 6.3, the variance decom-
35:1354:106578:16:17:91:523:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positions are crafted to prevent higher-level inputs (eg., commuting zone) from being reflected in
35:1355:106676:17:16:91:523:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lower-level variance components, but between-school variation in neighborhood quality will still be
35:1356:106775:16:17:91:523:601:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:captured by the between-school variance components.  This may be reinforced by the fact that the
35:1357:106871:17:16:91:523:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ELS and NELS samples are clustered at the school level rather than at the neighborhood level.  In
35:1358:106968:16:16:91:523:568:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:addition, ZIP code may be too coarse a measure of neighborhood, with many ZIP codes containing
35:1359:107062:16:17:91:523:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a mix of both good and bad neighborhoods (so that the bulk of neighborhood variation is assigned
35:1360:107158:17:16:91:523:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the “within-neighborhood” category in Table 2). But the estimates are still relatively small when
35:1361:107258:16:33:91:404:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we use block group. Clustering is clearly much stronger across schools.

39:1549:120573:20:16:107:549:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Focusing first on the NELS results, we see that shifting from a 10thto a 90thquantile school/commuting
39:1550:120675:16:17:91:523:448:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zone increases the high school graduation probability from 0.816 to 0.904,  an increase of 0.088
39:1551:120771:17:16:91:523:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(0.014).   This is very large relative to the dropout rate.   A corresponding shift in the school en-

39:1553:120965:16:17:91:523:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes the graduation probability from 0.831 to 0.891, an increase of 0.06 (0.014). The effect of a

39:1555:121134:19:17:107:523:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The estimates for ELS are somewhat smaller.  In the ELS block group case, the “School and
39:1556:121223:17:16:91:523:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CZ” treatment raises the graduation probability by 0.062 (0.011), from 0.896 to 0.958.  The school
39:1557:121321:16:16:91:523:330:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment raises it by 0.045 (0.010), and the CZ treatment raises it by 0.041 (0.009). The values are
39:1558:121422:16:17:91:523:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:slightly smaller when we use ZIP code as the neighborhood measure.  One reason for the smaller
39:1559:121516:17:16:91:523:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ELS estimates is that the unweighted high school graduation probability in the sample is very high:
39:1560:121615:16:17:91:523:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0.92.  Thus, there is not much room for increases in the graduation probability.  Online Appendix

40:1582:123591:16:17:91:523:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substantial outcome changes? One reason is that variance components, by virtue of squaring devia-
40:1583:123688:17:16:91:523:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions, tend to exacerbate differences in the relative importance of various inputs; standard deviations
40:1584:123791:16:17:91:523:516:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of these components are considerably closer in size to those corresponding to individual-level in-
40:1585:123889:17:16:91:523:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:puts. The second reason is that for binary outcomes even a small shift in the underlying propensity

42:1698:132522:19:17:107:523:155:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Note that the impacts of school and commuting zone on this outcome are considerably larger
42:1699:132612:17:16:91:523:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than  those  for  high  school  graduation.   For  NELS  a  partial  explanation  lies  in  the  fact  that  the
42:1700:132724:16:17:91:523:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fraction  of  the  variance  inYi(the  latent  index)  that  is  attributed  to  school  and  commuting  zone
42:1701:132833:17:0:91:523:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inputs is 0.033 for ENROLL and 0.022 for HSGRAD (Appendix Table A1). However, the variance
43:1702:132925:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:components underlying the ELS block group and ELS ZIP code counterfactuals are very similar in
43:1703:133019:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude to those used for the high school graduation counterfactuals (0.030 ofVar(Yi)in each
43:1704:133113:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:case). Instead, the larger estimated impacts for college enrollment primarily reflect the fact that the
43:1705:133216:16:16:91:523:683:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:college enrollment probability (0.327 in NELS and 0.422 in ELS, from Table 1-1) is much closer to
43:1706:133313:16:17:91:523:667:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0.5 than for high school graduation (0.853 in NELS and 0.919 in ELS). The probit model assumes a
43:1707:133409:17:16:91:523:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:normal distribution of unobserved inputs, so that an outcome mean of .5 suggests that many students
43:1708:133508:16:17:91:523:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are near the decision margin. Thus, the same change in the latent probit index translates to a much
43:1709:133607:17:19:91:348:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:greater shift in outcome probability for college enrollment.

43:1715:134059:17:16:91:523:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model implies that more disadvantaged subpopulations have fewer students near the decision mar-
43:1716:134154:16:16:91:523:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gin, so that the largest impacts occur for the most advantaged subgroup (in this case, white students
43:1717:134255:16:17:91:523:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with two college-graduate parents) and the lowest value is for the most disadvantaged subgroup
43:1718:134349:17:16:91:523:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(children of single white mothers with education less than or equal to high school).  The impacts
43:1719:134446:16:17:91:523:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the “School and CZ” treatment on the enrollment probability range from 0.116 to 0.213.  The
43:1720:134540:17:16:91:523:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“School only” treatment displays slightly higher effects than the “CZ only” treatments with similar
43:1721:134639:16:17:91:523:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:degrees of heterogeneity: impacts range from 0.086 to 0.154 for “School only” and 0.075 to 0.142
43:1722:134735:17:16:91:523:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the “CZ only” treatment. The estimates of the treatment effects for the ELS ZIP code and block
43:1723:134833:16:16:91:523:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group specifications follow the same pattern as in NELS, although the subgroup estimates fall in a
43:1724:134931:16:20:91:160:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:narrower range.
43:1725:134946:20:16:107:523:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 3 shows the relationship between the treatment effects on college attendance probability
43:1726:135041:16:17:91:524:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the quantiles ofXXXiBBB.The impact of the counterfactual treatments is non-monotonic inXXXiBBB,
43:1727:135140:17:16:91:523:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increasing and then decreasing as one moves through the distribution ofXXXiBBB. For example, for the
43:1728:135240:16:16:91:523:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“School and CZ” counterfactual in NELS, the estimated impact for the 10th, 75th(near the maximum
43:1729:135336:16:20:91:423:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:impact), and 90thquantiles ofXXXiBBBare 0.062, 0.253, and 0.218, respectively.
43:1730:135414:20:16:107:523:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The pattern occurs despite the fact that in the NELS case the coefficient on the interaction be-

43:1732:135625:17:16:91:523:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution may be due to this.  However, the pattern is primarily due to a striking fact about the
43:1733:135725:16:16:91:523:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variation in predicted outcome probabilities acrossXXXiBBBquantiles that is established in Figure 1a.
43:1734:135826:16:17:91:523:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In NELS (solid light line) for a school/CZ combination of median quality, the predicted enrollment

43:1737:136122:17:16:91:523:125:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:student aptitude measures (as of 8thgrade) predict enrollment at a four-year postsecondary insti-
43:1738:136219:16:0:91:523:109:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tution.  Consequently, very few students near the bottom of theXXXiBBBdistribution are in a position
44:1739:136321:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where higher quality school inputs would be enough to push them over the decision margin, even if
44:1740:136418:16:19:91:413:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they are slightly more sensitive to school quality than the average student.
44:1741:136494:19:17:107:523:697:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In fact, the ELS ZIP code specification provides a good opportunity to assess the importance
44:1742:136586:17:16:91:524:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the interaction terms in the model.  First,̂sd(ZZZC2cGGGC2)))is substantial, so that there is more signal
44:1743:136694:16:17:91:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contained in this regression index with which to identify true interactions.  Second, the interaction
44:1744:136795:17:16:91:523:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients  on  1(LowInc)×ZZZC2cGGGC2and  1(U RM)×ZZZC2cGGGC2are  seemingly  non-negligible  in  size
44:1745:136898:16:17:91:523:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(albeit still noisily estimated): 0.050 and 0.054 respectively (Table 4 Panel B).  This suggests greater
44:1746:137002:17:16:91:523:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sensitivity of students from modest backgrounds and minority students to CZ inputs.  Third,  the
44:1747:137098:16:16:91:523:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:variance components for the “CZ only” treatment,Var(ZZZC2cGGGC2+vc), contribute 1.26% ofVar(Yi)
44:1748:137193:16:17:91:524:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:when interactions are included and 1.24% ofVar(Yi)when they are excluded.  This means that we
44:1749:137286:17:16:91:523:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can directly compare treatment effects based on the models with and without interactions essentially
44:1750:137386:16:17:91:523:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:holding fixed the importance of the main effects. Indeed, the mean impact of the 10th-90th“CZ only”
44:1751:137485:17:19:91:331:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment on ENROLL is 0.118 for both specifications.
44:1752:137538:19:16:107:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As it turns out,  none of the subgroups we consider displays more than a 0.002 difference in
44:1753:137630:16:17:91:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment  effects  between  the  linear  and  non-linear  specification.   While  the  imprecision  of  our
44:1754:137738:17:16:91:523:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interaction  estimates  cautions  against  overinterpreting  the  results,  our  limited  evidence  suggests
44:1755:137846:16:17:91:523:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the probit function seems to be doing an effective job of capturing heterogeneity in sensitivity
44:1756:137947:17:33:91:321:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to higher quality school and commuting zone inputs.

44:1760:138229:16:17:91:523:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that replacing a combined school/commuting zone at the 10thquantile of the quality distribution
44:1761:138324:17:16:91:524:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with one at the 90thquantile increases the college graduation probability by 0.085 (0.016) (from
44:1762:138420:16:17:91:523:325:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:0.309 to 0.394).  Shifting only school inputs or only CZ inputs from their respective 10thto 90th
44:1763:138517:17:16:91:523:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quantiles increases the graduation probability by 0.077 (0.18) and 0.046 (0.019), respectively.  The
44:1764:138617:16:16:91:523:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small increase in impact from shifting school and CZ quality together relative to the impact of the
44:1765:138716:16:17:91:524:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:separate shifts is partly due to an estimated small negative covariance betweenZZZS2sGGGS2andZZZC2cGGGC2.
44:1766:138821:17:7:91:523:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:It also reflects the fact that doubling a variance only increases the standard deviation by a factor of

44:1770:139022:16:16:91:523:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tively, with the ELS ZIP code estimates displaying slightly smaller magnitudes. Switching from the
44:1771:139120:16:17:91:523:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:full specification to the basic specification (displayed in Online Appendix Table B9) increases the
44:1772:139219:17:19:91:273:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates for each dataset by about 0.015.
44:1773:139261:19:17:107:523:155:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The three treatments have a smaller effect on the college graduation probability than the enroll-
44:1774:139358:17:16:91:523:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ment rate. We do not have a complete explanation for this, but three possibilities are worth mention-
44:1775:139459:16:17:91:523:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing.  First, School and CZ inputs may play a bigger role in inducing students to attend a four-year
44:1776:139558:17:0:91:523:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:college than to successfully complete college. The second and related point is that marginal students
45:1777:139661:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who are induced to enroll in a four-year college as a result of superior school and CZ inputs may
45:1778:139758:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:graduate at lower rates.  Finally, there is considerable attrition in the sample between the survey in
45:1779:139860:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which ENROLL is measured (2nd and 3rd Follow-ups for NELS and ELS, respectively) and the

45:1791:140882:17:16:91:523:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the counterfactual impacts are substantially larger for the “School only” specification than the “CZ

45:1796:141371:16:19:91:171:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to another in ELS.

45:1809:142404:16:17:91:523:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the treatment would raise log wages by 0.045 (a 4.6% wage increase). In comparison, the standard

45:1811:142599:17:14:103:523:120:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:39As discussed in Section 5, the mean of ENROLL among sample members of the 3rd follow-up survey in NELS

46:1817:143133:19:16:107:523:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The effect of the 10th-90thcommuting zone treatment is larger than the school treatment in both
46:1818:143228:16:17:91:523:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:NELS and in ELS, in contrast to what we found for education. One would expect commuting zone
46:1819:143320:17:16:91:523:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics to be particularly important for wages, where opportunities in the local labor market
46:1820:143421:16:19:91:156:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are paramount.
46:1821:143435:19:17:107:523:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Since the wage model is linear, the only source of treatment effect heterogeneity consists of the

46:1823:143637:16:33:91:337:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small, so we do not find important subgroup differences.

46:1825:143745:24:16:107:523:522:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:A:There are several broad takeaways from the estimated impacts of counterfactual 10th-to-90th
46:1826:143836:16:17:91:523:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quantile shifts in school and/or commuting zone inputs. First, large changes in school and commut-
46:1827:143934:17:19:91:463:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing zone inputs can make a substantial difference in students’ educational attainment.
46:1828:144020:19:17:107:523:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, the impact of these inputs is quite heterogeneous across disadvantaged vs. advantaged
46:1829:144113:17:16:91:523:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:students.  The dropout rates of disadvantaged students are particularly sensitive to the external en-
46:1830:144214:16:16:91:523:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vironment, while few advantaged students are near the margin.  In contrast, for college enrollment
46:1831:144312:16:17:91:523:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and graduation, superior school and commuting zone inputs are important for all, but particularly
46:1832:144409:17:16:91:523:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consequential for students near (or above) the middle of the distribution of student and family back-
46:1833:144510:16:20:91:125:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ground.
46:1834:144517:20:16:107:523:368:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Third,  the more general model featuring interactions between student and school/commuting
46:1835:144607:16:16:91:523:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zone inputs produces predicted impacts of shifts in school and commuting zone environment that
46:1836:144701:16:17:91:523:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differ little from the results using the simpler probit specification without interactions. This suggests
46:1837:144806:17:16:91:523:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the nonlinearity inherent in the probit function does a fairly good job of capturing differential
46:1838:144908:16:17:91:523:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sensitivity to school and region-level inputs, and that a linear specification for the probit index may
46:1839:145011:17:16:91:523:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suffice in similar contexts.  But this need not be true in other applications and the estimates of the
46:1840:145113:16:19:91:254:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interaction coefficients are imprecise.
46:1841:145152:19:17:107:523:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally,  both school and commuting zone inputs seem to be important, and with comparable
46:1842:145241:17:16:91:523:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:magnitudes.  However, this conclusion is more tentative, because we cannot fully distinguish be-
46:1843:145337:16:39:91:425:218:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tween unobservable school inputs and unobservable commuting zone inputs.
46:1844:145409:39:28:91:181:179:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:9    Conclusion
46:1845:145424:28:16:107:523:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Educational attainment and wages, like many adult outcomes, are influenced by factors that are
46:1846:145518:16:17:91:523:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specific to the individual as well as aspects of the broader social environment. In this paper, we build
46:1847:145622:17:16:91:523:118:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the rich literature on sorting, school and neighborhood effects, and multilevel modeling to assess
46:1848:145723:16:0:91:523:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the relative importance of neighborhood, school, and broader local area factors in shaping student’s
47:1849:145825:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educational attainment and early career wages,  and the degree to which this relative importance
47:1850:145921:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differs across students from different backgrounds.  We extend the identification results of Altonji
47:1851:146021:17:16:91:523:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Mansfield (2018) to models with multiple group levels and with interactions between observed
47:1852:146117:16:16:91:523:683:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual factors and both observed and unobserved group level factors. The identification results
47:1853:146216:16:17:91:523:667:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are based on the idea that group averages of individual-level observables can fully control for sorting
47:1854:146319:17:16:91:523:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bias from group averages of individual-level unobservables. A natural but challenging extension to
47:1855:146417:16:20:91:493:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our analysis would be to incorporate interactions with unobserved individual characteristics.
47:1856:146510:20:16:107:523:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our theoretical results demonstrate the existence of a structural decomposition of variation in
47:1857:146605:16:16:91:523:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educational and labor market outcomes of interest into four components:  (1) individual contribu-
47:1858:146702:16:17:91:523:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions that are common across groups, (2) group contributions that are common across individuals,
47:1859:146798:17:16:91:523:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(3)  contributions  that  consist  of  interactions  between  student  and  group  inputs,  and  a  (4)  set  of
47:1860:146910:16:17:91:523:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ambiguous contributions, absorbed by our control function of group-level averages, that reflect a
47:1861:147007:17:19:91:435:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:combination of common group inputs and group-averages of individual inputs.
47:1862:147082:19:16:107:523:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We implement this structural decomposition using a multilevel mixed effects model, and use the
47:1863:147176:16:17:91:523:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results to generate lower bound estimates of the average impact among the student population of
47:1864:147271:17:16:91:523:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“treatments” consisting of shifts in school, commuting zone, and combined school/commuting zone
47:1865:147366:16:17:91:523:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quality from the 10thto the 90thquantile of their respective distributions. We also produce estimates
47:1866:147467:17:16:91:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for particular student subpopulations that exploit the treatment effect heterogeneity accommodated
47:1867:147565:16:19:91:152:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by our model.
47:1868:147578:19:17:107:523:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Despite accounting for a small share of the total variance in the latent indices that generate our
47:1869:147676:17:16:91:523:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:binary outcomes, our population average estimates suggest that school and commuting zone inputs
47:1870:147771:16:17:91:523:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:play an important role in determining educational attainment.  Moving from a school/commuting
47:1871:147864:17:16:91:524:362:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zone combination at the 10thquality quantile to a 90thquantile combination increases the probability
47:1872:147964:16:17:91:523:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of high school graduation by at least 0.06-0.09 across datasets and specifications, the probability of
47:1873:148066:17:16:91:523:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:enrollment at a four-year college by at least 0.17-0.18, and the probability of college graduation by at
47:1874:148170:16:17:91:523:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:least 0.08-0.09. School and commuting zone inputs seem to play a roughly equal role in producing
47:1875:148266:17:16:91:523:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educational attainment, though the model’s ability to distinguish between the two is more limited.
47:1876:148364:16:16:91:523:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:A 10th-90thquantile shift in school/commuting zone quality increases wages by 10-11 percent, with
47:1877:148461:16:20:91:498:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:commuting zone factors playing a somewhat larger role relative to school inputs and policies.
47:1878:148554:20:16:107:523:244:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:High school graduation rates of disadvantaged populations are considerably more sensitive to
47:1879:148646:16:17:91:523:228:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:school  and  commuting  zone  inputs,  while  college  graduation  rates  are  more  sensitive  to  group-
47:1880:148752:17:16:91:523:211:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level inputs for advantaged populations.  However, the heterogeneity in treatment effects is driven
47:1881:148851:16:16:91:523:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by the share of the subpopulation near the decision margin in our probit models,  rather than by
47:1882:148947:16:17:91:523:179:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fundamental  differences  in  input  sensitivity.   Our  estimated  interaction  effects  are  usually  small
47:1883:149056:17:16:91:523:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(though somewhat imprecise), suggesting that the inherent nonlinearity in the probit model well-
47:1884:149152:16:20:91:443:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approximates the heterogeneity in school and commuting zone treatment effects.
47:1885:149230:20:16:107:523:126:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  analysis  of  a  regression  index  of  student-level  observables  suggests  that  most  outcome-
47:1886:149333:16:0:91:523:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relevant sorting takes place at the level of school attendance zones, with a modest role for commut-
48:1887:149435:0:16:91:523:732:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing zone-level sorting and a very small role for neighborhood sorting.  It is possible, of course, that
48:1888:149538:16:17:91:523:716:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the neighborhood component may be understated by the use of block group or ZIP code to define
48:1889:149631:17:19:91:205:699:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neighborhood boundaries.
48:1890:149655:19:16:107:523:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:While the panel surveys we use offer many advantages, a multilevel mixed effects model fea-

48:1892:149843:17:16:91:523:647:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leads some of our estimates (particularly interactions) to be imprecise, and highlights the value of
