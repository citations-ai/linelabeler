2:33:1776:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:There is conflicting evidence on the importance of out-of-pocket medical expenditures as a risk to
2:34:1874:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:financial security, particularly at older ages.  We revisit this question, focusing on health care spending
2:35:1981:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:near the end of life using data from the Health and Retirement Study for the years 1998-2006.  We
2:36:2078:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:address difficulties with missing values for various categories of expenditures, outliers, and variations
2:37:2183:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:across individuals in the length of the reporting period.  Spending in the last year of life is estimated
2:38:2288:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:to be $11,618 on average, with the 90th percentile equal to $29,335, the 95th percentile $49,907, and
2:39:2389:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:the 99th equal to $94,310.   These spending measures represent a substantial fraction of liquid wealth
2:40:2491:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:for decedents.  Total out-of-pocket expenditures are strongly positively related to wealth and weakly
2:41:2592:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:related to income.  We find evidence for a mechanism by which wealth could plausibly buy health:
2:42:2688:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:large expenditures on home modifications, helpers, home health care, and higher-quality nursing homes,
2:43:2790:14:42:72:345:448:12:Times:12:Times:which have been shown elsewhere to improve longevity.

3:62:3216:0:27:72:152:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1. Introduction 
3:63:3232:27:28:108:535:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The financial impact of catastrophic out-of-pocket health care expenditures appears with 
3:64:3321:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:alarming frequency in the national media (e.g., Trejos, 2008; New York Times, 2008), and there 
3:65:3416:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is strong evidence that average out-of-pocket expenditures are growing over time (Paez, et al., 
3:66:3512:28:28:72:529:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2009).  Most recently, Webb and Zhivan (2010) using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 
3:67:3602:28:27:72:497:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:data, estimate that 5 percent of households now retiring may face out-of-pocket medical 
3:68:3690:27:28:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenses of one-half million dollars or more.  The rapid erosion of employer-provided retiree 
3:69:3784:28:27:72:514:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:health insurance for current baby boomers and forecasted increases in health care costs will 
3:70:3877:27:28:72:480:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:likely make out-of-pocket burdens even larger in the years to come (Fronstin, 2006). 
3:71:3962:28:28:108:534:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:However, despite the anecdotal evidence and repeated stories in the popular press, these 
3:72:4051:28:27:72:525:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:out-of-pocket expenditures are often elusive and difficult to uncover in survey data.  McGarry 
3:73:4146:27:28:72:538:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Schoeni (2005) reported just $2,500 average spending per year in the Health and Retirement 
3:74:4241:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Study (HRS) for people who were not near death and  French and Jones (2004) found that only a 
3:75:4335:27:28:72:538:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:very small fraction of households experience catastrophic health care shocks.  More recently, De 
3:76:4432:28:27:72:525:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) found evidence of high out-of-pocket expenditures, but these 
3:77:4525:27:28:72:460:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:arise among single people at very old ages and among high income households.  
3:78:4603:28:28:108:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We return to these issues using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 
3:79:4688:28:27:72:524:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1998-2006 to understand better the distribution and risk of out-of-pocket medical expenses as 
3:80:4782:27:28:72:520:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:people approach death.  There are several challenges in measuring the empirical risks arising 
3:81:4876:28:27:72:533:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from such costs.  First, there are a large number of non-responses or bracketed responses where 
3:82:4972:27:28:72:542:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:proxy respondents – typically children or spouses of the deceased – don’t know the exact amount 
3:83:5068:28:28:72:522:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of spending but provide a range (say nursing home expenses between $2,000 and $10,000, or 
3:84:5158:28:0:72:531:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more than $25,000).  Imputations in these cases are clearly necessary, but made difficult by the 
4:85:5258:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sparseness of the data in some ranges on a year by year basis.  We therefore harness continuous 
4:86:5354:27:28:72:485:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:data from all six waves (1998-2006) of the HRS to develop more robust imputations.  
4:87:5438:28:27:107:500:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Second, we adjust for a bias in measuring the variation or “risk” of out-of-pocket 
4:88:5521:27:28:71:541:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending that arises because of the HRS survey design.  Core surveys are fielded every two years 
4:89:5618:28:28:71:529:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and an exit survey is administered to proxies after the death of a respondent. Most questions in 
4:90:5715:28:27:72:527:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the exit interview ask about spending for the period of time elapsed between the last interview 
4:91:5811:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and the date of death, so expenditures will vary with the time to death.  For people who happen 
4:92:5907:28:27:72:533:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to die soon after their last (core) interview, spending will be relatively low, while for those who 
4:93:6007:27:28:72:536:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:survive for nearly the entire two year window, expenditures will be large. Although measures of 
4:94:6103:28:28:72:527:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average expenditures in the sample may be unbiased, the variable reporting period will tend to 
4:95:6198:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:overstate the variance and inferences drawn from the tails of the distribution will be invalid.  We 
4:96:6298:27:28:72:531:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:correct for these biases by normalizing spending quantiles (and means) to a common 12-month 
4:97:6390:28:27:72:521:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:period.1  We also pay particular attention to the extent to which spending rises in the last few 
4:98:6487:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:months of life – a period of time often missed in traditional survey questionnaires—and adjust 
4:99:6582:28:27:72:207:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:our scaling appropriately.    
4:100:6612:27:28:108:535:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Third, we quantify the importance of large reported “outlier” measures for out-of-pocket 
4:101:6701:28:28:72:523:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending paying considerable attention to potential reporting and coding errors.  We walk the 
4:102:6795:28:27:72:522:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fine line between Type 1 error – dropping a large reported spending amount when it is in fact 
4:103:6889:27:28:72:533:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:true, and Type 2 error – accepting a large reported value as fact when the respondent (or proxy) 
4:104:6986:28:27:72:530:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:misunderstood the question or misreported the response.   Rather than exclude individuals who 
4:105:7080:27:18:72:494:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:have signaled that they are high-cost, we instead set monthly limits on what costs could 
4:106:7169:18:19:72:218:139:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
4:107:7229:19:19:72:532:120:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:1 Goldman and Zissimopoulos (2004) also use this quantile approach to examine the distribution of spending that 
4:108:7341:19:0:71:201:101:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:controls for observable factors. 
5:109:7377:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reasonably be and cap expenditures at these limits. As well, we consider sensitivity analysis to 
5:110:7474:27:28:72:505:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:outliers by capping amounts at different percentiles of spending.  We note that the correct 
5:111:7566:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:treatment of these rare and potentially large spending events is particularly important for health 
5:112:7665:27:28:72:510:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:care costs, because it is just such high-cost events that are disproportionately important for 
5:113:7760:28:28:72:512:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:financial security.  We are reassured by finding that our HRS aggregate estimates of out-of-
5:114:7852:28:27:72:509:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pocket spending for ages 65 and over agree well with estimates from the National Medical 
5:115:7941:27:28:72:310:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Expenditures Accounts (Hartman et al., 2004). 2   
5:116:7991:28:27:108:542:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally, we consider the normative implications of out-of-pocket spending by considering 
5:117:8080:27:28:72:541:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:what types of outlays are most closely associated with wealth and income. De Nardi, French, and 
5:118:8176:28:28:72:519:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Jones (2010) have shown that out-of-pocket spending is highly dependent on income and we 
5:119:8265:28:27:72:522:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seek to assess the extent to which this pattern represents spending on consumption above and 
5:120:8358:27:28:71:532:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:beyond medical expenditures—say purchasing plush living arrangements in a high end assisted 
5:121:8450:28:27:72:404:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:care facility—rather than spending for additional medical attention.   
5:122:8521:27:28:108:532:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The results suggest that out-of-pocket expenditures near death are considerable, with an 
5:123:8610:28:27:72:504:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average of $12,120 (in 2006 dollars) per person in our sample, or $11,618 when scaled to 
5:124:8699:27:28:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:represent the last year of life.  However, there is considerable variance, with the 12-month 90th

5:126:8868:28:27:107:506:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Where is all this spending going?  The largest single category is nursing home and 
5:127:8951:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hospital expenditures, which average $4,731 in the last year of life, of which about two-thirds is 
5:128:9050:28:23:72:525:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for nursing home care.  Not surprisingly, the distribution of expenses is highly skewed, with a

5:130:9206:20:17:72:523:141:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f4:2 Hurd and Rohwedder (2009) reach different conclusions, suggesting that the HRS survey may overstate out-of-
5:131:9315:17:11:72:523:124:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:pocket spending relative to other surveys of health care spending such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 
5:132:9426:11:12:72:233:113:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(MEPS).  We explore this issue below.  
5:133:9465:12:0:72:74:101:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2: 
6:134:9469:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:median of zero, a 95th percentile of $27,770, and a 99th percentile of $75,902.  Other important 
6:135:9566:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sources of spending are for insurance ($1,746), prescription drugs ($1,496), home health care 
6:136:9660:28:27:72:536:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and helpers ($1,966 combined), and “non-medical” spending to make houses accessible ($721).  
6:137:9753:27:28:108:535:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Out-of-pocket expenditures are higher for high-income quartiles ($14,269 versus $9,046 
6:138:9840:28:28:72:536:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for the lowest quartile of income), but the partial impact of income on out-of-pocket spending is 
6:139:9938:28:27:72:526:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:diminished considerably in a regression model. Differences in spending by wealth quartile are 
6:140:10032:27:28:71:527:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:much larger than income differences with spending in the top wealth quintile equal to $18,232 
6:141:10126:28:27:71:527:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:compared to $7,173 in the bottom.   These differences appeared to be driven mostly by greater 
6:142:10220:27:28:71:506:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending for nursing homes, as well as for helpers, home health care, and other sources of 
6:143:10311:28:28:71:457:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending that likely help maintain the independence of people living at home.    
6:144:10392:28:27:107:514:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Our results are therefore consistent with a more nuanced version of the two extreme 
6:145:10476:27:28:71:538:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:stories of out-of-pocket spending noted above.  Health care expenditures represent a numerically 
6:146:10573:28:27:71:531:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:large and potentially important drain on financial resources, particularly for households as time 
6:147:10671:27:28:71:501:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of death nears. However, the large wealth-elasticity (and more modest income-elasticity) 
6:148:10760:28:27:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:suggests that some of this spending may serve to “buy” independence or represent other forms of 
6:149:10856:27:28:71:497:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:consumption. This spending is likely to include a health component; evidence presented 
6:150:10943:28:28:71:519:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:elsewhere suggests that these additional services could themselves have a positive impact on 
6:151:11036:28:27:71:542:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:health outcomes (McCorkle, et al., 2000; Mor, et al., 2004), pointing to one mechanism by which 
6:152:11132:27:28:71:196:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wealth could buy health.3

7:158:11386:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There is mixed evidence on how out-of-pocket medical expenditures affect financial security.  
7:159:11480:28:27:72:494:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Perhaps the most publicized study, Himmelstein et al. (2005), was based on a survey of 
7:160:11567:27:28:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:households which had gone through bankruptcy hearings.  Roughly half of the sample cited out-
7:161:11660:28:28:71:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of-pocket expenditures as a possible cause of their bankruptcies, suggesting that out-of-pocket 
7:162:11756:28:27:71:478:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:medical expenses are extremely burdensome.  However, the survey defined relevant 
7:163:11837:27:28:71:525:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures as expenditures of $1000 or more.  And, as Dranove and Millenson (2006) point 
7:164:11928:28:27:71:529:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:out, this is not a very high barrier, and many households spend more for their annual insurance 
7:165:12024:27:28:71:505:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:premiums alone.  Using an alternative definition, Dranove and Millenson estimate a more 
7:166:12112:28:28:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:plausible yet still sizeable figure, attributing up to 17 percent of all bankruptcies, at least in part, 
7:167:12217:28:27:71:494:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to out-of-pocket medical expenses.  A Commonwealth Fund report (Merlis et al., 2006) 
7:168:12302:27:28:71:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:highlighting the “growing strain” of out-of-pocket expenditures on family budgets found that just 
7:169:12400:28:27:71:532:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:11 percent of households had expenses exceeding 10% of income. We note, however, that even 
7:170:12491:27:28:71:510:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:many of these “large” expenditures may have little effect on lifetime well-being if they are 
7:171:12584:28:27:71:512:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:limited to an isolated year. A large part of the burden is likely to stem from repeatedly high 
7:172:12679:27:28:72:157:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:health care costs. 
7:173:12698:28:28:108:518:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Conversely, several studies have found larger levels of out-of-pocket spending in the 
7:174:12784:28:27:72:535:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Medicare population.  Although Medicare provides nearly universal coverage for people 65 and 
7:175:12877:27:28:72:517:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:over, there are substantial gaps in that coverage. For many, these gaps are filled by privately 
7:176:12973:28:27:71:528:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:purchased “medigap” insurance or by retiree health insurance. While these supplemental plans 
7:177:13066:27:29:71:534:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:offer relatively complete coverage of the standard Medicare deductibles and copayments,4 there

7:179:13221:20:18:72:534:108:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:4  Medicare requires a modest deductible for doctor visits and a copayment for costs beyond this amount. Medicare 
7:180:13335:18:0:71:532:90:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:does not cover the cost of the first day of hospital care, requires a significant copayment for days 61-90 and covers 
8:181:13456:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are important limitations to the protections provided by such policies, particularly the coverage 
8:182:13554:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of long term care needs. Even for individuals with the most generous “medigap” policies, both 
8:183:13648:28:27:71:512:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:home health care services and nursing home stays must be paid for out of pocket unless the 
8:184:13739:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:individual qualifies for benefits from the means-tested Medicaid program or purchases a separate 
8:185:13836:28:28:72:315:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(and expensive) long term care insurance policy.5  
8:186:13887:28:27:108:536:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Gaps in the coverage of acute medical needs are likely to become increasingly important 
8:187:13975:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as the fraction of firms offering retiree health insurance falls. The Kaiser Foundation estimates 
8:188:14073:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that among large firms the percentage providing retiree coverage has fallen from 66 percent in 
8:189:14168:27:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1988 to 31 percent in 2008.6 Among all firms, the percentage offering retiree health insurance is 
8:190:14266:28:28:72:526:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantially lower with an estimated 13 percent providing retiree coverage in 2002 and likely 
8:191:14361:28:27:72:531:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:even less today. Retirees without employer-provided coverage must purchase a medigap policy 
8:192:14453:27:28:72:541:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on their own, which can cost up to $200 a month for a 65 year old. Fronstin (2006) estimates that 
8:193:14551:28:27:72:499:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in present-value terms someone retiring at age 65 a decade hence could need as much as 
8:194:14638:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$400,000 to cover these premiums.  These studies suggest that the rise in health care cost growth, 
8:195:14737:28:27:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:coupled with the erosion of retiree insurance from employers, will lead to rapid growth in out-of-
8:196:14835:27:28:72:336:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pocket expenses even if current costs are not so large.  
8:197:14892:28:28:108:539:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally, even with relatively generous health care coverage and supplemental policies, an 
8:198:14982:28:15:72:538:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:individual may incur substantial non-medical costs associated with a health condition. Items like 
8:199:15080:15:24:72:541:224:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                                                                                                                                                                
8:200:15272:24:13:72:530:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:nothing for days beyond 90 (after a fixed lifetime “reserve” of 60 days is used). For those with long hospital stays 
8:201:15389:13:14:72:521:187:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and no other coverage, these costs can be substantial.  Perhaps most importantly, Medicare covers neither home 
8:202:15500:14:13:72:539:173:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:health care nor nursing home expenses except for brief periods of medically needed care (rehabilitation) following a 
8:203:15617:13:19:71:131:160:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:hospital stay.   
8:204:15634:19:23:72:506:141:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:5 Only 10 percent of the elderly have purchased long term care insurance (Finkelstein and McGarry, 2005).  
8:205:15741:23:18:72:535:118:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:6 http://ehbs.kff.org/images/abstract/7814.pdf.  The figure of 66 percent is for large firms (200 or more employees) 
8:206:15857:18:0:71:520:100:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that offer health insurance to those currently working. Ninety-nine percent of large firms offer health insurance. 
9:207:15975:0:27:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:handicap ramps, grab bars and food to meet special dietary needs, can be expensive and must 
9:208:16067:27:28:71:294:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:typically be borne by the individual himself.   
9:209:16115:28:27:107:535:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Despite these insurance gaps, previous studies have often failed to find very large health 
9:210:16206:27:28:71:536:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:care spending “shocks.” For example, Goldman and Zissimopoulos (2003) found median out-of-
9:211:16296:28:28:71:539:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pocket spending among HRS respondents over a two-year period of just $920, with even the 95th 
9:212:16389:28:27:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentile of out-of-pocket expenditures reaching just $7,000—a significant amount for sure, but 
9:213:16486:27:28:71:503:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:less than one might fear for the upper tail of the distribution.  However, the Goldman and 
9:214:16577:28:27:71:532:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Zissimopoulus estimates do not include the end of life cohorts, and their data are from the 1998 
9:215:16674:27:28:71:528:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:survey when health care generally was less expensive than it might be today.7  By contrast, we 
9:216:16769:28:28:72:297:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:focus solely on the end-of-life “exit” sample.   
9:217:16818:28:27:108:520:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Most recently, De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) quantified expected out-of-pocket 
9:218:16902:27:28:71:527:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures in the HRS for single elderly households and found elevated spending associated 
9:219:16995:28:27:71:531:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with high levels of income, particularly among the very old (e.g., those age 90 and above).  For 
9:220:17092:27:28:71:536:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example, for 95-year olds in the top income quintile, the estimated average spending was nearly 
9:221:17188:28:27:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$16,000.  (Expenditures in the lower part of the income distribution are likely to be lower in part 
9:222:17288:27:28:72:528:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:because of the important role played by Medicaid in paying for nursing home and home health 
9:223:17380:28:28:72:489:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:care for the elderly.)  De Nardi et al. showed further that the risk of high out-of-pocket 
9:224:17471:28:27:72:541:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures helped to explain observed wealth accumulation, particularly among higher-income 
9:225:17565:27:28:72:492:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:households who are unlikely to qualify for Medicaid coverage and may want to protect 
9:226:17650:28:30:72:386:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:themselves against potentially burdensome long term care needs.

10:231:18106:0:27:108:522:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Webb and Zhivan (2010) consider out-of-pocket risks in a dynamic model.  Using the 
10:232:18189:27:28:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HRS data, they simulate potential spending outcomes for hypothetical 65-year-olds extending 
10:233:18281:28:27:71:528:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:out to their (uncertain) deaths, and find very large levels of uninsured risk: their 95th percentile 
10:234:18382:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:household faces a present value of $311,000 in health care spending, or $570,000 when adding in 
10:235:18478:28:28:71:501:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the cost of long-term care. However, these estimates likely overstate the true risk for two 
10:236:18570:28:27:71:525:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reasons.  First, to capture the true risk of spending absent an insurance safety net, they assume 
10:237:18668:27:28:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that individuals never receive Medicaid benefits.  Yet for many people who simply cannot afford 
10:238:18764:28:27:71:542:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the cost of care, Medicaid represents a feasible if not preferred option (Ameriks et al., 2010). The 
10:239:18865:27:28:71:501:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:potential value of Medicaid may also affect lifetime savings and distort the perception of 
10:240:18956:28:28:71:520:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:available resources (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes, 1995).  And second, some of the modeled 
10:241:19046:28:27:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“risk” may also reflect the income or wealth elasticity of spending on health care, independent of 
10:242:19145:27:28:72:538:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:health shocks.  That is, the top 5th percentile of spending is likely to include both people who are 
10:243:19246:28:27:72:492:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:very sick and people who are  very wealthy and who choose to consume a great deal of 
10:244:19331:27:28:72:530:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expensive health services. And while Webb and Zhivan (2010) do not find that their results are 
10:245:19426:28:27:72:535:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sensitive to outliers, we acknowledge that outliers may be more of an issue in end-of-life care, a 
10:246:19525:27:28:72:228:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:topic to which we return below. 
10:247:19557:28:28:108:533:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally, Hurd and Rohwedder (2009) have suggested an alternative explanation for why 
10:248:19642:28:27:72:515:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the risk of out-of-pocket expenditures may be overstated in studies using the HRS – that the 
10:249:19735:27:28:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures reported in the survey itself are biased upward.  They address this concern in two 
10:250:19831:28:27:72:521:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ways.  First, they show that for the small group of people who report very high out-of-pocket 
10:251:19925:27:28:71:520:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending, many do not have enough household income or wealth to pay these expenses.  The 
10:252:20014:28:28:72:489:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:problem of measurement error, however, is endemic in wealth and income, and family 
10:253:20097:28:0:71:498:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions to medical bills may be poorly captured in the survey. It is thus difficult to 
11:254:20193:0:27:72:488:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determine why the budget constraint appears to be violated—whether it is the medical 
11:255:20278:27:28:72:390:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures that are mis-measured or the resources themselves.   
11:256:20344:28:27:108:524:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The second objection raised by Hurd and Rohwedder is that aggregate spending in the 
11:257:20428:27:28:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HRS appears to be too high – as much as 60% overstated -- relative to other surveys such as the 
11:258:20524:28:28:71:512:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Medicare Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 
11:259:20609:28:27:71:538:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(MCBS).  It is true that the MEPS and the MCBS are much better than the HRS in measuring all 
11:260:20702:27:28:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:costs paid on behalf of the individual (i.e. both out-of-pocket costs and those insurance payments 
11:261:20801:28:27:71:505:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which would normally be invisible to all but very alert patients who check their insurance 
11:262:20892:27:28:71:533:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:company paperwork).  However, with respect to out-of-pocket costs in particular, the HRS asks 
11:263:20986:28:28:71:508:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about specific types of expenditures in more detail than do these other surveys, and allows 
11:264:21078:28:27:71:532:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:people who are unsure about actual dollar amounts to provide a range for the expense—leading 
11:265:21171:27:28:71:534:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to more complete reporting. (For example, the HRS asks who helps the respondent with various 
11:266:21264:28:27:71:541:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tasks and whether and how much helpers are paid, providing a more accurate measure of the cost 
11:267:21359:27:28:71:517:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of in-home assistance than elsewhere.)Thus, there is the real possibility that rather than over-
11:268:21455:28:27:71:493:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:estimating expenses, the HRS simply captures expenses not measured in other surveys. 
11:269:21540:27:28:107:521:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Furthermore, the MEPS and MCBS are both known to miss important components of 
11:270:21618:28:28:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:out-of-pocket spending, while French and Jones (2004) found that HRS out-of-pocket spending 
11:271:21710:28:27:71:537:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was close to aggregate estimates after corrections for underreporting. More recently, Hartman et 
11:272:21807:27:28:71:519:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:al. (2007) reported age-specific spending measures using the National Medical Expenditures 
11:273:21898:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Accounts (NMEA), which also adjusts for underreported components of out-of-pocket spending 
11:274:21989:27:0:71:530:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from the other survey data.  Their estimate of per capita spending for the over-65 population in 
12:275:22090:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2003/2004 was $2,170 on average.8 Defining the 2004 HRS Core data in an equivalent manner 
12:276:22180:27:28:72:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:yields a nearly identical annual estimate of $2,151.9  Including the sample of HRS respondents 
12:277:22275:28:27:71:540:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who died in 2004 (net of insurance payments and non-medical payments) brings the aggregate to 
12:278:22369:27:28:71:541:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$2,347 per capita, just 8 percent above the NMEA estimate.10  Based on these figures,  we do not 
12:279:22466:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:believe there isevidence of a strong upward bias in the HRS out-of-pocket expenditures, a result 
12:280:22563:28:27:72:497:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:echoed in Goldman and Zissimopoulos (2010).  Still, as Hurd and Rohwedder (personal 
12:281:22647:27:28:71:490:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:communication) have pointed out, the national estimates of age-specific spending may 
12:282:22732:28:27:71:535:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:themselves be subject to measurement error, making it difficult to determine a “gold-standard.”  
12:283:22829:27:28:71:532:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally, while the aggregates constructed from the HRS data may be approximately correct, the 
12:284:22923:28:28:71:538:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:components of spending (in particular nursing home versus non-nursing home spending) may be 
12:285:23015:28:27:71:273:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:measured with error (Sing, et al., 2006).   
12:286:23059:27:28:107:110:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
12:287:23059:28:27:71:122:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:III. Data  
12:288:23070:27:28:107:532:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Our data for this task come from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a 
12:289:23155:28:36:71:530:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:large panel survey that began in 1992 with a nationally representative sample of the population 
12:290:23251:36:20:72:218:286:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
12:291:23311:20:19:72:541:266:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:8  This estimate interpolates between 2002 and 2004 to estimate 2003 spending, and then averages 2003 and 2004 
12:292:23422:19:19:71:317:247:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:spending to match up with the two‐year horizon of the HRS. 
12:293:23481:19:19:72:515:228:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:9  This estimate uses similar imputations to those reported below.  To adjust for the 2‐year sample frame, we 
12:294:23591:19:14:71:534:209:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:divide total out‐of‐pocket spending (net of insurance) by the number of months since the last interview, and then 
12:295:23705:14:19:71:240:195:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:multiply this per‐month measure by 12.   
12:296:23746:19:19:72:532:176:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:10 While end‐of‐life spending risk is large at an individual level, it does not add as much to the aggregate estimate 
12:297:23864:19:14:71:528:157:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:both because only a small fraction of the sample dies in any year and because those who do die are alive for (on 
12:298:23977:14:14:71:505:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:average) just 6 months. Our estimate of $2,347 was created by assuming that the 2004 core interview was 
12:299:24081:14:14:71:537:129:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:conducted on December 31, 2004, and included spending in the prior 12 months for those interviewed in the core 
12:300:24192:14:14:71:536:115:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:survey, plus spending for the sample of people who had died in 12 months prior to the interview.  There were 517 
12:301:24305:14:0:71:359:101:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:deaths and their average spending for the calendar year was $6,633.    
13:302:24380:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:born between 1931 and 1941. These original respondents have been interviewed biennially ever 
13:303:24473:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:since with the most recent data collected in 2008.11 A separate cohort (the AHEAD cohort) of 
13:304:24566:28:27:72:515:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:those born in 1921 or earlier was interviewed in 1993 and again in 1995.  In 1998 these two 
13:305:24658:27:28:72:515:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:samples were merged and two additional cohorts were added making the sample population 
13:306:24745:28:28:72:520:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:approximately representative of the U.S. population ages 50 or older. A refresher cohort was 
13:307:24838:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:added in 2004 to maintain representation of the population in their 50s.  We restrict our analyses 
13:308:24937:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to data from 1998 to 2006 so that we have a full age range of individuals from which to draw and 
13:309:25034:28:27:72:392:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more consistent sets of questions with respect to health care costs. 
13:310:25103:27:28:108:534:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Another reason for considering just years since 1998 is that, as noted above, the original 
13:311:25194:28:28:72:539:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sample was restricted to the non-institutionalized population.  In the early years of data from any 
13:312:25294:28:27:72:493:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:cohort, health care expenditures (both overall and out-of-pocket) are likely to be biased 
13:313:25384:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:downward because those in nursing homes, who likely have the largest expenses, are excluded.12  
13:314:25480:28:27:71:499:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Over the longer term, this bias is attenuated as the sample matured and the formerly non-
13:315:25569:27:28:71:339:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:institutionalized elderly began to enter nursing homes.  
13:316:25626:28:27:107:517:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The HRS is unusual in that when sample members die, it conducts what is termed an 
13:317:25708:27:28:71:534:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“exit interview.” The exit interview is a survey administered to a surviving spouse (if available) 
13:318:25807:28:28:71:524:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:or other knowledgeable individual (such as an adult child), and collects information about the 
13:319:25902:28:27:71:532:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:deceased individual pertaining to the period of time since the previous “live” survey.13 Because 
13:320:25999:27:24:72:536:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:we are concerned with the cost of health care in the time period near death, these exit interviews 
13:321:26098:24:20:72:218:188:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
13:322:26158:20:24:72:240:168:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:11 The 2010 wave is currently in the field. 
13:323:26202:24:19:72:538:144:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:12 This problem is likely to be most severe in the older AHEAD cohort and less problematic for cohorts entering the 
13:324:26318:19:19:71:285:125:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:sample in their 50s when nursing home use is rare.   
13:325:26371:19:0:72:518:106:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:13 Depending on the year, somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 percent of proxies are the surviving spouse.  
14:326:26483:0:27:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are central to our study and we focus our attention on them.  However, we rely on the prior core 
14:327:26580:27:28:72:398:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:survey for information about income and wealth of the household.   
14:328:26647:28:27:108:523:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The HRS collects a great deal of information on financial status, health measures, and 
14:329:26734:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:out-of- pocket medical expenses, all of which we use in our analyses. In an improvement over 
14:330:26827:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:past surveys, the HRS uses a bracketing method to reduce the number of missing values. If a 
14:331:26919:28:27:72:536:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:respondent does not know (or does not wish to provide) an answer to a particular question about 
14:332:27015:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the amount of a health care expenditure (or other dollar-denominated question), they are asked a 
14:333:27112:28:27:72:521:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:series of questions as to whether the amount is greater than or less than a specific value. This 
14:334:27209:27:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:strategy provides us with a specific range of values rather than a missing response. Although the 
14:335:27307:28:28:72:530:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:exact amounts are still uncertain (and for some uses must be imputed) these brackets are vastly 
14:336:27403:28:27:72:532:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more useful than the missing values that characterize much of survey data, particularly in cases 
14:337:27500:27:28:71:342:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:where proxy respondents may not know exact amounts. 
14:338:27552:28:27:107:513:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We examine nine separate components of spending: insurance premiums (including 
14:339:27631:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:privately purchased health insurance, “medigap” plans, employer provided insurance, Medicare

15:354:28934:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:provide exact values. While the HRS and RAND provide imputed values for many variables in 
15:355:29024:28:27:72:498:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the core interview for the full range of survey years, they ceased imputations for the exit 
15:356:29116:27:28:72:521:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interviews in 2000.  An important component of our analysis is thus the construction of these 
15:357:29210:28:27:72:112:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:values.  
15:358:29219:27:28:108:531:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The imputation procedures and our methodology for handling outliers are central to our 
15:359:29306:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:study.15  Our primary objective was to ensure that the information provided in the survey ends up 
15:360:29404:28:27:71:539:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in the final dataset with as little ad hoc restrictions and exclusions as possible. We consider three 
15:361:29506:27:28:72:196:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the key issues below.   
15:362:29533:28:27:108:503:377:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Reasonable caps on spending values.  Large reported values for specific spending 
15:363:29614:27:28:72:523:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:measures pose a problem for researchers because it is often impossible to discern whether the 
15:364:29708:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:answer was given in error or whether it represents a rare but very large actual cost.  Problems can 
15:365:29808:27:28:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:also arise because of confusion about the appropriate time frame for the question. In the majority 
15:366:29907:28:28:71:536:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of cases respondents are asked to report out of pocket expenditures since the previous interview, 
15:367:30005:28:27:71:536:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but for a few expenditure items they are asked about monthly expenses (e.g. for helpers they are 
15:368:30102:27:28:71:507:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:asked about payments in the last month and for prescription drugs, about average monthly 
15:369:30191:28:27:71:540:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:payments). On the one hand, this change in the relevant period can confuse respondents and may 
15:370:30286:27:32:71:488:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lead to overstated medical expenses if, for example, when asked about monthly health

16:373:30508:0:27:72:507:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures, respondents report the total expense since the last interview, thus raising the 
16:374:30602:27:28:72:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:prospect of Type 1 error – overstating medical expenses.  On the other hand, we know that out-
16:375:30696:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of-pocket expenditures are marked by a high degree of skewness, so ad hoc “second-guessing” 
16:376:30788:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the respondent might lead to Type 2 error – rejecting the high reported cost when it is in fact 
16:377:30884:28:28:72:103:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:true.   
16:378:30892:28:27:108:497:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The first column of Table 1 provides a summary of the caps we use for spending 
16:379:30971:27:28:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:measures that seem unreasonably high.16 We based the $2,000 cap on monthly health insurance 
16:380:31063:28:27:72:503:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:payments for long-term care on premiums available through the Federal Long Term Care 
16:381:31148:27:28:72:500:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Insurance Program.17  There are fewer guidelines for pharmaceutical payments, but drug 
16:382:31235:28:28:72:500:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:regimens for high-end specialty drugs such as Gleevic alone can run as much as $40,000 
16:383:31322:28:27:72:504:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:annually, and so we set (somewhat arbitrarily) a cap of $5000 per month in out-of-pocket 
16:384:31411:27:28:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pharmaceutical spending.18 (If we were to examine spending beyond 2006, we would want to

16:386:31588:27:28:72:513:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:coverage.)  We have much less evidence on private-pay physicians, but choose a maximum 
16:387:31675:28:50:72:296:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:payment of 20 visits per month at $250/visit.

16:391:31906:19:19:72:535:214:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:17 We assumed an 80‐year‐old was purchasing long‐term care insurance with a $250 maximum daily amount for a

16:394:32225:14:14:71:518:167:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:does not include other insurance premiums (such as Medicare Part B premiums).  While payments of $2000 a

17:399:32756:0:27:108:538:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Monthly maximum expenditures for helpers and home health care comes from the use of 
17:400:32840:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:multiple-shift nursing care for (e.g.) people with advanced dementia.  We assume a maximum of 
17:401:32934:28:27:71:533:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$15,000 per month ($25 per hour times 20 hours per day times 30 days) for each category.  The 
17:402:33028:27:28:71:533:626:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:average monthly rate in New York City (the most expensive region) for a private nursing home 
17:403:33121:28:28:71:531:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bed is equal to just under $12,000 per month,19 so we view a $15,000 fee as a reasonable upper 
17:404:33216:28:27:72:511:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:limit on what might be spent in a more expensive facility.  Hospital expenditures and other 
17:405:33308:27:28:72:513:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenses can clearly exceed $15,000 monthly, but for consistency we simply set that as the 
17:406:33399:28:27:72:514:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:maximum as well and use a cap of $30,000 when nursing home and hospital expenses were 
17:407:33485:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reported together.  (Recall that these are out of pocket costs incurred beyond what Medicare or 
17:408:33581:28:28:72:501:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other insurance has covered.) Finally, we set hospice care and non-medical spending to a 
17:409:33670:28:27:72:206:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:monthly limit of $5,000.20   
17:410:33699:27:28:108:518:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: One further problem is that questions about helpers and home health care refer to the 
17:411:33785:28:27:72:528:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:month prior to death.  It seems unreasonable to expect that these expenses were incurred at the 
17:412:33881:27:28:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:same rate stretching back to the previous interview, but it also seems unreasonable to assume 
17:413:33975:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:these costs were incurred just for one month.  Based on a study of (post-1997) median length of 
17:414:34071:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:stay for home health care Medicare patients (Murkofsky, 2003), we assume that both helpers and 
17:415:34166:28:61:72:376:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:home health care workers are employed for 4 months in total.

17:418:34378:24:19:72:523:162:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:20 We also inspected many of the outliers more closely, examining, for example, expenditures in relation to the 
17:419:34490:19:14:71:540:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:individual’s income, wealth, and insurance coverage. We decided that a fixed rule was preferred relative to making 
17:420:34605:14:14:71:524:129:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:ad hoc changes on an individual level. Our inspection of the data and investigations into examples of extremely 
17:421:34717:14:14:71:526:115:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:expensive services available to individuals did, however, serve to demonstrate how difficult it can be to identify 
17:422:34832:14:0:71:160:101:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:true reporting errors. 
18:423:34859:0:27:108:515:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Table 1 further illustrates the impact of these adjustments on specific components of 
18:424:34945:27:28:72:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending.21  The caps matter the most for helpers (103 people out of 6631, or 1.6 percent), but 
18:425:35041:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the mean difference in the spending measure (between the uncapped and capped values) is just 
18:426:35134:27:28:72:531:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$157 because so few individuals report positive values.  Other important categories affected by 
18:427:35230:28:28:72:508:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the caps are health insurance (25 people, reducing the average by $193) and nursing home 
18:428:35319:28:27:72:522:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenses (17 people, reducing average expenses by $424).22  In sum, the caps reduce average 
18:429:35411:27:28:72:520:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending by less than $1000 per person, but likely to scale back the variance by much more.  
18:430:35504:28:27:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Below, we consider the importance of further capping spending on the 95th or 99th percentile.

18:432:35687:28:28:72:520:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:health care costs is its use of detailed categories of expenditures. This detailed probing likely 
18:433:35785:28:27:72:520:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:captures more expenditure than would a general catch-all question and is useful to an analyst 
18:434:35879:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seeking to examine particular forms of spending. However, it also means that the distributions of 
18:435:35977:28:27:72:540:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending for each of the underlying components are often plagued by small samples, particularly 
18:436:36073:27:28:72:529:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:at the upper tails. In any given exit interview there are only 1200 or so deaths so for infrequent 
18:437:36172:28:27:72:522:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but important outcomes, such as the out of pocket expense associated with a stay in a nursing 
18:438:36266:27:58:72:460:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:home or use of hospice care, there are many fewer observations in a given year.

18:440:36407:19:18:72:490:218:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:21 The HRS oversampled a number of specific groups so population weights are necessary in measuring 
18:441:36507:18:12:71:491:200:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:representative points of the distribution (or mean values). In table 1 we report unweighted statistics to 
18:442:36613:12:12:71:520:188:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:demonstrate clearly the effect of our caps. These means will therefore not correspond to the weighted means 
18:443:36721:12:12:71:521:176:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:presented in subsequent tables. Population weights are zero in the exit interview, because the individuals are, 
18:444:36833:12:12:71:535:164:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:well, dead.  We therefore went back for up to three successive waves of the HRS core interviews to search for the 
18:445:36947:12:13:71:539:152:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:most recent individual weight which was then assigned to the individual.  Still, there were a few individuals (325 of 
18:446:37065:13:12:71:508:139:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:the 6631 combined sample of decedents) with zero weights.  We use these “zero weight” individuals in our 
18:447:37170:12:7:71:375:127:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:imputation procedures but do not include them in the population totals.    
18:448:37245:7:19:72:521:120:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:22  Note that the sample size of 4032 is just for years 2002‐06 when nursing home expenditures were reported 
18:449:37354:19:0:71:198:101:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:separately from hospital costs. 
19:450:37390:0:27:108:533:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The thinness of the data makes it difficult to impute values using conditional means or a 
19:451:37480:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:traditional hot-decking procedure.   In the cases in which a specific bracket is available, say that 
19:452:37581:28:27:72:522:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending on a particular service was between $10,000 and $25,000, we might be comfortable 
19:453:37671:27:28:72:500:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with imputing a value equal to the midpoint ($17,500) or even the mean over continuous 
19:454:37758:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:responses in the interval, despite it being based on a small number of continuous responses (i.e. 
19:455:37856:28:27:72:536:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the scope for error is relatively small when bounds are in place). However, there are many cases 
19:456:37953:27:28:72:522:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in which we have opened rather than closed brackets. Individuals could report that they spent 
19:457:38047:28:27:72:534:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more than (say) $25,000 on a health expense but not report an exact amount or any upper limit.  
19:458:38143:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Should we impute $26,000?  Or double that?  With relatively few decedents in any given year, 
19:459:38236:28:28:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:there may not be more than a handful of people who report values above the upper break point 
19:460:38329:28:27:72:498:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for any given component of spending, making it extremely difficult to impute an overall 
19:461:38417:27:28:72:500:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conditional mean, much less one tailored to individual specifics such as age or insurance 
19:462:38507:28:27:72:127:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:coverage.   
19:463:38519:27:28:108:521:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:To deal with the sparseness of observations, we impute values based on a distribution 
19:464:38605:28:27:72:506:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:constructed from a combined sample of exit interviews for all survey years, a much larger 
19:465:38695:27:28:72:525:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sample of 6,631. We first construct a combined file of exact dollar amounts for each spending 
19:466:38789:28:28:72:534:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:category, with all measures adjusted for inflation using the GDP deflator and expressed in 2006 
19:467:38885:28:27:72:535:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dollars.  For everyone reporting a bracketed amount, we estimated the conditional mean for that 
19:468:38981:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bracket, including open ended brackets.  Because of inflation, the end-points of the brackets vary 
19:469:39080:28:27:72:529:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:over time, and so for each specific set of brackets, a new conditional mean was estimated.  We 
19:470:39175:27:28:72:512:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:then considered the more complex sets of questions – for example whether people reported 
19:471:39264:28:0:72:539:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:positive amounts (but didn’t know the amount) in which case they were assigned the mean value 
20:472:39362:0:27:72:507:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conditional on a positive value, or whether people reported not knowing at all whether the 
20:473:39453:27:28:71:465:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expense was incurred, in which case they were assigned the unconditional mean.  
20:474:39533:28:27:108:532:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:An example of the distribution is shown in Figure 1 for the (log) distribution of hospital 
20:475:39624:27:28:72:519:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and nursing home out-of-pocket expenditures for the entire sample, conditional on a positive 
20:476:39717:28:28:72:524:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:amount.  These estimates include both imputed and actual estimates, and while there are clear 
20:477:39811:28:27:72:498:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spikes where imputations play a larger part (or reflect rounding by respondents), there is 
20:478:39902:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sufficient density of continuously reported variables to suggest a log-normal distribution that is 
20:479:40001:28:27:72:204:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not dominated by outliers.  
20:480:40029:27:28:108:539:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We recognize that in stacking data from all years of the survey to conduct our imputation 
20:481:40119:28:28:72:537:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:procedure, we are missing any evolution over time in the distribution of expenditures. However, 
20:482:40215:28:27:72:523:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:we believe that the potential bias introduced by this method is less of a problem than any bias 
20:483:40311:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:introduced by relying solely on the few continuous data reports available in any particular year.  
20:484:40410:28:27:72:540:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We note that this procedure restricts our ability to assess growth in expenditures over time (other

20:486:40600:28:27:72:515:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:brackets or for those reporting actual expenses) and therefore do not provide a discussion of 
20:487:40694:27:38:72:245:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:differences in spending by year.23    
20:488:40732:38:28:107:510:257:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Time to Death: A final data issue which we note here is the differing length of time 
20:489:40817:28:27:72:530:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between interviews, particularly for exit interviews where the date of death might be just a few 
20:490:40914:27:28:72:535:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:months after the last interview or as long as two years. If deaths are randomly distributed across 
20:491:41013:28:35:72:512:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a two year interval, the varying length of time will not affect our population averages. (The

20:493:41167:20:19:72:494:119:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f4:23 We have considered using the stacked sample along with regression equations to control for individual 
20:494:41272:19:0:72:509:100:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f2:characteristics, but even with the full complement of decedents any regression would be sensitive to outliers. 
21:495:41387:0:27:72:494:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average time elapsed, from the respondents’ final “live” interviews until their deaths, is 
21:496:41478:27:28:71:522:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:approximately 15 months, with a median of 14 months.)   There will, however, be systematic 
21:497:41568:28:27:71:518:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:variation in expenditures with those who die long after their last interview appearing to have 
21:498:41663:27:28:71:541:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:higher end-of-life costs than dying soon after the last survey simply because the costs pertain to a 
21:499:41764:28:28:71:169:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:longer time period.  
21:500:41785:28:27:107:536:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There may also be potential biases in reporting patterns as proxies may be more likely to 
21:501:41875:27:28:71:521:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:misreport or forget completely about costs when the death occurred a year or more before, or 
21:502:41968:28:27:71:532:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:because of upticks in spending very near death.  It is difficult to sort out the difference between 
21:503:42068:27:28:71:521:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:forgetfulness and a diminished rate of out-of-pocket expenditures as one goes further back in 
21:504:42162:28:28:71:528:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:time prior to the death.  And as we show, the flattening out of reported spending beyond a two-
21:505:42257:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:year limit is suggestive of a sharp drop-off in recall for these proxies.  We present data that has 
21:506:42357:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:been adjusted for a quartic in the number of months since the last interview, whether for mean 
21:507:42452:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures or quantile regressions (to estimate weighted percentiles), where we set the number 
21:508:42549:27:28:71:162:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of months to 12.

21:510:42583:27:28:107:516:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We use data from the 1998—2006 exit interviews, with a combined sample of 6,631 
21:511:42663:28:28:71:538:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:people (6,306 of whom have positive sampling weights). Table 2 presents summary statistics for 
21:512:42758:28:27:71:523:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the sample of decedents both combined and for individual years.  The sample of decedents is, 
21:513:42851:27:28:71:534:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unsurprisingly, quite old. The average age at death is 79.4, with just 12 percent of the decedents 
21:514:42950:28:27:72:519:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:under the age of 65.  The fraction of men in the sample is somewhat below 50 percent, while 
21:515:43042:27:28:72:533:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average years of schooling are roughly 11 years, with a strong secular trend that rises from 10.6 
21:516:43140:28:0:72:515:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:years (1998) to 11.6 years (2006).  The fraction of people who report their race as nonwhite 
22:517:43237:0:27:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ranges between 11 and 15 percent (depending on the year), while the percent Hispanic is 4.6 
22:518:43329:27:28:72:225:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percent over the entire period.

22:520:43448:27:28:72:510:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:evidence of a rising trend over time (from $11,183 in 1998 to $14,451 in 2004) despite our 
22:521:43539:28:28:72:538:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:imputation based on across year averages, but there is a marked decline between 2004 and 2006, 
22:522:43634:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to $12,954.  This decline is in part the consequence of a modest decline in out-of-pocket drug 
22:523:43729:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures (probably more the consequence of a change in how the question is asked than in 
22:524:43822:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the introduction of Medicare Part D), but mostly because of an unusually high level of nursing 
22:525:43917:27:28:72:328:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:home spending (conditional on admission) in 2004.

22:534:44715:28:27:71:532:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:95th percentiles, and maximum amounts.  While mean spending is $12,120, median spending is 
22:535:44806:27:28:72:510:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:just $5,175. Indeed, nearly 30 percent of respondents reported less than $100 in any out-of-
22:536:44898:28:27:72:531:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pocket expenditure.  (Whether this is because of under-reporting or a true lack of out-of-pocket 
22:537:44995:27:28:72:518:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:costs is not entirely clear.)  For the 90th percentile, spending was $29,790, the 95th percentile 
22:538:45093:28:0:71:512:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$49,751, the 99th $101,581 (not shown),  while the maximum was $331,825. The impact of 
23:539:45184:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:extreme outliers on the mean was fairly modest; capping spending at the 99th percentile amount 
23:540:45279:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reduced the mean to $11,690, while capping at the 95th percentile reduced the mean to $10,400. 
23:541:45374:28:27:108:517:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:As noted previously, nursing home and hospital out-of-pocket expenditures were the 
23:542:45457:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:single largest category, with a mean of $4,731, and 95th percentile expenditures equal to $26,136.  
23:543:45557:28:28:72:515:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Expenditures for insurance were less skewed (median of $990, mean of $2,096), while drug 
23:544:45646:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures were somewhere in the middle; median spending was $448 but the 95th percentile 
23:545:45738:27:28:72:143:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was $6,000.24  
23:546:45753:28:27:107:507:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Payments to helpers for home-based care can account for substantial expenditures, 
23:547:45835:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:although it is not a common expenditure category.25  Fewer than one-quarter of the respondents 
23:548:45930:28:28:72:518:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:paid money to someone who helped with tasks around the home, but the conditional mean is 
23:549:46019:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:high, adding $1,281 to average expenses near death.  Given our assumption that helpers spent no 
23:550:46115:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more than 4 months prior to death with the households, this estimate is likely to underestimate 
23:551:46211:28:27:72:509:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the overall uncertainty arising from such costs.  Finally, hospice care is largely covered by 
23:552:46305:27:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Medicare, and thus its contribution to out-of-pocket expenditures is remarkably modest ($38 on 
23:553:46400:28:27:72:125:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average).   
23:554:46412:27:28:108:533:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The variation across individuals in these expenditures could be overstated given that the 
23:555:46502:28:23:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sample comprises both people who died more than two years after the prior core survey (and so

23:560:46959:19:14:71:536:167:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:concern is that they could therefore overlap with home care expenditures already reported in the main interview.

24:566:47412:27:28:72:510:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the survey (so we only pick up modest levels of spending).  Figure 2 shows the association 
24:567:47503:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between total out-of-pocket expenditures and the time since the last core survey.  Also presented 
24:568:47601:27:28:72:498:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is the implicit incremental spending – that is, the difference between the current average 
24:569:47692:28:28:72:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures for people who died (say) between 7 and 9 months, minus expenditures for those 
24:570:47784:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who died between 4 to 6 months.  (Thus we assume that the two groups are otherwise identical 
24:571:47877:27:28:72:481:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:except for the time since the last interview – perhaps a strong assumption, but not an 
24:572:47964:28:27:72:465:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unreasonable one given the randomness of the interview dates relative to death).   
24:573:48047:27:28:108:537:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Figure 2 demonstrates that a large fraction of spending in the last two years occurs in the 
24:574:48139:28:28:71:519:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:last 6 months, although spending continues to climb to an average of nearly twenty thousand 
24:575:48231:28:27:71:538:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dollars for people whose last interviews were more than 2 years prior to death.  That incremental 
24:576:48329:27:28:71:512:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending falls off so much in later months is suggestive of recall bias, but further modeling 
24:577:48423:28:27:71:352:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:would be required to measure and correct for recall bias.   
24:578:48483:27:28:107:529:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:To adjust for these clear differences in expenditures by months since the last interview, 
24:579:48573:28:27:71:531:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:we present results that correspond to Table 3a of the distribution of spending, but adjust for the 
24:580:48672:27:28:71:542:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:number of months since the interview by using a quartic in months, and setting the value(s) equal 
24:581:48770:28:28:71:535:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to 12 months prior to death.  Regression results (from both weighted least squares and weighted 
24:582:48866:28:27:71:537:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quantile regressions) are presented in Table 3b.  The mean values are similar, and the magnitude 
24:583:48963:27:28:71:526:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the shrinkage at the 95th percentile is quite modest or even non-existent in some cases.  The 
24:584:49060:28:27:72:515:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:impact of the shrinkage is greatest at the very top of the distribution – for example, as noted 
24:585:49156:27:28:72:515:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:above the 99th percentile of unadjusted total out-of-pocket expenditures is $101,581, but the 
24:586:49250:28:0:72:529:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:adjusted measure is $94,310.  In sum, these 12-month measures are more accurate estimates of 
25:587:49347:0:27:72:513:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the true distribution of out-of-pocket expenditures, but even after these corrections, the true 
25:588:49443:27:28:72:327:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:variation in medical expenditures is still substantial.  
25:589:49500:28:27:108:520:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We next consider the association between out-of-pocket expenditures and wealth and 
25:590:49583:27:28:72:540:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income quintiles.  Table 4a presents detailed spending measures by wealth quintile, and Table 4b 
25:591:49680:28:28:71:532:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:shows equivalent measures by income quintile.  The mean values are not exactly the same as in 
25:592:49774:28:27:72:533:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the aggregates reported in Table 3 because the sample changes somewhat due to missing values 
25:593:49867:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for either income (resulting in a sample size of 5,775) or wealth (N = 6,089).  Total out-of-pocket 
25:594:49967:28:27:72:531:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures for decedents rise from $7,173 in the bottom wealth quintile to $18,233 in the top 
25:595:50063:27:28:72:495:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quintile, an increase of 154 percent.  All measures of spending exhibit a positive wealth 
25:596:50153:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:elasticity, but some are larger in magnitude than others.  For example, while nursing home and 
25:597:50248:28:27:71:542:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hospital expenditures are nearly double for the highest quintile compared to the lowest quintile of 
25:598:50348:27:28:72:513:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wealth ($6,521 versus $3,461), the largest proportional differences arise in care provided at 
25:599:50442:28:27:72:526:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:home, for example home care ($1,334 versus $383), non-medical expenditures ($1,416 versus 
25:600:50532:27:28:72:332:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$335) and helper costs ($2,601 compared to $547).     
25:601:50586:28:27:108:530:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There are similar associations between spending and income, but as shown in Table 4b, 
25:602:50672:27:28:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:they are much less pronounced.  Overall spending rises from $9,046 in the bottom quintile to 
25:603:50765:28:28:72:517:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$14,269 in the top quintile, with patterns similar to those for wealth apparent with respect to 
25:604:50861:28:27:71:527:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spending on home care, non-medical care, and helper costs.  Also of interest are the categories 
25:605:50957:27:28:72:532:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that are not associated with income, for example hospital and nursing home expenses; these are 
25:606:51052:28:27:72:513:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$4,022 for the lowest income level and $4,471 for the highest.  In part this is because lower 
25:607:51146:27:28:72:529:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income decedents were more likely to have experienced a nursing home admission (11 percent 
25:608:51237:28:28:72:527:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:compared to 7 percent for the highest income group) increasing the unconditional mean.  That 
25:609:51330:28:0:72:532:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:said, it does not appear that one commonly offered explanation for income-based differences in 
26:610:51429:0:27:72:516:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:out-of-pocket spending – the use of luxury nursing homes – receives much support from the 
26:611:51519:27:28:72:115:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:data.26    
26:612:51530:28:27:108:535:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We further consider a multiple regression model of spending as a function of observable 
26:613:51618:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:characteristics to disentangle separate effects of income and wealth on expenditures.  We control 
26:614:51716:28:28:72:520:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for sex, race, Hispanic identification, a quadratic in schooling, a cubic in age, and (as before) 
26:615:51814:28:27:72:514:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:control for months prior to the previous core interview.  Figure 3 presents just the predicted 
26:616:51909:27:28:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:measures of out-of-pocket total expenditures, evaluated at the mean values of the explanatory 
26:617:52003:28:27:72:492:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:variables and the assumption of a 12-month value for months since last interview.  The 
26:618:52090:27:28:72:525:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:regression results indicate that out-of-pocket expenditures are roughly twice as high in the top 
26:619:52187:28:28:72:513:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wealth quintile compared to the bottom wealth quintile (95 percent confidence intervals are 
26:620:52279:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:shown by the whiskers in the diagram), but that the impact of income is no longer significantly 
26:621:52375:27:28:71:541:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:different from zero.  In sum, the estimates support the hypothesis that out-of-pocket expenditures 
26:622:52474:28:27:71:510:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are determined primarily by wealth on hand, and not by late-life income flows.  This result 
26:623:52566:27:28:71:501:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:accords with estimates presented in Smith (1999) that demonstrates a significant positive 
26:624:52656:28:27:71:539:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relationship between wealth and health status in the HRS, but no such relationship for retirement 
26:625:52754:27:28:71:168:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income and health.  
26:626:52774:28:28:107:532:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally, we present raw measures of out-of-pocket expenditures broken down by wealth 
26:627:52859:28:27:71:515:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quintiles and by age group.  We find a strong association between spending and age, as also 
26:628:52951:27:28:71:516:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:noted by De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010), with a widening distribution of spending with 
26:629:53042:28:27:71:520:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wealth quintile at older ages.  In Figure 4a, for example, end-of-life spending for those dying 
26:630:53138:27:18:71:537:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:under age 70 is quite modest, but average expenditures rise rapidly so that for the highest wealth

27:635:53554:27:28:72:498:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pattern is shown also for nursing home and hospitals expenditures (Figure 4b), it is most 
27:636:53644:28:27:72:540:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pronounced for home-related services – the sum of home health care, helpers, non-medical costs, 
27:637:53740:27:28:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and other medical expenses.  While such spending barely budges with age for the lowest wealth 
27:638:53834:28:28:72:513:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quintile, it rises more than three-fold (from an average of $3,448 to $11,594) by age for the 
27:639:53928:28:27:72:509:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:highest wealth quintile. This pattern is consistent with a greater likelihood of sudden-onset 
27:640:54022:27:28:72:522:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:illnesses for younger decedents, rather than long (and expensive) chronic illnesses among the 
27:641:54116:28:27:72:128:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:oldest old.

27:643:54129:28:28:72:147:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:V. Conclusion 
27:644:54143:28:27:108:503:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Previous studies of out-of-pocket expenditures have generally found low levels of 
27:645:54225:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average expenditures but a high degree of skewness in the distribution (Palumbo, 1999; Feenberg 
27:646:54321:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Skinner, 1994; French and Jones, 2004).  In part, the low mean values were the consequence 
27:647:54416:27:28:72:510:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of older data and generally lower levels of health care spending in those years.  Our results 
27:648:54510:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:suggest that, at least for the period 1998-2006, out-of-pocket expenditures near the end of life are 
27:649:54611:27:28:72:517:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:both pervasive and large, particularly for higher wealth groups and at older ages.  Even after 
27:650:54706:28:28:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:adjusting for the variable length of time the decedents are in the sample, average out-of-pocket 
27:651:54803:28:27:72:503:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenditures in the last 12 months of life are $11,618, with a median of $5,061 and a 95th 
27:652:54893:27:28:71:524:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentile measure equal to $49,907.  These numbers at least appear to be large relative to the 
27:653:54989:28:27:71:327:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decedent’s median non-housing wealth ($24,706).     
27:654:55041:27:28:107:526:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We have also found a strong wealth elasticity of spending, which adds some nuance to 
27:655:55126:28:28:71:528:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the notion of health expenditure shocks.  Given that our sample consists of recent decedents, it 
27:656:55223:28:0:71:524:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:would be hard to argue that the health “shock” experienced by the lowest wealth individual is 
28:657:55321:0:27:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:much different from that shock experienced by the highest wealth group.  It may therefore be 
28:658:55414:27:28:72:508:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tempting to view all of these wealth-elastic expenditure choices as “luxury” spending, like 
28:659:55506:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:purchasing a Lexus rather than a Kia.27  In this view, the low-wealth-quintile spending measure 
28:660:55602:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:would represent the “true” shock to spending and all the rest is deemed endogenous, and thus 
28:661:55695:28:28:71:403:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:perhaps not relevant for coverage under social insurance programs.   
28:662:55764:28:27:107:529:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:However, it may well be that the lowest wealth group as unable to afford uninsured but 
28:663:55851:27:28:71:518:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:medically valuable commodities– as one might expect for a group reporting zero median net 
28:664:55941:28:27:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wealth and an income of less than $10,000—and that no spending is therefore observed for these 
28:665:56036:27:28:72:511:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:needed items. Similarly, those with low income or wealth may only be able to afford lower 
28:666:56126:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quality care.   For example, Mor et al. (2004) showed much lower levels of quality – as measured 
28:667:56223:28:27:72:537:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by the prevalence of high-risk pressure ulcers, restraint use, and lack of pain control – in nursing 
28:668:56324:27:28:72:304:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:homes catering largely to Medicaid patients. 28   
28:669:56374:28:27:108:517:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Indeed, the ultimate luxury good appears to be the ability to retain independence and 
28:670:56460:27:28:72:512:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:remain in one’s home (perhaps altered to permit easy navigation), through the use of (paid) 
28:671:56552:28:27:72:540:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:helpers and home health care assistance.  Once admitted to the nursing home, a further benefit of 
28:672:56650:27:28:72:516:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:assets is the ability to eschew Medicaid, which many would prefer to avoid (Ameriks, et al., 
28:673:56743:28:28:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2010), and to have the ability to purchase more comfortable living arrangements.  These types of 
28:674:56840:28:27:72:540:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expenses are generally not amenable to insurance coverage, and thus it is not surprising that only 
28:675:56939:27:28:72:538:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:those with sufficient accumulated wealth can afford high levels of spending; levels that are large 
28:676:57038:28:21:72:526:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relative to even high flows of income.  Our results are thus consistent with the view that many 
28:677:57134:21:19:72:218:163:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
28:678:57194:19:24:72:523:144:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:27  For a model of endogenous out‐of‐pocket health care expenditures, see De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010). 
28:679:57304:24:19:72:517:120:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:28  This finding contrasts with the view of Hurd and Rohwedder (2009) who state that “[b]ecause of Medicaid, 
28:680:57413:19:0:71:466:101:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:amounts spent by a single person on long‐term end‐of‐life stay have practically no value.” (p.3)    
29:681:57517:0:27:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:elderly may continue to hold (or even accumulate) wealth as a hedge against uninsured costs 
29:682:57609:27:28:72:461:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:surrounding expensive end of live care-giving for themselves or their spouse.      
29:683:57692:28:27:108:518:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The independent living arrangements facilitated by wealth could also have long-term 
29:684:57776:27:28:72:487:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:effects on survival and functioning. Although the evidence on this issue is sparse, one 
29:685:57864:28:28:72:530:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:randomized trial did suggest that specialized home nursing improves survival following cancer 
29:686:57958:28:27:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:treatment (McCorkle, et al., 2000).  While this result applies to a fairly specialized form of home 
29:687:58058:27:28:71:534:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:care, it is consistent with the idea that wealth can translate into better health through these types 
29:688:58160:28:27:71:536:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of (uninsured) mechanisms. Certainly many patients themselves would testify that they will fare 
29:689:58256:27:28:71:506:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:better if allowed to remain in their own home. Finally, items such as special food or home 
29:690:58347:28:28:71:518:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:accommodations likely affect health directly, for example by reducing falls or other injuries. 
29:691:58442:28:27:107:521:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There are several important limitations of this study.  First, we recognize the inherent 
29:692:58531:27:28:71:521:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:uncertainty surrounding many of the assumptions about limits on spending, whether monthly 
29:693:58621:28:27:71:525:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:caps or the length of time we might expect spending to have occurred (e.g., for helpers).  That 
29:694:58717:27:28:72:498:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:said, we believe that even with our conservative imputations, there is strong evidence of 
29:695:58807:28:27:72:528:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantial pockets of out-of-pocket expenditures in the data, estimates that are consistent with 
29:696:58905:27:28:72:535:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aggregate measures of out-of-pocket spending. Furthermore, large differences exist by ability to 
29:697:59002:28:28:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pay. Even if we cap total out-of-pocket spending at the 95th percentile value to limit the impact 
29:698:59100:28:27:72:382:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of outliers, we find dramatic differences in spending by wealth.  
29:699:59166:27:28:108:533:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Second, we have not adequately captured non-monetary care-giving by family members 
29:700:59249:28:27:71:503:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that may be provided out of affection, or alternatively, motivated by inheritances or other 
29:701:59341:27:28:71:542:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:transfers.  Past studies suggest that value of this unpaid care is far greater than that of formal paid 
29:702:59445:28:0:71:513:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:care. Furthermore, this unpaid caregiving may well be concentrated in the lower tails of the 
30:703:59542:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income and wealth distributions and may offset some of the differences we observe with respect 
30:704:59637:27:28:72:236:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to expenditures on in-home care.  
30:705:59671:28:27:108:534:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Third, our focus on end-of-life spending reflects only the last year or so of life, and does 
30:706:59764:27:28:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not capture lifetime risks (as in Palumbo, 1999; Webb and Zhivan, 2010; or De Nardi, French, 
30:707:59857:28:28:72:536:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Jones, 2010).  Nor do we capture the important risk of disabling health shocks for those still 
30:708:59956:28:27:71:515:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:working.  During a 10-year period for people in their 50s, seven out of ten adults developed 
30:709:60049:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:health problems, lost their jobs, or lost spouses owing to divorce or death (Johnson, Mermin, and 
30:710:60147:28:27:71:526:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Uccello, 2006; also see Smith, 2005).  Such losses would lead to much diminished wealth and 
30:711:60239:27:28:71:370:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income as just as individuals are approaching retirement age.  
30:712:60302:28:28:107:530:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Despite these qualifications, we believe that this study sheds important light on the role 
30:713:60393:28:27:71:504:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of medically related expenditures in affecting the resources of the elderly. This issue is of 
30:714:60487:27:28:71:497:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantial policy concern particularly as we consider health care reform, changes in the 
30:715:60577:28:27:71:519:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:provision of care, and the much debated question whether those retiring today have adequate 
30:716:60669:27:28:71:511:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:savings and insurance to cover future health care needs (Skinner, 2007). Understanding the 
30:717:60760:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:nature of risks and more importantly, the health-based value of these out-of-pocket expenditures 
30:718:60857:27:28:71:524:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:– as opposed to their pure consumption value -- is central to designing future social insurance 
30:719:60953:28:28:71:230:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:policies to temper their burden.
