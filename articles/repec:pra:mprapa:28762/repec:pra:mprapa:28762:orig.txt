2:13:288:12:11:66:548:609:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:A  quantitative  model  is  presented  linking  the  rate  of  inflation  and  unemployment  to  the  change  in  the  level  of  labor 
2:14:424:11:12:66:548:598:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:force. The link between the involved variables is a linear one with all coefficients of individual and generalized models 
2:15:546:12:11:66:548:586:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:obtained empirically. To achieve the best fit between measured and predicted time series cumulative curves are used as 
2:16:665:11:12:66:548:575:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:a  simplified version of the 1-D  boundary elements  method. All  models  for Australia  are similar to those  obtained  for 
2:17:790:12:11:66:523:563:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the US, France, Japan and other developed countries and thus validate the concept and related quantitative model.

2:22:1002:15:20:66:134:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Introduction 
2:23:1014:20:21:66:549:480:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Five  years  ago  we introduced  a  concept linking by  linear  and  lagged  relationships price inflation 
2:24:1119:21:20:66:549:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  unemployment  in  developed  countries  to  the  change  rate  of  labor  force (Kitov,  2006). 
2:25:1220:20:21:66:548:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Corresponding model  is  a  completely  deterministic  one  with the  change  in  labor  force  being  the 
2:26:1325:21:21:66:549:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only  driving  force  causing  all  variations  in  the  pair  unemployment/inflation. Since  2006, many 
2:27:1428:21:21:66:549:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empirically  estimated  models  were (conditional  on  the  length  of  relevant  time  series) tested 
2:28:1531:21:20:66:429:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:econometrically and demonstrated the presence of cointegrating relations.   
2:29:1605:20:21:66:549:356:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Our model  is a natural  extension  of  the conventional  economic/econometric models  and 
2:30:1691:21:21:66:549:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concepts. For  example,  Stock  and  Watson  (2008)  conducted  a  formal  study  of  a  large  number  of 
2:31:1798:21:20:66:549:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic/financial  variables  and indices  as  predictors  of  inflation  using  the  Phillips  curve.  The 
2:32:1906:20:21:66:549:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  in  labor  force  was  not  included  in  this  enormously  large set  of approximately 200 
2:33:2004:21:21:66:549:273:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:predictors. Therefore, we extended this studied set and conducted a similar statistical investigation. 
2:34:2107:21:20:66:549:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Fortunately,  this measurable  macroeconomic variable  is  characterized  by  a  much  better  predictive 
2:35:2211:20:21:66:549:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power  and  inflation  is now not “hard  to  forecast”.    The  change  in  labor  force  in  the  biggest 
2:36:2318:21:21:66:549:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed countries (the USA, Japan, France, Germany, etc.) is so good a predictor that there is no 
2:37:2418:21:21:66:548:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:need  to  use  any  autoregressive (AR) properties  of  inflation.  In  this  sense,  our  model  is  fully 
2:38:2526:21:20:66:414:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deterministic and the model residuals are related to measurement errors. 
2:39:2598:20:21:66:548:149:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  In  its  original  form,  the  model  was  revealed  and  formulated  for the  United  States  (Kitov, 
2:40:2700:21:21:66:549:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2006).  The  root-mean-square  forecasting  error  (RMSFE)  of  inflation  at  a  2.5  year  horizon was of 
2:41:2808:21:20:66:549:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:0.8%  between  1965  and  2004.   Well-known  non-stationary behavior of  all  involved  variables 
2:42:2906:20:0:66:549:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:required testing for  the  presence  of  cointegrating  relations (Kitov,  Kitov, and Dolinskaya; 2007). 
3:43:3009:0:21:66:548:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Both,  the  Engle-Granger  and  Johansen approaches  have  shown  the  existence  of  cointegration 
3:44:3108:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between  unemployment,  inflation  and  the  change  in  labor  force,  i.e.  the  presence  of  long-term 
3:45:3215:21:20:66:548:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equilibrium (in other words, deterministic or causal) relations. Because the change in labor force is 
3:46:3317:20:21:66:548:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:likely a stochastic process and it drives the other two variables they also can be formally stochastic 
3:47:3420:21:21:66:251:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:process, but fully deterministic ones.   
3:48:3460:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: In  this paper,  we  empirically  estimate  several  models  of  inflation  and  unemployment for 
3:49:3557:21:20:66:548:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Australia.  This is one of few countries we have skipped in our previous analysis and it is good time 
3:50:3658:20:21:66:548:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  fill  this  gap. Our  research  and  its  results  add  to  the  extensive  literature related  to  inflation  and 
3:51:3776:21:21:66:546:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment in Australia. For example, Norman and Richards (2010) reviewed a range of single-
3:52:3870:21:20:66:532:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equation models of inflation for Australia. They found that the expectations-augmented standard 
3:53:3964:20:21:66:549:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Phillips  curve  or  mark-up  models show  better  predictive  power  than the  New-Keynesian  Phillips 
3:54:4066:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curve.  Another  important  conclusion  is  that  the  unemployment  rate better  fits  inflation  data than 
3:55:4174:21:21:66:549:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:either  the  output  gap  or  level  of  real marginal  costs.  Due  to  the  overall  decrease  in  the  rate  of 
3:56:4287:21:20:66:548:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  the relative explanatory  power of  all  inflation  models has  fallen. Not  surprisingly,  such 
3:57:4395:20:23:66:548:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:determinants of inflation as commodity prices or growth rate of money do not influence Australian 
3:58:4491:23:22:66:549:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation. We  presume  that  the  absence  of  labor  force  in  the  set  of  predictors  is  the  cause  of  the 
3:59:4606:22:21:66:219:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:eternal problems in prediction.  
3:60:4637:21:20:66:549:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Econometrically, price inflation  is often considered as  a  stochastic  process. Stock  and 
3:61:4729:20:21:66:549:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Watson (2008, 2010) carried out a detailed study of AR properties of many inflation time series in 
3:62:4826:21:21:66:549:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the U.S.  Karunaratne and Bhar (2010) used Markov regime switching heteroscedasticity model to 
3:63:4917:21:21:66:549:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capture  long-run  stochastic  trend  and  short-run  noisy  components in  the rate of Australian price 
3:64:5020:21:20:66:549:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation and  inflation  uncertainty  during  the  post-float  era  1983Q3-2006Q4.    They  found  a 
3:65:5122:20:21:66:549:250:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant  deviation  from  the mainstream  Friedman  paradigm  on  inflation  and  its  uncertainty. 
3:66:5224:21:21:66:549:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However,  they  linked the  inflation  dynamics  to  the  macroeconomic  policies  pursued to  achieve 
3:67:5326:21:20:66:549:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:external  and  internal  balance  as  implied by  Keynesian  Mundell-Fleming  model. Our  findings 
3:68:5424:20:21:66:549:188:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:partially support this conclusion but the only break in the inflation dynamics has been classified as 
3:69:5525:21:21:66:549:167:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  change  in  monetary  policy  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia  around  1993 to  explicit  inflation 
3:70:5636:21:20:66:315:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:targeting (Bernanke et al, 1999; Grenville, 1997).    
3:71:5689:20:21:66:548:126:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: For  an  open  economy,  the  influence  of  external  factors  is  an  important problem.  Do  we 
3:72:5788:21:21:66:548:105:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:really  see  any  external  shocks  in  the  domestic  rate  of  inflation in  Australia?    This  question  was 
3:73:5900:21:0:66:549:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:addressed  by  Buncic  and  Malecky  (2007). They  found that domestic  demand and  supply  shocks 
4:74:5997:0:21:66:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:affect the rate of inflation the most. It was also found that domestic inflation affected by exchange 
4:75:6096:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate shocks. We  share  this  conclusion  to  the  extent  all  these  processes  can  influence  the level  of 
4:76:6206:21:20:66:127:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor force.  
4:77:6219:20:21:102:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Naturally, a sound and quantitatively accurate model of price inflation allows forecasting at 
4:78:6313:21:21:66:549:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:various time horizons. Our deterministic model is able to use labor force projections as a predictor, 
4:79:6414:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  more  accurate  projections  providing  better  forecasts.    Other inflation models  use  various 
4:80:6519:21:20:66:548:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:parameters. For example, Robinson et al.  (2003) considered the Phillips curve based on estimates 
4:81:6616:20:21:66:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the  output  gap and  found  only  poor  predictive  power relative  even  to simplest  autoregressive 
4:82:6721:21:21:66:548:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:model and random walk models (Atkeson and Ohanian, 2001). Strangely, they concluded that the 
4:83:6813:21:20:66:549:522:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:output-gap-based  Phillips  curves “may  continue to  be  useful  in  real  time”.    Hall  and  Jaaskela 
4:84:6918:20:21:66:549:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2009)  found  a  measurable  difference  in  inflation  volatility  and  thus  in the  accuracy  of  prediction 
4:85:7030:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between  countries  with  and  without  inflation  targeting.  This  may  be  a  manifestation  of  the 
4:86:7134:21:21:66:548:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interaction  between  inflation  and  unemployment under our  general  framework  linking  both 
4:87:7229:21:20:66:549:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables  to  the  change  in  labor  force. This  effect  was  clearly  observed  in  France.  A much  lower 
4:88:7339:20:21:66:540:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate of price inflation is achieved at the expense of very high rate of unemployment (Kitov, 2007). 
4:89:7436:21:21:66:549:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  rate  of  unemployment  is  a  crucial  macroeconomic  variable  as  well.   The dynamics  of 
4:90:7535:21:20:66:549:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment in Australia, as in all developed countries, has no empirically accurate explanation 
4:91:7632:20:21:66:552:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in the mainstream economics and is chiefly based on pure theoretical assumptions on labor market.  
4:92:7728:21:21:66:549:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Karanassou  and  Sala  (2009)  presented  a multi-equation  labor  market  model  comprising  labor 
4:93:7828:21:20:66:548:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:demand,  wage  setting and  labor  supply  equations. The  main  goal  was  to  describe the  most 
4:94:7926:20:21:66:549:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prominent changes  in  the  rate  of  unemployment:  the  high-amplitude increase between  1973  and 
4:95:8025:21:21:66:549:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1983 and the fall from 1993 to 2006. Wage, oil price shocks and interest rate were found to cause 
4:96:8121:21:21:66:549:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the rise in unemployment in the 1970s and early 1980s.  On the contrary, the fall in the 1990s was 
4:97:8217:21:20:66:549:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:explained as driven by the acceleration in capital accumulation. Bardsen et al. (2010) also modeled 
4:98:8313:20:21:66:548:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  rate  of  unemployment in  Australia  as an asymmetric and  non-linear  function  of  aggregate 
4:99:8413:21:21:66:549:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:demand,  productivity,  real  wages and  unemployment  benefits. In  line  with the macroeconomic 
4:100:8510:21:20:66:549:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:theory, decreasing demand results in increasing unemployment. Real wage rigidity counteracts the 
4:101:8604:20:21:66:548:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contraction  of  demand and  reduces  the  level  of  unemployment. The  nonlinearity  of  the  model  is 
4:102:8709:21:21:66:549:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defined   by   a   positive   feedback   between   the   negative   growth   in   aggregate   demand   and 
4:103:8816:21:0:66:548:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment. We have found all these driving forces irrelevant since the rate of unemployment is 
5:104:8915:0:21:66:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:driven by the change in labor force. Our model is a linear (and likely lagged) one and any change in 
5:105:9016:21:21:66:350:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor force is proportionally mapped into unemployment.   
5:106:9073:21:20:94:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  reminder  of  the  paper  is  organized  in  four  sections.  Section  1  formally  introduces  the 
5:107:9178:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:model as obtained and statistically tested in previous studies (Kitov, 2006, 2007; Kitov and Kitov, 
5:108:9277:21:21:66:548:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2010). In many countries, the US and Japan among others, the generalized link between labor force 
5:109:9375:21:21:66:548:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  two  dependent  variables  can  be  split  into two  independent  relationships,  where  inflation 
5:110:9479:21:20:66:548:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:apparently does not depend on unemployment.  In France, only the  generalized model provided an 
5:111:9574:20:21:66:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adequate  description  of  the  evolution  of  both  dependent  variables  since  the  1960s.    In  Section  1, 
5:112:9686:21:21:66:548:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we  also  present and  characterize  various  estimates  of  inflation,  unemployment  and  labor  force  in 
5:113:9795:21:20:66:119:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Australia.  
5:114:9806:20:21:94:548:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Section  2 discusses  the  Phillips  curve  in  Australia  and  reveals  the  break  in  relevant  time 
5:115:9909:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:series  around  1994.  This  year  introduces  a  structural  break  in  all  relationships  estimated  in  this 
5:116:10022:21:21:66:548:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study.   In Section3, the linear link between labor force and unemployment is modeled using annual 
5:117:10120:21:20:66:549:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and monthly measurements of both variables. Instead of poorly constrained LSQ methods we apply 
5:118:10215:20:21:66:548:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  simplified  version  of  the  1-D  boundary  element  method – cumulative  curves.    Both  empirical 
5:119:10319:21:21:66:199:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationships are accurate.   
5:120:10348:21:20:94:549:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Section 4 is devoted to the link between the rate of inflation and labor force. We also use the 
5:121:10444:20:21:66:549:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:method  of  cumulative  curves  in  order  to  estimate  all  coefficients  in  the relevant  empirical 
5:122:10547:21:21:66:548:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship. Finally, Section 5 presents the generalized link between inflation, unemployment and 
5:123:10646:21:20:66:549:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor  force.  The  best  fit  model  provides  an  accurate  prediction  of  inflation  as  a  function  of  labor 
5:124:10761:20:21:66:195:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:force and unemployment.

5:126:10785:21:21:84:207:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. The model and data 
5:127:10803:21:20:66:549:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  originally  defined  by  Kitov  (2006),  inflation  and  unemployment  are  linear  and  potentially 
5:128:10908:20:21:66:309:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lagged functions of the change rate of labor force: 
5:129:10959:21:21:94:181:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  
5:130:10959:21:20:94:549:170:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:π(t) = A1dLF(t-t1)/LF(t-t1) + A2                             (1) 
5:131:11014:20:21:94:549:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:UE(t) = B1dLF(t-t2)/LF(t-t2) + B2                          (2) 
5:132:11067:21:21:546:549:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
5:133:11067:21:21:66:549:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:where π(t) is the rate of price inflation at time t, as represented by some standard measure such as 
5:134:11168:21:0:66:548:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:GDP  deflator  (DGDP)  or  CPI; UE(t) is  the  rate  of  unemployment  at  time t,  which  can  be  also 
6:135:11273:0:21:66:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:represented by various measures; LF(t) is the level of labor force at time t; t1 and t2 are the time lags 
6:136:11376:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between the inflation, unemployment, and labor force, respectively; A1, B1, A2, and B2 are country 
6:137:11474:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:specific  coefficients,  which  have  to  be  determined  empirically  in  calibration  procedures.  These 
6:138:11581:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coefficients  may  vary  through  time  for  a  given  country,  as  induced  by  numerous  revisions  to  the 
6:139:11692:21:21:66:548:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:definitions   and   measurement   methodologies   of   the   studied   variables,   i.e.   by   variations   in 
6:140:11804:21:21:66:165:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measurement units.  
6:141:11823:21:20:93:549:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Linear  relationships  (1)  and  (2)  define  inflation  and  unemployment  separately.  These 
6:142:11918:20:21:66:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables  are  two  indivisible  manifestations  or  consequences  of  a  unique  process,  however.  The 
6:143:12025:21:21:66:548:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:process  is  the growth  in  labor  force  which  is  accommodated  in  developed  economies  (we  do  not 
6:144:12132:21:20:66:549:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:include developing and emergent economies in this analysis) through two channels. First channel is 
6:145:12231:20:21:66:549:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  increase  in  employment  and  corresponding  change  in  personal  income  distribution  (PID).  All 
6:146:12338:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:persons  obtaining  new  paid  jobs  or  their  equivalents  presumably  change  their  incomes  to  some 
6:147:12444:21:21:66:549:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:higher  levels.  There  is  an  ultimate  empirical  fact,  however,  that  PID  in  the  USA  does  not  change 
6:148:12557:21:20:66:548:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  time  in  relative  terms,  i.e.  when  normalized to  the  total  population  and  total  income.  The 
6:149:12667:20:21:66:549:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increasing  number  of  people  at  higher  income  levels,  as  related  to  the  new  paid  jobs,  leads  to  a 
6:150:12781:21:21:66:549:398:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:certain disturbance in the PID. This over-concentration (or “over-pressure”) of population in some 
6:151:12880:21:20:66:549:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income  bins  above  its  “neutral”  long-term  value  must  be  compensated  by  such  an  extension  in 
6:152:12986:20:21:66:549:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corresponding income scale, which returns the PID to its original density. Related stretching of the 
6:153:13087:21:21:66:549:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income  scale  is  the  core  driving  force  of  price  inflation,  i.e.  the  US  economy  needs  exactly  the 
6:154:13200:21:20:66:549:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount of money, extra to that related to real GDP growth, to pull back the PID to its fixed shape. 
6:155:13300:20:21:66:549:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  mechanism  responsible  for  the  compensation  and  the  income  scale  stretching,  should  have 
6:156:13404:21:21:66:549:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:some  positive  relaxation  time,  which  effectively  separates  in  time  the  source  of  inflation,  i.e.  the 
6:157:13519:21:21:66:328:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor force change, and the reaction, i.e. the inflation.  
6:158:13577:21:20:93:549:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second channel is related to those persons in the labor force who failed to obtain a new paid 
6:159:13671:20:21:66:548:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:job.  These  people  do  not  leave  the  labor  force but  join  unemployment.  Supposedly,  they  do  not 
6:160:13778:21:21:66:549:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  the  PID  because  they  do  not  change  their  incomes.  Therefore,  total  labor  force  change 
6:161:13885:21:20:66:549:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equals unemployment change plus employment change, the latter process expressed through lagged 
6:162:13980:20:21:66:548:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation.  In  the  case  of  a  "natural"  behavior  of  the  economic  system,  which  is  defined  as  a  stable 
6:163:14097:21:21:66:548:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:balance  of  socio-economic  forces  in  the  society,  the  partition  of  labor  force  growth  between 
6:164:14203:21:21:66:549:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment  and  inflation  is  retained  through  time  and  the  linear  relationships  hold  separately. 
6:165:14313:21:0:66:549:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There is always a possibility, however, to fix one of the two dependent variables. Central banks are 
7:166:14415:0:21:66:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:definitely able to influence inflation rate by monetary means, i.e. to force money supply to change 
7:167:14515:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relative  to  its  natural  demand.  To  account  for  this  effect  one  should  to  use  a  generalized 
7:168:14621:21:20:66:323:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship as represented by the sum of (1) and (2): 
7:169:14675:20:21:93:96:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:170:14675:21:21:93:547:626:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:π(t)+UE(t)= A1dLF(t-t1)/LF(t-t1)+B1dLF(t-t2)/LF(t-t2)+A2+B2                                           (3) 
7:171:14777:21:21:546:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:172:14777:21:20:66:548:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Equation  (3)  balances  the  change  in  labor force  to  inflation  and  unemployment,  the  latter  two 
7:173:14884:20:21:66:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables  potentially  lagging  by  different  times  behind  the  labor  force  change.  Effectively,  when 
7:174:14994:21:21:66:471:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:t1≠0 or/and t2≠0, one should not link inflation and unemployment for the same year. 
7:175:15077:21:20:66:548:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: One can rewrite (3) in a form similar to that of the Phillips curve, but without autoregressive 
7:176:15173:20:21:66:99:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:terms: 
7:177:15179:21:21:66:75:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:   
7:178:15181:21:21:102:549:460:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:π(t) = C1dLF(t-t1)/LF(t-t1)+C2UE(t+t2-t1)+C3                             (4) 
7:179:15251:21:20:66:69:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:180:15251:20:21:66:548:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:where  coefficients C1,  C2, and C3  should  be  better  determined  empirically  despite  they  can  be 
7:181:15355:21:21:66:549:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:directly obtained from (3) by simple algebraic transformation. The rationale behind the superiority 
7:182:15455:21:20:66:549:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the empirical estimation is the presence of high measurement noise in all original time series. In 
7:183:15557:20:21:66:548:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:some places, (4) can provide a more effective destructive interference of such noise than does (3). 
7:184:15657:21:21:66:549:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Consequently, the coefficients providing the best fit for (3) and (4), whatever method is used, may 
7:185:15757:21:20:66:133:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be different.   
7:186:15772:20:21:102:549:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  principal  source  of  information is the  OECD  database  (http://www.oecd.org/)  which 
7:187:15865:21:21:66:549:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provides  comprehensive  data  sets  on  labor  force,  unemployment,  GDP  deflator  (DGDP),  and  CPI 
7:188:15969:21:21:66:549:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation. We   also   use   the estimates   reported by   the   U.S.   Bureau   of   Labor   Statistic 
7:189:16072:21:20:66:548:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(http://www.bls.gov) for corroboration  of  the data  on CPI, unemployment  and  labor  force. As  a 
7:190:16170:20:21:66:548:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rule,  readings  associated  with  the  same  variable  but  obtained  from  different  sources  do  not 
7:191:16275:21:21:66:549:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coincide.  This  is  due  to  different  approaches  and  definitions  applied  by  corresponding  agencies. 
7:192:16384:21:20:66:549:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This diversity of definitions is accompanied by a degree of uncertainty related to the methodology 
7:193:16481:20:21:66:548:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of measurements. This uncertainty cannot be directly  estimated but certainly  affects the reliability 
7:194:16584:21:21:66:197:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of empirical relationships.  
7:195:16611:21:21:102:548:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  addition  to  all  these  data  quality  problems,  there  is  no compatibility  in  definitions and 
7:196:16715:21:0:66:549:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measurement procedures over time. All data provided by all statistical agencies have to be checked 
8:197:16813:0:21:66:428:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for artificial breaks. For Australia, the OECD (2008) reports the following: 
8:198:16888:21:14:66:69:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:199:16888:14:14:84:548:674:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Series   breaks:   A   new   questionnaire   was   introduced   in   2001   and   employment and 
8:200:16984:14:13:84:548:660:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment series were re-estimated from 1986. From April 1986, employment data include 
8:201:17074:13:14:84:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unpaid  family  workers  having  worked  less  than  15  hours  in  a  family  business  or  on  a  farm. 
8:202:17180:14:14:84:549:633:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Previously, such persons who worked 1 to 14 hours or who had such a job but were not at work, 
8:203:17273:14:14:84:548:619:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:were  defined  as  either  unemployed  or  not  in  the  labor  force,  depending  on  whether  they  were 
8:204:17380:14:14:84:212:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:actively looking for work. 
8:205:17406:14:13:66:69:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:206:17406:13:21:84:548:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Several central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, shifted their monetary policy to 
8:207:17501:21:21:66:549:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  targeting  around  1994.  This introduced a real structural break  in  underlying  time  series 
8:208:17605:21:21:66:549:536:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the generalized dependence between three macroeconomic variables under study is mandatory 
8:209:17698:21:20:66:103:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to use.  
8:210:17706:20:21:84:549:495:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To  begin  with, we  introduce the  estimates  of  all  variables.  There  are two  time  series  for 
8:211:17808:21:21:66:549:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation,  unemployment  and  the  level  of  labor  force.    Figures  1 displays  the  evolution  of  two 
8:212:17917:21:20:66:548:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:principal measures of price inflation – GDP deflator, DGDP, and consumer price index, CPI. Both 
8:213:18011:20:21:66:548:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables were published by the OECD.  As has been already discussed, we consider the DGDP as 
8:214:18104:21:21:66:549:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a better representative of price inflation in a given country since it includes all prices related to the 
8:215:18210:21:21:66:549:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy.  The  overall  consumer  price  index, CPI,  is  fully  included  in  the  DGDP  and  thus  its 
8:216:18315:21:20:66:548:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behavior  represents  only  a  larger  part  of  the  economy.  Since  labor  force  and  unemployment  do 
8:217:18422:20:21:66:549:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characterize  the  entire  economy  it  is  methodically  better  to  use  DGDP  for  any  quantitative 
8:218:18526:21:21:66:549:329:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:modeling. Figure 1 shows that the overall difference between the CPI and DGDP is minor but there 
8:219:18623:21:20:66:552:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are short periods of very large discrepancy: from 1984 to 1987, from 1993 to 1995, and since 2003.   
8:220:18721:20:21:102:548:288:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The rate of inflation fell to the level of 0.04 y-1 in 1991and has been oscillating around this 
8:221:18816:21:21:66:548:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level  since.  Between  1974  and  1990,  inflation  was  almost  everywhere  above  6%  per  year.  This 
8:222:18922:21:21:66:549:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behavior  is  similar  to  that  in  many  developed  countries  and  our  concept  well  explained  both  the 
8:223:19033:21:20:66:384:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:peak and the fall in the U.S. using only the change in labor force.  
8:224:19101:20:21:102:549:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure  2  depicts  two  estimates  of  the  rate of  unemployment  as  reported  by  the  OECD  and 
8:225:19202:21:21:66:549:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the U.S. BLS. Surprisingly, the difference between these curves is almost negligible. There are two 
8:226:19302:21:20:66:548:163:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sharp peaks – in 1984 and 1994, i.e. the years with potential (artificial and real) structural breaks in 
8:227:19406:20:21:66:548:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:all time series. The highest rate of unemployment in Australia was at the level of 11% in 1993, and 
8:228:19506:21:21:66:549:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  lowermost  one  was  around  1%  before  1965.  This  extremely  low  rate  of  unemployment  was 
8:229:19609:21:20:66:549:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:likely  related  to  definition  and  measuring  problems.  We  prefer  to  refrain from  quantitative 
8:230:19712:20:0:66:250:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:modeling of the period prior to 1970.

10:240:20053:13:0:66:530:93:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:and U.S. definition (BLS).  The difference in the lower panel shows a higher volatility before 1980.  
11:241:20154:0:21:102:548:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The rate of  change in labor force in  |Figure 3 also has two representations: the OECD and 
11:242:20246:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:BLS.    Both  time  series  are  very  close  after  1980  with  the  overall  difference  between  45,000  to 
11:243:20357:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:60,000. All in all, this is an excellent agreement and the rate of change is practically identical. The 
11:244:20461:20:21:66:548:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period before 1980 is not so attractive for quantitative modeling – the difference between the BLS 
11:245:20559:21:21:66:548:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  OECD  time  series  is  very  volatile.  This  observation  may  be  related  to  the  long-term  iterative 
11:246:20672:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:process  of  revision  to  labor  force  definition.  Hence,  one  should  not expect  any  good  quantitative 
11:247:20783:21:20:66:549:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agreement between observed and predicted time  series before 1980 – the  level of labor force,  and 
11:248:20882:20:21:66:339:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:thus, the rate of change both have very high uncertainty. 
11:249:20939:21:21:102:549:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The main task of this study is to estimate the best fit empirical relationships between these 
11:250:21033:21:20:66:548:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:three variables. By definition, all relationships are linear and potentially lagged. Therefore, this task 
11:251:21139:20:21:66:549:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:does  not  seem  a  difficult  one.  As  a  rule,  we  prefer  to  use  cumulative  curves  instead  of  linear 
11:252:21251:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regression since the latter provides heavily biased estimates of the slope when both variables have 
11:253:21351:21:21:66:153:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:high uncertainty.  
11:254:21369:21:21:102:105:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
11:255:21369:21:20:84:201:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2. The Phillips curve  
11:256:21390:20:21:66:548:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In   its   simplest   form,   the   Phillips   curve   is   a statistical link   between   price   inflation   and 
11:257:21505:21:20:66:549:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment. It can be represented as a scatter plot or as time series of the rate of unemployment 
11:258:21604:20:21:66:548:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  Australia and the  rate  of CPI  inflation reduced  to  the  unemployment  time  series  by  a  linear 
11:259:21709:21:21:66:549:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship, as displayed in Figure 4. The period between 1974 and 1994 shows a good agreement 
11:260:21803:21:20:66:549:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  R2=0.76.  After  1995 the observed  and  predicted curves  diverge.  This is  likely related  to  the 
11:261:21910:20:21:66:487:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:new monetary policy of the Australian central bank associated with inflation targeting.  
11:262:21997:21:21:102:548:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure  4  shows  that the  Phillips  curve  does  not  exist  in  Australia  for  the  entire  period 
11:263:22099:21:21:66:549:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between 1974 and 2009 as a single relationship between inflation and unemployment. As discussed 
11:264:22193:21:20:66:549:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:above, we have limited quantitative modeling to the period of accurate measurements presented by 
11:265:22290:20:21:66:549:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The discrepancy between the observed and predicted curves in 
11:266:22387:21:21:66:549:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure 4 can manifest the absence of any relation between inflation and unemployment since 1995 
11:267:22483:21:20:66:549:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or  represent  a  structural  break.  The  latter  case  can  be  reduced  to  a  new  linear  relationship  after 
11:268:22598:20:21:66:549:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1994. Therefore, our next task is to estimate both coefficients of linear equation for the period after 
11:269:22702:21:21:66:102:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1994.   
11:270:22709:21:21:66:549:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Theoretically,  linear  regression  is  the  technique  to  estimate  the  coeffcients.  However,  both 
11:271:22813:21:0:66:548:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables,  especially  the  CPI  time  series,  are  characterized  by  significant  uncertainty.  When  both 
12:272:22926:0:21:66:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables  have  uncertainty,  the  method  of    linear  regression  underestimates  the  slope.  Because  of 
12:273:23037:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this  bias  we  prefer  to  estimate  the  coefficients  by  fitting  cumulative  curves  of  the  measured 
12:274:23145:21:20:66:548:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables. When a linear link between the studied variables does exist the cumulative curves must 
12:275:23243:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:converge over time in realtive terms. In the absence of the link, no convergence is possible and the 
12:276:23344:21:21:66:549:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cumulative  curves  will  give  a  clear  and  strong  signal of  the  discrepancy. The  superiority  of 
12:277:23448:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cumulative values may be illustrated by a simple example. One can calculate average velocity of a 
12:278:23546:21:20:66:552:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:car by integrating instant velocity estimates or dividing total path by travel time. The latter value is  
12:279:23652:20:21:66:513:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more accurate than the integral one and the relative accuracy only increases with travel time.

12:283:23841:12:13:66:548:201:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:series by relationship shown in the Figure.  The curves are close between 1974 and 1994 with R2=0.76 
12:284:23940:13:13:66:548:188:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:for this period. The following deviation might result from changes in monetary policy after 1994 and 
12:285:24041:13:13:66:487:175:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:also be associated with revisions to corresponding definitions and measuring procedures.

12:287:24129:21:21:102:549:141:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure  5  presents  the  results  of  the  trial-and-error  method  applied  to  the  observed  and 
12:288:24230:21:20:66:549:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:predicted  cumulative  curves.    In  the  upper  panel,  the  annual  readings  are  plotted.  The  predcited 
12:289:24341:20:21:66:549:100:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curve is volatile, and thus, is smoothed by  a three-year moving average,  MA(3).  As required, the 
12:290:24439:21:0:66:550:79:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cumulative curves  in  the  lower  panel are very close over the entire period.  As before,  we sought

13:294:24642:13:0:66:481:77:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:are obtained by trial-and-error methods from the cumulative curves in the lower panel.  
14:295:24731:0:21:66:548:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only  visual  fit  between  the  curves  and  did  not  exercise  any  formal  minimization.    Our  previous 
14:296:24841:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experience  shows  that  formal  statistical  approach  gives  practically  no  improvement  on  visual  fit. 
14:297:24951:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally,  the  Phillips  curve  for  Australia  has  a  structural  break  in  1994  and can  be  represented  by 
14:298:25065:20:21:66:291:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:two linear relationships before and after 1994: 
14:299:25112:21:21:66:69:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:300:25112:21:21:102:285:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:UE(t) = -0.47CPI(t) + 0.112; t<1995 
14:301:25147:21:20:102:548:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:UE(t) = -1.5CPI(t)  + 0.105;   t>1994                 (5) 
14:302:25198:20:13:66:69:564:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman: 
14:303:25198:13:21:102:549:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In any case, the existence of the canonical Phillips curve in Australia, even with a structural 
14:304:25294:21:20:66:549:530:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:break  is  good  news  for  our  concept.  The  pair  inflation/unemployment  must  demonstrate  a 
14:305:25393:20:20:66:446:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:piecewise linear relationship as a consequence of the generalized relationship.  
14:306:25473:20:20:66:69:490:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman: 
14:307:25473:20:21:84:431:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3. Unemployment as a linear function of the change in labor force  
14:308:25538:21:20:66:548:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:From  the  Phillips curve it is  only  one  step to  the dependence  of  unemployment  of  the  change  in 
14:309:25643:20:21:66:549:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor force. Actually, we replace the rate of inflation with the rate of labor force change in (5) and 
14:310:25746:21:21:66:548:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:then have to estimate new coefficients: it has been empirically revealed and statistically tested that 
14:311:25849:21:21:66:548:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the rate of unemployment in developed countries is a linear (and lagged) function of the change in 
14:312:25948:21:20:66:127:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor force.  
14:313:25961:20:21:102:548:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  expected, the  same  relationship  to  be  valid  for  Australia. The  estimation  method  is  as 
14:314:26062:21:21:66:549:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:before – the trail-and-error one. For the annual readings in Figure 6, we do not use the cumulative 
14:315:26161:21:20:66:548:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curve  approach  and  fit  only  peaks  and  troughs.  The  best-visual-fit  equations  for  the  period  before 
14:316:26274:20:21:66:214:284:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and after 1994 are as follows:  
14:317:26305:21:21:66:69:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:318:26305:21:20:102:304:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:UE(t) = -2.1dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.13, t<1995  
14:319:26345:20:21:102:548:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:UE(t) = -2.1dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.098, t>1994                 (6) 
14:320:26399:21:21:66:69:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:321:26399:21:21:66:548:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Because of high-amplitude oscillations in the original time series for the raet of labor force change, 
14:322:26502:21:20:66:549:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dLF/LF,  we have to smooth it by MA(3). The slope in (6) is negative. Therefore, any increase in 
14:323:26599:20:21:66:548:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  level  of  labor  force  is  reflected  in  a  proportional  and  simultaneous  fall  in  the  rate  of 
14:324:26708:21:21:66:549:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment.  This  is  a  fortunate  link – more  jobs  is  equivalent  to  less  unemployed.  However, 
14:325:26813:21:20:66:549:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:when  the  level  of  labor  force  does  not  change  with  time  the  rate  of  unemployment  is  very  high – 
14:326:26925:20:0:66:549:77:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:around 12%.  Hence, Australia has to keep a higher rate of labor force growth in order to retain the 
15:327:27028:0:21:66:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate of unemplyment at the current low level around 5%. Obviously, the jump from 4.5% in 2008 to 
15:328:27123:21:21:66:491:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5.6% in 2009 was induced by the fall in labor force observed since 2007 (see Figure 3).  
15:329:27211:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: It  is  worth  noting  that  (6)  implies  a  nonlinear  dependence  on  the  rate  of  particiaption  in 
15:330:27317:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor  force.  For  a  given  absolute  change  in  the  level  of  labor  force  in  Australia,  say  100,000  per 
15:331:27433:21:21:66:551:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:year,  the reaction  of  unemployment  with  be  different  for  the  rate  of  participation  60%  and  65%.  
15:332:27543:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The higher is the participation rate the lower is the change rate, dLF/LF, and thus the change in the 
15:333:27644:21:20:66:552:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate of unemployment.  Actually, the participation rate in Australia has been increasing from ~62%  
15:334:27744:20:21:66:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  the  1970s  and  1980s  to  65.5%  in  the  2000s. It  will  be  a difficult task  to  retain  the  rate  of 
15:335:27855:21:21:66:548:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment at the current low level – it is likely that the rate of participation is approaching the 
15:336:27957:21:313:66:325:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:peak level and will start to decline in the near future.

16:351:28805:13:0:66:218:78:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:between the cumulative curves.

17:355:28937:20:21:66:548:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Again, because of the change in monetary policy around 1995 we have to split the modeled period 
17:356:29030:21:21:66:548:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:into two segments: before and after 1994. The slope in the linear relationship is the same over the 
17:357:29130:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:entire period. This model is somewhat different from (6), which is based on annual readings. This 
17:358:29228:21:20:66:549:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is  likely associated  with  the  quick-and-dirty  approach  used  to  estimate  (6).  The  method  of 
17:359:29331:20:21:66:298:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cumulative curves gives much better estimates.  
17:360:29378:21:21:66:549:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Figure  3  illustrates  the  limits  of  accurate  quantitative  modeling.  Before  1980,  one  should 
17:361:29481:21:20:66:548:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not expect any accurate predictions.  In Figure 7, we seek for the best visual fit between cumulative 
17:362:29583:20:21:66:549:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curves  after  1985.  After  1995,  our  model  has  a  superior  predictive  power. As  a  compromise,  we 
17:363:29691:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:carried  out  several  statistical  tests  of  the  observed  and  predicted  time  series  as  well  as  the  model 
17:364:29808:21:21:66:417:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:residual for the period since January 1987. There are 288 readings used.

18:369:29959:0:21:102:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:At first, the residual model error shown in Figure 8 was tested for unit roots. The augmented 
18:370:30053:21:22:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Dickey-Fuller test  gave  z(t)=-7.56 with the 1% critical value of -3.46. The Phillips-Perron test for 
18:371:30156:22:21:66:549:666:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unit   roots   gave   z()=-104   and   z(t)=-7.88,   with   the   1%   critical   value   of -20.3   and -3.46, 
18:372:30269:21:21:66:549:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:respectively. Thus, one can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root in the residual time series. This 
18:373:30373:21:20:66:548:624:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confirms that the predicted time series is cointegrated with the observed one, as the Engle-Granger 
18:374:30470:20:21:66:549:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test  for  cointegration  requires.  The  Johansen  test  for  cointegration  applied  to  the  observed  and 
18:375:30580:21:21:66:549:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:predicted  time  series  gave  a  robust  rank  1. Because  the  cumulative  approach  provides  the  overall 
18:376:30690:21:20:66:549:562:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:detrending  of  the  model  residual  we  selected  trend  specification  “none”. Econometrically,  there 
18:377:30796:20:21:66:549:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exists  a  cointegrating  relation  between  the  rate  of  unemployment  and  the  change  in  labor  force  in 
18:378:30909:21:21:66:549:521:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Australia.  This  makes  the  result  of  linear  regression  of  the  monthly  reading  an  unbiased  one: 
18:379:31017:21:21:66:277:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:R2=0.81; for cumulative curves, R2=0.999.  
18:380:31059:21:20:102:548:479:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:All  in  all,  the  agreement  between  the  annual  and  cumulative  curves  is  excellent. We  have 
18:381:31161:20:21:66:546:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:smoothed  the  predicted  curve  by  a  twelve-month  moving  average  is  order  to  suppress  high-
18:382:31262:21:21:66:549:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amplitude   fluctuations   in   the   monthly   estimates of   dLF/LF. One   can   predict   the   rate   of 
18:383:31370:21:20:66:549:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unemployment  at  any  time  horizon  using  labor  force  projections.  We  have  failed  to  find  any 
18:384:31475:20:21:66:549:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:projection published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics except the one between 1999 and 2016. 
18:385:31573:21:21:66:549:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Unfortunately, this projection was all wrong and heavily underestimated the growth in labor force. 
18:386:31672:21:20:66:549:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It predicted the level of labor force in 2016 at 10,800,000.    In  December  2010, the level of labor 
18:387:31775:20:21:66:548:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:force  was  12,132,900.  This  is  good  news,  however.  According  to  (7),  a  higher  rate  of labor  force 
18:388:31886:21:21:66:303:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth results in a lower rate of unemployment.

18:392:32109:21:21:66:548:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:many countries. Here we are following the same estimation procedure as for unemployment above 
18:393:32203:21:20:66:549:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and other developed countries.  We start with the annual readings of GDP deflator, DGDP, reported 
18:394:32301:20:21:66:548:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by the OECD. According to the change in definition of labor force in 1986, which first affected the 
18:395:32400:21:21:66:549:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimates  for  1985,  we  have divided the  period  after  1978  (the start  of  reliable  measurements as 
18:396:32507:21:20:66:549:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reported  by  the  Australian  Bureaus  of  Statistics)  into  two  segments  and  obtained  the  following 
18:397:32615:20:21:66:155:135:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empirical models: 
18:398:32632:21:21:102:319:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:DGDP(t) = 4.2dLF(t)/LF(t) – 0.042  t>1984

19:404:32829:13:13:66:549:94:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:The break   in 1985 is explained   by the changes   in   definition the   labor   force   definition   and 
19:405:32932:13:0:66:259:81:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:corresponding measurement procedure.  
20:406:32971:0:21:102:548:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure 9 displays the  observed  DGDP  curve  and  that  predicted  according  to  (8).   Both, 
20:407:33065:21:21:66:548:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dynamic  and  cumulative  curves  are  in  agreement. For  the  period  between  1974  and  2009,  the 
20:408:33168:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:goodness of fit is very high: R2dyn=0.62 and R2cum= 0.996, respectively. If to consider that (8) does 
20:409:33269:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not use any autoregressive properties of inflation, which usually bring between 80% and 90% of the 
20:410:33368:21:21:66:549:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:explanatory  power  in  the  mainstream  models, this  link is  almost a deterministic one.  Later  in  this 
20:411:33474:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Section  we  show  that  the  Australian  times  series  of  inflation  and  the  change  in  labor  force  are 
20:412:33586:21:20:66:134:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cointegrated.  
20:413:33600:20:21:102:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure  10  illustrates  the  benefits  of  cumulative  approach.  The  absolute  and  relative  errors 
20:414:33704:21:21:66:549:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decrease  with  time. Despite  the  annual  levels  of price  and  labor  force  are  not  measured  more 
20:415:33810:21:20:66:549:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accurately  with  time  the overall change  in  the  level  is  measured better  and  better.  As   a 
20:416:33912:20:21:66:549:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consequence,  the  observed  and  predicted  cumulative  curves,  i.e.  the  overall  changes  in  price  and 
20:417:34022:21:21:66:548:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor  force,  do  converge.  They  become  indistinguishable,  i.e.  there  exists  a  deterministic  link 
20:418:34129:21:304:66:141:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between them.

20:421:34248:12:13:66:548:134:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:converge in relative terms and one can replace the price deflator with the growth in labor force with

21:424:34386:0:21:102:548:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The annual time series are relatively short with only 36 readings between 1974 and 2009, as 
21:425:34478:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shown  in  Figure  9.  It  is  well  known  that  small  samples  cannot  provide  robust  statistical  estimates 
21:426:34592:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and inferences. Fortunately, the OECD also reports quarterly estimates of inflation and labor force. 
21:427:34693:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As a rule, monthly and quarterly data are noisy because of measurement errors. For the Australian 
21:428:34791:21:21:66:549:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time  series  the  overall  measurement  accuracy  is  not poor  and  we  have  obtained  the  estimates  of 
21:429:34899:21:21:66:549:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coefficients  in  the  linear  link  between  the change  rate  of  the GDP  deflator, DGDP (annualized

21:435:35109:21:21:66:549:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Figure  11  presents  both the  quarterly and  cumulative  curves  of  observed  and  predicted 
21:436:35205:21:21:66:549:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation. The agreement between the cumulative curves is excellent, but both time series are noisy. 
21:437:35304:21:20:66:549:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Obviously,  the  quarterly  estimates  of  labor  force and  GDP  deflator,  in  Australia  and  other 
21:438:35406:20:21:66:549:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed countries,  are not accurate and the total change from quarter to quarter may be less than 
21:439:35507:21:21:66:549:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  measurement  uncertainty.    The  general  resemblance  is  good,  however.  Peaks and  troughs  are 
21:440:35611:21:20:66:310:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well described but their amplitudes oscillate fast.   
21:441:35663:20:21:102:549:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  cumulative  inflation,  i.e.  the  progressive  sum  of  the  (annualized)  quarterly  inflation 
21:442:35765:21:21:66:549:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:values, has reached the level of 5.5, with the highest quarterly value of 0.12. Hence, the quarterly 
21:443:35865:21:20:66:549:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  in  the  cumulative  value  is  less  than  0.5%.  The  largest  deviation  between  the  cumulative 
21:444:35974:20:21:66:549:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curves  is  observed  in  2010,  when  the  measured  DGDP  dropped  below  zero  line.  This  sharp 
21:445:36075:21:21:66:501:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deviation is based on preliminary estimates for 2010 and is subject to further revisions.      
21:446:36168:21:21:102:548:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:All  in  all,  the  current  deviation  does  not  change  the  final  result  of  statistical  tests  for 
21:447:36275:21:20:66:549:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cointegration. According to the first step in Engle-Granger test for cointegration, the residual error 
21:448:36378:20:21:66:548:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  linear  regression  should  not  have  unit  roots.    Figure  12  depicts  the  model  residual  as  obtained 
21:449:36493:21:21:66:549:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:using the method of cumulative curves (see Figure 11), which we consider as an equivalent of the 
21:450:36590:21:20:66:548:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regression residual error. For 122 readings between the second quarter of 1980 and the third quarter 
21:451:36690:20:21:66:549:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of 2010, the augmented Dickey-Fuller (DF) test gave z(t)=-4.40 with the 1% critical value of -3.50. 
21:452:36789:21:22:66:548:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  DF-GLS  test  rejects  (1%  critical  value)  the  null  of  a  unit  root  for  all  lags  from  1  to  12 
21:453:36902:22:21:66:549:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(quarters) except lag=4. The Phillips-Perron test for unit roots gave z()=-36.8 and z(t)=-4.54, with 
21:454:37004:21:0:66:330:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the 1% critical value of -19.87 and -3.50, respectively.

23:459:37193:0:21:102:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Therefore,  the  tests  for  unit  roots prove  that  the  predicted  time  series  is  cointegrated  with 
23:460:37299:21:21:66:549:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the observed one.  The Johansen test for cointegration checks the rank of the relation between the 
23:461:37398:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:involved  variables  and  thus  the  presence  of  cointegration  relations.  For  two  variables,  rank  one  is 
23:462:37512:20:21:66:549:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equivalent to the existence of one cointegrating relation between these variables.  When applied to 
23:463:37612:21:21:66:549:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  observed  and  predicted  quarterly  time  series  of  inflation  in  Australia  the  Johansen  test  gave  a 
23:464:37727:21:21:66:549:605:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:robust  rank  1  (trend  specification  “none”).  Econometrically,  there  exists  a  long  term  equilibrium 
23:465:37837:21:20:66:549:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relation between the rate of unemployment and the change in labor force in Australia with a break 
23:466:37935:20:21:66:549:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  1994.  This  makes  the  result  of  linear  regression  of  the  quarterly  readings  an  unbiased  one: 
23:467:38045:21:314:66:270:543:12:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:R2=0.48. For cumulative curves, R2=0.99.

23:471:38153:21:20:84:224:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5. The generalized model  
23:472:38177:20:21:66:548:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We have estimated several individual links between labor force, unemployment and inflation. Both 
23:473:38274:21:21:66:548:130:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relations  to  labor  force  are  cointegrated,  as  the  Engle-Granger  and  Johansen  tests have  shown.  In 
23:474:38384:21:20:66:548:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this situation, the generalized model is a straightforward one and somewhat obsolete. However, we 
23:475:38481:20:0:66:549:89:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have  estimated  this  model  as  well  for  methodological  purposes  and  for  the  completeness  of  our 
24:476:38591:0:21:66:548:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concept.  Because  of the  aforementioned breaks in  1995  and  the  break  in 1984 we  split  the  entire 
24:477:38696:21:21:66:247:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:modeling period into three segments: 
24:478:38732:21:14:66:69:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
24:479:38732:14:20:66:318:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CPI(t) = 3.9dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.88UE(t) - 0.1; t>1995 
24:480:38779:20:21:66:350:633:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CPI(t) = 3.9dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.97UE(t) - 0.1; 1984<t<1996 
24:481:38831:21:21:66:548:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CPI(t) = 8.3dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.97UE(t) - 0.1;  t<1985                   (10) 
24:482:38898:21:13:66:69:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
24:483:38898:13:21:102:549:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure 13 presents  the measured  and  predicted  CPI  inflation.  As  discussed  above,  the  CPI 
24:484:38996:21:21:66:548:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:does  not  represent  the  economy  as  a  whole,  and  thus,  the  CPI  evolution  may  be  not  a  one-to-one 
24:485:39108:21:21:66:548:536:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reaction  to  the  change  in  labor  force.     Figure  1  explains  the  difference - the  CPI  curve  is  more 
24:486:39221:21:20:66:549:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:volatile and deviates from the DGDP one in many places. Having a good prediction of the GDPD, 
24:487:39315:20:21:66:548:495:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one should not expect the same accuracy of prediction with the CPI time series. This fact is clearly 
24:488:39415:21:21:66:548:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:illustrated in  Figure  13,  where  the  predicted  time  series  heavily  deviates  from  the  observed  CPI 
24:489:39524:21:20:66:548:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  through  the  entire  period. At  the  same  time  the  rate  of  CPI  inflation  is  a  one-to-one 
24:490:39634:20:21:66:548:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:function of the change in labor force and unemployment. Both coefficients are positive in (10), but 
24:491:39734:21:21:66:520:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we have already found that these variables evolve in opposite directions, as described by (6).

24:493:39829:21:20:102:162:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Conclusion 
24:494:39839:20:21:66:549:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  rate  of  price  inflation and  unemployment in  Australia  is  a  one-off  function  of  the  change  in 
24:495:39950:21:21:66:549:329:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labor force. This conclusion validates earlier models for many developed countries: the US, Japan, 
24:496:40049:21:20:66:548:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Germany,  France,  Italy,  Canada,  the  Netherlands,  Sweden,  Austria,  and  Switzerland. Australia  is 
24:497:40154:20:21:66:549:288:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one  of  few  countries  we  did  not  study  so  far.  The  excellence  of  the  obtained  statistical  and 
24:498:40263:21:21:66:332:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conceptual results compensates the delay in analysis.    
24:499:40319:21:21:66:549:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Overall, we have established that there exist long term equilibrium relations the rate of labor 
24:500:40415:21:20:66:549:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:force  change  and  the  rate  of  inflation/unemployment.  The  level of  statistical  significance  of  these 
24:501:40527:20:21:66:549:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cointegrating  relations  allows  us  to  consider  these  links  as  deterministic  ones,  as  adopted  in 
24:502:40635:21:21:66:549:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:physics.    Unlike  the  mainstream  models,  no  relation  uses  autoregressive  properties  of  any 
24:503:40737:21:20:66:549:163:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:macroeconomic  variable  under  consideration.  This  does  not  make  the  rate  of  unemployment  and 
24:504:40841:20:21:66:549:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  non-stochastic  time  series.  The  change  in  labor  force  includes  a  strong  demographics 
24:505:40948:21:21:66:549:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:component  and  thus  is  stochastic  to  the  extent  the  evolution  of  population  in  a  given  country  is 
24:506:41061:21:20:66:548:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stochastic.  Since  the  level  of  labor  force  is  a  measurable  value  one  does  not  need  to  estimate  its 
24:507:41177:20:0:66:469:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stochastic properties – they are obtained automatically with routine measurements.

25:528:41498:12:13:66:548:101:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:the change rate of labor force leveling Australia.  The CPI inflation is modeled using the change rate

26:531:41736:0:21:102:549:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Unintentional  but  helpful  outcome  from  the  above  modeling  is  the  existence  of  the

26:533:41942:21:20:66:549:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation/unemployment  must  demonstrate  a  piecewise  linear  relationship  as  a  consequence  of  the
