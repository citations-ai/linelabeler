2:33:1880:33:24:72:540:563:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:School finance schemes control the allocation of $370 billion a year in the United States, but their
2:34:1980:24:24:72:540:539:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:economics  are  poorly  understood.  We  examine  an  illuminating  example:  Texas'  "Robin  Hood"
2:35:2079:24:24:72:540:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:scheme, which was enacted in 1994, allocates about $30 billion a year, and is currently collapsing
2:36:2177:24:24:72:540:491:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and likely to be abandoned. We show that the collapse was predictable. Robin Hood's design causes
2:37:2274:24:24:72:540:467:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substantial negative capitalization, shrinking its own tax base. It relies only slightly on relatively
2:38:2376:24:24:72:540:443:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:efficient (pseudo lump sum) redistibution and heavily on high marginal tax rates. Although Robin
2:39:2472:24:24:72:540:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Hood reduced the spending gap between Texas' property-poor and property-rich districts by $500
2:40:2566:24:24:72:540:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:per pupil, it destroyed about $27,000 per pupil in property wealth. The magnitude of this loss is
2:41:2663:24:24:72:539:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:important: if the state had efficiently confiscated the same wealth and invested it, it would generate
2:42:2765:24:24:72:539:347:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sufficient annual income to make all Texas schools spend at a high level. The Robin Hood scheme
2:43:2860:24:24:72:540:323:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is  stringent  but  not  bizarre:  other  states'  systems  share  its  features  to  some  degree.  We  provide
2:44:2972:24:24:72:540:299:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimates of the effects of school finance system parameters, which policy makers could use to
2:45:3066:24:32:72:308:275:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:design systems that are more efficient and stable.

3:57:3312:0:25:269:342:685:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I.  Introduction
3:58:3328:25:26:108:539:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:School finance is one of the most important public policies in the United States.  It can determine
3:59:3427:26:26:72:498:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:whether cities or suburbs grow; it can create or destroy investment in education.  School finance
3:60:3524:26:26:72:524:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:programs govern the allocation of approximately 370 billion dollars a year in the United States and 30
3:61:3626:26:26:72:535:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:billion dollars a year in Texas alone.  Despite their importance, these programs are poorly understood by
3:62:3731:26:26:72:538:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economists.  Every good public economist knows the income tax code and how social security works, but
3:63:3832:26:26:72:511:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:he probably knows little about school finance.  Even more worrisome is the fact that the creators of
3:64:3932:26:26:72:531:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school finance formulas often lack economic expertise.  They rarely foresee capitalization (the response
3:65:4036:26:26:72:520:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of property prices to the burdens and rewards created by the formula).  Indeed, they sometimes set up
3:66:4137:26:26:72:537:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:systems that maximize property wealth destruction, given the tax revenue collected and the redistribution
3:67:4242:26:26:72:518:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:achieved.  Often, they do not foresee that school districts may respond to perverse incentives that the
3:68:4345:26:26:72:532:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formula creates.  For instance, a formula might create incentives for districts to maximize the number of
3:69:4450:26:26:72:245:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:children who are classified as disabled.
3:70:4490:26:25:108:518:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we show how a school finance program derailed itself.  We examine Texas' so-
3:71:4581:25:26:72:530:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:called "Robin Hood" formula, first implemented in 1993-94.  Robin Hood is not odd:  most other states'
3:72:4683:26:26:72:524:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:systems share its features to some degree.  We focus on Robin Hood because it strongly exhibits all of
3:73:4785:26:26:72:536:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the problems listed above.  In less than a decade, the system is approaching collapse:  it has exhausted its
3:74:4893:26:26:72:536:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:own capacity.  We show that the collapse was predictable:   Robin Hood's design maximizes the negative
3:75:4995:26:26:72:529:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization it causes, shrinking its own tax base.  It relies only slightly on relatively efficient (pseudo
3:76:5105:26:26:72:353:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lump sum) redistibution and heavily on high marginal tax rates.
3:77:5168:26:26:108:529:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We wish to state at the outset that we believe that school finance is an important and legitimate
3:78:5265:26:26:72:537:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problem for state governments.  However, it is essentially a tax problem and, like other tax problems, can
3:79:5371:26:26:72:522:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be solved more or less well.  The scale of the mistakes can be massive, simply because school finance
3:80:5472:26:0:72:534:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:operates on a massive scale.  We estimate that the Robin Hood plan destroyed about 81 billion dollars of
4:81:5577:0:12:111:111:204:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Results from Hoxby (2001) can used to compare different school finance systems.  She estimates effects1
4:82:5682:12:24:72:201:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:using all 50 states over 30 years.
4:83:5716:24:12:111:110:168:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Some districts also get revenue from fees and local sales taxes, but local property taxes account for over2
4:84:5825:12:11:72:521:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:95 percent of districts' revenue.  Property tax systems are often slightly progressive because they exempt the first
4:85:5941:11:12:72:524:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:$10,000 to $25,000 of a house's value (a "homestead exemption") and allow exemptions for the elderly, disabled,
4:86:6052:12:24:72:150:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:veterans, and so on.
4:87:6072:24:12:111:111:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In addition, districts may receive some federal aid, but it is too small (only 7 percent of public school3
4:88:6180:12:11:72:523:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:spending) and too simply categorical (grants for the disabled, limited English proficient, and so on) to concern us
4:89:6295:11:12:72:527:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:here.  The major goals of school finance can be achieved only through state school finance, given the allocation of
4:90:6410:12:0:72:313:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:responsibility for schools in the American federalist system. 
4:91:6472:0:25:72:535:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property wealth in Texas ($27,000 of property wealth per pupil).  To get a sense of the magnitude of this
4:92:6577:25:26:72:529:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number, suppose that the state had somehow confiscated this wealth, instead of destroying it.  The state
4:93:6681:26:26:72:524:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would have been able to endow a permanent fund that would generate sufficient annual income (about
4:94:6779:26:26:72:519:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$1,350 per pupil) to let every one of its districts spend what the top 5 percent of its districts currently
4:95:6886:26:26:72:100:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spend.
4:96:6892:26:26:108:538:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our goal is not to criticize all efforts to provide equal educational opportunities, but to use Robin
4:97:6993:26:26:72:541:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hood to illustrate some problems of school finance and estimate the effects of school finance parameters. 
4:98:7099:26:26:72:482:504:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:We do not attempt to be prescriptive, but we do refer to more efficient systems than Texas' .   Good1
4:99:7200:26:26:72:500:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intentions about redistribution are not enough in school finance:  understanding the economics is
4:100:7297:26:52:72:134:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:important too.
4:101:7311:52:26:192:419:400:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:II.  A Brief Primer on American School Finance
4:102:7357:26:26:108:515:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the United States, education is primarily the responsibility of state governments and local
4:103:7451:26:25:72:533:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school districts.  Districts are the entities that spend money on schools.  Their main way to raise revenue
4:104:7558:25:26:72:365:323:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:by themselves is a proportional tax on the value of local property.  Districts also spend revenue that they2
4:105:7666:26:26:72:212:297:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:receive from their states as aid.  Aid may be negative –that is, a tax on districts' revenues from local3
4:106:7771:26:26:72:513:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property taxes.  Roughly speaking, the goal of school finance is to allocate state aid so that districts'
4:107:7876:26:0:72:538:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:choice of the appropriate level of school spending is (up to a point) independent of the permanent income
5:108:7982:0:12:111:110:251:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In other words, the well-off may provide luxuries for their children in school and out of school, and if the4
5:109:8093:12:12:72:525:239:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:distribution of consumption needs to be altered, school finance is not the appropriate mechanism to do it.  Income
5:110:8207:12:12:72:515:227:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:redistribution can most efficiently be done through the income tax and transfer systems, not through state aid to
5:111:8320:12:23:72:134:215:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:school districts.
5:112:8337:23:12:111:111:192:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  The essence of Tiebout's insight is that local property taxes are user fees when people are mobile enough5
5:113:8445:12:12:72:538:180:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:for property prices in a jurisdiction to reflect their assessment of the net value of local public goods (such as schools)
5:114:8567:12:12:72:518:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:and local property taxes.  Property has two special features as a tax base.  It is inherently attached to a particular
5:115:8685:12:12:72:519:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction so it regulates use of the local public good (schools).  Its value depends on the assessment of current
5:116:8801:12:11:72:532:144:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:property buyers and sellers, so that the entire tax base reflects current circumstances even though only a minority of
5:117:8919:11:12:72:523:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:people are mobile at any time.  This last feature makes it a semi-automatic mechanism for setting the user fee and
5:118:9033:12:12:72:516:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:regulating the productivity of local good producers.  A school district that sets property taxes too high given the
5:119:9148:12:12:72:534:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:actual services it is providing will drive down property prices in the district.  Property taxes will fall in an automatic
5:120:9270:12:11:72:513:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:manner until they reach the appropriate user fee.  Along the way, district leaders have an incentive to eliminate
5:121:9383:11:12:72:506:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:unproductive programs that were providing too little service for the money spent.  A reverse story holds for a
5:122:9493:12:0:72:534:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:program that is unusually productive. See Hoxby (1996) for a formal model and references to the Tiebout literature.
5:123:9608:0:25:72:532:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the district's own residents and depends only on students' returns to human capital investment and the
5:124:9713:25:26:72:537:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:permanent income of the state's residents.  We say "up to a point" because the goals of school finance are
5:125:9819:26:26:72:514:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:articulated in state supreme court opinions, and these opinions nearly always recognize a distinction
5:126:9920:26:26:72:494:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between school spending that represents human capital investment and spending that represents
5:127:10013:26:26:72:430:582:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:consumption.  School finance need only concern itself  with the investment part.  An efficient system of4
5:128:10118:26:26:72:493:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school finance creates minimum deadweight loss, given the progress its makes toward the goal.
5:129:10211:26:26:108:534:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:People sometimes wonder why school finance is not simply conducted at the state level, with no
5:130:10305:26:26:72:525:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:role for local districts or local property taxes.  Many experts in local public finance think that property
5:131:10412:26:26:72:512:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:taxation is uniquely efficient for funding local spending.  When used for spending on local schools,
5:132:10511:26:26:72:520:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property taxes arguably have attributes that make them approximate user fees, which impose minimal
5:133:10609:26:26:72:284:426:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:deadweight loss and improve local governance.  (The good attributes of property taxes do not apply5
5:134:10708:26:26:72:530:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when they are used to fund a state-level public good, such as investing in the education of poor children
5:135:10813:26:26:72:500:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in non-local districts.)  Thus, it is probably efficient for a system of school finance to start with a
5:136:10916:26:25:72:529:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fundament of local property taxation and layer state aid on top of it.  Nearly every American state has a
5:137:11021:25:26:72:508:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system with this two-part character.  In any case, the funding and allocation of state aid are the key
5:138:11123:26:223:72:427:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sources of difference between more and less efficient systems of school finance.
6:139:11204:223:0:111:110:74:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:   For our analogy, shareholders do benefit from capital gains and firms can repurchase shares.6
6:140:11300:0:25:253:358:685:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:III.  A Useful Analogy
6:141:11322:25:26:108:531:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Before describing a detailed system of school finance, it may be useful to illustrate the issues in
6:142:11421:26:26:72:523:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the more familiar world of firms.  Because we are going to draw an analogy between firms and school
6:143:11520:26:26:72:296:608:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:districts, suppose that firms cannot pay dividends.6
6:144:11572:26:26:108:503:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Suppose that government wanted to redistribute income among firms for some reason.  A
6:145:11657:26:26:72:533:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:straightforward scheme might take income from firms with high return on capital and transfer it to firms
6:146:11761:26:26:72:517:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with low return on capital.  This system of redistribution would naturally generate some dead weight
6:147:11861:26:26:72:534:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loss, as firms were discouraged from engaging in business activities that generated returns.  However, in
6:148:11966:26:26:72:340:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:its essential character, this tax be like other taxes on income.
6:149:12030:26:26:108:533:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Instead of the tax scheme just described, the government might implement a peculiar scheme:  it
6:150:12125:26:26:72:526:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could take income from firms with high market capitalization per unit of book capital and transfer it to
6:151:12229:26:26:72:522:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:firms with low market capitalization per unit of book capital.  What would this scheme do?  First, like
6:152:12332:26:26:72:531:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:redistribution based on return to capital, the scheme would discourage business activities that generated
6:153:12437:26:25:72:280:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:returns and generate the usual deadweight loss.
6:154:12484:25:26:108:520:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The effects would not stop there, however.  The present value of a firm's expected tax burden
6:155:12577:26:26:72:534:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would be capitalized into its share price, so that firms with initially high market capitalization would see
6:156:12685:26:26:72:526:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their share prices and market capitalization fall.  Thus, if the government initially picked a tax rate that
6:157:12793:26:26:72:536:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would raise the desired revenue given the initial distribution of firms' market capitalization, it would find
6:158:12902:26:26:72:497:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:itself unable to raise that revenue with that tax rate because the tax base would shrink not just as
6:159:13002:26:26:72:531:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:businesses cut back on real activity but in order to capitalize the tax burden itself.  (This is an important
6:160:13111:26:26:72:522:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point:  the change in the tax based due to decreased real activity would be small relative to the change
6:161:13215:26:26:72:515:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:produced by capitalization.)  The government might raise the tax rate in hopes of getting the level of
6:162:13317:26:0:72:530:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue it initially desired.  But, this would merely set off another round of share price changes, as new
7:163:13424:0:12:111:111:133:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Of course, if a government understood all of the mechanisms described in this paper and knew all of the7
7:164:13530:12:12:72:527:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:relevant elasticities, it could determine whether there was a suitable fixed point:  a tax rate at which the desired tax
7:165:13650:12:12:72:526:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:revenue was generated, given the capitalization that the tax rate would cause.  The government could then jump to
7:166:13763:12:11:72:534:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the fixed point.  In school finance, this hypothetical situation seems merely to be a pleasing possibility, and not only
7:167:13883:11:12:72:517:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:because governments tend not to foresee capitalization.  The Texas data show no sign that a fixed point is being
7:168:13995:12:0:72:126:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:approached.  
7:169:14008:0:25:72:205:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expectations were capitalized.
7:170:14038:25:26:108:539:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:At first glance, one might suppose that the negative capitalization among the initially high market
7:171:14137:26:26:72:539:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization firms would be fully offset by an equal amount of positive capitalization among low market
7:172:14242:26:26:72:539:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization firms.  But, this is very unlikely because the cash would be less valuable in the hands of the
7:173:14351:26:26:72:499:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recipient firms than it was in the hands of the donor firms.  If the cash were equally valuable, the
7:174:14451:26:26:72:526:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recipient firms would have had it from shareholders in the first place.  In short, a redistribution scheme
7:175:14557:26:26:72:534:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:based on market capitalization is unlikely to generate a stable stream of revenue and is likely to generate
7:176:14664:26:26:72:229:504:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:a series of increases in the tax rate.7
7:177:14703:26:26:108:528:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A third consequence of the peculiar scheme would be firms' altering their accounting and other
7:178:14797:26:26:72:521:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:practices to maximize the value of book capital relative to true productive capital.  The higher a firm's
7:179:14902:26:26:72:205:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:book capital, the lower its tax.
7:180:14934:26:26:108:538:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Suppose that the peculiar scheme has a refinement:  the government puts the entire tax burden on
7:181:15030:26:26:72:539:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market-capitalization-per-dollar-of-book-capital above some threshold.  This refinement would give some
7:182:15133:26:25:72:530:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:firms negligible incentive to be productive with their marginal investments since these returns would be
7:183:15237:25:26:72:525:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disproportionately taxed away.  Essentially, the refinement raises marginal tax rates, given the average
7:184:15341:26:26:72:250:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax rate, thereby heightening distortions.
7:185:15383:26:26:108:530:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In summary, the government's peculiar redistribution scheme would not only generate the usual
7:186:15476:26:26:72:536:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deadweight loss associated with discouraging income-producing business activity, it would also likely be
7:187:15580:26:26:72:512:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(i) an unstable scheme with rising tax rates, (ii) a scheme that generated rising ratios of book to true
7:188:15684:26:72:72:486:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:productive capital, and (iii) a scheme with high marginal tax rates, given its average tax rates.
8:189:15782:72:12:111:110:121:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:   More accurately, the relationship between weighted students and true student educational needs is8
8:190:15883:12:23:72:385:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:analogous to the relationship between book capital and true productive capital.
8:191:15962:23:12:111:111:86:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:   In some states, however, dramatic changes in school finance are made purely through legislature effort,9
8:192:16069:12:0:72:231:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:with no court rulings (see Hoxby 2001).
8:193:16108:0:25:230:381:685:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:IV.  Understanding Robin Hood
8:194:16137:25:26:108:529:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The scheme just described sounds so problematic as to be unlikely.  Yet, such schemes account
8:195:16230:26:26:72:500:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for much of the $370 billion that is redistributed among school districts each year.  The "peculiar
8:196:16329:26:26:72:521:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scheme" is a strict analogy of Texas' Robin Hood scheme.  Most school finance systems in the United
8:197:16428:26:26:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:States (including Robin Hood) do the equivalent of redistributing on the basis of market capitalization.  A
8:198:16535:26:26:72:528:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:good many school finance systems, including Robin Hood, do the equivalent of redistributing based on
8:199:16635:26:26:72:496:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:book values that can be manipulated.  Several schemes, including Robin Hood, use systems that
8:200:16728:26:26:72:330:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maximize marginal tax rates, given their average tax rates.
8:201:16787:26:26:108:538:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In reading the description of Robin Hood below, keep the following parallels in mind. A districts'
8:202:16885:26:26:72:530:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax base is analogous to a firm's market capitalization.  The relationship between weighted and
8:203:16989:26:26:72:501:426:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:actual students is analogous to the relationship between book capital and true productive capital.8
8:204:17088:26:26:72:210:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A.  The Origins of Robin Hood
8:205:17117:26:26:108:507:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Texas' Robin Hood formula came about in a fairly typical way.  A 1984, a group of school
8:206:17205:26:25:72:538:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts sued the state, charging that the then-current system of school finance was unconstitutional.  The
8:207:17313:25:26:72:531:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Supreme Court of Texas found the system to be unconstitutional in 1989, and the Texas legislature then
8:208:17415:26:26:72:532:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:proceeded to enact new systems of school finance.  The first two systems took effect in the 1990-91 and
8:209:17518:26:26:72:521:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1992-93 school years, respectively, and were also found to be unconstitutional.  The third system was
8:210:17619:26:26:72:529:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood.  It was implemented in the 1993-1994 school year and found constitutional in 1994.  Such
8:211:17719:26:26:72:347:219:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:back and forth between courts and legislatures is not unusual.9
8:212:17782:26:26:108:501:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood's structure is fairly common.  Texas' school finance system is based on local
8:213:17870:26:22:72:494:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property taxes, on top of which are layered three "tiers" of state aid:  a foundation aid system, a
9:214:17970:22:24:114:113:145:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:   We are scrupulous about this distinction.  If we use the word "pupil," we refer to an actual pupil.10
9:215:18074:24:24:114:113:121:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:   In Texas, the recapture system is formally known as the Chapter 41system.11
9:216:18152:24:11:114:113:97:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Typically, the supply of property is assumed to have some elasticity even though jurisdictions'12
9:217:18251:11:12:72:531:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:boundaries do not change.  The idea is that there is usually some property that is undeveloped or in a low-value use
9:218:18367:12:0:72:275:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:that can be developed as, say, residential property. 
9:219:18420:0:25:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:guaranteed revenue system, and a recapture system.  All three tiers are based on a district's property value
9:220:18528:25:26:72:516:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per "weighted pupil."  A weighted pupil is not an actual pupil.  Students' disabilities, limited English
9:221:18632:26:26:72:533:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:proficiency, need for compensatory education, and other conditions are converted into weights, so that a
9:222:18736:26:26:72:523:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:student may count as multiple students.  Hereafter, we use the word "pupil" to refer to an actual pupil,
9:223:18840:26:26:72:529:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and we use the abbreviation WADA (weighted pupil in average daily attendance) to refer to a weighted
9:224:18940:26:26:72:104:556:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:pupil.  A district with a high property value per WADA is commonly described as "property-rich;" a10
9:225:19040:26:26:72:353:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district with low property value per WADA is "property-poor." 
9:226:19102:26:26:72:187:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B.  The Recapture System
9:227:19126:26:26:108:431:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:In describing Texas' system, it is best to start with the recapture system.  Under this system, a11
9:228:19225:26:26:72:527:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district's property tax base per weighted pupil is divided into two pieces:  that below and that above the
9:229:19331:26:26:72:520:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recapture threshold.  The threshold was initially set at $280,000 per WADA in 1994.  When a district
9:230:19431:26:26:72:525:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enacts a property tax rate, the taxes paid on the below-threshold part go into the district's own coffers. 
9:231:19538:26:26:72:515:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The taxes paid on the above-threshold part go into the state's coffers and are then used to fund aid to
9:232:19641:26:25:72:528:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:other districts.  The state has "captured" the property tax base above the threshold, although the district
9:233:19748:25:26:72:409:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:continues to be able to set the property tax rate (up to limit, as we shall see).
9:234:19829:26:26:108:527:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 illustrates the budget constraint and spending choice for a property-rich district that is
9:235:19928:26:26:72:509:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:operating under purely local school finance.  It is a standard figure (created by Epple, Filimon, and
9:236:20029:26:26:72:523:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Romer, 1984), displayed simply to acquaint the reader with its elements.  On the horizontal axis in the
9:237:20132:26:26:72:529:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:right-hand quadrant is school spending per pupil (g).  On the horizontal axis in the left-hand quadrant is
9:238:20237:26:0:72:286:193:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:units of fully-taxed property in the district (H).  On the vertical axis is the price per unit of property12
10:239:20345:0:25:72:523:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:() and the gross-of-tax cost of a unit of property ().  The difference between  and  is
10:240:20431:25:26:72:499:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the tax paid per unit of property  –put another way, it is a measure of the loss in non-housing
10:241:20524:26:26:72:529:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption that a person experiences when he pays property taxes.  For the purposes of the graph, the
10:242:20626:26:28:72:533:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax rate  is defined in such a way that it generates per pupil revenue from tax payments.  Note
10:243:20730:28:26:72:511:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that the property tax rate can be deduced from the figure by examining the ratio of the length of the
10:244:20831:26:26:72:523:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:segment labeled "tax per unit of housing" to the length of the segment from the origin to .  The line
10:245:20932:26:26:72:417:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labeled is the district's per-pupil budget constraint, given by the equation:
10:246:21009:26:26:367:370:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:.
10:247:21010:26:26:72:502:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The slope of the budget constraint is the marginal tax price of a dollar of per-pupil spending.  For
10:248:21110:26:28:72:520:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:graphical exposition, we treat the amount of property consumed under pure local finance () as one
10:249:21207:28:26:72:533:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unit.  This makes the budget constraint have a 45 degree slope under local finance, which should help to
10:250:21311:26:26:72:539:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:remind us that the marginal tax price of a dollar of per-pupil spending is one under local finance.  Finally,
10:251:21420:26:26:72:511:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:note that the scales used in the figure are not realistic:  they are designed to allow readers to see the
10:252:21525:26:26:72:188:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:differences among curves.
10:253:21550:26:25:108:538:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 illustrates an initial equilibrium.  The indifference curve of the deterministic voter in the
10:254:21652:25:26:72:523:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district is tangent to the budget constraint at a point such that the district spends  per pupil and each
10:255:21757:26:26:72:504:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household pay taxes of  per unit of housing it consumes.  The price of a unit of property, ,
10:256:21849:26:26:72:534:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generates a supply of housing equal to ; and the gross-of-tax cost of a unit of property, , generates a
10:257:21952:26:26:72:218:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demand for housing equal to .
10:258:21981:26:26:108:538:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 2 shows what the state projects the property-rich district will do after the recapture system
10:259:22081:26:26:72:501:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is enacted.  State projections assume that property-rich districts do not cut their local spending in
10:260:22182:26:26:72:535:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:response to increases in the marginal tax price, do not cut their consumption of housing in response to an
10:261:22288:26:26:72:536:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in its gross-of-tax cost; and do not see the tax burden capitalized into their property prices.  That
10:262:22398:26:0:72:530:85:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is, the state projects that property-rich districts will simply raise their tax rate to keep their spending the
11:263:22510:0:25:72:533:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:same in the face of recapture and that nothing else will change.  In Figure 2, this "hoped-for" response is
11:264:22617:25:26:72:516:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shown by the budget constraint labeled "" and labeled, hoped-for tax payments to the local
11:265:22707:26:26:72:533:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district and state.  Of course, what the state projects is not an equilibrium.  The indifference curve of the
11:266:22816:26:26:72:529:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deterministic voter is not tangent to  at the initial level of school spending, , and the supply
11:267:22911:26:26:72:539:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of housing in the district outstrips the demand, which has fallen because of the higher gross-of-tax cost of
11:268:23019:26:26:72:532:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:housing in the district.  Observe that the slope of  will be steeper the higher is the marginal tax
11:269:23118:26:26:72:529:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:price or, equivalently, the larger is the share of property tax wealth that is confiscated.  This is because,
11:270:23227:26:26:72:532:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with recapture, the district pays a dollar of property taxes, but only get to spend a fraction of that dollar,
11:271:23337:26:26:72:525:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:so its marginal tax price is ratio of the district's property wealth per pupil (v) to the recapture threshold
11:272:23446:26:26:72:521:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per pupil (l).  Finally, note that  turns vertical at some point:  this is caused by a limit on the
11:273:23545:26:26:72:536:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax rate that was imposed in coordination with the recapture scheme.  We will have more to say
11:274:23648:26:26:72:162:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about the limit later.
11:275:23670:26:26:108:537:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 2 has already shown that property prices must fall in the property-rich district: its existing
11:276:23771:26:25:72:524:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:residents want to consume less property than is supplied at current prices.  This response is akin to the
11:277:23876:25:26:72:529:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:usual response of consumption when it is taxed.  But, property prices will also capitalize the tax burden
11:278:23981:26:26:72:518:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because of the new equilibrium among districts.  That is, people will be deterred from residing in the
11:279:24083:26:26:72:509:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-rich district at all, and property prices will fall commensurately.  Figure 3 shows how this
11:280:24184:26:26:72:111:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:happens.
11:281:24192:26:26:108:521:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 3 shows the pre-recapture and hoped-for tax and spending choices of the property-rich
11:282:24284:26:26:72:502:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district.  It also shows the choices of an intermediate district that is insufficiently property-rich to
11:283:24388:26:26:72:512:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:experience recapture but is also insufficiently property-poor to get state aid.  An initial inter-district
11:284:24494:26:26:72:532:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equilibrium is defined by the existence of an equilibrium within each district (as shown in Figure 1) and
11:285:24599:26:26:72:514:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:"boundary" individuals like the one whose indifference curve is illustrated in Figure 3.  Initially, the
11:286:24703:26:0:72:496:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:boundary individual is just indifferent between living in the property-rich district, where he will
12:287:24804:0:25:72:495:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:experience more school spending and pay more tax than he would most prefer, and living in the
12:288:24897:25:26:72:521:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intermediate district, where he will experience lower school spending than pay less tax than he would
12:289:24998:26:26:72:531:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:most prefer.  After the recapture scheme is enacted, the boundary individual is no longer indifferent:  he
12:290:25104:26:26:72:528:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:strictly prefers the intermediate district.  Indeed, the figure is drawn in such a way that the intermediate
12:291:25212:26:26:72:508:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district is strictly preferred by all of the residents of the property-rich district who preferred school
12:292:25317:26:26:72:507:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending less than its former deterministic voter.  (To see that the initial deterministic voter would
12:293:25419:26:26:72:519:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:become the new boundary individual if the hoped-for budget constraint prevailed in the property-rich
12:294:25519:26:28:72:525:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district, mentally extend his top indifference curve –which is tangent to – and see that it runs
12:295:25614:28:26:72:305:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:right through the choice of the intermediate district.)
12:296:25669:26:26:108:518:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The point of Figure 3 is that property prices fall in the property-rich district, not just because
12:297:25767:26:26:72:533:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property consumption is taxed but also because of capitalization.  The result is that the hoped-for budget
12:298:25873:26:26:72:534:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constraint and choices do not prevail.  Instead, there is a new equilibrium like that shown in Figure 4.  In
12:299:25981:26:26:72:518:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 4, the property-rich district has lower property prices, which have re-equilibriated the housing
12:300:26084:26:26:72:529:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market and limited the outflow of residents to the intermediate district.  With lower property prices, the
12:301:26190:26:26:72:513:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district has less property tax revenue confiscated, faces a lower marginal tax price, and has a budget
12:302:26292:26:26:72:538:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constraint with a lower intercept and slope ().  At the new equilibrium, the district is spending a little
12:303:26398:26:26:72:535:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less per-pupil than it did at the initial equilibrium, owing to standard income and substitution effects of a
12:304:26507:26:26:72:531:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rise in the price of school spending.  The dramatic difference is, however, between what the state hoped
12:305:26611:26:25:72:529:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to collect in tax payments and what it does collect (see labeled lengths in figure).  The reason that these
12:306:26718:25:26:72:501:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:amounts are so different is that, under a recapture system, the property wealth that is lost through
12:307:26818:26:26:72:535:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization affects only the part of district's property tax base that now effectively belongs to the state.
12:308:26929:26:26:108:522:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Going forward, keep in mind the shortfall between the state's hoped-for revenue and its actual
12:309:27023:26:26:72:244:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue from the property-rich district.
12:310:27063:26:0:72:212:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C.  The Foundation Aid System
13:311:27094:0:12:114:114:145:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  The foundation system is called "Tier 1" in Texas.  Property tax rates are usually expressed in mils or13
13:312:27201:12:12:72:536:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:thousandths.  Thus, a 10 mil rate is a 1 percent tax on property.  In Texas, property tax rates are usually expressed as
13:313:27321:12:12:72:533:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:cents per hundred dollars of property value (8.6 mils equals 86 cents per hundred).  To make the Texas system easy
13:314:27435:12:23:72:398:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:to compare with those of other states, we express everything in mils in this paper. 
13:315:27519:23:12:114:113:86:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Districts do not actually send checks to the state and then receive checks in return.  The state computes14
13:316:27628:12:0:72:308:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the district's net receipt and only that amount is transferred.
13:317:27691:0:25:108:495:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Foundation aid systems are easiest to understand them if we think of the state as having
13:318:27779:25:26:72:532:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:converted some local property taxes into a state property tax, which it collects and uses to make a lump-
13:319:27884:26:26:72:525:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sum grant to each district.  The part of the local property tax rate that is converted into a state property
13:320:27992:26:26:72:519:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax is known as the foundation tax rate.  For instance, in Texas, the foundation tax rate is the first 8.6
13:321:28098:26:26:72:251:582:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:mils of each district's property tax rate.  In return for paying 8.6 mils to the state, each district receives a13
13:322:28212:26:26:72:329:556:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:lump sum grant per WADA, called the foundation grant.  A foundation aid system can redistribute a14
13:323:28311:26:26:72:538:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:good deal of revenue because districts that are property-poor on a weighted pupil basis will contribute far
13:324:28418:26:26:72:523:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less than they get in grants.  In many states, the foundation aid tax rate is set so that the system is self-
13:325:28527:26:26:72:501:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supporting:  the property-rich districts' payments fund all of the aid to the property-poor districts.
13:326:28629:26:26:108:529:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Texas, the foundation aid system is not self-supporting because the property-rich districts do
13:327:28726:26:26:72:501:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not participate in it.  Districts that would be net contributors to the foundation system are already
13:328:28827:26:26:72:528:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contributing much of their property tax revenue through the recapture system.  In other words, the state
13:329:28931:26:26:72:514:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cannot take 8.6 mils of their property tax revenue because it has already captured 100 percent of the
13:330:29032:26:25:72:535:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax revenue associated with the base that makes property-rich districts rich.  The recapture from
13:331:29138:25:26:72:513:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a property-rich district is, in practice, larger than the amount it would have contributed under a self-
13:332:29242:26:26:72:222:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supporting foundation aid system.
13:333:29275:26:26:108:518:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We shall see below that a self-supporting foundation aid system would be substantially more
13:334:29366:26:26:72:516:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:efficient than Texas' peculiar combination of a recapture system and foundation aid system in which
13:335:29465:26:26:72:483:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-rich districts do not participate.  So, why does Texas use this peculiar combination?
13:336:29559:26:0:108:534:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The answer is that lawyers, not economists, designed the system.  Texas has a constitutional ban
14:337:29657:0:25:72:520:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on statewide property taxes, and self-supporting foundation aid system would obviously impose one. 
14:338:29755:25:26:72:538:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although Texans regularly change their constitution through referenda, lawyers thought they had devised
14:339:29858:26:26:72:508:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a work-around that would effectively impose a statewide property tax without their having to write
14:340:29956:26:26:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supporting legislation.  If one looks only at the letter and not the spirit of the law, Texas' recapture system
14:341:30067:26:26:72:537:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:appears to be constitutional because it rests on a bizarre fiction.  Legally, a property-rich district does not
14:342:30178:26:26:72:504:556:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:have to allow its above-threshold revenue to be captured.  It is simply the case that, if it refuses to
14:343:30281:26:26:72:508:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:voluntarily contribute this revenue, the state can redraw districts until the property-rich district has
14:344:30385:26:26:72:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property wealth below the threshold.  Districts can be redrawn without regard to geographic contiguity so
14:345:30490:26:26:72:538:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that a poor inner-city neighborhood could, in theory, become part of an affluent suburban district halfway
14:346:30596:26:26:72:532:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across the state.  Similarly, part of an property-rich district could, in theory, be detached and re-attached
14:347:30705:26:26:72:533:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to a poor district hundreds of miles away.  Naturally, to avoid the problems that the redrawing of district
14:348:30812:26:26:72:526:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:boundaries would generate, property-rich districts "voluntarily" contribute revenue.  Many people find
14:349:30914:26:26:72:535:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Texas' pseudo-voluntary scheme confusing, and this is not surprising because it was designed to disguise
14:350:31018:26:25:72:300:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the effective imposition of a statewide property tax.
14:351:31071:25:26:108:525:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 5 shows a property-poor district under purely local finance.  Compared to the property-
14:352:31165:26:26:72:533:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rich district under local finance (Figure 1), the property-poor district has less pricey property and spends
14:353:31273:26:26:72:521:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less on schools.  Its budget constraint, , is such that if the district raises one dollar of property tax
14:354:31378:26:26:72:289:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue, it spends one dollar on its local schools.
14:355:31429:26:26:108:539:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 6 shows the property-poor district with a foundation aid system (and a guaranteed revenue
14:356:31525:26:26:72:517:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system, which we have not yet described).  In order to focus on the foundation aid system, notice the
14:357:31626:26:26:72:518:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:length labeled "foundation grant from the state" and connect it visually to the dashed line:  this is the
14:358:31731:26:26:72:529:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:budget constraint that would prevail under a foundation system if property prices stayed the same when
14:359:31833:26:26:72:523:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the system was enacted. The property-poor district's initial budget constraint () has its bottom end
14:360:31933:26:0:72:526:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lopped off because the district's per-property unit contribution to the foundation aid system is given by
15:361:32040:0:25:72:526:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the foundation tax rate () times its property price ().  In return, the district receives the foundation
15:362:32144:25:26:72:531:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:grant per pupil ().  Because the foundation grant is larger than what the property-poor district has paid
15:363:32248:26:26:72:525:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in foundation taxes, the with-foundation-aid budget constraint is shifted out relative to the purely local
15:364:32354:26:26:72:528:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:budget constraint.  Nevertheless, over much of its length, the with-foundation-aid budget constraint has
15:365:32458:26:26:72:539:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the same slope as the no-state-intervention budget constraint.  Thus, at least at first glance, foundation aid
15:366:32568:26:26:72:532:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:systems do not distort a district's marginal incentives to spend on schools.  (This is not quite true, owing
15:367:32676:26:26:72:530:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the fact that a positive foundation grant will raise the demand for housing in the district.  However, it
15:368:32784:26:26:72:529:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is a reasonable first approximation.)  By a parallel logic, a property-rich district does not have marginal
15:369:32891:26:26:72:519:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incentives that are much distorted, under a self-supporting foundation system.  In general, foundation
15:370:32993:26:26:72:494:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:systems are closer to being lump sum and have smaller deadweight loss than recapture systems.
15:371:33086:26:26:72:235:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:D.  The Guaranteed Revenue System
15:372:33119:26:26:108:531:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Like many other states, Texas has a guaranteed revenue system that lies on top of its foundation
15:373:33215:26:26:72:515:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system.  Beyond the 8.6 mils that districts contribute to the foundation system,  districts may choose
15:374:33317:26:25:72:518:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:another property tax rate (called the "Tier II rate").  Each mil of a district's Tier II property tax rate is
15:375:33426:25:26:72:510:323:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:guaranteed to produce at least a certain revenue per weighted pupil, regardless of the district's own
15:376:33527:26:26:72:535:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax base.  The state fulfils this guarantee by contributing revenue when a district's own property
15:377:33634:26:26:72:532:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax base would generate insufficient revenue.  If a district's property tax base generates as much or more
15:378:33740:26:26:72:536:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue than the guaranteed level, it is left alone, neither contributing to nor receiving Tier II aid.  (Keep
15:379:33850:26:26:72:525:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in mind that property-rich districts do not get all the revenue associated with their Tier II rates because
15:380:33957:26:26:72:415:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the part associated with their above-threshold property wealth is confiscated.)
15:381:34036:26:26:108:508:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Under the guaranteed revenue system, a property-poor district might pay only five cents in
15:382:34126:26:26:72:538:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property taxes for every dollar of revenue it receives.  This is such an attractive price for school spending
15:383:34235:26:26:72:525:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that property-poor districts might be tempted to spend with abandon because nearly all of the money is
15:384:34337:26:0:72:528:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coming from elsewhere.  To prevent such overspending, every guaranteed revenue system has an upper
16:385:34437:0:12:114:113:133:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Apparently, the 15 mil cap appeals to the property-poor districts because they want to ensure that15
16:386:34539:12:12:72:517:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:property-rich districts cannot spend much more than they can.  This desire is poorly thought out.  Property-poor
16:387:34651:12:12:72:494:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:districts should not try to prevent property-rich districts from spending their own money on inputs that are
16:388:34759:12:11:72:534:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:educationally productive, such as new technology.  If the property-poor districts want to make a case for some input
16:389:34875:11:12:72:520:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:being so necessary that it must be included in the foundation grant, they need to have evidence that property-rich
16:390:34989:12:0:72:292:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:districts are uniformly buying it with their own money. 
16:391:35045:0:25:72:532:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:limit on the property tax rate for which state will fulfil the guarantee.  In Texas, a district's Tier II rate is
16:392:35158:25:26:72:531:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capped at 6.4 mils and its total property tax rate is capped at 15 mils (8.6 mils for the foundation system
16:393:35265:26:26:72:523:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and up to 6.4 mils for Tier II).  Although it is necessary to have a cap on the rate that is guaranteed, an
16:394:35372:26:26:72:520:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:overall cap is unnecessary –most states simply make a district revert to pure local finance once it gets
16:395:35476:26:26:72:412:582:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:over the guaranteed rate.  Texas' overall 15 mil cap is politically motivated.15
16:396:35556:26:26:108:536:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 6 illustrates how the guaranteed revenue system fits on top of the foundation system.  The
16:397:35653:26:28:72:526:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:budget constraint labeled "" shows that the property-poor district first receives its
16:398:35738:28:26:72:498:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:foundation grant and then faces a marginal tax price for school spending that is well below one. 
16:399:35834:26:26:72:530:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Specifically, the slope of the with-guaranteed-revenue budget constraint is given by the ratio of the per-
16:400:35940:26:26:72:456:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:WADA revenue guarantee to the district's per-WADA property tax base times one mil:
16:401:36022:26:52:336:339:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:.
16:402:36023:52:26:72:539:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(The one mil in the denominator is there because the guarantee is defined on a per mil basis.)  The budget
16:403:36129:26:26:72:405:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constraint turns vertical where the district reaches the property tax rate cap.
16:404:36208:26:26:108:533:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 6 illustrates what the state would like to have happen to a poor district getting foundation
16:405:36307:26:26:72:529:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and guaranteed revenue aid.  The district is paying just a bit more property tax than it was paying under
16:406:36412:26:26:72:527:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:purely local finance, yet its schools are spending much more per pupil.   The district is getting not only
16:407:36518:26:26:72:532:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the foundation grant but also guaranteed revenue payments from the state (see labeled length).  Figure 6
16:408:36622:26:25:72:516:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumes, however, that the district's property prices do not change when it receives such aid.  This is
16:409:36725:25:0:72:110:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unlikely.
17:410:36736:0:25:108:518:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 7 shows why property prices change.  The figures compares the property-poor district
17:411:36827:25:26:72:502:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with district that is more intermediate (less poor, but still poor enough to receive some state aid). 
17:412:36929:26:26:72:506:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Initially, both districts are in internal equilibrium under local finance, and the indifference of their
17:413:37033:26:26:72:514:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:"boundary" individuals shows that they are also in inter-district equilibrium.  With the new state aid
17:414:37135:26:26:72:498:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:programs, there will be a new boundary individual.  Looking closely, it will be seen that the new
17:415:37232:26:26:72:526:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:boundary individual has a greater preference for school spending than the old boundary individual (the
17:416:37334:26:26:72:531:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indifference curve is less flat).  Put another way, the property-poor district can now attract an individual
17:417:37442:26:26:72:513:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with more taste for schooling because the district gets to spend more per pupil.  If the property-poor
17:418:37544:26:26:72:522:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district is more attractive, it must be the case that its property prices rise to re-equilibriate the housing
17:419:37653:26:26:72:316:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market –that is, to capitalize the benefit it has received.
17:420:37712:26:26:108:509:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Actually, the situation is slightly more complicated than this because new residents are not
17:421:37804:26:26:72:538:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attracted by additional school spending per se; they are attracted by schools that are more valuable.  With
17:422:37911:26:26:72:535:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the property-rich districts, it is reasonable to assume that every dollar of tax payments is converted into a
17:423:38020:26:25:72:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dollar of value in the schools.  The assumption is reasonable because local taxpayers are choosing to
17:424:38121:25:26:72:536:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spend their own money on schools.  If their dollar of tax payments is not converted into a dollar of value,
17:425:38228:26:26:72:517:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they can keep their dollar.  Property-poor districts are in a different situation because they pay only a
17:426:38333:26:26:72:530:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fraction of each additional dollar of school spending.  For instance, a district that pays only 10 cents for
17:427:38441:26:26:72:516:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:every dollar of school spending should logically support additional spending so long as the marginal
17:428:38541:26:26:72:537:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dollar is converted into at least 10 cents of value.  Because prospective residents are attracted by schools'
17:429:38650:26:26:72:512:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:value, not their spending per se, property prices in the property-poor district need not rise dollar for
17:430:38754:26:26:72:521:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dollar with the fiscal benefit conferred by state aid.  We should not be surprised to find an asymmetry
17:431:38857:26:26:72:529:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between the property value lost and gained when a dollar is redistributed.  Later, we return to this point
17:432:38963:26:26:72:137:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in some detail.
17:433:38978:26:0:108:537:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 8 shows the property-poor district's equilibrium with state aid, taking into account the rise
18:434:39080:0:25:72:511:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in its property prices.  Because its property prices have risen to capitalize the aid, the district makes
18:435:39185:25:26:72:530:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greater tax payments than the state expected, it gets less guaranteed revenue aid than the state expected,
18:436:39291:26:26:72:507:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and it spends less on schools than the state expected.  However, the differences between the state's
18:437:39391:26:27:72:539:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expectations and what actually occurs is likely to be rather small. Finally, notice how easy it would be for
18:438:39499:27:28:72:534:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the district to locate at the kink where the budget constraint () turns vertical –even a small change in
18:439:39603:28:25:72:503:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the slope of the deterministic voter's indifference curve would put the district at the kink.  That is,
18:440:39706:25:26:72:520:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-poor districts are likely to set their property tax rate at or near the cap, owing to the fact that
18:441:39814:26:26:72:279:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they pay only a fraction of the marginal dollar.

18:443:39917:26:26:108:510:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The parts of the Texas' school finance system described so far are all based on WADA, not
18:444:40006:26:26:72:503:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual pupils.  There are, of course, many details to the construction of the pupil weights.  For the
18:445:40107:26:26:72:408:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:purposes of this paper, however, we can focus on two aspects of the system.
18:446:40182:26:26:108:523:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:First, districts can face strong incentives to increase their ratio of WADA to actual pupils.  By
18:447:40279:26:26:72:511:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:raising WADA/pupils, property-rich districts can reduce their measured wealth, and thereby reduce
18:448:40376:26:26:72:513:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recapture.  Property-poor districts can increase both their foundation and guaranteed revenue aid by
18:449:40476:26:26:72:534:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:raising WADA/pupils.  Intermediate districts can increase the probability that they receive foundation or
18:450:40581:26:26:72:440:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:guaranteed revenue aid and decrease the probability that they experience recapture.
18:451:40664:26:26:108:505:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, although some weights are for conditions that require little or no local judgement
18:452:40754:26:25:72:536:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(blindness, deafness), other weights are for conditions that do require local judgement.  In practice, these
18:453:40862:25:26:72:530:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are conditions in which there is a spectrum of difficulty, where a low level of difficulty is considered to
18:454:40969:26:26:72:500:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be part of the normal variation among children and a high level of difficulty is considered to be a
18:455:41068:26:26:72:509:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disability that requires special treatment:  limited English proficiency, speech impairment, learning
18:456:41169:26:15:72:530:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disability, emotional disturbance.  The procedures for classifying students into these disabilities make it
19:457:41278:15:24:114:114:98:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  See Texas Education Agency, Division of Special Education (2002).16

19:459:41405:0:25:72:276:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:clear that significant local discretion is used.  In addition, the judgement-sensitive disabilities receive16
19:460:41514:25:26:72:505:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-trivial weights.  One full-time equivalent pupil in speech therapy is 5 WADAs.  One full-time
19:461:41611:26:26:72:534:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equivalent resource room pupil is 3 WADAS (resource rooms are typically assigned to learning disabled
19:462:41712:26:26:72:538:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:students).  In Dallas, more than 98 percent of the students who have weights greater than one are students
19:463:41818:26:26:72:530:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in judgement-sensitive categories.  Students in judgement-sensitive categories account for 95 percent of
19:464:41922:26:26:72:268:556:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:the difference between WADA and pupils.  Cullen (2003) shows that these percentages are typical for17
19:465:42023:26:26:72:101:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Texas.
19:466:42029:26:26:108:519:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In short, the easiest way for a district to increase its revenue is to get the maximum out of the
19:467:42126:26:26:72:525:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:WADA system, given the schooling it means to give students.  The weights are designed to help cover
19:468:42225:26:26:72:534:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the costs of the average student who is in a category.  Therefore, a district will gain if it can put students
19:469:42335:26:26:72:519:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:into categories where they are marginal candidates for classification.  Because classification requires
19:470:42438:26:26:72:538:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:local judgement, it may be quite possible for districts to gain via such accounting practices.  Indeed, there
19:471:42547:26:26:72:499:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are now WADA consultants, whom districts employ to help them get the most out of the system.
19:472:42639:26:25:108:530:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:WADA accounting may make few people happy.  Parents with infra-marginal disabled children
19:473:42728:25:26:72:531:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may feel that staff devote too much effort to classifying marginal children and too little effort to serving
19:474:42836:26:26:72:516:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seriously disabled students.  Parents with children who are just at the margin of being classified may
19:475:42938:26:26:72:539:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:worry that their child is overclassified and would be better off without a label.  Parents with children who
19:476:43046:26:26:72:517:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have no disability may feel that the school administration is unduly concerned with disability-related
19:477:43148:26:0:72:379:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paperwork and too little concerned with educating "regular" students.
20:478:43219:0:12:114:114:239:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  For what it is worth, the following equation summarizes per-pupil spending under the Robin Hood18
20:479:43318:12:59:72:105:227:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:formula:
20:480:43326:59:11:72:532:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:The equation above is not particularly elucidating except that, by showing how the systems interact, it demonstrates
20:481:43442:11:12:72:508:157:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:that neither the foundation aid nor guaranteed revenue systems is at all self-supporting.  The recapture system
20:482:43553:12:12:72:538:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:generates revenue that supports the other two systems.  People who are familiar with formulas from other states often
20:483:43670:12:24:72:186:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:get confused over this issue. 
20:484:43700:24:11:114:113:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We have previously described the possibility of a "fixed point" tax rate and why states are unlikely to be19
20:485:43810:11:24:72:214:98:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:able to choose one.  See footnote 7.
20:486:43846:24:0:114:114:74:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In practice, the state can do this by allowing the threshold to be eroded by inflation.20
20:487:43937:0:26:246:365:685:11:g_d0_f4:6:g_d0_f3:V.  Robin Hood in Toto 18
20:488:43960:26:26:108:509:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Summing up, under the Robin Hood system, property-rich districts are likely to experience
20:489:44049:26:26:72:503:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:falling property prices and contribute less revenue to the system than the state hoped they would. 
20:490:44147:26:26:72:536:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Property-poor districts receive aid, may experience a rise in property prices, and are likely to set their tax
20:491:44257:26:26:72:518:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate near or at the cap.  Both property-rich and property-poor districts are likely to raise their WADA
20:492:44360:26:26:72:532:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relative to their number of actual pupils.  We have focused on districts at the two extremes because they
20:493:44465:26:25:72:508:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are most interesting, but of course there are intermediate districts that have intermediate outcomes.
20:494:44566:25:26:108:529:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our summary cannot stop here, however, because the system we have outlined is unlikely to be
20:495:44658:26:26:72:107:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:stable.  Because of capitalization, the state is getting significantly less revenue than it expected, yet it19
20:496:44768:26:26:72:512:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:still has to make the promised foundation grants and fulfil its revenue guarantees.  The state may be
20:497:44869:26:26:72:333:426:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:tempted to lower the threshold at which recapture occurs.  The lower threshold will capture more of the20
20:498:44974:26:26:72:508:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax revenue of the incumbent property-rich and it will also redefine as property-rich some
20:499:45073:26:26:72:538:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intermediate districts that previously had too little property wealth to experience recapture.  Lowering the
20:500:45181:26:26:72:538:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recapture threshold sounds like a good solution, but we now know that lowering the threshold will set off
20:501:45286:26:26:72:515:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:another round of capitalization, so that the state will get some extra revenue, but is again likely to be
20:502:45391:26:0:72:530:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disappointed.  Notice, as well, that every time the state lowers the recapture threshold, the property-rich
21:503:45500:0:25:72:530:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts will raise their tax rates.  They will gradually but inevitably move toward the property rate cap.
21:504:45608:25:26:108:536:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In short, what is the experience of the Robin Hood system likely to be, over several years?  From
21:505:45705:26:26:72:498:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the state's point of view, the system is always disappointingly short of funds and requires greater
21:506:45804:26:26:72:530:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:infusions from the state's general revenue than it expected to need.  From the point of view of a resident
21:507:45910:26:26:72:491:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of a property-rich district, the system is not only burdensome (he loses wealth) but grows more
21:508:46005:26:26:72:517:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burdensome with each passing year.  Moreover, if he has children in schools, he is worried about his
21:509:46105:26:26:72:512:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district losing all its discretion as it approaches the property rate cap.  From the point of view of the
21:510:46210:26:26:72:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:resident of an intermediate district, the system probably seemed harmless enough at its inception.  But, he
21:511:46317:26:26:72:520:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may have been surprised to find that, after several years, he has been declared to be property-rich and
21:512:46420:26:26:72:506:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subjected to recapture.  From point of view of a childless (elderly, say) resident of a property-poor
21:513:46521:26:26:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district, the system is problematic:  although his housing consumption and income are unchanged, he now
21:514:46624:26:26:72:526:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:owes more property tax, mainly because his district has increased its property tax rate but also because
21:515:46728:26:26:72:525:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:his house is worth more.  A resident of a property-poor district who has school-aged children probably
21:516:46830:26:25:72:496:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has the rosiest view:  he pays more property tax but his children also attend a school that spends
21:517:46928:25:26:72:535:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantially more.  Yet, he is likely to be anxious:  his district is at or near the property tax rate cap so it
21:518:47041:26:26:72:510:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has almost no discretion:  it depends entirely on the foundation grant and guaranteed revenue level,
21:519:47141:26:26:72:485:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which are set by the state.  The state perennially complains that the system's funding is below
21:520:47236:26:26:72:531:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expectations and he must fight an ongoing political battle to ensure that the state once again reduces the
21:521:47342:26:26:72:524:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recapture threshold in its perennial quest for funds.  Many parents are likely to be dissatisfied with the
21:522:47448:26:26:72:533:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:WADA system because it may produce decisions that are more oriented toward revenue than toward the
21:523:47546:26:26:72:320:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:proper treatment of disabled and near-disabled children.
21:524:47602:26:26:108:502:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Perhaps because of the Robin Hood name or perhaps because property wealth is likely to
21:525:47688:26:26:72:528:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disappear under Texas' scheme, we are often asked whether Robin Hood is a system of efficient wealth
21:526:47788:26:0:72:522:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:confiscation.  Efficient wealth confiscation systems receive high marks from economists because they
22:527:47890:0:12:114:113:168:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Some states, including Texas, actually do have endowments that support school aid.  Typically, these21
22:528:47994:12:11:72:531:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:were created in the early days of the state from sales of government land.  Because they were set up long ago, when
22:529:48109:11:12:72:504:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:real per-pupil spending and state populations were smaller, most endowments are insufficiently large to fund
22:530:48217:12:24:72:407:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:significant aid today.  However, they demonstrate that endowments can be practical.
22:531:48300:24:12:114:113:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  This is a curious standard from an economist's point of view because it is evident that the combination of22
22:532:48410:12:11:72:532:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the foundation aid system and recapture system already constitute a statewide property tax (mentally assign the first
22:533:48527:11:12:72:535:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:8.6 mils of recaptured revenue to the foundation aid system and there you are).  Nevertheless, this is the standard set
22:534:48646:12:0:72:124:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:by the Court.
22:535:48659:0:25:72:526:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cause few distortions.  In them, the state takes assets from the wealthy and either uses them to endow a
22:536:48763:25:26:72:504:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state fund for ongoing redistribution or redistributes the assets immediately in such a way that the
22:537:48863:26:26:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formerly poor have no ongoing need of redistribution.  If it is to be efficient, confiscation must be done in
22:538:48972:26:26:72:528:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a fell swoop so that it becomes a sunk cost for formerly wealthy, who get on with their lives and do not
22:539:49076:26:26:72:504:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distort their ongoing behavior.  Robin Hood has none of this character.   We will see that the state
22:540:49176:26:26:72:517:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:imposes high marginal tax rates on school spending and wealth, returns repeatedly to tax wealth this
22:541:49276:26:26:72:527:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period that it left untaxed last period, and cannot show, for its efforts, either an endowment nor a set of
22:542:49383:26:26:72:475:504:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:formerly poor districts that now have the wealth to manage school spending on their own.21
22:543:49473:26:26:108:505:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In short, after several years, a system like Robin Hood is unlikely to enjoy the widespread
22:544:49564:26:26:72:518:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:popularity enjoyed by the man after whom it is named.  Many people will feel that property taxes are
22:545:49664:26:26:72:530:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rising too fast; school superintendents and parents are likely to feel unduly constrained; state legislators
22:546:49772:26:26:72:528:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are likely to be tired of the perennial problems.  Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, Texas is the only
22:547:49878:26:26:72:534:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state that has been sued over its school finance system by property-rich and property-poor districts at the
22:548:49985:26:25:72:119:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:same time.
22:549:49995:25:26:108:534:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A curious feature of the Texas Supreme Court opinion in favor of the Robin Hood system is that
22:550:50089:26:26:72:500:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Court stated that if all districts were to reach the 15 cap, it would be obvious that they had no
22:551:50190:26:26:72:316:271:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:discretion and that the 15 mil tax was a statewide tax.   The Court's statement created a widely-22
22:552:50289:26:171:72:524:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recognized automatic trigger for the system's demise.  Currently, more than 80 percent of Texas pupils
23:553:50393:171:0:114:114:74:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  The source is Texas Education Agency, Summary of Finances 2003-04.23
23:554:50463:0:25:72:267:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:are in districts within half a mil of the cap.  The system is about to become unconstitutional and few23
23:555:50567:25:53:72:389:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:people seem motivated to resuscitate it in anything like its current form.
23:556:50641:53:25:141:470:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:VI.  An Empirical Strategy for Testing Hypotheses about Robin Hood
23:557:50707:25:26:108:201:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We hypothesize that:
23:558:50727:26:26:108:537:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(i) All else equal, capitalization of Robin Hood drove down property prices in recapture districts.
23:559:50826:26:26:108:540:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(ii) Owing to capitalization, the revenues contributed by property-rich districts to the Robin Hood
23:560:50925:26:26:72:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system were insufficient to fund the intended aid.  As a result, the state reduced the recapture threshold in
23:561:51034:26:26:72:118:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:real terms.
23:562:51045:26:26:108:532:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(iii) As a result of the recapture threshold falling in real terms, an increasing number of districts
23:563:51146:26:26:72:196:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were subjected to recapture.
23:564:51174:26:26:108:503:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(iv)  As a result of capitalization, districts that faced recapture could not keep up with the
23:565:51268:26:26:72:507:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demand for school spending without raising their property tax rates.  Such districts were gradually
23:566:51367:26:25:72:285:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pushed toward the 15 mil cap on property taxes.
23:567:51414:25:26:108:526:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(v)  Low marginal tax prices induced property-poor districts to set their property tax rates at or
23:568:51512:26:26:72:128:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:near the cap.
23:569:51525:26:26:108:537:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(vi) Districts will have increased their WADA/ADA ratio depending on their financial incentives
23:570:51620:26:26:72:313:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to do so (where they are in the school finance system).
23:571:51675:26:26:72:321:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A.  Parameters that Describe the School Finance System
23:572:51729:26:26:108:516:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Systems of school finance can be described by a few parameters that characterize the budget
23:573:51820:26:26:72:271:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constraints illustrated in Figures 1 through 8:
23:574:51867:26:26:72:436:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(i) a district's marginal tax price ()–that is, the slope of its budget constraint;
23:575:51950:26:0:72:516:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(ii) a district's virtual grant ()–that is, the difference between the intercept of pure local
24:576:52046:0:12:114:114:227:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Figure 8 has nice geometry that shows that the virtual grant is equal to net foundation aid for a district24
24:577:52156:12:12:72:533:215:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:that receives foundation aid only (no guaranteed revenue aid).  Project the dashed budget constraint (the one at a 45
24:578:52273:12:11:72:518:203:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:degree angle) to the horizontal dotted line labeled .  The length of the  line that remains is the intercept or
24:579:52384:11:12:72:537:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:virtual grant.  Its length is given by the foundation grant minus one side of the right triangle created by the projection
24:580:52506:12:12:72:535:180:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:of the dashed line.  The length of that triangle's side is exactly equal to the vertical distance between the  line and
24:581:52625:12:12:72:532:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the horizontal part of .  That vertical distance is what the district pays into the foundation aid system.  Subtract
24:582:52740:12:12:72:491:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the district's payments into the foundation aid system from its foundation grant to obtain the virtual grant.
24:583:52849:12:11:108:538:144:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:For a district that receives guaranteed revenue aid, the virtual grant is not merely net foundation aid because
24:584:52960:11:12:72:500:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:its budget constraint is not at a 45 degree angle.  Project the sloped part of  onto the  line, making a
24:585:53064:12:12:72:501:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:right-angle triangle.  The short vertical side of this triangle has length equal to the district's payment into the
24:586:53179:12:12:72:504:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:foundation program.  The long horizontal side of the triangle has length equal to:  (district's payment into the
24:587:53291:12:11:72:537:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:foundation program) * (guaranteed level per cent of property tax rate)/(amount district raises per cent of property tax
24:588:53410:11:0:72:493:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:rate).  The virtual grant is the foundation grant minus the length of the long horizontal side of the triangle.
24:589:53521:0:25:72:494:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:finance budget constraint and the intercept of the projection of the with-aid budget constraint;24
24:590:53619:25:26:72:202:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(iii) the property tax rate cap;
24:591:53651:26:26:72:362:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(iv) the effect of a change in WADA/pupil on a district's revenue;
24:592:53717:26:26:72:529:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(v) the share of the change in property tax revenue that a district keeps when its property values change
24:593:53822:26:26:72:255:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and affect its local revenue ().
24:594:53854:26:26:108:532:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The first four parameters listed above are self-evident.  The fifth parameter, however, requires a
24:595:53952:26:26:72:504:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:little explanation.   affects the inter-district equilibrium illustrated in Figures 3 and 7. 
24:596:54044:26:26:72:512:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Essentially, when a school finance reform makes households shift from one district to another, they
24:597:54143:26:26:72:534:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:change house prices which change local property tax revenues which change districts' budgets according
24:598:54245:26:26:72:506:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to.  Because districts' budgets affect households' demand to live in them,  is
24:599:54322:26:26:72:322:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:important for establishing how far property prices move.
24:600:54378:26:26:108:503:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An additional virtue of  is that it indicates the power of the incentives facing a
24:601:54459:26:26:72:507:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district's staff.  Suppose staff make extra efforts that raise property values and, consequently, local
24:602:54562:26:25:72:515:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property tax revenues in their district.  The larger is the share of these extra dollars that their district
24:603:54670:25:143:72:538:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:keeps, the more likely is their schools' budget to rise.  If staff like larger budgets, then their incentives are
25:604:54785:143:12:114:114:180:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Of course, if district staff maximize property values, then  is a  measure of the power of their25
25:605:54884:12:12:72:526:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:incentives.  Districts' maximizing property values is a popular assumption among local public economists, but it is
25:606:54999:12:11:72:518:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:presumably just a convenient shorthand for the ways in which staff benefit from higher property values.  No one
25:607:55110:11:24:72:405:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:claims that they literally have contracts that depend on their raising property values.
25:608:55197:24:12:114:113:121:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We are concerned about differentiating between changes in the parameters that are exogenous (caused26
25:609:55300:12:12:72:523:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:purely by the law change) and endogenous to the districts' reactions to the law changes.  We address this problem
25:610:55413:12:11:72:524:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:using simulated instrumental variables, which do not share some of the features of typical instrumental variables. 
25:611:55528:11:12:72:525:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:For instance, with simulated instruments, it is obvious where the variation in the instruments comes from:  the law
25:612:55643:12:0:72:532:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:change.  Also, the case for the instruments fulfilling the second instrumental variables condition (lack of correlation
25:613:55762:0:25:72:272:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:higher powered when  is higher.25
25:614:55795:25:26:72:190:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B.  Our Empirical Strategy
25:615:55821:26:26:108:511:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our empirical strategy is straightforward because, at heart, we are analyzing one big policy
25:616:55913:26:26:72:534:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:change in school finance.  Of course, the Robin Hood formula affected different districts differently, but
25:617:56019:26:26:72:535:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the differences are not random but related to districts' initial characteristics.  Therefore, it is best to think
25:618:56132:26:26:72:516:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the timing of Robin Hood as the main source of exogenous variation:  we will look for districts to
25:619:56233:26:26:72:532:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deviate from their prior behavior with timing that makes it appear that they are reacting to Robin Hood. 
25:620:56337:26:26:72:523:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because we want the Robin Hood parameters that a district faces to reflect only the impact of the law,
25:621:56439:26:26:72:533:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not the district's endogenous response to it, we use simulated parameters.  That is, for each year, we take
25:622:56546:26:26:72:525:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observations on each district before Robin Hood, use them to predict what property values would have
25:623:56646:26:26:72:537:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:been in the absence of Robin Hood, and run the predicted value through the contemporary school finance
25:624:56748:26:26:72:529:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:laws to determine what marginal tax price, foundation tax, et cetera would have been with Robin Hood
25:625:56847:26:26:72:532:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but no other change.  We use the simulated parameters as instrumental variables, instrumenting for each
25:626:56950:26:25:72:530:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual parameter with the simulated parameter that the district would face if the law had changed but its
25:627:57055:25:26:72:525:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:own behavior had not.  This now-standard technique is usually called simulated instrumental variables
25:628:57156:26:26:72:536:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimation.  Simulated parameters are powerful instruments and valid (if they are valid) by construction. 
25:629:57261:26:26:72:519:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:That is, a reader who knows how they are constructed should be able to judge their validity.  We also
25:630:57362:26:26:72:505:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate reduced-form equations, which generate "intention-to-treat" estimates of the Robin Hood
25:631:57458:26:63:72:112:219:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:system.26
26:632:57469:63:11:72:536:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:between the instruments and unobserved determinants of the dependent variable) is straightforward:  the instruments
26:633:57584:11:12:72:530:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:are constructed to fulfil this condition as much as possible. Because each simulated parameter has exactly the same
26:634:57699:12:12:72:516:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:structure as the parameter it mimics, the reduced form equation produces "intention to treat" estimates of Robin
26:635:57811:12:24:72:521:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Hood, while the simulated instrumental variables estimates are "treatment on the treated" effects of Robin Hood.
26:636:57923:24:11:114:114:97:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  See, for instance, Feldstein (1995) on the importance of using panel data and Goolsbee (2000) on the27
26:637:58027:11:12:72:530:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:difficulty in constructing a counterfactual for high income people.  Gordon (forthcoming) discusses this issue when
26:638:58142:12:0:72:418:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:constructing a counterfactual for a major change in federal Title I spending on schools.
26:639:58230:0:25:108:525:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because we predict that some responses will play out over time, we graphically show districts'
26:640:58324:25:26:72:537:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:responses for the years after the law change, up to the 2001-02 school year.  We treat several variables as
26:641:58431:26:26:72:539:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simultaneously determined dependent variables:  property prices, property tax rates, school spending, and
26:642:58536:26:26:72:534:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the WADA/pupil ratio.  We also show how the recapture threshold evolved from the beginning of Robin
26:643:58635:26:26:72:161:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hood to the present.
26:644:58655:26:26:72:252:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C.  Obstacles for Our Empirical Strategy
26:645:58695:26:26:108:539:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As in most studies of tax reforms, the primary empirical obstacle is determining what would have
26:646:58791:26:26:72:523:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:happened in the absence of the reform.  That is, what is the correct counterfactual? This issue is much
26:647:58894:26:26:72:436:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:discussed in studies of income tax reforms, but less discussed for school finance.27
26:648:58978:26:26:108:506:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Overall, we believe that constructing a counterfactual is less problematic for Texas school
26:649:59069:26:26:72:507:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:finance than it is for an analysis of an income tax reform.  First, the timing of the reform was more
26:650:59170:26:26:72:527:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:arbitrary than is a typical income tax reform.  Income tax reforms typically begin in a legislature that is
26:651:59277:26:26:72:494:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sensitive to the business cycle, but the timing of school finance reforms is dictated by an erratic
26:652:59376:26:25:72:538:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interaction of plaintiffs, courts, and legislatures.  Even if the initiation of the Edgewood case (1984) were
26:653:59485:25:26:72:519:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:endogenous to the business cycle, the school finance system was not affected at all until 1989-90 and
26:654:59586:26:26:72:526:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood was not implemented until 1993-94.  Second, in tax reform analysis, it is often difficult to
26:655:59689:26:26:72:519:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:follow individuals.  We do not have this problem:  a district is a district and the data form a complete
26:656:59793:26:26:72:529:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:panel.  Third, unlike individuals who have many idiosyncracies in their lives that are unobserved by the
26:657:59897:26:26:72:533:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:econometrician, a district's menu of choices and its actions are entirely public.  As a result, the estimates
26:658:60006:26:0:72:522:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we use for making predictions are precise.  Fourth, there were no other major school or tax reforms in
27:659:60110:0:11:114:114:274:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:    Texas implemented an accountability program for schools in the 1990s, but the financial consequences28
27:660:60216:11:12:72:433:263:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:of the program were negligible, given the scale of revenues and spending that we examine.
27:661:60305:12:12:108:524:251:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Texas increased aid for building school facilities in property poor districts in 1997 and for all districts in
27:662:60415:12:12:72:538:239:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:2001.  We therefore look at the property tax and school spending that is not for facilities, but is for "maintenance and
27:663:60535:12:11:72:502:227:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:operations."  Maintenance and operations taxes and spending are more than 95 percent of the total in Texas.
27:664:60642:11:12:108:524:216:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Texas raised the homestead exemption from $5,000 to $10,000 in 1998.  Using the comptroller's data on
27:665:60743:12:12:72:532:204:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:what assessed property values would have been with and without exemptions, we eliminate the confounding impact
27:666:60853:12:24:72:202:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:of the exemptions from our data.
27:667:60885:24:12:114:114:168:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In other words, we deliberately do not use a district's own values for most variables.  This is because it is29
27:668:60998:12:11:72:507:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:plausible that a metropolitan area's socioeconomics and demographics change in a way that is exogenous to a
27:669:61105:11:12:72:539:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:district's own conduct and circumstances, but it is not plausible that a district's socioeconomics and demographics are
27:670:61224:12:12:72:531:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:exogenous to its conduct and circumstances (especially the impact of Robin Hood itself). We have performed all of
27:671:61337:12:12:72:531:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the analysis using only state level variables (as opposed to metropolitan and county) and get similar but less precise
27:672:61455:12:23:72:201:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:predictions, as we would expect.
27:673:61487:23:12:114:113:86:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  To get these percentages, we used 1987, a year in which the average price of a barrel of oil was typical30
27:674:61595:12:0:72:158:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:for the 1980s:  $18.1.
27:675:61617:0:25:72:372:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:Texas over the same period that are likely to confound our results.28
27:676:61686:25:26:72:222:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:D.  Constructing a Counterfactual
27:677:61719:26:26:108:534:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We need to construct a counterfactual both in order to construct the simulated parameters and in
27:678:61815:26:26:72:422:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:order to control for what would likely have happened in Robin Hood's absence.
27:679:61892:26:26:108:524:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use data from 1980 to 1990 to estimate how each district's property tax base is affected by
27:680:61986:26:26:72:512:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:natural gas and oil prices; personal income in its metropolitan area (or county, for non-metropolitan
27:681:62087:26:26:72:528:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts); employment by industry in its metropolitan area (county); population in its metropolitan area
27:682:62192:26:26:72:503:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(county); state-level employment in the oil, gas and mining industry; and gross state product.  We
27:683:62290:26:26:72:538:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate a district-level regression with most variables at the county or metropolitan area level in order to
27:684:62399:26:26:72:520:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ensure that the covariates are strong predictors of property values but also plausibly exogenous to the
27:685:62502:26:26:72:258:426:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:conduct of the individual school district.  In order to allow property prices to vary more with oil and29
27:686:62607:26:26:72:534:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:natural gas prices in districts that depend heavily on that industry, we interact the oil and gas prices with
27:687:62716:26:26:72:524:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicators for a district's decile when districts are categorized by the percentage of their property in oil
27:688:62824:26:25:72:537:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and gas land.  We also interact oil and gas prices with indicators for a district's quartile when districts are
27:689:62935:25:143:72:423:323:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:categorized by the percentage of their employment in the oil and gas industry.  In order to allow30
28:690:63036:143:12:114:113:180:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  The elasticity of property values to oil prices rises with a district's dependence on oil and gas land and is31
28:691:63149:12:12:72:521:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:equal to 0.10 for the top decile of dependence.  The elasticity of property values to natural gas prices rises with a
28:692:63266:12:12:72:516:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:district's dependence on oil and gas land and is equal to 0.24 for the top decile of dependence.  The elasticity of
28:693:63381:12:11:72:497:144:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:property values to metropolitan (county) per capita personal income is 0.07 for districts with initial median
28:694:63490:11:12:72:508:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:household income in the bottom quartile, 0.13 for districts in the second quartile, 0.17 for districts in the third
28:695:63605:12:12:72:529:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:quartile, and 0.03 for districts with initial median household income in the top quartile.  A full set of coefficients is
28:696:63726:12:12:72:335:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:available from the authors, but these are the most interesting ones.
28:697:63794:12:11:108:521:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Texas assessors value oil and gas land using a discounting method, published oil and gas price forecasts
28:698:63898:11:12:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:(which tend strongly to reflect current prices), and information about which wells would be economic at which price. 
28:699:64015:12:0:72:527:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:For a given parcel of oil or gas land, nearly all of the year-to-year variation is driven by current oil and natural gas
28:700:64135:0:25:72:536:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property prices to vary more with personal income in districts that depend on residential property values,
28:701:64241:25:26:72:530:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we interact metropolitan (county) per capita personal income with indicators for a district's decile when
28:702:64346:26:26:72:526:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts are categorized by the percentage of their property that is residential.  Finally, because income
28:703:64453:26:26:72:515:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth in the 1980s and 1990s was not experienced equally by low wage and high wage earners, we
28:704:64548:26:26:72:522:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interact metropolitan (county) per capita personal income with indicators for a district's quartile when
28:705:64652:26:26:72:364:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts are categorized by their initial median household income.
28:706:64719:26:26:108:235:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Specifically, our equation is:
28:707:64749:26:104:527:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1)
28:708:64752:104:26:72:527:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where i indexes districts, j indexes the metropolitan area or county, t indexes time, and the vector  is
28:709:64856:26:26:72:514:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the set of metropolitan-, county-, and state-level variables described above.  Notice that equation (1)
28:710:64959:26:25:72:524:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:includes a fixed effect for each district and has a log-log specification.  The equation explains the data
28:711:65065:25:26:72:527:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the 1980s extremely well:  the F-statistic is 74.2 for the test of the hypothesis that the coefficients
28:712:65173:26:26:72:526:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the explanatory variables, not including the district fixed effects, are jointly equal to zero.  With the
28:713:65281:26:26:72:524:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district fixed effects, the equation explains 99.4 percent of the variation.  We believe that the resulting
28:714:65388:26:26:72:531:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predictions for the 1990s are reliable because most of the variation in property values in Texas is driven
28:715:65494:26:3:72:503:219:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:by household incomes or by oil and gas prices, which affect property values in systematic ways.31
29:716:65593:3:12:72:538:216:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:prices.  It is important to associate oil and gas prices with the correct year of property valuation because there is a lag
29:717:65716:12:24:72:298:204:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:between actual price changes and their use by assessors. 
29:718:65773:24:12:114:113:180:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We found that employment in agriculture and low-skill industries were less noisy indicators of recent32
29:719:65878:12:11:72:533:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:immigrants than was survey data on immigrants by metropolitan area (county) or data on legal immigrants' intended
29:720:65991:11:24:72:118:157:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:destination.
29:721:66003:24:12:114:114:133:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We hold constant each district's ratio of WADA/pupils at its 1991 value because this was the first year in33
29:722:66113:12:24:72:515:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:each WADA was measured and districts would have had little time to react to the law by reclassifying students.
29:723:66223:24:11:114:113:97:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We use a log-log specification because it is implied by common specifications for demand for school34
29:724:66326:11:12:72:486:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:spending, such as those derived from Cobb-Douglas utility.  As a check, however, we estimated a levels
29:725:66428:12:0:72:368:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:specification.  It generated comparable estimates but fit the data less well. 
29:726:66505:0:25:108:485:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In order to predict district's number of pupils, we regress pupils on district indicators,
29:727:66595:25:26:72:360:660:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:metropolitan (county) population, and employment by industry.   We use 1980s data and a log-log32
29:728:66692:26:26:72:520:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specification.  Not surprisingly, population and employment strongly predict pupils:  the F-statistic is
29:729:66796:26:26:72:523:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:109.5 for the test of the hypothesis that the coefficients on the explanatory variables, not including the
29:730:66902:26:26:72:531:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:district fixed effects, are jointly equal to zero.  With the district fixed effects, the equation explains 99.8
29:731:67013:26:26:72:530:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent of the variation.  We then apply each district's initial WADA/pupil ratio to its predicted number
29:732:67118:26:26:72:309:530:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:of pupils to get a predicted WADA for each district.33
29:733:67172:26:26:72:201:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:E.  The Estimating Equations
29:734:67200:26:26:108:500:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We estimate the effects of Robin Hood's parameters using straightforward regressions of
29:735:67287:26:26:72:523:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts' property values and spending on the parameters listed above, district indicators, and districts'
29:736:67394:26:26:72:522:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predicted property values (which summarize all of the other influences on property values).  We use a
29:737:67495:26:32:72:431:400:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:log-log specification, except that we do not log because it is a share.  The estimating34
29:738:67583:32:26:72:314:368:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equations for property values and school spending are:
29:739:67637:26:78:527:540:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2)
29:740:67640:78:177:527:540:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(3)
30:741:67645:177:13:114:114:87:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In fact, we tested the hypothesis that the coefficients on the two  interactions were the same and35
30:742:67746:13:0:72:190:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:rejected it at the 0.0001 level.
30:743:67778:0:26:72:516:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where  is the predicted property value based on equation (1).  We let the coefficient on the
30:744:67870:26:28:72:520:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal tax price depend on whether a district's revenues are being confiscated () or matched
30:745:67964:28:28:72:526:606:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:() by the state.  We expect the coefficients on both  interactions to be negative, but, for the
30:746:68059:28:26:72:520:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reasons we noted above, we expect the coefficient to be larger in absolute value if revenues are being
30:747:68161:26:25:72:132:552:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:confiscated.  We expect positive coefficients on the virtual grants.  In the property value equation, we35
30:748:68267:25:26:72:538:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expect a positive coefficient on  because, intuitively, it indicates the return to investments that
30:749:68366:26:26:72:512:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:raise property value.  We do not, however, have a clear prediction for the sign on  in the
30:750:68456:26:26:72:502:475:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending equation.  A low value of  insulates a district's spending from variation in its
30:751:68545:26:26:72:493:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property values, but the effect of such insulation on a district's level of spending is not obvious.
30:752:68645:26:26:108:528:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Below, we will see that simple figures establish the basic consequences of Robin Hood.  What,
30:753:68738:26:26:72:513:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then, is the additional value of regression analysis?  Regression estimates reveal detail in a way that
30:754:68841:26:26:72:517:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:figures cannot.  Moreover, they generally show the trade-offs inherent in school finance systems and
30:755:68941:26:26:72:539:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could be used to predict the effects of other states' schemes.  Although we do not claim to estimate a fully
30:756:69049:26:26:72:536:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:structural model, the parameters that describe the budget constraints imposed by Robin Hood are derived
30:757:69152:26:26:72:536:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from theory, our measures of them are very accurate, and our specifications are reasonable if the demand
30:758:69256:26:26:72:536:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for school spending has a Cobb-Douglas or similar form.  Our simulated instrumental variables estimates
30:759:69359:26:25:72:539:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:represent treatment-on-the-treated effects of the parameters.  Our reduced-form estimates are also useful. 
30:760:69465:25:26:72:527:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If another state were to design a school finance plan under the naive belief that no capitalization would
30:761:69570:26:26:72:530:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:occur, we would get the most accurate predictions of the plan's effect if we combined our reduced-form
30:762:69672:26:55:72:367:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates with the state's naive projections of its plans' parameters.
31:763:69744:55:12:114:113:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We also have data on a very large sample of individual house sale transactions covering the late 1980s36
31:764:69850:12:11:72:539:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:through today.  So far, we have merely used the data to confirm that assessed values reflect market values.  We could
31:765:69967:11:12:72:537:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:also use the data to see whether house consumption reacts in predictable ways.  Are people less likely to build onto a
31:766:70085:12:0:72:278:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:house in a district that faces recapture, for instance?
31:767:70140:0:25:282:330:685:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:VII.  Data
31:768:70150:25:26:108:535:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:All of our data are either administrative or census data.  Most data are from the Texas Education

31:770:70347:26:26:72:507:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are the data used to generate each district's actual aid.  The files contain the information we use on
31:771:70449:26:26:72:530:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assessed property values, pupils, WADA, property tax rates, foundation grants, recapture, and so on.  In
31:772:70553:26:26:72:530:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:addition, we use districts expenditure data from the Academic Excellence Indicator System files (Texas

31:774:70742:26:26:72:523:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Comptroller's annual Property Value Study to determine whether assessed and market property values
31:775:70840:26:26:72:376:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:correspond (Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, various years).  Finally, we make minor use of36
31:776:70938:26:26:72:523:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:census data and energy price data:  United States Department of Commerce (1983, 2003, 2003, 2004),

31:778:71124:26:26:108:539:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:On the whole, data are not an issue in this study.  The administrative data are comprehensive, and
31:779:71222:26:26:72:529:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:errors in the data are unlikely because they would have been costly to some party.  In any case, because
31:780:71326:26:25:72:525:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we are using the actual data that were used to generate aid, it is likely that the state and districts would
31:781:71434:25:53:72:347:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have responded to erroneous data as though they were correct.

31:783:71561:25:26:108:533:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this section, we show the before-after differences in Texas' school finance parameters for two
31:784:71658:26:26:72:520:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exemplary districts and districts categorized by their property-richness.  Texas has 1031 conventional
31:785:71760:26:26:72:513:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school districts –too many to show individually.  The ideal "before" year is the 1988-89 school year
31:786:71860:26:0:72:526:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because it precedes any attempt by the state to respond to the Edgewood case.  It does not matter much
32:787:71964:0:12:114:113:216:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:   During the 1992-93 and 1993-94 school years, a peculiar formula was used that was quickly found37
32:788:72064:12:12:72:495:204:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:unconstitutional.  The formula involved grouping Texas school districts in County Education Districts and
32:789:72169:12:12:72:534:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:redistributing some funds within the groups.  From our point of view, this formula is an unnecessary detour between
32:790:72284:12:12:72:511:180:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the old formula and the Robin Hood formula.  Robin Hood is an adaptation of the old formula, not the County
32:791:72391:12:11:72:537:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Education District formula, which was wholly discarded after its short "life."  Because the County Education District
32:792:72508:11:12:72:528:157:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:formula was found to be unconstitutional quite quickly, it would not have changed expectations much or generated
32:793:72620:12:24:72:153:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:much capitalization.
32:794:72640:24:12:114:113:121:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In this and the following paragraphs, money amounts are in 2002 dollars, adjusted using Bureau of Labor38
32:795:72747:12:23:72:205:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Statistics, Consumer Price Index.
32:796:72780:23:12:114:113:86:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  See Calabreze and Epple (2004) for an explanation of why 0.08 is a reasonable factor for converting39
32:797:72883:12:0:72:273:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:property values into annualized property services. 
32:798:72934:0:25:72:538:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:whether we choose 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97, or 1997-98 as an "after" year.  In the years between 1988
32:799:73036:25:26:72:517:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 1994, the structure of the foundation grant and guaranteed revenue system were in place, but the
32:800:73136:26:26:72:402:634:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:level of aid was considerably lower than they were after recapture began.37
32:801:73211:26:26:108:524:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:First consider Edgewood Independent School District and Alamo Heights Independent School
32:802:73299:26:26:72:532:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:District in Bexar County.  They are geographically neighboring districts.  The former was property-poor
32:803:73402:26:26:72:539:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(bottom 5 percent of property wealth per pupil) and the latter was property-rich (top 5 percent of property
32:804:73509:26:26:72:493:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wealth per pupil).  In 1989, as shown in the top panel of Table 1, Alamo Heights families had a
32:805:73604:26:26:72:440:504:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:significantly higher median income ($53,078) than Edgewood families ($22,945).  In 1988-99, Alamo38
32:806:73703:26:26:72:537:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Heights had a property tax rate of 12.4 mils, and Edgewood had a property tax rate of 9.8 mils.  By 1997,
32:807:73808:26:26:72:523:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:both districts' property tax rates had hit the cap of 15 mils.  15 mils may not sound like a high tax rate,
32:808:73915:26:26:72:522:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but this is because it is expressed as a share of an asset price.  It we convert it into a tax on annualized
32:809:74023:26:26:72:511:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property services , we can compare its magnitude to that of other taxes.  A 15 mil tax on property is
32:810:74124:26:26:72:359:374:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:approximately a 19 percent tax on annualized housing services.  A 19 percent tax rate is not low relative39
32:811:74231:26:25:72:234:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to taxes on other goods and services.
32:812:74268:25:26:108:491:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Now examine the bottom panel of Table 1, which shows school finance parameters for
32:813:74350:26:26:72:530:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Edgewood and Alamo Heights, with both the intended "after Robin Hood" parameters and the ones that
32:814:74448:26:185:72:534:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actually evolved.  Any differences between the intended and actual parameters are due to capitalization. 
33:815:74554:185:12:114:113:86:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Of course, the reverse was equally true.  If the staff engaged in some activity that caused property values40
33:816:74665:12:0:72:514:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:and thus property tax revenues to fall, the district only experienced 33 cents on the dollar of the consequences. 
33:817:74779:0:25:72:537:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Edgewood's marginal tax price fell from 1 in 1988-89 to 0.11 in 1997-98 (that is, the district only paid 11
33:818:74886:25:26:72:526:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cents on the dollar for marginal spending).  Its intended and actual marginal tax price were the same in
33:819:74990:26:26:72:516:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1997-98, implying that little capitalization occurred (a fact we demonstrate shortly).   The lump sum
33:820:75091:26:26:72:531:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfer to Edgewood was $3,187 before Robin Hood and about $3,732 after Robin Hood (intended and
33:821:75188:26:26:72:526:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual are similar).  Notice that Robin Hood raised Edgewood's lump sum transfer by a relatively small
33:822:75290:26:26:72:515:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:amount (17 percent), but reduced Edgewood's marginal tax price ninefold.  The  variable
33:823:75377:26:26:72:530:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shows that, even before Robin Hood, Edgewood's staff could not raise their school budget much if their
33:824:75479:26:26:72:523:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:efforts raised property values in the district.  For every dollar of extra tax revenue generated by higher
33:825:75585:26:26:72:263:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:property values, Edgewood kept 33 cents.  After Robin Hood, Edgewood kept zero cents of extra tax40
33:826:75684:26:26:72:274:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue generated by higher property values. 
33:827:75728:26:26:108:533:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Before Robin Hood, Alamo Heights had an marginal tax price of 1, meaning that it paid a dollar
33:828:75822:26:26:72:510:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in taxes to spend a dollar.  If no capitalization had occurred, Robin Hood would have raised Alamo
33:829:75920:26:26:72:485:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Heights's marginal tax price to 2.56.  Because of substantial negative capitalization (a fact we
33:830:76016:26:25:72:528:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demonstrate shortly), its marginal tax price increased to 1.39 (the district paid $1.39 in taxes to spend a
33:831:76123:25:26:72:527:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dollar).  Alamo Heights got no lump sum transfer before Robin Hood, but in 1997-98 it could maintain
33:832:76223:26:26:72:507:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:its pre-Robin Hood per-pupil spending only by putting $3,573 per student into the state's recapture
33:833:76322:26:26:72:487:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system.  If capitalization had not occurred, much more ($15,041 per student) would have been
33:834:76414:26:26:72:513:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:confiscated.  Finally, before Robin Hood, Alamo Heights staff could raise their schools' budget by a
33:835:76514:26:26:72:514:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dollar that if their efforts raised an extra dollar of tax revenue through higher property values.  After
33:836:76619:26:26:72:518:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood, Alamo Heights kept zero cents of every extra tax dollar from changing property values.
33:837:76717:26:70:108:509:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Having looked at two specific districts, we now show, in Table 2, parameters of the school
34:838:76809:70:11:114:113:97:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  The quantiles and statistics in Table 2 are pupil-weighted.  That is, each of the 20 quantiles contains41
34:839:76916:11:12:72:539:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:approximately five percent of the Texas pupil population. Quantiles 15 and 16 cannot be separated because Houston,
34:840:77030:12:0:72:282:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:a district with very large enrollment, straddles them. 
34:841:77085:0:25:72:348:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:finance system for 20 property-wealth-per-WADA quantiles.  We show only the actual "after Robin41
34:842:77182:25:26:72:513:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hood" parameters.  We do not show the intended parameters simply because they would force us to
34:843:77277:26:26:72:497:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discuss capitalization prematurely:  we prefer to show the facts on capitalization first.  The most
34:844:77376:26:26:72:521:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:noteworthy changes in budget constraints occur at the two ends of the property wealth spectrum.  The
34:845:77476:26:26:72:505:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-poorest quantiles experience very large negative changes in their marginal tax prices and
34:846:77574:26:26:72:531:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relatively small positive changes in their lump sum transfers.  The property-richest quantiles experience
34:847:77679:26:26:72:526:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:positive changes in their marginal tax prices and substantial recapture.  In short, Edgewood and Alamo
34:848:77781:26:26:72:384:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Heights are fairly typical of the bottom and top quantiles, respectively.
34:849:77854:26:26:108:528:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 3 shows how the recapture threshold fell over time in real terms, from about $340,000 in
34:850:77948:26:26:72:542:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1994 to $305,000 in 2002.  Because the threshold fell, more districts were swept into the recapture group. 
34:851:78054:26:26:72:537:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In 1994, recapture districts accounted for only 5.1 percent of students.  By 2002, 10.3 percent of students
34:852:78161:26:26:72:510:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were enrolled in recapture districts.  Moreover, the predicted enrollment numbers suggest that 22.3
34:853:78260:26:26:72:539:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent of all Texas students would now be in recapture districts if they had not been deterred from living
34:854:78367:26:25:72:531:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in them by the Robin Hood scheme.  Table 3 demonstrates that Texas has been changing the parameters
34:855:78466:25:26:72:493:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the system in an apparent effort to fill a perennial shortage of revenue.  Below, we show that
34:856:78563:26:52:72:315:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization did likely cause such a revenue shortage.

34:858:78655:26:26:108:521:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We now turn to the capitalization consequences of Robin Hood, using figures to illustrate the

34:861:78866:26:55:108:525:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figures 9 through 11 show the predicted and actual property tax bases for the property-poorest

35:864:79117:0:25:72:521:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts (quantile 1), intermediate (quantile 10), and property-richest (quantile 20) districts in Texas. 
35:865:79224:25:26:72:515:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Observe that the three figures all have the same scale:  the vertical distance on the figures represents
35:866:79328:26:26:72:523:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$300,000 per pupil.  Figure 9 shows that, in the property-poorest districts, the actual property tax base
35:867:79433:26:26:72:532:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:roughly kept pace with the predicted base, suggesting that little or no capitalization occurred.  Figure 10
35:868:79540:26:26:72:502:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shows that intermediate districts like those in quantile 10 experienced a small amount of negative
35:869:79638:26:26:72:530:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization –about $12,500 per pupil– after Robin Hood.  The negative capitalization begins in about
35:870:79741:26:26:72:521:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1990 and grows through 1994, after which the negative capitalization holds steady.  This time pattern
35:871:79842:26:26:72:495:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:makes sense because school finance laws began affecting intermediate districts in 1989 and had
35:872:79936:26:26:72:539:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasing effects on them through 1994, when Robin Hood was enacted and the law became stable so far
35:873:80037:26:26:72:514:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as they were concerned.  Note that the appearance of negative capitalization does not depend on our
35:874:80136:26:26:72:529:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:having generated an overly optimistic forecast:  their actual property value per pupil fell.  Keep in mind
35:875:80241:26:26:72:519:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that this decline occurred during a decade of robust economic growth in Texas and the United States.
35:876:80341:26:26:108:537:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 11 shows that property-rich districts like those in quantile 20 experienced very substantial
35:877:80440:26:25:72:522:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative capitalization, beginning in 1993-94 and growing thereafter, with no signs of slowing down. 
35:878:80540:25:26:72:491:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This timing makes sense.  Recapture began in 1993-94, although Robin Hood was not declared
35:879:80630:26:26:72:525:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constitutional until 1994.  The real recapture threshold fell in nearly every subsequent year, raising the
35:880:80736:26:26:72:499:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recapture burden for districts already in the recapture system and sweeping new districts into the
35:881:80834:26:26:72:538:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recapture system.  Admittedly, some of the appearance of negative capitalization in Figure 11 depends on
35:882:80938:26:26:72:530:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our prediction that property values should have risen over the 1990s, but it is well known that the 1990s
35:883:81043:26:26:72:529:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were a period of unusually rapid income growth for the wealthy.  The median income of  households in
35:884:81143:26:0:72:507:167:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:the top quantile districts grew by 20 percent between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses of Population. 42
36:885:81242:0:11:114:114:168:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Oil prices were rather steady through 1995, but had risen by more than 30 percent by 2001.  Natural gas43
36:886:81349:11:24:72:507:157:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:prices were steady through 1998, but had nearly doubled by 2001.  See United States Department of Energy. 
36:887:81455:24:24:114:114:133:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  These figures are available from the authors. 44
36:888:81505:24:12:114:114:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  For reasons of space, we do not show individual districts' fixed effects or the coefficient on the predicted45
36:889:81617:12:11:72:515:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:property tax base, which (by construction) functions as a sufficient statistic for factors that systemically affect a
36:890:81734:11:12:72:530:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:district's tax base and generates a coefficient very close to one.  Indeed, we can restrict it to be equal to one and the
36:891:81855:12:0:72:202:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:other coefficients hardly change.
36:892:81888:0:25:72:397:685:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:Moreover, oil and natural gas prices rose substantially in the late 1990s.  Nevertheless, Figure 11 shows43
36:893:81995:25:26:72:525:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that actual property value per pupil fell in nominal dollars in quantile 20 districts.  Even if one thought
36:894:82101:26:26:72:521:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that our prediction of property values in quantile 20 districts is overly optimistic (and we do not think
36:895:82206:26:26:72:510:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that it is, given that it is growing no faster than household income and more slowly than oil and gas
36:896:82307:26:26:72:534:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prices), it would be hard not to conclude that Robin Hood had caused substantial negative capitalization.
36:897:82412:26:26:108:537:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Readers may be interested to note that Figures 9 through 11 would look much the same if we had
36:898:82506:26:26:72:439:530:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:shown aggregate property values, rather than aggregate property values per pupil.  In other words, it is44
36:899:82612:26:26:72:445:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:changes in property values, not changes in pupils, that dictate the shape of each line.

36:901:82774:26:26:108:539:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 4 shows how Robin Hood's parameters generated capitalization, displaying the coefficients
36:902:82869:26:26:72:207:426:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:of interest from equation (2).  Before examining the coefficients of interest, however, observe that they45
36:903:82976:26:26:72:523:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explain the data very well.  Figures 12 and 13 repeats the comparison of actual and predicted property
36:904:83078:26:26:72:507:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values without Robin Hood that we previously showed in Figures 9 through 11.  We also add lines
36:905:83173:26:25:72:497:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:showing the predicted property values with Robin Hood.  Figures 12 and 13 are produced using,
36:906:83266:25:26:72:506:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respectively, the simulated instrumental variables and reduced-form estimates in Table 4.  Even in
36:907:83364:26:26:72:537:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile 20, which has dramatic changes in capitalization, the estimates do a good job of explaining  why
36:908:83469:26:26:72:532:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual property values diverged from the path they were predicted to take in the absence of Robin Hood.
36:909:83572:26:26:108:519:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 4 shows that, in property-rich districts that experience an increase in their marginal tax
36:910:83668:26:110:72:527:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prices, property values fall by 24.8 percent for every doubling of marginal tax prices.  For instance, the
37:911:83776:110:12:114:113:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  That is, we need variation in the virtual lump sum grants that driven by changes in foundation grants, not46
37:912:83886:12:11:72:517:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:driven by changes in the slope of the budget constraints shown in Figures 1 through 8.  Changes in the slope are
37:913:83998:11:12:72:539:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:changes associated with marginal tax prices, and we need to have variation in the virtual grants that is independent of
37:914:84117:12:0:72:400:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:variation in marginal tax prices if we are to distinguish the roles of the parameters.
37:915:84203:0:25:72:520:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal tax prices of districts in quantile 20 rose from 1 to 1.75 (0.56 natural log points), implying a
37:916:84308:25:26:72:505:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decline in property values of about 13.9 percent from this parameter's effect.  The next coefficient
37:917:84408:26:26:72:529:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggests that, in property-poor districts that experience a decrease in their marginal tax prices, property
37:918:84515:26:26:72:513:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values rise by 5.36 percent for every halving of their marginal tax prices.  The typical property-poor
37:919:84617:26:26:72:522:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(quantile 1) district saw its  marginal tax price fall from 1 to 0.14 (1.97 natural log points), implying a
37:920:84724:26:26:72:508:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rise in property values of 11.8 percent.  The coefficient on the virtual lump sum grant suggests that
37:921:84825:26:26:72:506:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:doubling it would raise property values by only 0.6 percent.  While a small capitalization effect of
37:922:84925:26:26:72:535:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:foundation grants is consistent with evidence in Hoxby (2001), it must also be admitted that Robin Hood
37:923:85028:26:26:72:534:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generated such modest variation in foundation grants that it is not a good application for estimating their
37:924:85135:26:26:72:111:452:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:effects.  The coefficient on  is 0.1489.   fell by 0.33 for property-poor districts in46
37:925:85223:26:26:72:530:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile 1, implying a 5 percent decrease in property values.  It fell by 0.67 for property-rich districts in
37:926:85332:26:26:72:350:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile 20, implying a 10 percent decrease in property values.
37:927:85395:26:26:108:500:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Comparing the columns of Table 4, we see that the reduced-form estimates are generally
37:928:85481:26:25:72:528:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attenuated versions of the simulated instrumented variables estimates.  This is exactly what we expect. 
37:929:85585:25:26:72:534:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The intention-to-treat estimates suggest that parameters are less efficacious because they include the fact
37:930:85692:26:26:72:429:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that capitalization waters down the intended effect of the school finance scheme.
37:931:85773:26:26:108:536:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Summing up, we expect property-rich (quantile 20) districts' property values to have fallen by 24
37:932:85870:26:26:72:530:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent (about $246,000 per pupil), expect the property-poorest (quantile 1) districts' property values to
37:933:85976:26:26:72:521:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rise by about 6.8 percent (about $4,700 per pupil), and expect intermediate outcomes for intermediate
37:934:86077:26:26:72:534:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts.  For instance, we expect a 4.6 percent decline in property values for quantile 10 districts (about
37:935:86186:26:58:72:536:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$12,600 per pupil).  Considering that the estimates are for an average "after Robin Hood" year, while the
38:936:86293:58:11:114:113:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In particular, the property-rich districts have lost about $246,000 per pupil in an average "after" year but47
38:937:86405:11:24:72:305:98:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:about $290,000 per pupil by the last "after" year we show.
38:938:86463:24:0:114:114:74:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  If the payout rate were five percent real or about eight percent nominal, the amount would be $300,820. 48
38:939:86571:0:25:72:529:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:figures show changing dynamics, the estimates very correspond well to the graphs, except that Figure 9
38:940:86673:25:26:72:477:660:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:evidently masks a small amount of positive capitalization in the property-poorest districts.47
38:941:86767:26:26:108:514:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Aggregating over all districts' gains and losses in property values, our estimates suggest that
38:942:86862:26:26:72:538:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood caused Texas to lose a net of $27,000 per pupil in property wealth.  The best estimate would
38:943:86965:26:26:72:529:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actually vary by year and is between $20,728 and $33,495 in property wealth per pupil, with later years
38:944:87068:26:26:72:247:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generally associated with higher losses.
38:945:87108:26:26:72:296:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C.  Understanding the Capitalization that Occurred
38:946:87158:26:26:108:506:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We have seen that negative capitalization of approximately $290,000 per pupil apparently
38:947:87246:26:26:72:528:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:occurred in quantile 20 districts.  This may seem like a large number, but recall the numbers for Alamo
38:948:87349:26:26:72:510:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Heights to see that it is reasonable, given the intended recapture.  Robin Hood intended that Alamo
38:949:87448:26:26:72:518:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Heights should pay $15,041 per student every year.  If the district were to endow permanent $15,041
38:950:87547:26:26:72:370:400:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:scholarships, it would cost the district at least $300,000 per pupil.  Robin Hood essentially attached the48
38:951:87655:26:26:72:521:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obligation to fund just such scholarships to every property in Alamo Heights.  Thus, we should not be
38:952:87756:26:25:72:521:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:surprised to find that properties which were worth $X per pupil before Robin Hood were worth about
38:953:87854:25:26:72:160:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$X-290,000 after it.
38:954:87874:26:26:108:537:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Such losses of property wealth had serious consequences for the stability of Robin Hood because
38:955:87969:26:26:72:537:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile 20 districts were disproportionately responsible for putting dollars into the state aid system.  It is
38:956:88080:26:26:72:516:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:no wonder that, with their property tax bases falling in response to Robin Hood, the state would find
38:957:88181:26:26:72:419:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:itself perennially disappointed about the revenue captured from these districts.
38:958:88261:26:26:108:507:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We are not surprised by substantial negative capitalization of Robin Hood in property-rich
38:959:88351:26:0:72:525:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:districts, but why is there so little positive capitalization in property-poor districts that Texas had a net
39:960:88461:0:25:72:259:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loss $27,000 in property wealth per pupil?
39:961:88503:25:26:108:534:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There are two possible explanations, which are not mutually exclusive.  We have already argued
39:962:88597:26:26:72:518:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that capitalization can be highly asymmetric because property-poor districts have incentives to spend
39:963:88698:26:26:72:536:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:money even if their residents value it at much less than a dollar per dollar spent.  Put another way, Robin
39:964:88805:26:26:72:533:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hood may have made much more revenue available to property-poor districts, but the value they created
39:965:88906:26:26:72:521:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the revenue may have been insufficient to substantially increase household demand to live in the
39:966:89007:26:26:72:519:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts.  It is demand, not school spending per se that bids up property prices.  Second, it is possible
39:967:89113:26:26:72:518:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that, even if demand increased substantially, the supply of vacant or low-use agricultural land was so
39:968:89215:26:26:72:526:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:great in property-poor districts that prices were bid up only slightly.  In other words, their supply curve
39:969:89322:26:26:72:215:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for residential land is rather flat.
39:970:89358:26:26:108:537:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We cannot directly test the first explanation (if feasible, it would require a separate study), so we
39:971:89459:26:26:72:498:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leave it as the residual explanation.  However, we should be able to see clear signs of the second
39:972:89557:26:26:72:535:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explanation.  Property-poor districts should disproportionately convert land to residential use and should
39:973:89663:26:25:72:527:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have disproportionate growth of housing units.  (We say "disproportionate" because there will be some
39:974:89764:25:26:72:523:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:land conversion and new housing in all districts, simply because Texas' overall population grew in the
39:975:89866:26:26:72:503:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1990s.)  In Appendix Figures 1 through 3, we examine property use in the 1990s.  We see a small
39:976:89961:26:26:72:534:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percentage of land converted to residential use in all districts, but see no sign that property-poor districts
39:977:90071:26:26:72:377:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:converted land any faster than intermediate or property-rich districts.
39:978:90142:26:26:108:526:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also regressed the decadal changes in districts' housing units on the decadal changes in the

39:980:90343:26:26:72:529:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicators for their property wealth quantile, and, most importantly, indicators for their property wealth
39:981:90449:26:26:72:536:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile interacted with the indicator the decade being the 1990s (the Robin Hood period).   Specifically,
39:982:90555:26:26:72:147:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the regression is:
39:983:90573:26:0:463:466:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:,
40:984:90576:0:11:114:114:144:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  In other words, until the recapture threshold fell significantly and swept them into recapture in the late49
40:985:90686:11:12:72:526:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:1990s, a fair number of districts in quantile 19 were unaffected by Robin Hood.  Not surprisingly, households that
40:986:90800:12:12:72:532:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:might otherwise have moved into quantile 20 districts (all of which experienced recapture) may have built homes in
40:987:90914:12:12:72:353:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:quantile 19 districts, generating the result we see in Appendix Table 1.
40:988:90986:12:11:108:526:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:  In Appendix Table 1, the coefficient for the property-poorest districts (quantile 1) is a positive 0.11, but
40:989:91096:11:12:72:537:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:we cannot make much of this since it is not significant at any conventional statistical level and the coefficients for all
40:990:91218:12:0:72:259:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the other property-poor quantiles are negative. 
40:991:91266:0:25:72:507:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where if t is 1990, then t-1 is 1980; and if t 2000, then t-1 is 1990.  If property-poor districts added
40:992:91366:25:26:72:539:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:housing units disproportionately after Robin Hood, then the coefficients on their interaction terms will be
40:993:91473:26:26:72:532:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:positive and statistically significantly different from zero.  In fact, Appendix Table 1 shows that none of
40:994:91580:26:26:72:520:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the interaction terms has a coefficient that is statistically significantly different from zero, except that
40:995:91688:26:26:72:507:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile 19 has a positive coefficient that is marginally significant at the 10 percent level.  In other
40:996:91792:26:26:72:497:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:words, disproportionately high growth in housing units in the 1990s occurred only in the second
40:997:91887:26:26:72:513:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-richest group of districts –probably because most of these districts that were unaffected by
40:998:91988:26:26:72:538:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood for much of the 1990s (too property-rich to participate in the guaranteed revenue system and
40:999:92091:26:26:72:357:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:too property-poor to experience recapture until the late 1990s).49
40:1000:92157:26:26:108:504:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In short, neither the land conversion evidence nor the housing units evidence supports the
40:1001:92247:26:26:72:523:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hypothesis that demand for homes in the property-poor districts grew substantially.  Demand for these
40:1002:92348:26:26:72:514:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts apparently failed to increase; it is not merely that the supply of residential property in these
40:1003:92454:26:26:72:531:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts was highly elastic.  We conclude that Robin Hood generated only a little positive capitalization
40:1004:92560:26:25:72:414:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in property-poor districts because their value to residents rose only by a little.
40:1005:92642:25:26:108:486:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The capitalization result that surprised us was the consistent pattern of small negative
40:1006:92730:26:26:72:519:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalization in intermediate districts like those in quantile 10 (quantiles 7 through 13 look similar). 
40:1007:92836:26:26:72:530:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These intermediate districts experienced a negligible change in their net foundation aid, lower marginal
40:1008:92940:26:26:72:536:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax prices, and no recapture because they were insufficiently property-rich to hit the recapture threshold. 
40:1009:93048:26:26:72:522:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The one parameter that significantly worsened for such districts was .  That is, after Robin
40:1010:93139:26:84:72:511:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hood, if staff effort raised property values, the district simply paid more property taxes:  the school
41:1011:93244:84:12:114:113:109:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  The technical descriptions of the computations suggest to us that they are highly reliable.  The sampling50
41:1012:93353:12:11:72:516:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:is too detailed to describe here, but suffice it to say that the comptroller collects a value-stratified sample that is
41:1013:93472:11:12:72:532:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:sufficiently large to produce a 95 percent confidence interval of length 0.1 in each school district.  That is, a typical
41:1014:93593:12:0:72:392:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:95 percent confidence interval is 0.95-1.05 around a mean assessment ratio of 1.
41:1015:93673:0:25:72:531:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:budget did not benefit at all.  We hypothesize that, by eliminating an incentive device, Robin Hood may
41:1016:93776:25:26:72:514:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have decreased the value of schools, thereby generating a small amount of negative capitalization in

41:1019:93938:26:26:108:520:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:So far, we have examined assessed property values, but it is possible that the capitalization is
41:1020:94034:26:26:72:523:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more fictional than real.  That is, it is possible that only the assessed or book values of property fell in
41:1021:94142:26:26:72:504:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Texas, not the market values.  On the other hand, the state has an incentive to prevent variation in
41:1022:94242:26:26:72:533:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assessment practices, which could undermine its system of aid, causing it to give disproportionate aid to
41:1023:94347:26:26:72:526:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts with underassessed property values.  In an effort to monitor its county-based assessors, Texas'
41:1024:94452:26:26:72:517:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Comptroller annually computes a ratio of assessed to market value for each school district, basing its
41:1025:94554:26:26:72:413:426:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:computation on a sample of all property sales that occurred during the year.50
41:1026:94632:26:26:108:525:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Figures 14 through 17, we use the ratios of assessed-to-market value from the Comptroller's
41:1027:94726:26:26:72:524:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:annual studies to investigate whether Robin Hood affected market property values, or merely assessed
41:1028:94826:26:25:72:507:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values.  Figure 14 shows average assessment ratios from 1988 to 2001 for all of the major types of
41:1029:94924:25:26:72:528:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property in Texas:  single family homes, multiple family homes, vacant property, commercial property,
41:1030:95025:26:26:72:518:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:utilities property, and minerals property (which includes oil and gas property).  We see no trend over
41:1031:95127:26:26:72:529:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time toward underassessment.  Instead, we see assessment ratios trending toward one, for all categories
41:1032:95230:26:26:72:533:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of property, suggesting the Comptroller's monitoring has succeeded in bringing assessed values into line
41:1033:95334:26:26:72:523:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with market values.  It is not surprising to see evidence of increased scrutiny during a period when the
41:1034:95438:26:26:72:334:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state's level of intervention in school finance has increased.
41:1035:95500:26:0:108:519:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Figures 15 through 17 (which are all on the same scale as Figure 14), we show assessment
42:1036:95593:0:25:72:535:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ratios by property wealth quantile for single family homes, commercial property, and minerals property. 
42:1037:95697:25:26:72:534:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These figures would allow us to spot a trend toward underassessment in, say, property-rich (quantile 20)
42:1038:95801:26:26:72:517:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school districts, even if assessment ratios in other districts were close to one.  We see no evidence of
42:1039:95905:26:26:72:532:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trends toward underassessment in any quantile.  Indeed, assessed values of all types, in all quantiles, are
42:1040:96012:26:52:72:246:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasingly in line with market values.

42:1042:96088:26:26:108:533:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We now briefly investigate how Robin Hood affected property tax rates, disability classification
42:1043:96184:26:26:72:208:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Texas, and school spending.
42:1044:96214:26:26:72:344:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A.  The Consequences of Robin Hood for Property Tax Rates
42:1045:96271:26:26:108:502:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We predicted above that Robin Hood would affect property tax rates.  The property-poor
42:1046:96357:26:26:72:515:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts had incentives to raise their tax rates because each dollar they raised allowed them to spend
42:1047:96460:26:26:72:535:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:multiple dollars.  Indeed, property-poor districts had to raise their property tax rates in order to get much
42:1048:96569:26:25:72:525:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:aid from Robin Hood because the scheme gave them only modest increases in their foundation aid and
42:1049:96667:25:26:72:535:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:made it impossible for their budgets to rise with their property values.  Figure 18 shows that the tax rates
42:1050:96775:26:26:72:532:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of property-poor districts did rise.  We see that the property-poorest districts (quantile 1) raised their tax
42:1051:96885:26:26:72:510:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates from about 12 mils to 14.2 mils following the full implementation of Robin Hood in 1994-95.
42:1052:96982:26:26:108:517:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 18 shows that intermediate districts (quantile 10) also experienced rising property tax
42:1053:97076:26:26:72:522:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates.  Recall that, with Robin Hood, these districts experienced lower marginal tax prices and a small
42:1054:97179:26:26:72:532:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:amount of negative capitalization.  The predictable consequence was that they chose higher property tax
42:1055:97282:26:26:72:528:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates.  In 1991, their average tax rate was 12.6 mils.  After 1994, it hovered between 14 and 14.7 mils.  
42:1056:97388:26:26:108:532:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However, it is the property-rich districts that experienced the steepest rise in property tax rates. 
42:1057:97489:26:26:72:464:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 18 shows that, immediately after the recapture system started, their tax rates rose 
42:1058:97579:26:0:72:504:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from 12.5 mils to 14 mils.  However, because the state kept reducing the recapture threshold in its

43:1060:97783:12:11:72:351:144:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:WADA raise the multipliers that generate a district's foundation grant.
43:1061:97854:11:12:108:511:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:We classify a district as having mild incentives to raise the WADA/pupil ratio if its only benefit from
43:1062:97957:12:12:72:535:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:raising WADA is getting greater foundation aid.  We use the following rule to find such districts:  a district must not
43:1063:98076:12:12:72:508:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:not receive guaranteed revenue aid; must not be able to get guaranteed revenue aid by raising its WADA by 5
43:1064:98183:12:11:72:515:97:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:percent; must not experience recapture; and must not be put into recapture status by an 5 percent decrease in its
43:1065:98296:11:12:72:535:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:WADA.  That is, we find districts that are not only in the gap between the guaranteed revenue and recapture system,
43:1066:98411:12:0:72:319:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:but also a little distance from the thresholds for those systems.

43:1068:98583:25:26:72:508:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending (setting off yet another round of capitalization!).  They are now at the 15 mil cap, and we
43:1069:98683:26:26:72:529:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cannot say how high their rates might be in the absence of the cap.  In anything, Figure 18 suggests that
43:1070:98788:26:26:72:529:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their rates would still be rising.   These districts literally cannot spend anything more per WADA:  they
43:1071:98892:26:26:72:518:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cannot raise their tax rates; they cannot derive higher budgets from rising property values because all
43:1072:98995:26:26:72:523:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal revenue from that source is captured.  Raising the ratio of their WADA to pupils is their sole
43:1073:99098:26:26:72:249:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:means of obtaining additional spending.

43:1075:99219:26:26:108:518:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The Robin Hood system is based on property wealth per WADA.  Thus, every district has an
43:1076:99307:26:26:72:517:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incentive to raise its ratio of WADA to pupils to minimize its "book" wealth.  As just seen, however,
43:1077:99408:26:26:72:505:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:raising WADA is the sole means by which property-rich districts at the cap can raise spending.  A
43:1078:99505:26:26:72:490:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-poor district has incentives to raise WADA because it makes both foundation aid and
43:1079:99597:26:26:72:537:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:guaranteed revenue aid more generous.  A small number of "gap" districts have only very mild incentives
43:1080:99700:26:25:72:525:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to raise WADA because they are too property-rich to receive guaranteed revenue aid and too property-
43:1081:99800:25:26:72:522:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poor to experience recapture.  In such districts, the costs associated with reclassifying a student might
43:1082:99905:26:26:72:408:297:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:easily offset the only benefit of higher WADA:  a higher foundation grant.51
43:1083:99981:26:26:108:538:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 19 shows that the WADA/pupil ratio of quantile 1 (property-poor) districts rose from 1.36
43:1084:100077:26:26:72:521:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 1.42.  The WADA/pupil ratios of quantile 20 (property-rich) districts rose much more:  from 1.3 to
43:1085:100178:26:26:72:524:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1.62.  If it were not for Robin Hood's incentives, such WADA/pupil ratios would be very surprising in
43:1086:100279:26:107:72:505:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relatively affluent districts.  The WADA/pupil ratios of districts with only mild incentives to raise

44:1088:100487:12:0:72:120:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:school year.
44:1089:100499:0:25:72:449:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:WADA did not change much over the period:  they hovered in the range around 1.27.
44:1090:100580:25:26:108:511:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This evidence strongly suggests that districts responded to Robin Hood's incentives to raise
44:1091:100672:26:26:72:527:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:WADA.  It confirms Cullen's (2003) study of disability classification in Texas.  The main consequence
44:1092:100773:26:26:72:533:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of WADA "inflation" is probably distortions in how students are taught.  Although WADA inflation has
44:1093:100873:26:26:72:515:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consequences for the stability of school finance in Texas, they are less than one might think because
44:1094:100974:26:26:72:512:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nearly all districts are simultaneously inflating WADA:  the average WADA to pupil ratio in Texas
44:1095:101071:26:26:72:539:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts rose from 1.27 in 1991 to 1.36 in 2002.  As a result, the property-rich districts are paying less per
44:1096:101182:26:26:72:537:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual student than they were intended to pay, but –offsetting this–  the property-poor districts are getting
44:1097:101291:26:26:72:314:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more per actual student than they were intended to get.

44:1099:101431:26:26:108:525:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:People often ask whether a school finance program leveled-up or leveled-down.  That is, did it
44:1100:101525:26:26:72:510:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cause average per-pupil spending in the state to rise faster or slower than it otherwise would have? 
44:1101:101626:26:26:72:533:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 20, which shows Texas' average per-pupil spending and that of a few comparison states, provides
44:1102:101728:26:25:72:521:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:one indicator of the answer.  We chose comparison states with care.  Oklahoma and Louisiana are not
44:1103:101827:25:26:72:527:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:only Texas' neighbors, but also share its dependence on the oil and gas industry.  California also has an
44:1104:101932:26:26:72:521:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:oil and gas industry, experiences much of the same immigration as Texas, and had metropolitan areas
44:1105:102031:26:26:72:535:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(like Austin, Texas) affected by the high technology boom in the 1990s.  First, note that in the pre-Robin
44:1106:102137:26:26:72:531:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hood period (1980 to 1989), Texas had the highest rate of growth in per-pupil spending among the four
44:1107:102238:26:26:72:533:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states.  Over the subsequent decade, under the influence of school finance reform (1989 to 1999), Texas'
44:1108:102342:26:26:72:493:193:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:average per-pupil spending grew at much the same pace as spending in the comparison states.  Over the52
44:1109:102445:26:26:72:536:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:briefer period of full Robin Hood implementation, from 1994 to 1999, Texas' average per-pupil spending
44:1110:102547:26:44:72:525:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:grew at the same pace as Louisiana's, very slightly faster than that of California, and faster than that of
45:1111:102656:44:11:114:113:97:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  We cannot include the 1980s in this figure because the only district-level data on per-pupil spending for53
45:1112:102765:11:12:72:520:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the 1980s are from a different source, the 1981-82 and 1986-87 Censuses of Governments.  We found these data
45:1113:102873:12:0:72:280:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:insufficiently comparable to be useful for Figure 16.
45:1114:102926:0:25:72:120:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Oklahoma.
45:1115:102935:25:26:108:512:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 21 presents two more indicators of whether Robin Hood leveled up or down:  Texas'
45:1116:103023:26:26:72:518:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:average per-pupil spending as a percentage of per-capita personal income and as a percentage of per-
45:1117:103123:26:26:72:537:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capita gross state product.  Both of these percentages rose throughout the 1980s and then remained stable
45:1118:103228:26:26:72:496:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:throughout the 1990s.  There is no sign of an increase in the percentages after Robin Hood's full
45:1119:103325:26:26:72:535:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:implementation in 1994.  In summary, Figures 20 and 21 suggest that Robin Hood neither leveled-up nor
45:1120:103426:26:26:72:490:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leveled-down.  It probably had little effect on the average level of school spending in the state.
45:1121:103524:26:26:108:503:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Of course, the primary aim of school finance schemes is reallocation of school spending. 
45:1122:103613:26:26:72:517:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Changing average spending is a secondary goal, if it is a goal at all.  In Figure 22, we show per-pupil
45:1123:103716:26:26:72:442:452:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:spending from 1991 to 2001 for property wealth quantiles 1, 5, 10, 15, 19, and 20.  There has been53
45:1124:103816:26:26:72:521:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:narrowing of the spending gap, especially among the first through the 95th percentiles of the property
45:1125:103918:26:26:72:532:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wealth distribution.  Over the decade, the coefficient of variation in per-pupil spending fell from 0.22 to
45:1126:104025:26:26:72:534:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:0.12.  The spending gap between the lowest and highest spending quantiles narrowed from about $2,200
45:1127:104125:26:25:72:525:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to about $1,800.  Note that the property-poorest quantile typically does not spend the least per pupil in
45:1128:104230:25:26:72:525:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Texas:  the lowest spending districts tend to have per-pupil property wealth between the 25th and 50th
45:1129:104332:26:26:72:118:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percentile.
45:1130:104343:26:26:108:531:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Table 5, we show regression estimates of the effects of the school finance parameters on per-
45:1131:104439:26:26:72:519:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pupil spending.  We are less interested in the individual coefficients than in their implications for the
45:1132:104544:26:26:72:527:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dispersion of school spending.  Nevertheless, examine the coefficients briefly.  The increased marginal
45:1133:104647:26:26:72:535:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax prices have little effect on property-rich districts' per-pupil spending (the point estimates are negative
45:1134:104757:26:26:72:518:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but statistically insignificant).  However, for every halving of the marginal tax price in property-poor
45:1135:104861:26:67:72:504:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:districts, per-pupil spending rises by 13.56 percent.  The coefficient on the virtual lump sum grant
46:1136:104963:67:0:114:113:74:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  Both numbers are in 2002 dollars, adjusted using the CPI.54
46:1137:105024:0:25:72:526:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggests that doubling it would raise spending by 0.9 percent, but we acknowledge that this coefficient
46:1138:105127:25:26:72:541:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may understate the true effect because Robin Hood generated such modest variation in foundation grants. 
46:1139:105231:26:26:72:533:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We are not surprised to see a negative coefficient on  (see discussion above), but we have no
46:1140:105324:26:26:72:530:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:especially good interpretation of its small but statistically significant effect.  fell by 0.33 for
46:1141:105423:26:26:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-poor districts in quantile 1, implying an 0.8 percent increase in their spending.  It fell by 0.67 for
46:1142:105534:26:26:72:456:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:property-rich districts in quantile 20, implying a 1.8 percent increase in their spending.
46:1143:105624:26:26:108:512:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Using the results shown in Table 5, we estimate that Robin Hood reduced the coefficient of
46:1144:105714:26:26:72:506:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation in per-pupil spending in Texas by 0.11 and reduced the gap between the lowest spending
46:1145:105810:26:26:72:517:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile and highest spending quantile from about $2000 to $1500 (the exact number depends on the
46:1146:105907:26:26:72:193:452:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:"after Robin Hood" year).  These summary statistics accord well with our graphical view of the54
46:1147:106003:26:52:72:308:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dispersion of per-pupil spending, shown in Figure 22.

46:1149:106126:26:25:108:532:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 6 contains summary statistics to help us see the big picture –how has Robin Hood worked
46:1150:106219:25:26:72:501:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as a school finance scheme designed to equalize school spending?  We use statistics based on the
46:1151:106315:26:26:72:527:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient estimates in Tables 4 and 5, but there is nothing mysterious about them.  They could almost
46:1152:106418:26:26:72:269:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be read off graphs like Figures 9 through 22.
46:1153:106463:26:26:108:537:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The left-hand columns show the benefits of Robin Hood:  it caused the coefficient of variation in
46:1154:106560:26:26:72:536:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per pupil spending to fall by 0.11 and caused the spending gap between the highest-spending and lowest-
46:1155:106663:26:26:72:524:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending quantile to fall by about $500.  These are not insignificant gains in school spending equality,
46:1156:106767:26:26:72:533:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but school spending was not equalized in Texas.  The middle column shows that $1,482 per pupil would
46:1157:106867:26:26:72:462:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be needed to give all schools in Texas spending equal to the highest quantile's spending.
46:1158:106956:26:0:108:535:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The right-columns in Table 6 show the costs of Robin Hood, which –interestingly– are indicated
47:1159:107052:0:25:72:501:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by aggregate capitalization.  Why is this?  Robin Hood distorts households' choices about homes,
47:1160:107148:25:26:72:521:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schools, and other consumption.  Some households undoubtedly liked their pre-Robin Hood packages
47:1161:107244:26:26:72:523:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:better; some liked their post-Robin Hood packages better.  To the extent that value is merely changing
47:1162:107346:26:26:72:530:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hands, the scheme is not costly.  Robin Hood is costly only when some households lose consumption or
47:1163:107446:26:26:72:500:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling they valued and other households do not get offsetting gains.  Because property values
47:1164:107542:26:26:72:516:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capitalize the value of services bought with taxes, aggregate capitalization automatically nets out the
47:1165:107645:26:26:72:539:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:benefits of the Robin Hood program and is an accurate measure of its costs.  (We are often asked whether
47:1166:107749:26:26:72:522:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:people who move to Texas in the future will somehow benefit from today's net negative capitalization
47:1167:107849:26:26:72:538:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because they will pay less for homes.  The answer is no.  Property values capitalize the costs and benefits
47:1168:107956:26:26:72:505:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of districts' schools.  Movers to Texas will pay less for their homes on average because the school
47:1169:108055:26:26:72:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:systems and homes will be, on average, worth less to them.  They will not be getting especially good
47:1170:108155:26:26:72:101:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deals.)
47:1171:108162:26:26:108:525:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Net losses of property wealth in Texas were about $27,000 per pupil (more in the later years). 
47:1172:108257:26:25:72:526:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We cannot directly compare the losses to, say, the amount we need to fill to the spending gap, which is
47:1173:108360:25:26:72:535:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shown in the middle column.  This is because the loss is a stock and the gap is a flow (an amount needed
47:1174:108464:26:26:72:528:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:every year).  Nevertheless, if we multiply the losses in the right hand column by a return on investment
47:1175:108568:26:26:72:536:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such as 5 percent, we get $1,350 per pupil.  In other words, if we could somehow invest the lost property
47:1176:108673:26:26:72:506:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wealth and use its proceeds for redistribution, we could eliminate nearly all inequality of per pupil
47:1177:108774:26:26:72:526:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending in Texas and raise the average level of spending to the level of the highest spending quantile.
47:1178:108878:26:26:108:520:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Was Robin Hood efficient at taking from the rich and giving to the poor?  Certainly not if the
47:1179:108972:26:26:72:532:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alternative was efficient confiscation of wealth.  If the state had simply confiscated $27,000 per pupil in
47:1180:109079:26:26:72:529:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assets from the wealthy, it could have endowed a fund to nearly equalize school spending (as described
47:1181:109181:26:26:72:530:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:above).  Efficient wealth confiscation is not a realistic policy option in the United States, but an income
47:1182:109288:26:0:72:529:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or payroll tax might be a realistic alternative to the recapture system.  Since Texas currently has neither

48:1184:109500:12:12:72:515:133:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:gas property.  The state already measures the implied income of oil and gas producers in order to compute their
48:1185:109611:12:24:72:182:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:property value assessments.
48:1186:109638:24:11:114:114:97:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:  A foundation aid system based on property values generates more capitalization than one based on56
48:1187:109738:11:12:72:473:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:incomes because (a) the foundation grant varies with property values and (b) foundation aid reduces 
48:1188:109838:12:0:72:262:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:which affects property values, as we have seen. 
48:1189:109886:0:25:72:517:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax and a tax rate of less than 2% would be necessary to replace recapture, Robin Hood could almost
48:1190:109985:25:26:72:380:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:certainly have been funded without generating much deadweight loss.
48:1191:110052:26:26:108:527:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Why is Robin Hood so inefficient?  There are two reasons.  First, by relying on property as the
48:1192:110147:26:26:72:524:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:basis of the tax and the aid, the system invites capitalization.  Capitalization makes the tax base shrink
48:1193:110253:26:26:72:522:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:much faster than we are used to seeing with a typical tax.   As a result, tax rates have to rise.  Because
48:1194:110359:26:26:72:534:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deadweight loss is approximately proportional to the square of the tax rate, the high tax rates induced by
48:1195:110465:26:26:72:524:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Robin Hood (most Texans now pay a 19 percent rate on housing services) are inefficient.  It should be
48:1196:110566:26:26:72:519:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:emphasized that there is no reason why Robin Hood had to be based on property values.  Other states
48:1197:110665:26:26:72:491:478:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:fund aid with taxes on income or sales and distributed aid on the basis of household incomes.55
48:1198:110760:26:26:108:539:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, Robin Hood is inefficient because the scheme does not make good use of the foundation 
48:1199:110853:26:26:72:529:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system, which is more lump-sum in nature than the guaranteed revenue or recapture systems.  That is, a
48:1200:110955:26:26:72:505:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:self-supporting foundation system takes a lump of revenue from each rich district, gives a lump of
48:1201:111053:26:26:72:517:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue to each poor district, and then sets all districts' marginal tax prices to one.  Indeed, it is quite
48:1202:111161:26:25:72:515:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:possible to have a foundation aid system based on income and not property values, so that it induces
48:1203:111261:25:26:72:187:323:11:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:almost no capitalization.  The foundation component of Robin Hood is minor –the law hardly raised56
48:1204:111360:26:26:72:524:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:most districts' foundation grants.  It is Robin Hood's guaranteed revenue system that generates most of
48:1205:111463:26:26:72:534:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the aid for poor districts.  Moreover, the rich districts do not contribute through the foundation system at
48:1206:111571:26:26:72:523:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all –their marginal property value is taxed instead..  In short, Robin Hood minimizes reliance on lump
48:1207:111673:26:26:72:525:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sum redistribution and maximizes reliance on high marginal tax rates.  This is unnecessary:  numerous
48:1208:111774:26:0:72:406:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states rely largely or wholly on foundation systems, which can be generous.
49:1209:111851:0:25:108:523:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Texas' Robin Hood scheme unintentionally contained the seeds of its own self-destruction.  A
49:1210:111943:25:26:72:525:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:better understanding of how school finance works might lead to the adoption of schemes that are more
49:1211:112043:26:26:72:531:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:efficient, more stable, more equalizing, less burdensome to taxpayers, and –in the long run– more likely
49:1212:112147:26:52:72:241:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to achieve the goals of school finance.
