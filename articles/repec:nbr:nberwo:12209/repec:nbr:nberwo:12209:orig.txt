2:25:1147:28:14:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The participation of interest groups in public policy making is unavoidable.  Its unavoidable nature
2:26:1247:14:14:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is only matched by the universal suspicion with which it has been seen by both policy makers and
2:27:1343:14:15:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the public.  Recently, however, there has been a growing literature that examines the participation
2:28:1442:15:14:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of interest groups in public policy making from a New Institutional Economics perspective.  The
2:29:1537:14:14:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:distinguishing feature of the New Institutional Economics Approach is its emphasis in opening up
2:30:1633:14:14:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the black box of decision-making, whether in understanding the rules of the game, or the play of the
2:31:1733:14:14:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:game.    In  this  paper  we  do  not  attempt  to  fairly  describe  the  vast  literature  on  interest  group's
2:32:1847:14:14:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:behavior.  Instead, the purpose of this essay for the New Institutional Economics Guide Book is to
2:33:1945:14:15:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:review  recent  papers  that  follow  the  NIE  mantra.    That  is,  they  attempt  to  explicate  the
2:34:2048:15:14:71:539:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:micro-analytic features of the way interest groups actually interact with policy-makers, rather than
2:35:2148:14:14:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:providing  an  abstract  high-level  representation.    We  emphasize  the  role  of  the  institutional
2:36:2252:14:28:71:342:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:environment in understanding interest groups' strategies.

4:71:4930:36:28:90:525:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The  participation  of  interest  groups  in  public  policy  making  is  unavoidable.    No  society  
4:72:5033:28:28:90:525:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:can be so repressive nor individual power be so extreme that decisions are undertaken by 
4:73:5122:28:27:90:525:601:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a narrow clique of individuals without consideration to others.  Its unavoidable nature is 
4:74:5213:27:28:90:527:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:only  matched  by  the  universal  suspicion  with  which  it  has  been  seen  by  both  policy  
4:75:5311:28:27:90:527:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:makers  and  the  public.    Recently,  however,  there  has  been  a  growing  literature  that  
4:76:5409:27:28:90:528:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:examines  the  participation  of  interest  groups  in  public  policy  making  from  a  New  
4:77:5503:28:28:90:525:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Institutional Economics perspective.  The distinguishing feature of the New Institutional 
4:78:5593:28:27:90:526:463:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Economics  Approach,  as  it  is  understood  today,  is  its  emphasis  in  opening  up  the  black  
4:79:5695:27:28:90:526:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:box  of  decision-making,  whether  in  understanding  the  rules  of  the  game,  or  the  play  of  
4:80:5797:28:27:90:316:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the game.  Indeed, as Oliver Williamson says,  
4:81:5844:27:28:126:489:381:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:“The NIE has progressed not by advancing an overarching theory but by 
4:82:5914:28:28:126:490:353:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:uncovering  and  explicating  the  microanalytic  features  [of  institutions]  to  
4:83:5998:28:27:126:490:325:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which  Arrow  refers  and  by  piling  block  upon  block  until  the  cumulative  
4:84:6081:27:28:126:286:298:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:value added cannot be denied.”1 
4:85:6112:28:27:89:526:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Thus,  in  this  paper  we  do  not  attempt  to  fairly  describe  the  vast  literature  on  interest  
4:86:6217:27:28:89:525:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group’s behavior.  Instead, we mostly review recent papers that follow Williamson’s NIE 
4:87:6305:28:28:89:525:215:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:mantra.  That is, they attempt to explicate the micro-analytic features of the way interest 
4:88:6397:28:27:89:525:187:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groups  actually  interact  with  policy-makers,  rather  than  providing  an  abstract  high-level

4:92:6590:11:16:90:518:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:2 An earlier wave of new institutional analysis of interest groups was led by Mancur Olson’s path breaking 
4:93:6697:16:0:89:516:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1971 The Logic of Collective Action.  His analysis of the organization of, and individual incentives to join 
5:94:6899:0:27:126:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We start this survey by emphasizing that to understand the role of interest groups 
5:95:6982:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in  the  modern  administrative  state,  it  is  fundamental  to  recognize  that  while  legislatures  
5:96:7086:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:enact  statutes,  and  often  supervise  their  implementation,  it  is  bureaucracies  that,  via  the  
5:97:7191:27:28:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:administrative process, make and implement the bulk of policies.  Consider, for example, 
5:98:7280:28:28:90:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:telecommunications  in  the  United  States.    For  more  than  60  years  the  main  body  of  
5:99:7377:28:27:90:524:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:telecommunications legislation in the United States was the Federal Communications Act 
5:100:7464:27:28:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(FCA) of 1934.3  This piece of legislation specifically directed the newly created Federal 
5:101:7555:28:27:89:527:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Communications  Commission  to  regulate  interstate  communications  so  as  to  provide  
5:102:7646:27:28:89:526:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:telecommunications  services  at  “just,  fair  and  reasonable  prices.”    Nowhere  in  the  Act  
5:103:7746:28:28:89:526:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were there specific instructions about how to obtain that general goal.  Furthermore, the 
5:104:7836:28:27:89:528:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Act  presumed  the  existence  of  a  monopoly  supplier  of  long  distance  services.    The  
5:105:7932:27:28:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fostering of competition was not one of the stated goals of the Act.  Even though the FCA 
5:106:8022:28:27:89:526:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was  silent  about  competition,  from  the  late  1950s  until  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  
5:107:8121:27:28:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1996,  the  FCC  was  engaged  in  a  process  of  partially  deregulating  the  long  distance  and  
5:108:8223:28:27:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  customer  provided  equipment  segments  of  the  industry,  which  culminated  with  the  
5:109:8319:27:28:89:526:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:passing  of  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act.    This  process  was  partially  triggered  by  
5:110:8417:28:28:89:529:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:various   interest   group   actions,   which   included   introduction   of   multiple   pieces   of   
5:111:8521:28:27:89:527:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislation,  continuous  lobbying  of  congress  and  the  agency,  and,  naturally,  suing  for

5:113:8649:66:26:521:524:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                                                                                                                 
5:114:8793:26:12:90:503:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:groups, led to a large literature on the formation and organization of interest groups.  See, for example, 
5:115:8900:12:7:90:233:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f3:Moe (1980) and references therein.

5:117:8959:11:16:90:443:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:4 For a more detailed analysis of the role played by interest groups in the opening of the 
5:118:9050:16:0:89:326:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:telecommunications market in the US, see Spiller (1996b). 
6:119:9203:0:27:126:528:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Indeed,  the  potentially  large  distributional  effects  of  legislation  provide  the  
6:120:9293:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:affected  groups  strong  incentives  to  attempt  to  control  what  policies  are  made  and  how  
6:121:9394:28:27:90:524:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:they are enforced.  Thus, much of interest group action in the modern administrative state 
6:122:9485:27:28:90:450:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is geared toward influencing the implementation of, often vague, policies.  
6:123:9561:28:28:108:525:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In this paper we first discuss the role of interest groups in the policy making process, 
6:124:9650:28:27:90:527:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and  then  explore  how  it  is  affected  by  the  nature  of  the  institutional  environments  in  
6:125:9752:27:44:90:237:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:which interest groups operate. 
6:126:9782:44:36:90:271:499:257:g_d0_f5:257:g_d0_f5:II. Buy, Lobby or Sue 
6:127:9804:36:27:90:529:463:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The   literature   normally   relates   to   the   activities   of   interest   groups   generically   as   
6:128:9912:27:28:90:527:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“lobbying,”  where  by  this  it  refers  to  actions  such  as  transferring  resources  to  policy  
6:129:10014:28:27:90:528:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:makers  (whether  in  the  form  of  a  campaign  contribution,  or  bribes)  or  transferring  
6:130:10110:27:28:90:524:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:information.  These two, however, are drastically different actions, and in this survey we 
6:131:10200:28:28:90:528:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:will  not  follow  the  usual  definition  of  lobbying  as  the  quintessential  interest  group  
6:132:10299:28:27:90:525:325:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:activity.  Instead we look at three main ways by which interest groups may sway policy 
6:133:10386:27:28:90:531:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:outcomes  their  preferred  way:  buying  influence,  lobbying  for  influence,  and  suing.    
6:134:10482:28:27:90:525:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Buying influence reflects the actions, often legal and sometimes illegal, by which interest 
6:135:10574:27:28:90:525:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groups may attempt to get decision makers (whether politicians or bureaucrats) to listen 
6:136:10663:28:28:90:526:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to  their  needs,  and,  hopefully,  act  accordingly.    Lobbying  for  influence  consists  of  the  
6:137:10766:28:27:90:525:187:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:various actions, also often legal, and sometimes illegal, by which interest groups attempt 
6:138:10857:27:28:90:528:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to  transfer  information  to  politicians  and  bureaucrats  about  issues  (such  as  voters’  
6:139:10954:28:27:90:527:132:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:preferences,  impact  of  particular  agency  or  legislative  proposals,  etc)  that  may  affect  
6:140:11054:27:28:90:525:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decision makers’ political and bureaucratic calculus. Suing is the art of using the judicial 
6:141:11147:28:0:90:527:77:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:process  to  change  the  arena  where  the  game  is  played,  away  from  the  legislative  and  
7:142:11341:0:27:90:528:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:administrative  process,  towards  the  court.    Judicial  action  may  be  pursued  against  a  
7:143:11439:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:particular policy or its implementation, depending, naturally, of the nature of the case, but 
7:144:11533:28:41:90:460:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:also of the more general environment in which the interest group operates.5   
7:145:11611:41:33:89:296:612:144:g_d0_f6:195:g_d0_f6:II.1 Direct and Indirect Influence 
7:146:11646:33:28:90:525:579:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Buying, lobbying and suing can also be direct or indirect.  Interest groups pursue a direct 
7:147:11738:28:28:90:527:551:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:action  (say  lobbying)  when  the  target  is  intended  to  act  directly  on  the  matter.    For  
7:148:11840:28:27:90:525:523:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example, an interest group may lobby a legislator with the specific intent of changing her 
7:149:11931:27:28:90:525:496:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:vote on a particular bill; or may lobby the legislator with the intent that the legislator use 
7:150:12026:28:28:90:529:468:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  information  to  exert  their  authority  to  influence  the  way  a  particular  agency  
7:151:12121:28:27:90:528:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:implements  a  statute.  The  same  direct/indirect  dichotomy  applies  to  the  other  two  
7:152:12215:27:42:90:191:413:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:strategic choices.6     
7:153:12239:42:33:90:164:371:144:g_d0_f6:195:g_d0_f6:II.2 Buying 
7:154:12251:33:27:90:527:338:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Legislator-buying  is  the  most  publicized  form  of  interest  group  influence,  and  the  one  
7:155:12351:27:50:90:414:311:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:that has attracted the most attention by scholars and pundits alike. 7 
7:156:12421:50:22:234:237:261:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
7:157:12469:22:16:90:517:239:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:5 Some countries do not provide for a blanket declaration of lack of constitutionality of a statute, requiring 
7:158:12580:16:7:89:389:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:instead its prior application (i.e., an agency decision) to a particular case.   
7:159:12661:7:16:90:509:216:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:6 The analogy to “buying” is straightforward. The analogy to suing requires a bit more explanation.  The 
7:160:12766:16:11:89:519:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:purpose of suing is to shift the arena of the game away from the legislative/bureaucratic arena, towards the 
7:161:12875:11:12:89:503:189:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:judicial arena, where the interest group expects to get via litigation what it was unable to obtain via the 
7:162:12983:12:11:89:513:177:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:other strategies.  The purpose of litigation, at the same time, may be direct – such as reversing an adverse 
7:163:13092:11:12:89:490:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:bureaucratic outcome, or indirect, such as putting the regulatory agency on notice that pursuing this 
7:164:13194:12:11:89:516:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:particular policy line would be extremely expensive.  One can understand in this way the strategy of those 
7:165:13301:11:12:89:508:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:entrants, such as MCI and others, who fought the FCC to open the telecommunications market.  Indeed, 
7:166:13402:12:11:89:519:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Temin (1987) points to MCI’s multiple law suits against the FCC as the triggering factor that increased the 
7:167:13510:11:12:89:497:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:hostility of the Justice Department against AT&T, and helped motivate it to pursue AT&T’s eventual 
7:168:13609:12:7:89:135:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:break-up.   
7:169:13621:7:16:90:509:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:7 Even US President Theodore Roosevelt saw the need in 1906 to coin the term “muckrakers” to refer to 
7:170:13723:16:11:89:476:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:those journalists who questioned the influence of business in policy making.  See The Columbia

8:172:14009:0:30:90:247:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f7:II.2.1 Buying Direct Influence  
8:173:14041:30:28:90:519:678:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The classical interest group literature focuses on direct vote buying.  Scholars model this 
8:174:14133:28:27:90:524:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interaction as a game where interest groups compete with each other to capture legislators 
8:175:14224:27:28:90:510:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by making contributions (to campaigns, or illegally, for profit) in return for politicians’ 
8:176:14316:28:28:90:511:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:votes.8  Empirical evidence on the pay-for-vote interaction between interest groups and 
8:177:14404:28:27:89:476:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislators is at best inconclusive.  Stramann (1998) studies time pattern in PAC 
8:178:14486:27:28:89:515:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions and finds that changes in PAC contributions are correlated with the voting 
8:179:14575:28:27:89:504:512:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:schedule on relevant policies, independent of the electoral cycle.  The extent to which 
8:180:14663:27:28:89:510:485:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:direct vote buying by interest groups actually takes place, however, is unclear.  Indeed, 
8:181:14752:28:28:89:519:457:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more than thirty years ago, Gordon Tullock asked the fundamental question of why there 
8:182:14839:28:27:89:509:429:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is so little money going to US policy makers (1972).  Ansolabehere, DeFigueiredo and 
8:183:14924:27:28:89:500:402:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Snyder (2003), investigating the size and makeup of political contributions, and their 
8:184:15011:28:27:89:516:374:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:effect on politicians’ behavior, find that, conditioned on the effect of policies on interest 
8:185:15105:27:28:89:485:347:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groups’ welfare, these groups give far less than they should, and furthermore, that 
8:186:15189:28:27:89:500:319:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions have little effect on politicians’ behavior.9  Alternatively, contributions 
8:187:15279:27:28:90:491:292:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:could be made as a source of ideological consumption,10 or simply tickets to obtain 
8:188:15363:28:28:90:493:264:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:access.  Indeed, Ansolabehere, Snyder and Tripathi (1995) find a strong connection 
8:189:15446:28:27:90:487:236:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between buying (campaign contributions) and lobbying, suggesting that campaign 
8:190:15525:27:40:90:493:209:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions may indeed be used to gain and maintain access.  Bronas and Lott, Jr. 
8:191:15609:40:22:234:237:169:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
8:192:15657:22:16:90:513:147:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:8 Among the classical buying legislators’ papers, see Denzau and Munger (1986); Snyder (1990), (1991); 
8:193:15760:16:7:89:148:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Baron (1994). 
8:194:15774:7:16:90:506:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:9 One could argue that legislators (and the president) buy each others’ votes via pork-barrel legislation.  
8:195:15882:16:11:90:507:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Although the practice is well studied (for a recent application to Brazil, see Alston and Mueller 2006), I 
8:196:15989:11:7:90:224:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:will not deal with this issue here. 
8:197:16025:7:16:90:521:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:10 Since the probability that a small contribution will impact on the probability of the legislator’s reelection 
8:198:16137:16:0:90:361:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is small, the net gains from the contribution could well be negative. 
9:199:16302:0:27:90:523:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(1997) reach a similar conclusion.  They find that politicians in their last term do not alter 
9:200:16397:27:28:90:494:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:their voting behavior significantly compared to their preceding term, indicating that 
9:201:16483:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest groups contribute to politicians who are more aligned with their political views, 
9:202:16574:27:28:90:504:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rather than buying votes, a view consistent with campaign contributions being more a 
9:203:16659:28:40:90:301:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:consumption than an investment activity.11

9:205:16737:30:28:90:524:528:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Following the direct implications of the Congressional Dominance Hypothesis,12 or of the 
9:206:16825:28:27:90:525:500:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Separation of Powers Hypothesis on judicial decision-making,13 interest groups can also 
9:207:16913:27:28:90:526:473:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attempt  to  control  policy  outcomes  through  buying  legislators’  influence  on  bureaucrats  
9:208:17012:28:28:90:525:445:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:or courts.  The Congressional Dominance Hypothesis, which presents in a different form 
9:209:17099:28:27:90:531:417:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the   “fire   alarm”   framework   of   McCubbins   and   Schwartz   (1984),   suggests   that   
9:210:17196:27:28:90:528:390:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:independent  agencies  are  not  truly  independent,  as  they  are  subject  to  continual  -  
9:211:17292:28:27:90:526:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:although not necessarily active - congressional oversight.  Active congressional reversal, 
9:212:17382:27:28:90:530:335:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:though,  is  not  necessary,  all  that  is  needed  is  the  credible  threat  of  legislative  action.    
9:213:17490:28:27:90:528:307:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Spiller  (1992)  shows  that  the  discretion  of  independent  administrative  agencies  in  a  
9:214:17587:27:28:90:526:280:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:system  of  division  of  powers  depends,  among  other  things,  on  the  composition  of  the  
9:215:17685:28:28:90:527:252:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislature  and  the  executive  (determining  the  threat  of  congressional  reversal).14  In  a  
9:216:17786:28:21:89:528:224:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:system  of  division  of  powers,  however,  full  Congressional  Dominance  is  a  corner  
9:217:17878:21:21:234:237:203:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
9:218:17926:21:16:90:524:182:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:11 One could always spin a reciprocity theory whereby interest groups may compensate legislators with post 
9:219:18032:16:12:90:519:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:legislative employment, increasing thus the potential for interest alignment even on legislators’ last terms.  
9:220:18143:12:7:90:411:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:For a recent survey of theories of capture by interest groups, see Dal Bó (2006). 
9:221:18225:7:16:90:522:147:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:12 See, for example, Weingast and Moran (1983), McCubbins and Schwartz (1984), and references therein.  
9:222:18329:16:11:90:521:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The evidence on legislators’ influence on agency actions is large.  I focus here on the incentives for buying 
9:223:18439:11:7:90:262:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:legislators so as to achieve such influence. 
9:224:18484:7:16:90:513:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:13 See, for example, Gely and Spiller (1990), Spiller and Gely (1992), Ferejohn and Shipan (1990).  For a

9:226:18670:7:16:90:493:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:14 The organization and budget of the judiciary (determining the threat of judicial reversal) is also of 
9:227:18775:16:0:90:196:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:relevance (Spiller 1992).   
10:228:18898:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:solution  and  requires  a  particular  type  of  political  composition  between  the  legislature  
10:229:18999:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and the executive.15  Thus, in political environments with divided governments, agencies 
10:230:19088:28:27:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:do  not  always,  nor  fully,  respond  to  Congressional  desires.    As  a  result,  buying  indirect  
10:231:19193:27:28:90:453:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:influence is not always an efficient or effective strategy for interest groups. 
10:232:19273:28:28:118:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There  is  some  recent  evidence  of  buying  indirect  influence.    De  Figueiredo  and  
10:233:19365:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Edwards (2004) find that state regulatory commissions’ decisions on telecommunications 
10:234:19452:27:28:90:530:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:policy   (in   particular,   interconnection   charges)   are   closely   aligned   with   campaign   
10:235:19554:28:27:90:526:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions  to  key  legislators  by  both  incumbents  and  new  entrants.    Indirect  buying  
10:236:19654:27:28:90:526:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:provides  then,  a  third  explanation  to  the  scant  evidence  concerning  the  link  between  
10:237:19752:28:42:90:372:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:campaign contributions and observable policy outcomes.

10:239:19822:33:27:90:527:385:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:An  alternative  way  for  interest  groups  to  exert  influence  is  to  provide  legislators  with  
10:240:19925:27:28:90:525:358:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:valuable  information.    The  purpose  of  this  information  is  to  potentially  alter  legislators’  
10:241:20030:28:27:90:525:330:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:support for a particular policy.16  We call the transfer of information lobbying.17  Interest 
10:242:20124:27:28:90:527:303:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groups may transfer information to legislators and other decision makers in various ways.  
10:243:20214:28:28:90:530:275:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Interest   groups   may,   for   example,   participate   in   hearings,   may   directly   provide   
10:244:20316:28:27:90:526:247:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:background  documentation,  or  organize  protests.    To  be  of  value,  these  costly  actions  
10:245:20415:27:28:90:525:220:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:must transfer relevant information to decision makers, whether legislators, bureaucrats or 
10:246:20505:28:23:90:526:192:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:judges.  The information may concern the value, cost and distributional implication of a 
10:247:20594:23:22:234:237:169:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
10:248:20642:22:16:90:520:147:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:15 Spiller (1990) shows that Congressional budgetary decisions for agencies reflect an internal rather than a 
10:249:20752:16:7:90:159:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:corner solution.   
10:250:20771:7:16:90:517:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:16 Support may depend on the legislator’s perception of his/her constituency’s preferences over the policy, 
10:251:20879:16:7:90:288:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:or of his/her own believes about the public good. 
10:252:20929:7:16:90:503:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:17 In principle, conditional campaign or in general monetary contributions may also change legislators’ 
10:253:21033:16:11:90:519:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:perspectives about particular policies.  I focus here, though, on information concerning states of the world, 
10:254:21143:11:0:90:239:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:rather than on interest group actions. 
11:255:21277:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:particular  policy  to  the  legislators’  constituents,  the  saliency  of  the  issue  to  the  interest  
11:256:21385:27:28:90:531:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group’s   constituency,   or   the   implication   of   alternative   technologies   or   policy   
11:257:21484:28:27:90:527:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:implementation.  18    The  information  transfer  can  be  done  following  formal  (and  legal)  
11:258:21583:27:28:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:procedures,19 or via informal (and often illegal) ways.20  All these transfer information to 
11:259:21676:28:40:90:526:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the relevant actor.  As influence buying, lobbying for influence may be direct or indirect.

11:261:21808:30:28:90:527:528:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:An  interest  group  providing  information  about  the  consequences  of  a  particular  bill  is  
11:262:21908:28:27:90:527:500:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attempting  to  get  legislators  to  take  that  information  into  account  when  voting  for  a  
11:263:22008:27:28:90:526:473:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:particular  bill.    Scholars  in  recent  years  have  given  much  attention  to  the  informal  and  
11:264:22112:28:28:90:528:445:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:formal  rules  by  which  interest  groups  engage  in  information  lobbying.    The  formal  
11:265:22207:28:27:90:526:417:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:literature  in  general  does  not  discriminate  between  direct  and  indirect  lobbying.    A  key  
11:266:22310:27:28:90:530:390:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:issue  in  lobbying,  though,  is  the  inherent  bias  in  the  information  transmission  process.    
11:267:22414:28:27:90:530:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Interest  groups  will  only  provide  information  when  it  is  in  their  advantage  to  do  so.    
11:268:22517:27:28:90:526:335:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Calvert  (1985)  shows,21  however,  that  even  biased  information  may  be  preferred  to  no  
11:269:22615:28:27:90:527:307:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:information.    Furthermore,  because  politicians  cannot  eliminate  informational  bias  if  
11:270:22711:27:28:89:530:280:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:information   arises   from   a   single   interested   group,22   legislators   will   benefit   from   
11:271:22816:28:28:90:525:252:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:facilitating  access  to  multiple  interests,  even  from  those  whose  desired  policy  outcomes  
11:272:22917:28:27:90:526:224:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are not aligned with their own (Austen Smith and Wright 1992, Epstein and O’Halloran

11:275:23147:21:16:90:501:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:18 The March 2006 students’ demonstrations in France represent one excellent example of transferring 
11:276:23248:16:7:90:436:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:information to politicians about voters’ preferences concerning flexible labor policies. 
11:277:23337:7:12:90:433:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:19 Such as participating in congressional hearings, directly lobbying agency staff, etc. 
11:278:23426:12:11:90:373:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:20 Violent demonstrations is one example of informal illegal lobbying.

12:282:23784:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:multiple interest groups cancels out whatever information advantage each interest group 
12:283:23872:28:39:90:257:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:may have vis-à-vis the politicians.

12:285:23948:31:28:90:525:583:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:As it concerns lobbying for indirect influence, the information to be transmitted may be 
12:286:24037:28:27:90:525:555:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about constituents’ interests or about agencies or courts’ potential decisions.  The interest 
12:287:24131:27:28:90:526:528:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group  transmits  the  information  with  the  expectation  that  the  agency  or  court,  knowing  
12:288:24231:28:27:90:527:500:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that  such  lobbying  is  taking  place,  and  that  it  will  affect  legislators’  reaction  to  the  
12:289:24335:27:28:90:412:473:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:proposed decision, will adjust the proposed decision accordingly.   
12:290:24403:28:28:126:527:445:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Indeed,  apart  from  the  direct  monetary  advantages  that  legislators  may  obtain  
12:291:24492:28:27:90:525:417:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from interest groups participation,23 legislators may value interest groups participation in 
12:292:24585:27:28:90:529:390:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  administrative  process  because  of  their  informational  advantage.    Since  policy  
12:293:24679:28:27:90:525:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:outcomes can also affect re-election probabilities, or more generally, a politician’s career 
12:294:24772:27:28:90:526:335:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:advancement,  legislators  have  incentives  to  provide  interest  groups  with  access  both  to  
12:295:24872:28:27:90:525:307:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the regulatory process, and to themselves.  This is the essence of the “fire alarm” theory 
12:296:24963:27:28:90:528:280:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of  congressional  oversight  (McCubbins  and  Schwartz  1984),  whereby  congressional  
12:297:25052:28:28:90:530:252:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:supervision  is  triggered  by  interest  groups  detection  of  bureaucratic  “misbehavior.”24   
12:298:25150:28:27:89:528:224:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Indeed,  given  that  agency  delegation  is  the  natural  consequence  of  increased  policy  
12:299:25246:27:28:89:528:197:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:complexity,  legislators’  need  to  supervise  the  bureaucracy  may  be  undertaken  by  
12:300:25337:28:22:234:237:169:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
12:301:25385:22:16:90:506:147:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:23 It can be argued that by allowing interest group participation in the administrative process, legislators 
12:302:25494:16:11:90:520:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:may have increased their usefulness to interest groups, thus, increasing the amount interest groups will pay 
12:303:25603:11:12:89:518:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:for access. See also Spiller (1990) for a revolving door theory of interest group influence where politicians 
12:304:25713:12:7:89:374:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:benefit from interest group influence on bureaucratic decision making. 
12:305:25784:7:16:90:506:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:24 McCubbins, Noll and Weingast (1987) view administrative procedures in that fashion.  In their view, 
12:306:25887:16:11:90:504:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:administrative procedures guide bureaucracies to make decisions consistent with the preferences of the 
12:307:25990:11:0:90:171:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:enacting coalition.

13:309:26204:27:28:90:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:advantage   over   bureaucracies   in   gathering   information   (DeFigueiredo,   Spiller   and

13:311:26394:27:28:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:they  are  highly  motivated  to  garner  policy  relevant  information.    While  supervising  
13:312:26490:28:28:90:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bureaucracies  require  budgets  and  have  to  be  motivated  to  undertake  the  extra  effort,  
13:313:26589:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest groups’ research and monitoring activity is done for their own purpose, and does 
13:314:26679:27:28:89:529:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not  require  congressional  funding,  releasing  congressional  budgets  for  other  purposes.    
13:315:26778:28:27:89:525:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This is the essence of the “fire alarm” strategy.  On the other hand, as mentioned above, 
13:316:26868:27:28:89:524:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest groups are biased, while supervising bureaucracies may be less so.  As with direct 
13:317:26960:28:28:89:525:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lobbying, promoting multiple interest groups participation, including those in opposition 
13:318:27050:28:27:89:525:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to the politician, makes politicians strictly better off, as competing interest groups provide 
13:319:27145:27:28:89:533:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the   greatest   amount   of   information   at   the   lowest   cost   to   the   elected   official.      
13:320:27253:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:DeFigueiredo, Spiller and Urbiztondo (1999) use this insight to explain the enactment of 
13:321:27342:27:28:90:409:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Administrative Procedure Act by the US Congress in 1946.26   
13:322:27407:28:27:126:524:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The Administrative Procedure Act, 27 as well as most of the enabling legislation of 
13:323:27490:27:28:89:526:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:regulatory  agencies,  set  procedural  requirements  that  provide  for  ample  participation  of  
13:324:27590:28:28:89:527:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest  groups  in  the  regulatory  process.    These  procedural  requirements  stipulate  that  
13:325:27691:28:27:89:527:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:regulatory  agencies  must  provide  notice,  must  inform  the  public  about  proposed  rule  
13:326:27787:27:20:89:527:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:makings,  must  make  their  decisions  taking  into  account  the  submissions  of  interested

13:328:27932:22:16:90:491:170:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:25 The creation of a specific organ of the legislature whose purpose is to supervise the actions of the 
13:329:28036:16:11:90:497:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:bureaucracy (such as the US General Accounting Office) is one such strategy.  The problem remains, 
13:330:28135:11:12:90:493:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:though, of who monitors the monitor.  For a discussion of hierarchy as an organizational response to 
13:331:28236:12:7:90:273:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:information problems, see Garicano (2000).   
13:332:28281:7:16:90:508:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:26 McCubbins, Noll and Weingast (1987) present a slightly different view.  They see the organization of 
13:333:28385:16:11:90:524:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:administrative procedures, in general and as applied to particular agencies, as ways to hard-wire and protect 
13:334:28494:11:12:90:514:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the interests of the enacting coalitions, while DeFigueiredo, Spiller and Urbiztondo (1999) focus more on 
13:335:28599:12:7:90:325:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the generic informational benefit to incumbent legislators. 
13:336:28659:7:0:90:334:78:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:27 5 USC §§ 551-59, 701-06, 1305, 3105, 3344, 5372, 7521.  
14:337:28814:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:parties,  and  cannot  rush  nor  make  decisions  in  the  dark.    In  this  setting,  interest  groups  
14:338:28921:27:28:90:527:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:provide  two  important  roles:  first,  they  provide  information  to  the  regulatory  agency  
14:339:29019:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about  the  state  of  the  world,  and  second,  they  provide  information  to  legislators’  about  
14:340:29122:27:28:90:528:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:their  constituents’  preferences.    Both  are  important  for  the  agency  and  its  political  
14:341:29221:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:masters. On the one hand, agencies are resource constrained and hence information about 
14:342:29309:28:27:89:525:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the state of the world is always beneficial.  On the other hand, information about interest 
14:343:29401:27:28:89:527:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groups'  preferences  is  important  as  it  allows  the  agency  to  forecast  potential  political  
14:344:29503:28:27:89:525:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:problems  they  may  encounter  at  the  legislature.  The procedural restrictions on decision 
14:345:29598:27:28:89:527:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:making  also  provide  the  opportunity  for  interest  groups  to  attempt  to  block  agency  
14:346:29694:28:28:89:526:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decision  making  through  lobbying  their  politicians  -  McCubbins  and  Schwartz’  (1984)  
14:347:29789:28:27:89:528:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“fire  alarm”  insight.    Interest  group  participation  allows  legislators  to  supervise  the  
14:348:29889:27:28:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:agency without having to be actively involved in the regulatory process, and hence limits 
14:349:29979:28:27:89:528:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  time  that  legislators  have  to  expend  in  regulating  regulators.28    However,  the  
14:350:30075:27:28:90:528:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:information  revealed  through  individual  interest  group’s  lobbying  activities,  even  if  
14:351:30171:28:27:90:526:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:truthful,  is  naturally  biased.  Interest  groups  will  not  reveal  information  that  will  bring  
14:352:30275:27:28:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about  a  regulatory  outcome  that  makes  them  worse  off.    Thus,  the  APA’s  widespread  
14:353:30371:28:28:90:525:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:facilitation of interest group participation ameliorates the bias in information provided by 
14:354:30464:28:27:90:190:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:each interest group.  
14:355:30486:27:28:126:526:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Transferring  information  about  constituents’  interests  also  provides  an  indirect  
14:356:30576:28:27:90:526:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:link  between  lobbying  and  policy  decisions,  whether  by  agencies  or  courts.    Under  the

14:360:30919:16:12:90:476:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:including interest group participation in agencies’ procedure and structure, agencies will change 
14:361:31017:12:11:90:523:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:automatically in response to changes in the enfranchised interest groups’ preferences, freeing the legislators 
14:362:31128:11:0:90:201:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:from the need to intervene. 
15:363:31252:0:27:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:play  of  the  game  following  a  judicial  decision  that  can  be  overruled  by  legislative  
15:364:31350:27:28:89:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:action,29 would select policies only among those that are immune to legislative reversal.  
15:365:31440:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:By  changing  legislators’  perceptions  of  their  constituencies’  preferences,  lobbying  may  
15:366:31538:27:28:90:528:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:change  the  set  of  judicial  policies  that  are  immune  to  legislative  override.    Indeed,  
15:367:31638:28:28:90:526:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Iaryczower,  Spiller  and  Tommasi  (2006)  find  that  interest  groups  lobby  more  when  the  
15:368:31736:28:27:90:320:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:courts are more constrained by the legislature.   
15:369:31786:27:28:118:525:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In sum, the reason why the literature looking for a connection between lobbying or 
15:370:31869:28:27:90:526:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:campaign  contributions  and  policy  outcomes  have  failed  to  provide  a  direct  connection  
15:371:31967:27:28:89:525:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between lobbying and campaign contributions and policy outcomes is that they may have 
15:372:32053:28:28:89:525:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:essentially been looking at the wrong place.  As Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006) 
15:373:32141:28:27:89:525:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:emphasize, “the empirical work on the impact of lobbying has been looking at the wrong 
15:374:32228:27:28:89:527:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:policy  dimension.”    Rather  than  considering  the  impact  on  the  nature  of  legislation,  
15:375:32326:28:27:89:526:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:empirical  research  should  focus  on  the  way  the  administered  state  operates,  that  is,  via  
15:376:32429:27:28:89:527:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bureaucracies  and  the  courts.    In  this  sense,  buying  or  lobbying  for  indirect  influence  
15:377:32531:28:27:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ought  to  imply  a  stronger  correlation  between  campaign  contributions  and  lobbying  to  
15:378:32628:27:42:90:328:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislators and bureaucratic or judicial outcomes.

15:381:32788:28:27:90:527:192:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Litigation,  however,  can  be  used  as  a  complement  to  buying  and  lobbying.    Indeed,  
15:382:32884:27:28:90:526:165:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:because  litigation  is  expensive,  complex  and  time  consuming,  interest  groups  may  use  
15:383:32981:28:37:90:527:137:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:litigation  as  a  threat  to  obtain  policies  advocated  through  their  lobbying  process.    The

16:386:33292:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:extent to which litigation threats can alter bureaucratic behavior, though, depends on the 
16:387:33383:27:28:90:528:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:probability  that  the  interest  group  is  likely  to  win.    Thus,  the  composition  of  the  
16:388:33482:28:27:90:529:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislature  and  that  of  the  courts,  impacts  the  credibility  of  litigation  threats.    De  
16:389:33583:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Figueiredo  (2005)  finds,  for  example,  that  interest  groups  are  most  likely  to  challenge  a  
16:390:33687:28:28:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Federal Communications Commission when the courts are more likely to rule against the

16:392:33790:43:36:90:371:527:257:g_d0_f5:257:g_d0_f5:III. Strategic Choice of Instruments 
16:393:33827:36:28:90:526:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Given  the  multiplicity  of  instruments  of  influence  available  to  interest  groups,  we  now  
16:394:33928:28:27:90:527:463:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:analyze  how  interest  groups  may  strategically  select  their  choice.    Before  a  policy  is  
16:395:34029:27:28:90:527:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:implemented,  interest  groups  face  the  choice  of  buying  and/or  lobbying.    Buying  and  
16:396:34126:28:27:90:526:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lobbying are not equally efficient and effective for all groups.  Indeed, Hillman and Hitt 
16:397:34216:27:28:90:527:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(1999)  propose  that  the  current  stage  of  an  issue’s  life  cycle,  the  firm’s  monetary  and  
16:398:34319:28:28:90:530:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:informational   resources,   and   the   corporate   environment   that   the   firm   operates   in   
16:399:34422:28:27:90:528:325:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determines  the  firm’s  political  strategies.    For  example,  Ansolabehere,  Snyder  and  
16:400:34516:27:28:90:524:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Tripathi (2002) find that unions and single-issue groups, whose objectives are more clear 
16:401:34606:28:27:90:527:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and  partisan  than  other  interest  groups,  tend  to  contribute  rather  than  lobby.    Such  
16:402:34705:27:28:90:530:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:patterns   are   consistent   with   theories   of   strategic   interest   group   behavior.      More   
16:403:34811:28:28:90:525:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:specifically, groups with large memberships can gain attention by their sheer number, and 
16:404:34901:28:27:90:527:187:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hence  do  not  need  to  spend  large  amount  of  money  buying  legislators;  groups  with  
16:405:34996:27:28:89:530:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:extreme   ideological   preferences   may   not   reflect   a   large   spectrum   of   legislative   
16:406:35098:28:27:89:525:132:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:constituencies’  preferences,  and  may  be  better  off  engaging  in  direct  or  indirect  buying

17:411:35625:27:28:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and DeFigueiredo (2002) show that lobbying falls with the probability that the court will 
17:412:35714:28:28:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reverse  the  agency.    De  Figueiredo  (2002)  also  finds  that  interest  groups  take  the  FCC  
17:413:35816:28:41:89:442:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more to courts when courts are ideologically far from the administration. 
17:414:35890:41:33:89:350:529:144:g_d0_f6:195:g_d0_f6:III.1 A Model and Empirical Implications31 
17:415:35931:33:28:126:525:496:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:To highlight the strategic use of instruments, we develop here a simple model of 
17:416:36012:28:28:90:525:468:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:separation of powers based on the model of indirect lobbying of Iaryczower, Spiller and 
17:417:36100:28:27:90:524:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Tommasi  (2006).32    There  are  two  individual  players,  the  court  and  the  interest  group,33 
17:418:36201:27:29:89:525:413:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and a legislature populated by a continuum of legislators with total size one. The policy 
17:419:36291:29:31:89:525:384:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:space is X  =  [0,1],  and  given  ideal  policy  zi,  player  i  has  preferences  over  policies  x∈X 
17:420:36394:31:10:90:323:353:144:g_d0_f4:104:g_d0_f4:represented  by  a  utility  function  2)(

17:424:36491:32:28:90:525:316:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:assume  that  the  interest  group’s  ideal  policy  is  at  the  right  extreme  of  the  policy  space,  
17:425:36598:28:27:90:525:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:zu= 1, and refer to policy x’ as being pro-interest group with respect to x’’ whenever x’ >

17:428:36742:21:16:90:512:182:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:30 Interest groups may intensify their lobby and buying activities with the purpose of reversing the policy 
17:429:36850:16:12:90:508:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:by direct legislative override.  For this strategy to be “optimal”, though, the policy implementation must 
17:430:36957:12:7:90:357:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:have reflected the erroneous strategic choice by the interest group. 
17:431:37026:7:11:90:442:147:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:31 Much of this section is taken liberally from Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006). 
17:432:37114:11:16:90:497:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:32 DeFigueiredo and DeFigueiredo (2002) develop a similar vote buying rather than indirect lobbying 
17:433:37214:16:12:90:487:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:model.  However, in their model there is no uncertainty, a fundamental issue to trigger informative 
17:434:37314:12:7:90:130:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:lobbying. 
17:435:37324:7:16:90:508:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:33 This model can also be applied to a game between the administration and the legislature.  Throughout 
17:436:37427:16:11:90:489:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:this section, the word “court” can be replaced by the word “agency” to generate a model of indirect 
17:437:37527:11:0:90:207:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:lobbying of the bureaucracy. 
18:438:37652:0:27:126:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Legislators and the court differ in their responsiveness to voters.  In particular, we 
18:439:37739:27:29:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:assume  that  the  court  is  completely  unresponsive  to  the  position  of  voters  in  the  policy  
18:440:37843:29:28:90:526:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:space, and denote its preferred policy by zc∈ X.  We assume, though, that legislators are 
18:441:37933:28:29:89:526:624:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:at  least  partially  responsive  to  voters’  stance  on  the  issue.    Assuming  for  simplicity  that  
18:442:38040:29:29:89:524:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:the distribution of voters in the policy space can be characterized by a single parameter θ 
18:443:38131:29:29:90:524:566:152:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f4:∈ X, we let the ideal policy of legislator j be given by zLj(θ;βj)≡βj+θ, where for all j, βj 
18:444:38223:29:30:89:526:537:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:>0 and βj < 1. The degree of conflict in the legislature is captured by the distribution of 
18:445:38314:30:29:90:524:507:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:points βj among its members, which we describe by the cumulative distribution G(.);  i.e., 
18:446:38405:29:29:89:450:478:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for any point β, G(β) denotes the proportion of legislators for which βj ≤β. 
18:447:38480:29:27:126:528:449:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Given  the  extent  of  interest  group  activity,  policy  outcomes  result  from  the  
18:448:38569:27:28:90:526:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interaction  of  the  court  and  the  legislature.  While  the  precise  form  of  this  interaction  
18:449:38672:28:28:90:525:394:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:depends on specific institutional details, in most polities the elective body can ultimately 
18:450:38765:28:28:90:526:366:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:impose its will under some sufficiently demanding procedure. We represent this idea by 
18:451:38851:28:29:90:525:338:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:assuming that the court chooses a ruling xc∈X, which the legislature can reverse with the 
18:452:38941:29:29:90:525:309:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:votes of a majority m ∈ [1/2,1] of legislators. We say that a court’s ruling is “stable” in 
18:453:39033:29:28:90:525:280:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:the legislature – and therefore final – if there exists no alternative policy that a majority m 
18:454:39129:28:27:90:526:252:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of  legislators  would  prefer  to  it  in  a  binary  choice,  and  denote  the  set  of  stable  rulings  
18:455:39237:27:29:90:253:225:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:given the majority rule m by Sm.   
18:456:39272:29:29:125:527:196:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Legislators  and  the  court  are  uninformed  about  the  realization  of  θ,  and  have  
18:457:39363:29:29:90:528:167:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:common  prior  beliefs  represented  by  the  cumulative  distribution  function  F(⋅)  with  
18:458:39457:29:29:90:524:138:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:density f(⋅). In contrast, the interest group is perfectly informed about the realization of θ, 
18:459:39553:29:28:89:526:109:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and  can  potentially  credibly  transmit  this  information  through  costly  actions  -  lobbying  
18:460:39654:28:0:89:529:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(participating  in  legislative  or  regulatory  hearings,  writing  white  papers,  and  even  
19:461:39846:0:30:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:organizing  strikes  and  public  demonstrations).  In  particular,  given  a  realization  θ’,  the  
19:462:39948:30:29:90:526:678:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest  group  can  organize  an  observable  level  a  of  actions  bearing  a  cost  C(a,θ’).  For  
19:463:40052:29:29:89:526:649:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:simplicity  we  assume  that  C(a,θ)=a(k  -θ),  k>1,  that  is,  the  marginal  cost  of  lobbying  is  
19:464:40156:29:28:90:390:620:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decreasing in the pro-interest group stance of the population.   
19:465:40221:28:29:126:527:592:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The  timing  of  the  game  can  thus  be  described  as  follows:  (i) θ  is  realized  and  
19:466:40314:29:27:90:528:563:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:privately  observed  by  the  interest  group;  (ii)  the  interest  group  decides  a  publicly  
19:467:40412:27:28:90:525:536:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observable level of lobbying intensity a; and (iii) the court chooses a ruling xc in the set 
19:468:40504:28:29:90:286:508:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of stable policies in the legislature Sm.34

19:485:41122:31:28:90:526:211:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We first characterize, as a benchmark, the symmetric information equilibrium. Note that 
19:486:41210:28:29:90:525:183:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in this case legislators are perfectly informed about the value of θ, and the interest group 
19:487:41303:29:28:90:525:154:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:derives no benefit from lobbying, irrespective of the preferences of the electorate. Hence, 
19:488:41395:28:22:234:237:126:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
19:489:41443:22:17:90:513:104:42:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:34 For completeness, there is a fourth stage in which the legislature reviews the court’s decision, 
19:490:41542:17:13:89:505:87:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:but given that courts would only make policy choices that are stable, we can without any loss, 
19:491:41637:13:0:89:189:74:121:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:discard this last stage. 
20:492:41757:0:27:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:there  will  be  no  lobbying  in  equilibrium.  The  relationship  between  preferences  of  the  
20:493:41856:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:electorate  and  policy  outcomes  in  the  symmetric  information  environment,  however,  is  
20:494:41952:28:27:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the key element determining the amount and effectiveness of lobbying in the incomplete 
20:495:42039:27:28:90:219:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:information environment.  
20:496:42065:28:30:126:528:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We  start  by  characterizing  the  set  of  stable  policies  in  the  legislature  given  
20:497:42157:30:31:90:529:568:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:majority  rule  m.  Letting  ≡ GmLβ-1(1-m)  and   ≡ GmHβ-1(m),  it  is  easy  to  see  that  
20:498:42249:31:31:90:525:537:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:Sm(θ)=[zL(θ;mLβ ), zL(θ;)]. That is,  is the critical legislator for a pro-interest group 
20:499:42338:31:29:90:527:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:coalition,  in  the  sense  that  any  policy  x  to  the  left  of  her  preferred  policy  would  be  
20:500:42442:29:30:90:526:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:replaced  by  a  more  pro-interest  group  policy.  Similarly,    is  the  critical  legislator  for  
20:501:42545:30:29:89:525:447:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:an anti-interest group coalition, in that any policy to the right of her preferred policy will 
20:502:42640:29:0:90:389:418:144:g_d0_f4:152:g_d0_f8:be  replaced  by  a  more  anti-interest  group  policy.  Note  that  β

20:510:42749:28:29:90:528:389:152:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f4:βH(m)  only  with  simple  majority  rule  (m=1/2),  in  which  case  Sm(θ)  collapses  to  the  
20:511:42846:29:27:90:525:360:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:preferred policy of the median voter in the legislature, and the court has no policy making 
20:512:42938:27:29:90:525:333:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:power. It follows that for m > 1/2, the set of possible court’s ideal policies that would be 
20:513:43030:29:28:90:272:304:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:stable given θ  has positive measure.  
20:514:43068:28:28:126:526:276:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The court will then select its ideal policy unless it is constrained either for being 
20:515:43153:28:28:90:525:248:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“extremely” pro-interest group or anti-interest group in relation to the relevant players in 
20:516:43246:28:28:90:527:220:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  legislature.    In  particular,  since  the  preferred  policy  of  every  legislator  is  strictly  
20:517:43352:28:29:90:525:192:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increasing in θ, a higher value of θ  results in a pro-interest group shift of the entire set of 
20:518:43449:29:28:90:524:163:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:stable policies. A court with a fixed policy preference zc may then become a “pro-interest 
20:519:43540:28:30:90:521:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group” court for a legislature observing a low realization θ’ (zc > zL(θ’;βH ) ), or an ”anti-
20:520:43633:30:0:89:524:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest  group”  court  for  a  legislature  observing  a  high  realization  θ’’(zc  <  zL(θ’’;βL )). 
21:521:43833:0:28:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Figure 1 depicts in bold the resulting court’s equilibrium rulings as a function of the state 
21:522:43927:28:41:90:154:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of nature, θ.

21:525:43988:25:28:89:525:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The two parallel lines in the figure represent the preferences of the critical legislators as a 
21:526:44084:28:30:89:525:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:function of the state of nature, zL(θ ; βL )=βL+θ  and zL(θ ; βH )= βH+θ . For each θ, the 
21:527:44173:30:29:90:524:213:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:set of stable policies S(θ) is the segment between these lines, the interval [βL+θ, βH+θ] in 
21:528:44266:29:29:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the vertical axis. If, for some θ , the court’s ideal point zc is in S(θ), the court will be able 
21:529:44363:29:28:90:525:155:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to rule according to its preferred policy, facing no effective legislative constraints.  In the 
21:530:44459:28:30:90:524:127:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example  depicted  in  the  figure,  this  occurs  for  all  states  between  the  (interior)  points  θ0 
21:531:44564:30:0:89:528:97:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and θ1.  In  this  region,  then,  the  flat  portion  of  the  bold  line  represents  the  court’s  
22:532:44762:0:29:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:equilibrium  ruling.  For  θ  <  θ0,  however,  S(θ)  is  entirely  below  zc.  Thus,  if  it  were  
22:533:44863:29:28:90:527:679:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:common  knowledge  among  legislators  that  public  sentiment  is  strongly  anti-interest  
22:534:44956:28:27:90:525:651:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group, the ideal point of the court would not survive the challenge of a more anti-interest 
22:535:45048:27:29:90:526:624:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group  legislation.  The  best  choice  for  the  court  in  such  states  is,  therefore,  to  enact  the  
22:536:45156:29:29:90:529:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most  pro-interest  group  stable  ruling;  i.e.,  βH+θ.    For  θ<θ0,  then,  the  bold  line  
22:537:45252:29:29:89:525:566:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:representing  the  court’s  equilibrium  rulings  coincides  with  βH+θ.    Similarly,  for  θ>θ1, 
22:538:45350:29:29:90:525:537:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:S(θ) is entirely above zc.  In this subset of states the legislature is too pro-interest group 
22:539:45445:29:28:90:525:508:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:compared to the court, and thus the best choice for the court in such states is to enact the 
22:540:45538:28:29:90:525:480:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most  “anti-interest  group”  stable  ruling;  i.e.,  βL+θ.  Proposition  1  below  summarizes  the  
22:541:45639:29:28:90:198:451:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:preceding discussion.  
22:542:45662:28:27:126:525:423:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The legislature thus effectively constrains the court for some realizations of public 
22:543:45748:27:31:90:525:396:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:opinion when the set }:{10θθθθθ≥∨≤=K is non-empty.  In other words, the court will 
22:544:45831:31:28:90:526:365:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:be able to rule its preferred policy independently of public opinion only if this policy is 
22:545:45923:28:27:90:522:337:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:both (i)  pro-interest  group  relative  to  the  preferences  of  the  critical  legislator  for  a  pro-
22:546:46029:27:28:90:525:310:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest group coalition before a pro-interest group electorate (zc > zL(1;βL )= βL+1) and 
22:547:46119:28:28:90:522:282:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:(ii)  anti-interest  group  relative  to  the  preferences  of  the  critical  legislator  for  an  anti-
22:548:46224:28:27:90:528:254:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest  group  coalition  before  an  anti-interest  group  electorate  (zc  <  zL(0  ;βH )= βH ).  
22:549:46325:27:28:89:525:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Note that, as in Gely and Spiller (1990), this condition is more likely to be satisfied when 
22:550:46418:28:28:89:522:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:there  is  significant  dissent  in  the  legislature  (the  critical  legislators  for  a  pro  and  anti-
22:551:46525:28:71:89:333:171:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest group coalitions are far apart, βL<<βH).35  
22:552:46577:71:22:234:237:100:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
22:553:46625:22:0:90:350:78:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:35 See Proposition 1 in Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006). 
23:554:46785:0:29:125:524:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Moreover, in general, the size of K increases with βL and decreases with βH. Thus, 
23:555:46866:29:28:89:526:679:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  set  of  realizations  of  public  opinion  for  which  the  court  is  effectively  constrained  is  
23:556:46973:28:27:89:527:651:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:always  smaller  the  higher  dissent  in  the  legislature  is.    Hence,  the  overall  effect  of  
23:557:47075:27:28:89:526:624:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislators’  responsiveness  to  public  opinion  on  judicial  independence  depends  on  the  
23:558:47172:28:39:89:327:596:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relative position of the court in the policy space.

23:560:47263:31:28:89:527:526:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The  previous  analysis  showed  that  when  the  court  is  constrained  for  some  (publicly  
23:561:47359:28:29:89:525:498:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:known) preferences of the electorate, an increase in θ  induces a more pro-interest group 
23:562:47449:29:28:90:526:469:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ruling,  and  thus,  a  more  pro-interest  group  policy  outcome  in  equilibrium.  Iaryczower,  
23:563:47548:28:27:90:528:441:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Spiller  and  Tommasi  (2006)  show  that  when  policy-makers  are  uncertain  about  the  
23:564:47640:27:28:90:528:414:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:realization  of  θ,  lobbying  by  the  interest  group  restores  the  complete  information  
23:565:47735:28:27:90:527:386:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:mapping  between  the  preferences  of  the  electorate  and  policy  outcomes.  In  particular,  
23:566:47833:27:29:90:525:359:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:they show that equilibrium lobbying increases with the realization of θ when, given θ, the 
23:567:47924:29:29:90:526:330:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:court is constrained by the legislature (i.e., θ∈K), and does not change when the court is 
23:568:48014:29:29:89:237:301:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unconstrained (θ∈ [θ0,θ1]).36   
23:569:48046:29:27:126:527:272:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:That  is,  in  equilibrium  the  level  of  lobbying  will  reflect  the  preferences  of  the  
23:570:48142:27:28:90:525:245:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:electorate up to the extent that this information can influence a binding constraint for the 
23:571:48235:28:28:90:530:217:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:court   (and   thus   policy   outcomes).   In   other   words,   lobbying   is   effectively   fully   
23:572:48339:28:27:90:526:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:informative.  As  long  as  (informed)  policy  is  responsive  to  the  electorate’s  preferences,  
23:573:48440:27:62:90:525:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest group types facing different pro-interest group dispositions of the electorate will 
23:574:48533:62:22:234:237:100:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
23:575:48581:22:0:90:407:78:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:36 See Proposition 2 and Lemma 1 in Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006). 
24:576:48753:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:always  choose  different  levels  of  lobbying,  allowing  the  reproduction  of  the  complete  
24:577:48851:27:28:90:437:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:information link between policies and the preferences of the electorate.  
24:578:48925:28:27:126:528:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This  does  not  imply,  however,  that  the  equilibrium  will  necessarily  involve  
24:579:49012:27:28:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:transmission  of  information.  In  fact,  lobbying  will  be  completely  unresponsive  to  the  
24:580:49110:28:29:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:preferences of the electorate if (and only if) the court is unconstrained for every possible 
24:581:49203:29:28:90:525:569:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:realization of θ.  Conversely, there will be a complete separating equilibrium if (and only 
24:582:49295:28:28:90:525:541:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:if) the court is constrained for every realization of public preferences. That is, only if the 
24:583:49390:28:30:89:522:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:court’s  ideal  policy  is  “extremely  anti-interest  group”  (i.e.,  zc  <  βL),  or  “extremely  pro-
24:584:49494:30:28:90:526:483:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest group” (i.e., zc  >  βH+1), interest groups will choose different lobbying level for 
24:585:49587:28:28:90:527:455:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:different  observed  values  of  θ.    This  result  allows  us  to  develop  the  response  of  the  
24:586:49689:28:28:90:526:427:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expected  level  of  lobbying  and  pro-interest  group  rulings  to  changes  in  the  composition  
24:587:49790:28:27:90:525:399:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the legislature. Note that for our purposes changes in the composition of the legislature 
24:588:49883:27:29:90:525:372:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are relevant only to the extent that they affect the boundaries of the stable set of policies 
24:589:49977:29:28:90:528:343:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in  the  legislature,  zL(θ;βL )=βL+θ    and  zL(θ;βH)=βH+θ.    Moreover,  recall  from  the  
24:590:50070:28:28:90:527:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:analysis  of  the  symmetric  information  benchmark  that  the  set  of  realizations  of  public  
24:591:50170:28:28:90:524:287:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:opinion for which the court is effectively constrained decreases with the degree of dissent 
24:592:50262:28:30:90:525:259:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in the legislature. That is, in general, the size of K increases with βL and decreases with 
24:593:50353:30:28:90:111:229:152:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f4:βH.  
24:594:50358:28:28:126:528:201:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Since  the  level  of  interest  group  lobbying  is  decreasing  in  the  size  of  the  
24:595:50448:28:28:89:525:173:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:constrained court ruling space, it is straightforward to see that a pro-interest group shift in 
24:596:50544:28:30:89:521:145:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  preferred  policy  of  the  critical  legislator  for  a  pro-interest  group  coalition  βL  (anti-
24:597:50649:30:0:89:527:115:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest  group  coalition,  βH)  increases  the  expected  pro-interest  group  tendency  of  the

25:599:50946:30:28:89:119:678:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:[γ].37  
25:600:50954:28:28:126:527:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This  result  has  direct  implications  to  the  response  of  equilibrium  outcomes  to  
25:601:51045:28:28:90:525:622:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:changes in court’s preferences. First, the expected level of pro-interest group rulings will 
25:602:51138:28:28:90:525:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increase following a pro-interest group change in the court’s preferences unless the court 
25:603:51229:28:29:90:526:566:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is  constrained  for  every  realization  of  θ  both  preceding  and  following  this  change.  The  
25:604:51331:29:27:90:526:537:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:change in the expected level of lobbying is, however, ambiguous.38  Similarly, we know 
25:605:51417:27:28:90:525:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from the analysis of the symmetric information benchmark that the effect of legislators’ 
25:606:51506:28:27:90:525:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:responsiveness to public opinion on judicial decisions depends on the relative position of 
25:607:51597:27:28:90:526:455:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  court  in  the  policy  space.  This  implies  that  the  relation  between  lobbying  and  the  
25:608:51699:28:28:90:525:427:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:responsiveness of legislators to public opinion will also necessarily depend on the relative 
25:609:51792:28:39:90:285:399:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:position of the court in the policy space.

25:611:51865:31:27:126:527:329:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This  model  has  direct  and  empirically  refutable  implications  for  understanding  
25:612:51954:27:28:90:528:302:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest  groups’  lobbying  strategies,  as  well  as  implications  concerning  the  relation  
25:613:52051:28:28:90:525:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between  policy  outcomes  and  interest  group  activity.  First,  policy  outcomes  in  the  form  
25:614:52152:28:27:90:525:246:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of judicial decisions become more “pro-interest group” the higher the level of the interest 
25:615:52244:27:28:90:527:219:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group’s  political  activity.  In  other  words,  in  this  model,  lobbying  influences  policies  
25:616:52344:28:27:90:525:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:indirectly, via judicial adaptation.  Second, the expected level of lobbying decreases the 
25:617:52435:27:27:90:526:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more effective the separation of powers between the court and the legislature is (i.e., the 
25:618:52527:27:22:234:237:137:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
25:619:52575:22:12:90:350:115:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:37 See Proposition 3 in Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006). 
25:620:52639:12:17:90:512:103:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:38 This should come as no surprise, however, since for this purpose, increasing xc with βL and βH given is 
25:621:52745:17:12:90:496:86:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:qualitatively similar as simultaneously reducing both βL and βH taking xc as given, and from the prior 
25:622:52846:12:0:90:457:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:discussion we know that βL and βH have opposite effects on the expected level of lobbying. 
26:623:53033:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more divided the legislature is on the relevant issues). Specifically, the level of lobbying 
26:624:53126:27:28:90:467:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is decreasing in the magnitude of the set of stable policies in the legislature.39  
26:625:53210:28:28:126:526:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This  model  also  has  strategic  lobbying  implications  .    Consider  Figure  1.    In  the  
26:626:53307:28:30:90:525:625:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:figure, for a given set of preferences zc, βH, βL, we can partition the set of realizations of 
26:627:53402:30:28:90:527:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the  state  of  the  world,  θ,  in  three  areas.    In  regimes  S1  and  S3  (where  the  court  is  
26:628:53506:28:28:90:525:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:constrained  either  by  a  pro-interest  group  or  anti-interest  group  legislature),  informative  
26:629:53609:28:27:90:525:539:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lobbying takes place, while it does not in S2.  Regimes S1 and S3, however, differ in the 
26:630:53699:27:28:90:526:512:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:individuals  over  which  lobbying  effort  is  being  exercised.    While  in  S1,40  the  interest  
26:631:53801:28:28:90:526:484:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group  lobbies  a  friendly  legislator  (i.e.,  that  legislator  with  a  higher  pro-interest  group  
26:632:53906:28:27:90:526:456:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tendency),  in  S2,  the  interest  group  is  trying  to  mollify  the  preferences  of  the  relatively  
26:633:54013:27:28:90:528:429:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:anti interest  group  legislator.    In  other  words,  lobbying  becomes  counter-active.    In  
26:634:54111:28:27:90:527:401:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relatively  bad  states  of  the  world,  lobbying  is  focused  on  friendly  legislators,  while  in  
26:635:54215:27:28:90:457:374:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relatively good states of the world, lobbying is focused on unfriendly ones.   
26:636:54294:28:28:126:524:346:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally, although in regime S2 lobbying becomes ineffective, suing is effective as 
26:637:54377:28:27:90:526:318:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:legislators  cannot  agree  in  moving  the  administration  policy  in  any  direction.    Thus,  we  
26:638:54480:27:28:90:525:291:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:should observe litigation the more divided the legislature is on the interest group’s issue, 
26:639:54573:28:27:90:529:263:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and   the   stronger   the   division   of   powers   in   the   polity,   a   result   consistent   with   
26:640:54681:27:78:90:384:236:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:DeFigueiredo (2000) study of telecommunications litigation.

26:642:54789:21:16:90:500:137:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:39 This model also has standard separation of powers empirical implications.  As in most separation of 
26:643:54892:16:12:90:505:121:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:powers models, the equilibrium level of “pro-interest group” judicial decisions depends on the political 
26:644:54997:12:11:90:506:109:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:composition of the legislature.  In equilibrium, a more “pro-interest group” legislature will trigger more 
26:645:55104:11:8:90:483:98:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:“pro-interest group” decisions provided that the court is effectively constrained by the legislature. 
26:646:55206:8:16:90:522:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:40 Recall S1 reflects cases when the state of the world is relatively anti interest group, as θ is relatively low, 
26:647:55321:16:0:89:231:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:given the preferences of the polity.

27:652:55528:36:28:90:529:632:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The   framework   presented   in   the   previous   sections   was   based   on   an   institutional   
27:653:55631:28:27:90:527:604:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:environment  resembling  the  separation  of  powers  of  the  United  States.    In  the  United  
27:654:55730:27:28:90:527:577:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:States,  members  of  the  US  Congress  exhibit  remarkable  longevity;  they  also  tend  to  
27:655:55826:28:27:90:526:549:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:specialize  in  committees  and  to  play  an  active  role  in  policymaking42  and  in  overseeing  
27:656:55928:27:28:89:524:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the public bureaucracy.43  Outside of the United States, though, legislatures most often do 
27:657:56020:28:28:90:528:494:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not resemble the US Congress in terms of many or all of these above-mentioned features.  
27:658:56108:28:27:90:526:466:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This  is  particularly  the  case  in  the  party-centered  systems  (Shugart  and  Haggard  2001)  
27:659:56208:27:28:90:528:439:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that  dominate  the  world’s  democracies,44  yet  are  also  the  least  studied.45  The US 
27:660:56301:28:28:90:529:411:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Congress  is  thus  a  rare  outlier  in  the  population  of  national  legislatures.    As  a  
27:661:56398:28:27:90:527:383:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:consequence,  theoretical  models  of  interest  group  participation  in  the  US,  while  very  
27:662:56496:27:28:90:525:356:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:helpful in generating general theory, are also limited due to their status as case studies of 
27:663:56590:28:27:90:525:328:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:an  atypical  case.    In  this  section  we  focus  our  analysis  of  interest  group  participation  in  
27:664:56698:27:28:90:526:301:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:party-centered  systems  that  exist  in  a  large  majority  of  the  world’s  parliamentary  and

27:674:57572:7:16:90:515:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:44 By party centered we refer to those electoral systems that force the voters’ choices among parties rather 
27:675:57681:16:7:90:309:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:than across candidates. See Carey and Shugart (1995). 
27:676:57735:7:16:90:524:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:45 To the extent that studies of legislatures in other presidential democracies have been conducted, they tend 
27:677:57846:16:7:90:418:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to focus almost exclusively on the least party-centered systems; especially Brazil. 
27:678:57930:7:16:90:510:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:46 The establishment of the European Union presents a unique case of an evolving institutional structure, 
27:679:58036:16:0:90:517:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:from party centered to one better characterized as separation of powers.  For a discussion of how firms are 
28:680:58240:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:differ considerably from the US counterparts.  In party centered systems, legislators may 
28:681:58330:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not stay for long in the legislature. As a consequence, they may have little  incentives  to  
28:682:58424:28:27:90:522:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:invest in specialized legislative skills, or to control the bureaucracy.  Similarly, in party-
28:683:58518:27:28:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:centered systems, the focus of policy making tends to be away from the legislature – with 
28:684:58608:28:28:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the cabinet (as in the case of unified governments) or the government party taking a more 
28:685:58698:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fundamental policy making role.  In these instances, interest group participation in policy 
28:686:58790:27:28:90:422:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:making drastically changes its nature.  We explore these issues here. 
28:687:58860:28:27:125:528:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In  the  previous  sections  we  discussed  how  legislators  benefited  from  interest  
28:688:58949:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:group participation, and thus, how legislators have the incentive to mold the institutional 
28:689:59041:28:28:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:framework  in  which  they  participate  so  as  to  extract  as  much  information  from  it  as  
28:690:59140:28:27:90:485:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:possible.  We explore this incentive in alternative institutional environments here. 
28:691:59225:27:28:125:525:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The key question for comparative work is whether the assumptions that drive the 
28:692:59305:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:US case are appropriate in understanding how electoral rules shape legislative incentives 
28:693:59395:27:28:90:525:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:elsewhere.    In  principle,  non-US  politicians  are  as  strategic  in  their  actions  as  their  US  
28:694:59501:28:27:90:525:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:counterparts.  However, the political institutions that shape legislators’ incentives do vary 
28:695:59595:27:28:90:529:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:across  countries;  career  structure,  electoral  laws,  and  party  rules  can  be  very  different.    
28:696:59701:28:28:90:528:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The question narrows, then, to the incentives these politicians face in different contexts.47   
28:697:59797:28:27:125:525:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:For example, if party nomination is inconsequential for electoral success, as is the 
28:698:59882:27:28:89:529:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:case   for   incumbents   in   the   Brazilian   Chamber   of   Deputies   (Ames   2001),   party   
28:699:59982:28:50:89:522:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:renomination will play no substantial role in shaping legislators’ behavior.  Thus, the US-

29:705:60550:0:27:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:centered  analytical  framework  may  suffice.48    In  contrast,  there  are  situations,  as  in  
29:706:60650:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:closed-list  PR  systems,  where  nomination  at  the  top  of  a  major  party  list  can  virtually

29:708:60859:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by  the  renomination  rules  but  essentially  unconstrained  by  the  electoral  process  (Strøm

29:714:61365:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:leaders  in  the  creation  of  the  district-party  list,  local  party  leaders  may  or  not  be  key  in  
29:715:61475:28:27:90:288:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the determination of legislators’ futures.

29:719:61822:28:27:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:order  to  pursue  their  desired  career  paths,  they  must  maintain  a  good  relationship  with

29:722:62128:28:27:89:526:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:have  a  complex  political  objective.    They  want  to  maximize  the  performance  of  their

30:741:63854:27:28:125:526:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Electoral  incentives  not  only  impact  a  legislature’s  organization  (Weingast  and

30:743:64032:27:28:90:527:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Spiller  and  Tommasi  2002).    In  party  centered  systems  where  electoral  incentives  are  
30:744:64130:28:27:90:530:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:centralized  around  parties,  information  will  follow  the  same  extent  of  centralization.    
30:745:64230:27:28:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Baron  (2000),  for  example,  shows  how  interest  group  participation  is  less  transparent  –  
30:746:64331:28:28:89:526:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but  not  less  active-  in  Japan  than  in  the  United  States.    Although  there  are  fewer  access  
30:747:64438:28:27:89:527:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:points,  interest  groups  are  able  to  provide  information  (lobby)  in  a  systematic,  albeit  
30:748:64539:27:28:89:524:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:informal and centralized fashion.  In party centered systems, administrative procedures as

30:750:64725:27:28:89:525:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bureaucracy actions.  On the one hand, legislators in party-centered systems are not that 
30:751:64815:28:29:89:526:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interested  in  pursuing  bureaucratic  supervision.    On  the  other  hand,  in  party  centered

31:754:65136:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:systems with unified governments – such as those in Japan or the UK – the bureaucracy 
31:755:65221:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is  under  substantial  control  from  the  cabinet,  with  the  cabinet  having  little  incentive  in  
31:756:65326:28:27:90:471:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:providing the legislature with substantial powers to supervise its own actions.   
31:757:65408:27:28:125:524:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The incentives for campaign contributions also change accordingly.  There is little

31:759:65589:28:27:90:522:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:distributions  to  legislators  may  have  little  impact  on  their  reelection,  and  their  post-
31:760:65689:27:28:90:527:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reelection behavior will be highly impacted by the incentives of the political party bosses.  
31:761:65783:28:27:90:526:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Thus, as with lobbying efforts, campaign contributions will be highly centralized in key 
31:762:65872:27:28:90:206:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:party decision makers.   
31:763:65897:28:28:125:526:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Finally,  litigation  in  party  centered  systems  may  provide  less  satisfaction  than  in  
31:764:65993:28:27:90:527:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:systems  with  stronger  separation  of  powers.    Because  party  centered  systems  tend  to  
31:765:66090:27:28:90:530:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:narrow   the   separation   between   legislative   and   executive   powers,   courts   face   a   
31:766:66190:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantially narrower set of discretion.  The courts are in a situation where  overturning 
31:767:66282:27:28:90:528:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the bureaucracy may imply alienating the cabinet, which may, in turn, trigger retribution.  
31:768:66373:28:27:90:526:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Indeed, evidence from Japan and the UK suggest that progression within the judiciary is 
31:769:66461:27:28:90:529:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dependent   on   proper   behavior   vis-à-vis   the   government   of   the   day.50      Similarly,

32:777:67067:36:28:90:525:669:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In this survey we try to provide a framework to understand interest group participation in

32:781:67448:28:27:90:527:558:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:government  party,  though,  will  tend  to  reserve  interest  group  access  to  key  decision  
32:782:67546:27:28:90:529:531:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:making   politicians.      The   trade-off   between   campaign   contributions,   lobbying   and   
32:783:67646:28:28:90:526:503:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:litigation is also affected by the nature of the institutional environment.  Litigation loses 
32:784:67739:28:27:90:528:475:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:its  power  in  unified  systems,  limiting  successful  interest  group  activities  to  direct  
32:785:67837:27:28:90:528:448:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lobbying  and  buying.    In  decentralized  polities,  the  full  extent  of  complementarities
