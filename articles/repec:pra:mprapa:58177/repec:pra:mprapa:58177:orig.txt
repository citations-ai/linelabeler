2:43:1565:26:25:72:331:305:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Abstract 
2:44:1573:25:16:72:543:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This  study  investigates the  role  of  exchange  rate,  market  size  and  human  capital  for  attracting 
2:45:1682:16:16:72:543:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:foreign  direct  investment  (FDI).  In  this  regard,  time  series  data  on  annual  basis  has  been 
2:46:1787:16:16:72:543:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:collected for the period 1985–2010 and an Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron 
2:47:1879:16:16:72:542:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(PP)  unit  root  tests  are  utilized  to  determine  the  stationarity  of  the  variables.  An  autoregressive 
2:48:1993:16:16:72:542:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to co-integration was applied as all the variables 
2:49:2091:16:16:72:542:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in the model are first level stationary, e.g. I(1). The empirical findings of this study confirm the 
2:50:2192:16:16:72:543:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:long run relationship among the variables. However, market size and human capital have strong 
2:51:2285:16:15:72:542:168:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:positive  and  significant  impact – in  short- and  long-run – for  attracting  FDI  but  exchange  rate 
2:52:2388:15:16:72:542:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shows  negative  impact  in this  regard.  The  coefficient  ECM  is  negative  and  significant,  which 
2:53:2492:16:16:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:means that it converges towards equilibrium. CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests were utilized to test 
2:54:2583:16:16:72:542:121:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:the model’s stability and the plots of each test did not cross the lines of critical value, which 
2:55:2681:16:16:72:543:105:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicates  the  stability  of  the  estimated  parameters  and  this  model  can  be  used  by  Pakistan  in 
2:56:2790:16:0:72:543:89:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy and decision making. For achieving higher economic growth and economies of scale, the 
3:57:2924:0:16:72:542:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country  should  concentrate  on  the  ingredients  of  this  study  so  that it  could  attract  more  FDI  as 
3:58:3035:16:16:72:229:684:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compared to the other countries.

3:63:3214:26:16:72:153:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Introduction 
3:64:3228:16:13:72:75:568:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
3:65:3228:13:16:72:542:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  world has now  become  a  global village  due  to  the  induction  of  new  and  advanced  modern 
3:66:3330:16:16:72:543:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:technologies.  The  innovative  features  in modern technology  make  possible  for  countries  to  get 
3:67:3433:16:16:72:543:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic  exposure  as  well as  the  economies  of  scale. However, in the increasingly  globalized 
3:68:3531:16:16:72:542:507:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and interdependent economy of the world, knowledge and human capital are the key competitive 
3:69:3622:16:16:72:542:491:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:weapons of the nations (Thurow, 1994). FDI is not only the source of employment and financial 
3:70:3716:16:16:72:543:475:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:benefits but it also acts as a medium for acquiring the human capital, technology, infrastructure, 
3:71:3809:16:15:72:543:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:managerial  and  organizational  practices  and  easy access  to  markets  (Noorbakash and  Alberto, 
3:72:3908:15:16:72:543:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2001). Developing  countries  are  also  in a race  of  developing  their  technology  up  to  a 
3:73:4004:16:16:72:542:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considerable  extent,  so  that  they  can also become  a  part  of this  global  village  and  recent 
3:74:4107:16:16:72:543:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developments in information technology have been an important step to set up a global market in 
3:75:4203:16:16:72:542:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this  regard (Chakrabarti, 2001; Noorbakhsh  and  Alberto, 2001). The outcomes  of FDI are very 
3:76:4292:16:16:72:542:380:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:important  for the developing  countries as most  of  the  time they  are in capital shortage,  lack  of 
3:77:4395:16:16:72:543:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:modern  technology and in getting  less  competitive  edge.  FDI can overcome these issues by 
3:78:4485:16:22:72:493:348:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:providing benefits to the foreign investor (Chaudhry et al., 2013; Rehman et al., 2010). 
3:79:4571:22:15:72:543:326:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the present era of global competition every country wants to compete internationally. Most of 
3:80:4667:15:16:72:543:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the developing countries now show a welcoming attitude to FDI (Noorbakhsh and Alberto, 2001; 
3:81:4755:16:16:72:542:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Khan and Nawaz, 2010). In this regard different policies are implemented to encourage investors 
3:82:4847:16:16:72:543:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  invest, which  ultimately  results  in  the  economic prosperity and  financial  competitiveness  of 
3:83:4950:16:16:72:543:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  particular  country.  These  implications in  case  of  Pakistan are  loosening  the  restrictions on 
3:84:5057:16:16:72:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trade  barriers and  cash  flows,  encourage  the  role  of advance technology and  granting most 
3:85:5153:16:22:72:530:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:favorite nation status (MFN)1 to the countries which encourage investors to invest in Pakistan.  
3:86:5248:22:16:72:543:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After  following  a  somewhat  restrictive  policy  towards  FDI, Pakistan  has  liberalized  its  policy 
3:87:5354:16:15:72:543:193:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:regime considerably since 1990. The increasing recognition of Pakistan’s locational advantages 
3:88:5449:15:16:72:543:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in perspective of human capital, exchange rate and market size has led to increasing investments 
3:89:5546:16:16:72:543:162:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:by  MNE’s  in  different  areas of  business  and  enable  Pakistan  to  exploit  these  advantages 
3:90:5646:16:26:72:400:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Rehman et al., 2010; Khan and Nawaz, 2010; Asghar et al., 2012).

3:92:5768:7:16:72:542:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:1“Most Favourt Nation Status is one of the cornerstones of World Trade Organization’s trade law and the members 
3:93:5880:16:12:72:542:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:of  the  WTO  agree  to  accord  MFN  status  to  each  other.  Exceptions  allow  for  preferential  treatment  of  developing 
3:94:6008:12:11:72:302:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:Times New Roman:countries, regional free trade areas and customs union”.

4:96:6105:0:16:72:543:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, different studies express different views related to FDI but some of these consider the 
4:97:6202:16:16:72:542:684:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant role of infrastructure, human capital and exchange rate along with other determinants 
4:98:6300:16:16:72:543:668:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for attracting the FDI inflows (Chaudhry et al., 2013; Asghar et al., 2012; Rehman et al., 2010; 
4:99:6397:16:16:72:543:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Asiedu, 2006; Xing and Zhao, 2003; Noorbakhsh and Alberto, 2001; Moore, 1993; Wheeler and 
4:100:6487:16:16:72:543:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Mody 1992). The  bottom  line  of  these  studies highlights that  Multinational  Corporations 
4:101:6580:16:16:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(MNCs) are in search of such markets where they can get the advantage of low cost, high profits 
4:102:6676:16:16:72:542:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and economies of scale. As inflow of foreign capital and resource creates backward and forward 
4:103:6771:16:15:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:linkages,  MNC’s  contribute  technical  help  to  promote  the  domestic  firms.  The  level  of 
4:104:6869:15:16:72:543:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:technology  and  productivity  through  both  labor  and  capital  of  domestic  producers  will  increase 
4:105:6976:16:16:72:543:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Asiedu,  2004;  Shahbaz  and  Rehman,  2010).  A  number  of  factors  gave  foundation  to  the 
4:106:7074:16:16:72:543:541:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increased efforts by developing countries to attract FDI inflows. A firm invests across the border 
4:107:7173:16:16:72:543:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:either to exploit a foreign market or to get better access to the certain inputs most likely the better 
4:108:7277:16:22:72:322:509:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:infrastructure and skilled and cheap human capital.  
4:109:7329:22:16:72:75:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
4:110:7329:16:16:72:543:471:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:According  to  UNCTAD 2 (1994),  the  capacity  building  and  recognition  by  policy  makers  in 
4:111:7427:16:15:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:terms  of  capabilities  encompassed  in  FDI  has  the  ability  to  contribute  directly  towards  the 
4:112:7532:15:16:72:542:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth  and  development  of  the  national  economy.    Secondly  the  other  rescue  packages  for  the 
4:113:7638:16:16:72:543:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corporations are declined in such a way that they increase the level of reliance on FDI. However, 
4:114:7736:16:16:72:543:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the government of these developing countries has gained momentum in maximizing the benefits 
4:115:7828:16:16:72:542:392:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and controlling the liabilities of investment by transitional corporations (Asiedu, 2006; Kok and 
4:116:7926:16:16:72:543:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ersoy,  2009).  Hence,  FDI  can  bring  vital  and  potential  benefits  through  the  spillovers  of 
4:117:8029:16:16:72:543:360:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management,   technical   skills,   information   technology   and   through   better   utilization   of 
4:118:8134:16:15:72:142:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:infrastructure. 
4:119:8149:15:16:72:75:329:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
4:120:8149:16:16:72:543:313:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:A number of studies’ bottom line has revealed that the propensity of spillovers which takes its 
4:121:8245:16:16:72:543:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:place is a function of absorptive capacity of the host country, which, in turn, is a function of the 
4:122:8346:16:16:72:542:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development level of an economy, the education level of the human capital and the competition 
4:123:8440:16:16:72:543:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level  of  the  host  economy  (Blomstrom  and  Kokko,  1997;  Resmini,  2000;  UNCTAD,  1994). 
4:124:8536:16:16:72:543:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Classical  theory  related  to  the  international  capital  flow  states  that  FDI  is  a  function  of

4:128:8823:16:32:72:543:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accordance to FDI inflows. As for as Pakistan is concerned the above mentioned variables have

5:140:9697:16:26:72:219:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.1. Exchange Rate and FDI 
5:141:9722:26:16:72:543:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Exchange rate of a country has remained a debatable and controversial topic for researchers and 
5:142:9818:16:16:72:543:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy makers.  Different researches show different opinions in this regard as Kohlhagen (1977) 
5:143:9914:16:15:72:543:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conducted  a  study  which  reveals  that  MNEs  converge  toward  increasing  their  production 
5:144:10011:15:16:72:543:563:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capacity in foreign countries, and the motive behind this is to serve their domestic market in case 
5:145:10111:16:16:72:543:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  foreign  currencies  depreciate.  Blomstrom  and  Kokko  (1997) conclude that the host  country 
5:146:10212:16:16:72:543:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market  size,  local  regulations,  infrastructure  and  technological  capacity  of  local  firms influence 
5:147:10321:16:16:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  extent  of  linkages  are.  This  study  argues  that  over  time  the connection between  these 
5:148:10422:16:16:72:542:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ingredients  will  enhance  as  the  level  of  skills  of  the  local investors  grows economies  of  scale 
5:149:10530:16:26:72:121:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increases. 
5:150:10540:26:15:72:542:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Benassy et  al.,  (2001)  examine  the  trade-off  between  depreciation  in  exchange  rate  and  its 
5:151:10643:15:16:72:543:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:volatility in terms of their effects on FDI. However, the fluctuations in exchange rate have much 
5:152:10741:16:16:72:542:426:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concern  in  decision  making  related  to  FDI.  Currencies  with  higher  depreciation  trend  are 
5:153:10842:16:16:72:543:410:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considered  more  alarming  to  foreign  investor  as  their  investment  declines  over  periods.  Zhang 
5:154:10948:16:16:72:543:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2008) and Blonigen (1997) also declare negative impact of exchange rate on FDI inflows. Xing 
5:155:11042:16:16:72:542:378:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  Zhao  (2003)  conducted  a  study  to  analyze  the linkage  among  imports,  FDI,  and  exchange 
5:156:11144:16:16:72:542:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rates in  the  situation of imperfect  competition.  The  findings  of  this  study  conclude  product 
5:157:11245:16:16:72:543:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:differentiation is  the  major  reason that  MNEs indulge in  imports.  However  they  got extra 
5:158:11339:16:25:72:448:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:benefits from the devaluation in the currency of host country than local firms. 
5:159:11415:25:16:72:543:305:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The phenomena that the exchange rates affect FDI flows shows its influence in a few theoretical 
5:160:11511:16:16:72:542:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:studies, e.g., Froot and Stein (1991), Kohlhagen (1977),and Benassy et al., (2001). Most of these 
5:161:11609:16:16:72:543:273:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:studies conclude that  due  to  the  devaluation in hosting country’s currency host country’s FDI 
5:162:11705:16:16:72:543:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflows become boost up, however, an  appreciation in turns leads towards the reduction in FDI 
5:163:11800:16:16:72:542:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflows. Basically, there are two major channels through which exchange rates reflect its impact 
5:164:11897:16:16:72:543:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on  FDI:  the  first  one  is channel of wealth  effect  and  the  second  one  is channel of relative 
5:165:12000:16:16:72:542:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production  cost  (Froot  and  Stein,  1991;  Xing  and  Zhao,  2003). Reduction  in  the  value  of  the 
5:166:12106:16:15:72:543:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:currency of  FDI’s host  countries  includes  a  reduction  in  cost  of  production  in  terms  of  foreign 
5:167:12214:15:16:72:543:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:currency which in turn boosting up the profit of export oriented foreign investors. However, the 
5:168:12311:16:16:72:542:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:higher  return  attracts  more  inflows  of  FDI.  Empirical  investigation  in  perspective  of  exchange 
5:169:12418:16:16:72:543:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate and FDI nexus is an important icon for the making of both FDI and exchange rate policies. 
5:170:12512:16:28:72:343:130:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, Pakistan is also playing its role in this regard. 
5:171:12570:28:0:72:201:102:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.2. Market Size and FDI 
6:172:12634:0:16:72:543:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The market size and FDI’s relationship  is  elaborated by Resmini  (2000), that  market  size3 is 
6:173:12729:16:16:72:543:684:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:positively  associated  with  FDI.  By  applying  gravity  models  on  bilateral  FDI  flow  from  G54 
6:174:12831:16:16:72:542:668:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:countries  to  22  emerging  markets  over  the  period  1992–2000,  Frenkel et  al., (2004) finds that 
6:175:12934:16:16:72:542:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:host  country  GDP  matters  while  considering  all  home  and  host  countries.  However,  when 
6:176:13032:16:16:72:543:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regionally  separating  the  emerging  markets  into  Asia,  Central  Europe  and  Latin  America,  this 
6:177:13137:16:16:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study finds that GDP matters only in Central Europe and Latin America. Hence, the most widely 
6:178:13231:16:16:72:542:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:used measures of market size are GDP, GDP per capita and growth in GDP. Moosa and Cardak 
6:179:13320:16:15:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2006)  conducted  a  study  on  how  the  domestic  market  size  and  differences  in  factor  costs  can 
6:180:13428:15:16:72:543:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relate  to  the  location  of  FDI.  However,  this  study  states  that  foreign  investors  who  operate  in 
6:181:13539:16:16:72:543:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:industries  characterized  by  relatively  large  economies  of  scale,  the  market  size  and  its  growth 
6:182:13648:16:16:72:543:541:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have  considerable  impact  in  this  regard  as  they  can  exploit  scales  economies  only  after  the 
6:183:13754:16:26:72:259:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market attains a certain threshold size. 
6:184:13794:26:16:72:542:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The impudence of  market  size  on  the  inflows  of  FDI  in  the  empirical  literature  depicts  its 
6:185:13897:16:16:72:543:483:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:positive  image.  The  spillovers  of  FDI  are  attracted  to  those  markets  where  the  MNC’s  can 
6:186:14000:16:16:72:543:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:achieve  reduction  in  the  costs  of  production  and  get  economies  of  scale.  Blonigen  (1997), 
6:187:14102:16:15:72:543:451:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Chakrabarti (2001), and Moosa and Cardak (2006) found positive influence of market size in the 
6:188:14197:15:16:72:543:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:game  of  attracting  FDI.  By  using  cross-section  data  of  135  countries,  Chakrabarti  (2001) 
6:189:14298:16:16:72:542:420:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:conducts an extreme bound analysis and finds that market size attracts FDI. Moosa  and Cardak 
6:190:14392:16:16:72:542:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2006) uses cross-section data of 138 countries for the period 1998–2000 and do extreme bound 
6:191:14486:16:16:72:543:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:analysis.  The  findings  of  this  study  provide  evidence  in  support  of  the  study  of  Chakrabarti 
6:192:14593:16:26:72:393:372:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:(2001) which depicts the positive influence of market size on FDI. 
6:193:14659:26:16:72:543:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Mina (2007) determines the location advantages in GCC countries. This study concludes that the 
6:194:14754:16:15:72:543:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:location  advantages  gain  their  emergence  from  the  assets  that  foreign  markets  supply  and  these 
6:195:14862:15:16:72:542:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assets  include  abundant  natural  resources,  cheap factors  of  production,  large  market  size,  and 
6:196:14968:16:16:72:543:299:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:appropriate business environment. However, these factors attract the firms to produce and trade 
6:197:15064:16:16:72:543:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:across  the  border.  Khan  and  Nawaz  (2010)  conclude  that  foreign  investors  invest  in  those 
6:198:15166:16:16:72:542:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries  where  they  got  new  opportunities.  However,  the  foreign  investors  tap  the  domestic 
6:199:15270:16:16:72:543:251:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market and thus the market size has considerable importance in this regard. The larger the market 
6:200:15368:16:26:72:388:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:size, the higher will be the opportunities and economies of scale.  
6:201:15435:26:26:72:220:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.3. Human Capital and FDI 
6:202:15460:26:15:72:543:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Borensztein et  al.,  (1998) concludes  that  the  countries  having  less  human  capital  have  negative 
6:203:15567:15:16:72:543:168:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:influence  on  the  growth  of  FDI.  However,  once  the  human  capital  passes  through  a  threshold, 
6:204:15673:16:20:72:542:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these countries realize larger  FDI inflows and positive growth-effect.  The rationale behind this 
6:205:15772:20:8:72:218:132:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:                                                           
6:206:15830:8:16:72:541:124:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f7:3 “It is usually measured by GDP per capita and population size to capture actual market demand and absolute 
6:207:15938:16:11:72:180:108:10:g_d0_f7:10:Times New Roman:market size, respectively”. 
6:208:15965:11:7:72:74:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman: 
6:209:15965:7:16:72:539:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:4 “The G-5 countries are the combination of Germany, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States”. 
6:210:16075:16:0:72:74:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman: 
7:211:16116:0:16:72:543:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is  that  the  countries  with  sufficiently  high  levels  of  human  capital  can  exploit  the  more 
7:212:16220:16:16:72:543:684:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:technological spillovers associated with FDI.  UNCTAD (2000) states that Ireland’s success in 
7:213:16314:16:16:72:543:668:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attracting  FDI  in  the  electronics  industry  has  been  due  to  its  educated  skilled  human  resources 
7:214:16424:16:16:72:543:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which allow TNCs to set up and arrange an efficient outclass plants and equipments and get the 
7:215:16519:16:26:72:457:636:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:benefits through targeting the world’s leading electronics firms in that country.  
7:216:16601:26:16:72:542:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Multinational firms usually have higher labor productivity and capacity than the domestic firms; 
7:217:16698:16:16:72:543:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:however, the increase in the share of FDI depicts its positive correlation with plant productivity 
7:218:16797:16:15:72:543:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  host  countries  (Aitken  and  Harrison,  1994).  There  is  a  lack  of  consensus  among  the 
7:219:16897:15:16:72:543:563:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:researchers  related  to  the  success  of  many  developing  countries  in  attracting  FDI  due  to  their 
7:220:17006:16:16:72:543:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:human  capital  (Hausmann,  2000).  Noorbakhsh  and  Alberto  (2001)  argue  that  developing 
7:221:17100:16:16:72:543:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries must pay attention to enhance their attractiveness as a location for FDI by dominating 
7:222:17197:16:16:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policies  that  raise  the  level  of  local  skills  and  enhance  the  human  resource  capabilities.  The 
7:223:17306:16:16:72:542:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:finding of this study concludes that the human capital is a statistically significant determinant of 
7:224:17406:16:16:72:542:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:FDI  inflows.  Moreover  this  study  also  argues  that  the  importance  of  FDI  has  increased 
7:225:17505:16:16:72:543:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significantly through time. Blomstromand Kokko (2003) discusses the relationship between FDI 
7:226:17598:16:15:72:543:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and human capital and state that FDI inflows cause a potential for spillovers of knowledge to the 
7:227:17696:15:16:72:542:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:local human capital. Moreover, the level of human capital in host country determines how much 
7:228:17790:16:16:72:543:420:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:FDI it can attract and absorb which ultimately provides potential spillover benefits. Hence, it is 
7:229:17889:16:16:72:543:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possible that host economies with relatively high levels of human capital  may be  able to attract 
7:230:17988:16:16:72:543:388:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:large  amounts  of  technology-oriented  foreign  MNC’s,  which  contribute  significantly  to  the 
7:231:18088:16:26:72:262:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development of local labor force skills. 
7:232:18128:26:16:72:543:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Khan (2007) concludes that human capital is a major icon and a competitive edge in uplifting the 
7:233:18225:16:15:72:542:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy  through  increases  in  productivity  and  through  the  value  added  services.  Shahbaz  and 
7:234:18329:15:16:72:543:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Rehman (2010) conclude that the human capital stock enhance economic growth. Asgher et al., 
7:235:18421:16:16:72:543:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2012)  state  that  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  human  capital  and  economic growth. 
7:236:18526:16:16:72:543:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However,  there  is  a  need  to  design  and  apply  effective  economic  policies  in  order  to  reap 
7:237:18631:16:26:72:264:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:maximum benefits from human capital. 
7:238:18667:26:16:72:543:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After reviewing the existing literature related to the role of exchange rate market size and human 
7:239:18766:16:16:72:542:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capital for attracting the FDI spillovers, it is concluded that there is a lack of concusses about the 
7:240:18869:16:16:72:543:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:role of various variables discussed in attracting FDI. At bottom line, this study will highlight the 
7:241:18970:16:15:72:466:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:role of ingredients included in this model and also fill the gap in case of Pakistan.

7:245:19108:16:14:90:93:130:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:246:19108:14:16:72:543:116:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  data  has  been  collected  from  World  Development  Indicators  (WDI)  with  annual  frequency 
7:247:19210:16:16:72:543:100:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:over the period of 1985-2010. The variables included in the model are: foreign direct investment 
7:248:19307:16:0:72:543:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(FDI), exchange rate (EXGR), market size (MAS), and human capital (HUC).The purpose of this 
8:249:19440:0:16:72:543:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study is to determine the motivators for attracting FDI in Pakistan. All the variables included in 
8:250:19537:16:16:72:543:684:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this  study  are  in  log  form  and exchange  rate  of  local  currency – units  per  US$ – (EXGR)  has 
8:251:19640:16:16:72:543:668:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been used as exchange rate in the model, GDP current US$ is used as a proxy for market size and 
8:252:19736:16:16:72:385:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:total labor force in Pakistan is a proxy for human capital (HUC).

8:255:19836:26:16:72:542:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The aim of this study is to investigate the motivators of FDI inflows in case of Pakistan. There is 
8:256:19935:16:15:72:542:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an application of Log-linear model in this study – as Layson (1983) concludes that the log-linear 
8:257:20032:15:16:72:543:563:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:form provides more reliable and comprehensive results than linear form. However, Shahbaz and 
8:258:20125:16:16:72:543:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Rahman  (2010)  also conclude  that  the  findings  with  a  log-linear  specification  are  more 
8:259:20223:16:16:72:520:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:authenticated than linear specification. Hence, functional form of log-linear is quoted below:

8:272:20730:16:15:72:184:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3.3.1. Unit Root Tests  
8:273:20752:15:16:72:543:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Stationarity  checking  is  a  preemptory  measure  before  the  application  of  any  econometric  work. 
8:274:20858:16:16:72:542:271:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spurious  results5 may  achieve  if  the  data  of  the  variables  is  non-stationary  (Granger  and 
8:275:20959:16:16:72:543:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Newbold, 1974). However, non-stationary data leads to incorrect inferences. It is therefore very 
8:276:21056:16:16:72:543:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:important that series should be stationary. For this, we use the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) 
8:277:21151:16:16:72:500:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root tests to check the order of integration of the variables.

8:281:21399:16:28:72:542:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by Pesaran et al., (2001). This procedure is also known as bounds testing approach and has many

8:283:21553:7:16:72:542:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:5“Spurious results mean the high value of R-square,  a  highly  significant  t-ratio  and  the  variables  of  the  proposed 
8:284:21678:16:12:72:543:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:model  have no interrelationships. If the  value  of R-square  is greater than Durbin-Watson Statistics  (DWS), then it 
8:285:21798:12:11:72:205:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:Times New Roman:represents spurious regression”.

9:308:22217:0:16:72:543:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:econometric  advantages  over  other  co-integration  procedures.  Mostly  the  Engle  and  Granger 
9:309:22317:16:16:72:543:684:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1987) and Johasen–Juselius (1990) tests were utilized to determine the cointegration among the 
9:310:22413:16:16:72:543:668:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attributes indulged in the model but the preemptory measure for these tests is that all ingredients 
9:311:22510:16:16:72:542:652:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:should be on I(1) – stationary at first difference. However, ARDL bounds testing approach didn’t 
9:312:22604:16:16:72:542:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have such kind of limitation and provides accurate results as either variable are stationary at I (0) 
9:313:22705:16:16:72:543:620:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:– at  level – or  even  fractionally  co-integrated  (Pesaran  and  Pesaran,  1997).  Endogeneity 
9:314:22801:16:16:72:543:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problems  in  Engle  Granger  method  is  also  handled  by  ARDL  cointegration  approach  and  now 
9:315:22902:16:15:72:542:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  long- and  short-run  parameters  of  the  model  can  be  estimated  simultaneously,  hence  all  the 
9:316:23009:15:16:72:543:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables  are  assumed  as  endogenous.  ARDL  is  more  dynamic  technique  and  provides  better 
9:317:23109:16:16:72:542:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:results for small sample sizes than rest of the co-integration techniques but ARDL bound testing 
9:318:23205:16:16:72:542:541:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:approach  is  not  applicable  if  any  of  the  variable  is  integrated  at  I(2)  or  above.  On  the  basis  of 
9:319:23321:16:16:72:543:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:above  scenario,  the  following  model  is  specified  for  the  application  of  ARDL  bounds  testing

9:331:23759:15:16:72:543:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Engle  and  Granger  (1987) visualize  the  relationship  between  co  integration,  error  correction 
9:332:23861:16:16:72:542:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(EC) and error correction model (ECM). The functionality of ECM is to provide clue about the

9:343:24412:15:16:72:543:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Wald  test will  provide the value of F-statistics which  in  turns tells  us  the  long- or  short- run 
9:344:24514:16:16:72:542:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship  of  the  variables  included  in  the  model.  Pesaran et  al.,  (2001) described  the  critical 
9:345:24624:16:16:72:542:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:values which were utilized to get comparison with respect to the value of the F-statistics. If the

9:347:24834:16:0:72:543:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rejection  of  null  hypothesis  and  if  it  is  less  than  lower  bound  then  the  null  hypothesis  will  be

10:352:25109:16:16:72:206:684:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considered as inconclusive.

10:358:25341:15:16:72:543:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1975). The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests are also utilized to test a null hypothesis of constancy 
10:359:25434:16:16:72:476:575:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for parameter over the sample and these figure plots were used in decision making.

10:362:25550:26:16:72:543:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Before  applying  econometric  techniques,  stationarity  of  variables  are  tested.  In  this  regard  the 
10:363:25659:16:16:72:543:501:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:results of ADF and PP unit root tests are summarized in table 1. However, ln(FDI) and ln(HUC) 
10:364:25753:16:16:72:543:485:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are  stationary  at  first  difference  at  1%  significance  level,  whereas,  ln(EXGR)  and  ln(MAS)  are 
10:365:25861:16:15:72:542:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stationary on first difference at 5% level of significance.  In this scenario ARDL approach to co 
10:366:25959:15:16:72:202:454:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:integration can be applied.

13:472:30347:26:16:72:542:452:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This study aimed to  determine the role of exchange  rate,  market  size and  human  capital  for 
13:473:30441:16:16:72:543:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attracting FDI in Pakistan. The motive behind this study was to give a bottom line related to the 
13:474:30536:16:16:72:543:420:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ingredients included in this study, that either they contribute towards getting more share of FDI 
13:475:30627:16:16:72:542:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or  not. However,  this work  will  provide some  guidelines  for the  policy  makers  in  Pakistan  for 
13:476:30730:16:15:72:543:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:getting more market share of FDI as compared to the other countries that have less capacity and 
13:477:30825:15:16:72:542:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources  but have more  share  of  FDI  as compared to  Pakistan. ADF  and  PP  unit  root  tests  are

13:490:31920:16:16:72:542:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stability  of  model.  The  results  show the long  run  relationship among the  variables that  are 
13:491:32020:16:16:72:542:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considered in the model and Pakistan should consider the parameters of this study for attracting 
13:492:32115:16:15:72:388:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more FDI which will results in its economic growth and stability. 
13:493:32180:15:16:72:75:119:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
13:494:32180:16:16:72:543:103:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:By keeping in view the above scenarios, the following prescriptions will be helpful for the policy 
13:495:32277:16:0:72:542:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:makers  for getting more  inflows  of  FDI  in Pakistan. Government of  Pakistan  should strictly 
14:496:32610:0:16:72:542:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:follow the policy of trade and not aid and the step of granting most favorite nation status to the 
14:497:32708:16:16:72:543:684:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fellow  countries  will  be  fruitful  in  this  regard  as  Pakistan  increase  its  trade  and create friendly 
14:498:32820:16:16:72:542:668:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relations  with  the  other  countries  which will become  the  cause  of its economic  prosperity  and 
14:499:32922:16:16:72:542:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:success. Excessive  borrowing  and  depreciation  of  exchange  rate  are  most  distressing and 
14:500:33019:16:16:72:543:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deplorable  economic  problems  which  need urgent  solution. State  Bank  of  Pakistan  and  other 
14:501:33117:16:16:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:responsible institutions must make sure the stability of exchange rate and government should pay 
14:502:33213:16:16:72:542:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attention in  providing  a  peaceful  economic environment to  the investors that will encourage 
14:503:33304:16:15:72:542:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:private investment and FDI. Human capital is a major icon in uplifting the economy of a country. 
14:504:33401:15:16:72:542:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Educational and training institutions with the collaboration of government of Pakistan and other 
14:505:33497:16:16:72:542:557:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:NGO’s like United Nations Organizations (UNO), International Labor Union (ILO) and all other 
14:506:33588:16:16:72:542:541:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions  which claim themselves as  stakeholders in  the wellbeing of  the  people  and  human 
14:507:33685:16:16:72:542:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights, to provide skilled, technical and information technology literate persons, so that Pakistan 
14:508:33785:16:16:72:543:509:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can  compete  in  the entire world  which  will  result  in  its  economic  solidarity,  independence  in 
14:509:33890:16:16:72:543:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decision  making  and  economic  growth. Among  these,  the  most  important issues  which need 
14:510:33984:16:16:72:543:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attention are that the Ministry of Commerce and Trade with the collaboration of the Ministry of 
14:511:34080:16:15:72:542:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finance  and  Investment in  Pakistan  must  grant tax  exemptions  to  the firms  satisfying  certain 
14:512:34182:15:16:72:543:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conditions under the tax free zone scheme, provide skilled labor force, a stable political scenario 
14:513:34281:16:16:72:542:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and a relatively corruption free environment to the investors who want to invest in Pakistan. The 
14:514:34375:16:16:72:543:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:limitations  of  this  study  are  that  the  choice  of  proxies  for  this  study  is  according  to  the 
14:515:34483:16:16:72:543:398:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:circumstances  of  Pakistan  so  that’s  why  it may  lack  the  generalizability  element for  other 
14:516:34585:16:16:72:543:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries in  case  of  proxies  used  in  this  study  to  prove  the  problem  statement. For  further 
14:517:34689:16:16:72:506:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recommendations of research, this model can be manipulated as per current requirements.
