2:25:1173:31:19:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We  study  the  extent  to  which  decisions  to  expand  firm  size  are  associated  with  increases  in
2:26:1279:19:19:71:539:573:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:subsequent  CEO  compensation.  Controlling  for  past  stock  performance,  we  find  a  positive
2:27:1377:19:19:71:539:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:correlation between CEO compensation and the CEO's past decisions to increase firm size. This
2:28:1470:19:19:71:539:535:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:correlation is economically meaningful; for example, other things being equal, CEOs who in the
2:29:1564:19:19:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:preceding three years were in the top quartile in terms of expanding by increasing the number of
2:30:1660:19:20:71:539:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:shares outstanding receive compensation that is higher by one-third than the compensation of CEOs
2:31:1757:20:19:71:539:477:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:belonging to the bottom quartile. We also find that stock returns are correlated with subsequent CEO
2:32:1857:19:19:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:pay only to the extent that they contribute to expanding firm size; only the component of past stock
2:33:1957:19:19:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:returns  not  distributed  as  dividends  is  correlated  with  subsequent  CEO  pay.  Finally,  we  find  an
2:34:2066:19:19:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:asymmetry between increases and decreases in size: while increases in firm size are followed by
2:35:2161:19:19:71:539:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:higher CEO pay, decreases in firm size are not followed by reduction in such pay. The association
2:36:2258:19:19:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:we find between CEOs' compensation and firm-expanding decisions undertaken earlier during their
2:37:2353:19:27:71:380:363:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:service could provide CEOs with incentives to expand firm size.

3:47:2574:0:16:75:155:717:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:1. Introduction 
3:48:2590:16:21:75:81:701:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  
3:49:2592:21:21:75:538:680:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  A  long-standing  view  in  economics  and  finance  holds  that  managers  have  an  excessive  
3:50:2691:21:20:75:540:659:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:incentive  to  expand  the  size  of  their  firm,  (e.g.,  Baumol  (1959),  Jensen  (1986),  Morck,  
3:51:2793:20:21:75:534:639:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Shleifer,  and  Vishny  (1990)).  On  this  view,  managers  could  choose  to  make  some  value-
3:52:2891:21:21:75:539:618:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:decreasing  acquisitions,  as  well  as  to  retain  excessive  cash  flow  instead  of  distributing  it  to  
3:53:3002:21:20:75:538:597:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shareholders.  Managers  might  act  in  this  way  because  increasing  firm  size  could  serve  their  
3:54:3108:20:21:75:538:577:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:private interests in various ways. Among other things, Jensen (1986) suggests that expanding 
3:55:3201:21:21:75:475:556:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:firm size might benefit managers by enabling them to obtain larger executive pay.  
3:56:3284:21:20:75:537:535:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B: The view that firm expansion might be rewarded by higher executive pay relies in part on 
3:57:3373:20:21:75:537:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the observation that pay and firm size appear to be correlated. As many studies document (see, 
3:58:3468:21:21:75:537:494:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:e.g., Core, Holthausen, and Larcker (1999), and Cyert, Kang, and Kumar (2002))—and as any 
3:59:3558:21:21:75:536:473:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:casual look at compensation tables published by the financial press suggests—larger firms tend 
3:60:3653:21:20:75:539:452:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:to  provide  their  CEOs  with  larger  pay  packages.  However,  upon  reflection,  the  correlation  
3:61:3756:20:21:75:538:432:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:between  firm  size  and  CEO  pay  does  not  establish  that  CEOs  could  increase  the  size  of  their  
3:62:3865:21:21:75:536:411:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:pay package by expanding firm size or that CEO pay is correlated with the CEO’s own choices 
3:63:3957:21:20:75:317:390:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:whether (and to what extent) to expand firm size.  
3:64:4008:20:21:75:538:370:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  For  example,  suppose  that  the  compensation  of  continuing  CEOs  at  any  given  year  is  a  
3:65:4110:21:21:75:538:349:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:function  only  of  (i)  the  size  of  the  firm  when  the  executive  started  serving  as  a  CEO  (say,  
3:66:4220:21:20:75:538:328:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:because  firms  with  a  larger  size  seek  to  attract  more  talented  executives),  and  (ii)  the  stock  
3:67:4331:20:21:75:539:308:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:performance  of  the  company  during  the  CEO’s  service  thus  far.  If  boards  act  in  this  way,  
3:68:4436:21:21:75:537:287:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expanding the size of the firm will by itself (i.e., putting aside any effect it might have on stock 
3:69:4537:21:20:75:538:266:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:returns)  have  no  effect  on  the  CEO’s  subsequent  compensation.  In  such  a  case,  however,  we  
3:70:4642:20:21:75:537:246:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:will still observe a correlation between CEOs’ current compensation and the size of their firms 
3:71:4738:21:21:75:537:225:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:because the size of a continuing CEO’s firm is likely to be correlated both with the firm’s size 
3:72:4835:21:21:75:537:204:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:when the CEO began serving and with the stock performance during the CEO’s service. Thus, 
3:73:4925:21:20:75:537:183:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:to identify whether the prospect of higher subsequent pay could provide CEOs with incentives 
3:74:5018:20:21:75:537:163:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:to expand firm size, we need to investigate whether past CEO decisions to expand are followed 
3:75:5112:21:21:75:537:142:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:by a compensation increase beyond the increase due to improved performance associated with 
3:76:5203:21:20:75:424:121:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:these expansions (if any). We pursue such an investigation in this study. 
3:77:5277:20:21:75:537:101:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B: We find that a CEO’s compensation is correlated with the firm’s stock performance during 
3:78:5366:21:21:75:536:80:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the preceding years of the CEO’s service. We also find, however, that, controlling for such past 
3:79:5463:21:0:75:538:59:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:performance,  a  CEO’s  compensation,  as  well  as  the  change  in  the  CEO’s  compensation  from  
4:80:5567:0:20:75:536:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:earlier levels, is correlated with increases in the firm’s size — in terms of either assets or sales 
4:81:5668:20:21:75:330:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:— during the preceding years of the CEO’s service.  
4:82:5720:21:21:75:540:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:      We  further  investigate  the  association  between  pay  and  size-expansion  decisions  by  
4:83:5820:21:20:75:537:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:decomposing  changes  in  firm  size  into  two  components:  increases  in  shares  outstanding  and  
4:84:5923:20:21:75:538:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increases  in  size  (whether  measured  by  assets  or  sales)  per  share.  We  find  that,  other  things  
4:85:6033:21:21:75:538:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:being equal, a CEO’s current pay is correlated with the rate of growth in the number of shares 
4:86:6128:21:20:75:536:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:outstanding during the CEO’s preceding service. This rate of share growth is the product of (i) 
4:87:6224:20:21:75:538:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:issuance  of  shares  to  finance  acquisitions,  (ii)  issuance  of  shares  to  finance  investments  and  
4:88:6333:21:21:75:537:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:internal  expansion,  (iii)  issuances  of  shares  to  finance  compensation  to  employees  (in  lieu  of  
4:89:6442:21:21:75:537:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:paying them in cash, which reduces firm size), and (iv) decisions whether to repurchase shares 
4:90:6537:21:20:75:539:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:(which  operate  to  reduce  firm  size  and  share  growth).  By  increasing  the  number  of  shares  
4:91:6641:20:21:75:537:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:outstanding, a CEO can increase firm size without necessarily increasing shareholder returns. 
4:92:6735:21:21:75:538:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:The  identified  correlation  between  CEO  pay  and  preceding  growth  of  shares  outstanding  is  
4:93:6837:21:20:75:538:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:economically  meaningful:  Holding  all  else  constant,  the  average  compensation  in  firms  that  
4:94:6940:20:21:75:536:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:belong to the top quartile in terms of change in shares outstanding in the preceding three years 
4:95:7037:21:21:75:502:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:is higher by about one-third than the average compensation given to the bottom quartile. 
4:96:7126:21:20:75:537:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  We  also  find  that,  other  things  being  equal  (including  past  stock  returns),  a  CEO’s  pay  is  
4:97:7235:20:21:75:537:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:correlated with the increase in assets per share and sales per share during the CEO’s preceding 
4:98:7331:21:21:75:540:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:service.  This  association  is  also  economically  meaningful.  Holding  all  else  constant,  the  
4:99:7433:21:20:75:538:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:average compensation in firms that belong to the top quartile in terms of increasing per share 
4:100:7528:20:21:75:542:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:sales   during   the   preceding   three   years   is   higher   by   about   one-fifth   than   the   average   
4:101:7641:21:21:75:538:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  given  to  the  bottom  quartile.  Similarly,  holding  all  else  constant,  the  average  
4:102:7747:21:21:75:538:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  in  firms  that  belong  to  the  top  quartile  in  terms  of  increasing  per  share  assets  
4:103:7857:21:20:75:537:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:during the preceding three years is higher by about one-fourth than the average compensation 
4:104:7950:20:21:75:538:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:given  to  the  bottom  quartile.  Because  strategies  that  would  maximize  per  share  sales  or  per  
4:105:8057:21:21:75:537:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:share assets might differ from ones that would maximize stockholder returns, these finding are 
4:106:8152:21:20:75:319:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:also relevant for assessing executives’ incentives.  
4:107:8205:20:21:75:540:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:      We  also  decompose  past  stock  returns  under  a  continuing  CEO  into  the  capital  gain  
4:108:8307:21:21:75:540:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:component—that  is,  the  part  of  the  return  not  paid  out  as  dividends—and  the  dividend  
4:109:8406:21:20:75:537:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:component. We find that a CEO’s compensation is correlated with the capital gain component 
4:110:8497:20:21:75:536:97:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:of the stock returns under the CEO’s preceding service, but we do not find such correlation for 
4:111:8593:21:21:75:539:76:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the  dividend  component.  Because  the  dividend  component  of  total  stock  returns  does  not  
4:112:8693:21:0:75:538:55:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:contribute  to  firm  size  (even  though  it  does  contribute  to  shareholder  wealth),  this  finding  is  
5:113:8806:0:20:75:537:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:consistent with the general positive correlation we find between firm-expanding decisions and 
5:114:8900:20:21:75:188:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:higher subsequent pay. 
5:115:8923:21:21:75:540:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:      Our  analysis  of  the  expansion-compensation  correlation  also  identifies  an  asymmetry  
5:116:9023:21:20:75:537:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:between increases and decreases in firm size.1 The positive correlation between compensation 
5:117:9116:20:21:75:538:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:and  size  is  driven  by  firms  that  increase  firm  size  and  not  by  firms  that  decrease  firm  size.  
5:118:9228:21:21:75:537:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:There  is  correlation  between  size  changes  and  compensation  among  CEOs  who  increase  firm  
5:119:9329:21:20:75:320:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:size but not among CEOs who decrease firm size.  
5:120:9378:20:21:93:541:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We  should  stress  that  CEOs’  firm-expansion  decisions  are  influenced  not  only  by  
5:121:9470:21:21:75:540:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expectations  that  expansion  will  be  followed  by  higher  subsequent  pay  but  also  by  the  
5:122:9570:21:21:75:537:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expected effect that expansion decisions will have on the value of options and shares given to 
5:123:9665:21:20:75:539:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the  CEOs  earlier  as  part  of  their  compensation  packages.  Other  things  being  equal,  such  
5:124:9767:20:21:75:541:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:holdings   of   shares   and   options   operate   to   align   CEOs’   incentives   with   those   of   the   
5:125:9878:21:21:75:538:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shareholders.  Indeed,  there  is  evidence  that  CEOs  with  larger  holdings  of  shares  and  options  
5:126:9985:21:20:75:539:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:are  less  likely  to  make  value-decreasing  acquisition  decisions  (see,  e.g.,  Amihud  and  Lev  
5:127:10088:20:21:75:538:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:(1981),  Lewellen  and  Loderer  (1984)).  However,  as  we  shall  discuss  in  the  next  section,  for  
5:128:10195:21:21:75:540:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:any  given  level  of  managerial  holdings  of  shares  and  options,  CEOs’  decisions  will  be  
5:129:10295:21:20:75:537:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:distorted in the direction of excessive size expansion if expansion can be expected to produce 
5:130:10390:20:21:75:188:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:higher subsequent pay. 
5:131:10413:21:21:75:539:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  We  should  also  emphasize  that  our  findings  of  correlation  between  firm  expansion  and  
5:132:10513:21:20:75:538:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsequent  pay  does  not  indicate  that  current  compensation  practices  are  suboptimal.  To  be  
5:133:10617:20:21:75:541:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:sure,  such  correlation  might  be  the  result  of  boards’  use  of  benchmarking  by  size  that  
5:134:10719:21:21:75:538:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  consultants  recommend  (Hall  and  Murphy  (2003),  Bebchuk  and  Fried  (2004)).  
5:135:10817:21:21:75:537:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:However, such correlation could also result from arm’s length contracting between boards and 
5:136:10910:21:20:75:538:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:managers.  For  example,  a  larger  firm  size  might  make  it  desirable  to  provide  the  CEO  with  
5:137:11016:20:21:75:537:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:more powerful incentives (Baker and Hall (2004)), and it also might strengthen the manager’s 
5:138:11109:21:21:75:538:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:bargaining  position  by  increasing  the  cost  to  the  company  of  replacing  the  manager  or  by  
5:139:11213:21:20:75:537:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:providing the manager with experience that enhances the value of outside opportunities. Thus, 
5:140:11307:20:21:75:537:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:even though a connection between firm expansion and subsequent pay might distort managers’ 
5:141:11398:21:21:75:472:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:ex ante choices, having such a connection might be necessary or optimal overall.   
5:142:11481:21:20:75:540:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:      While  our  results  do  not  necessarily  indicate  that  current  compensation  patterns  are  
5:143:11584:20:15:75:536:97:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:suboptimal, they validate the concern expressed by Jensen (1986) and others that compensation 
5:144:11678:15:9:75:222:82:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:                                                 
5:145:11726:9:19:75:538:73:49:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:F:1  Our  analysis  of  this  issue  is  in  the  spirit  of  Garvey  and  Milbourn  (2005),  who  study  whether  pay  
5:146:11844:19:0:75:385:54:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:F:responds differently to positive and negative changes in stock returns. 
6:147:11918:0:20:75:537:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:practices provide managers with incentives to expand firm size. Recognition and study of these 
6:148:12013:20:21:75:537:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:incentives are important for understanding firms’ decisions to issue shares,  make  acquisitions  
6:149:12111:21:21:75:452:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:and investments, and distribute cash through cash dividends and repurchases.  
6:150:12189:21:20:75:539:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  managers’  expansion  decisions  might  be  influenced  by  
6:151:12290:20:21:75:537:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:factors other than the effect of these decisions on the managers’ current holdings of shares and 
6:152:12387:21:21:75:538:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:options  and  their  subsequent  compensation.  A  distortion  in  favor  of  expansion  produced  by  
6:153:12490:21:20:75:537:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  practices  could  be  strengthened  by  expectations  that  expansion  would  increase  
6:154:12592:20:21:75:540:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:managers’  power  and  prestige  or  make  a  takeover  less  likely.  A  distortion  in  favor  of  
6:155:12693:21:21:75:539:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expansion,  however,  might  also  be  mitigated  by  the  presence  of  large  block-holders  and  
6:156:12793:21:21:75:536:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:vigilant boards (which might lead to the firing of underperforming CEOs), by career concerns, 
6:157:12887:21:20:75:537:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:by the market for corporate control, by the larger effort levels required to manage larger firms, 
6:158:12985:20:21:75:537:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:or by other factors that might operate to discourage managers from producing low returns for 
6:159:13078:21:21:75:537:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shareholders  (see,  e.g.,  Benston  (1985),  Rosen  (1992)).  Thus,  assessing  whether  and  to  what  
6:160:13183:21:20:75:539:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:extent  firm-expansion  decisions  are  rewarded  by  compensation  practices  –  our  aim  in  this  
6:161:13285:20:21:75:537:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:paper – is necessary but not sufficient for a full understanding of managers’ private incentives 
6:162:13382:21:21:75:230:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:with respect to firm expansion.  
6:163:13415:21:20:75:537:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  discusses  the  question  we  
6:164:13522:20:21:75:539:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:seek  to  investigate  and  the  prior  empirical  work  on  the  subject.  Section  III  presents  our  
6:165:13627:21:19:75:280:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:empirical analysis. Section IV concludes.  
6:166:13670:19:19:75:78:326:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:F: 
6:167:13670:19:35:75:271:307:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:2. Research questions and Prior work 
6:168:13707:35:34:75:222:272:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:2.1. Jensen’s conjecture  
6:169:13732:34:21:93:537:238:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:A good statement of the conjecture we seek to study can be found in Jensen (1986). Jensen 
6:170:13822:21:21:75:537:217:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:argues  that  “managers  have  incentive  to  cause  their  firms  to  grow  beyond  the  optimal  size.”  
6:171:13929:21:21:75:537:196:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Some of these incentives, Jensen suggests, arise from the fact that growth is “associated with 
6:172:14024:21:20:75:267:175:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f5:B:increases in managers’ compensation.”  
6:173:14062:20:21:93:538:155:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:The  concern  about  CEOs’  incentives  arises  from  the  plausible  assumption  that  CEOs  can  
6:174:14161:21:21:75:539:134:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:have  considerable  influence  on  changes  in  firm  size.  While  some  relevant  decisions  (e.g.,  
6:175:14264:21:20:75:542:113:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:decisions   to   make   acquisitions   or   distributions)   are   made   by   the   board,   CEOs   wield   
6:176:14373:20:21:75:538:93:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:considerable  influence  on  whether  the  issue  will reach the board and on the board’s decision. 
6:177:14473:21:0:75:537:72:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEOs are likely to have information that directors do not have, and they are often the ones that 
7:178:14572:0:20:75:540:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:initiate  firm-expansion  decisions  and  make  proposals  and  recommendations  to  the  board.  
7:179:14670:20:21:75:537:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Which decisions concerning firm size would be value-maximizing is not observable and, thus 
7:180:14761:21:21:75:538:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:commonly,  cannot  be  decided  by  the  board  (or  directly  by  shareholders)  without  any  input  
7:181:14864:21:20:75:537:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:from  the  firm’s  top  executives.  As  a  result,  CEOs  can  influence  the  firm-expansion  decisions  
7:182:14971:20:21:75:483:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:that their firms make, and this influence in turn is shaped by their private incentives. 
7:183:15060:21:21:93:537:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Compensation  practices  affect  CEOs’  payoffs  from  decisions  concerning  firm  size  in  two  
7:184:15159:21:20:75:536:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:ways. First, compensation arrangements provide CEOs with options and shares, and CEOs will 
7:185:15250:20:21:75:537:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:likely take into account the effect of their decisions on the value of the portfolio of shares and 
7:186:15349:21:21:75:538:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:options  they  hold  as  a  result  of  prior  compensation  decisions.  Second,  CEOs  might  well  take  
7:187:15456:21:21:75:540:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:into  account  how  their  decisions  will  affect  the  value  of  (both  cash  and  equity-based)  
7:188:15557:21:20:75:338:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation that they can expect to receive later on.  
7:189:15613:20:21:93:539:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:There  are  several  reasons  why  CEOs  might  expect  an  increasing  firm  size  to  lead  to  
7:190:15711:21:21:75:537:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increased compensation in subsequent periods. Even assuming that the board is solely focused 
7:191:15804:21:20:75:538:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:on  shareholder  interests  and  engages  in  arm’s-length  contracting  with  the  CEO,  a  larger  firm  
7:192:15911:20:21:75:537:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:size might lead the board to grant higher pay. An increased firm size might make it desirable to 
7:193:16008:21:21:75:537:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:provide the CEO with more powerful incentives; might provide the manager with experience, 
7:194:16098:21:20:75:537:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:visibility, and connections that could enhance the CEO’s outside options; and might strengthen 
7:195:16193:20:21:75:537:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the CEO’s bargaining position also by raising the costs of replacing the CEO with a new one. 
7:196:16286:21:21:75:538:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:In  addition,  because  a  board  might  seek  to  maintain  some  parity  with  compensation  in  peer  
7:197:16391:21:20:75:539:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:companies  to  avoid  morale  and  prestige  issues,  a  larger  firm  size  could  lead  to  the  CEO’s  
7:198:16497:20:21:75:440:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation being compared to that in larger companies with higher pay.  
7:199:16571:21:21:93:534:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:From  the  shareholders’  perspective,  the  only  relevant  question  is  how  a  given  firm-
7:200:16666:21:21:75:537:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expansion decision will affect returns. From the manager’s private perspective, however, both 
7:201:16760:21:20:75:537:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:return and size matter, which means that the manager’s decision would be distorted in favor of 
7:202:16855:20:21:75:538:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:firm  expansion.  As  long  as  the  CEO  can  expect  an  increase  in  the  firm  size  to  increase  the  
7:203:16964:21:21:75:536:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO’s subsequent compensation, this expectation would introduce a distortion, on the margin, 
7:204:17057:21:20:75:538:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in  favor  of  such  a  size  expansion.  The  CEO’s  current  holdings  of  shares  and  options  could  
7:205:17163:20:21:75:368:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:mitigate the magnitude of this distortion but not eliminate it. 
7:206:17227:21:21:93:537:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:To illustrate, consider a CEO who serves for two periods and is expected to receive in the 
7:207:17318:21:20:75:537:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:beginning of each period 1% of the firm’s shares. And suppose that during the first period, the 
7:208:17414:20:21:75:541:97:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO  faces  an  opportunity  to  make  a  stock-financed  acquisition  that  would  double  the  
7:209:17511:21:21:75:537:76:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:company’s number of shares and would change returns to existing shareholders by x%. In this 
7:210:17603:21:0:75:538:55:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:situation,  if  x  is  negative,  the  CEO  will  take  into  account  both  (i)  that  the  acquisition  will  
8:211:17717:0:20:75:538:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:reduce  the  value  of  the  shares  the  CEO  received  in  the  beginning  of  the  first  period,  and  (ii)  
8:212:17830:20:21:75:537:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:that the acquisition will double the number of shares that the CEO will receive in the beginning 
8:213:17927:21:21:75:537:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:of  the  second  period.  Clearly,  there  is  a  range  of  negative  values  that  x  might  take  for  which  
8:214:18040:21:20:75:345:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the CEO will still be better off making the acquisition.   
8:215:18099:20:21:93:538:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:To  see  the  point  more  generally,  consider  a  CEO  who  holds  a  fraction  α  of  a  company’s  
8:216:18202:21:21:75:537:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shares as a result of earlier compensation decisions. Suppose that, without any firm-expansion 
8:217:18297:21:20:75:535:593:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f5:B:decisions, the market value of the company’s shares at the end of the current period will be W0, 
8:218:18394:20:21:75:537:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:and the value of the CEO’s position will thus be αW0.    The CEO now faces an opportunity to 
8:219:18487:21:22:75:536:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:take an action that would increase (some measure of) firm size by γ and will increase the return 
8:220:18584:22:21:75:240:530:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:to the existing shareholders by ρ.  
8:221:18620:21:24:93:537:509:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Suppose also that the compensation to the CEO, ),(γρC, is an increasing function of both 
8:222:18709:24:22:75:537:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the return ρ and the size expansion γ.. In this case, the CEO will decide to expand size if and 
8:223:18804:22:22:75:537:463:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:only if:  C(ρ, γ) + α W0 ρ >0. As long as ∂C / ∂γ > 0, the threshold ρ* over which the CEO 
8:224:18894:22:21:75:539:441:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:will  make  the  acquisition  will  be  negative.  The  intuition  is  that  the  CEO  will  be  making  a  
8:225:19002:21:21:75:537:420:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:positive profit even for a firm-expansion action that breaks even for the existing shareholders 
8:226:19098:21:22:75:536:399:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f5:B:(ρ=0). With ρ=0, the CEO will neither gain nor lose on the CEO’s existing shares but will gain 
8:227:19193:22:21:75:537:377:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:from obtaining a higher compensation in the next period. Thus, the threshold ρ* at which the 
8:228:19286:21:21:75:538:356:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO  breaks  even  from  an  expansion  decision  must  be  negative.  Note  that  the  larger  α  is,  the  
8:229:19395:21:21:75:537:335:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:weaker the distortion. As long as the expansion will bring about a higher next-period pay (i.e., 
8:230:19492:21:21:77:539:314:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f5:B:∂C  /  ∂γ  >  0),  however,  there  will  be  a  distortion  in  favor  of  expansion.  This  association  
8:231:19599:21:21:75:538:293:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:makes  it  important  to  find  out  whether,  under  current  pay  practices,  CEOs  can  expect  that,  
8:232:19705:21:20:75:500:272:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:controlling for stock return performance, expansion will be followed by a pay increase.  
8:233:19794:20:21:93:538:252:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:The  fact  that  an  association  between  firm  expansion  and  subsequent  compensation  might  
8:234:19892:21:21:75:537:231:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:distort firm-expansion decisions does in no way imply that such a connection, if it exists, is a 
8:235:19989:21:21:75:537:210:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:part of suboptimal pay practices. Ex post, i.e., after the expansion decision was made, it might 
8:236:20086:21:21:75:538:189:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:be  efficient  for  pay  setting  to  be  characterized  by  ∂C  /  ∂γ  >  0.  Thus,  optimal  setting  of  pay  
8:237:20199:21:20:75:539:168:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:policy  might  involve  a  tradeoff  between  the  ex  post  benefits  of  increasing  pay  when  size  
8:238:20303:20:21:75:536:148:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increases and the ex ante costs that such a connection might have in terms of distorting earlier 
8:239:20400:21:21:75:534:127:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:firm-expansion decisions. Thus, finding a correlation between compensation and earlier firm-
8:240:20492:21:20:75:538:106:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expansion  decisions  under  the  CEO  does  not  imply  that  existing  compensation  practices  are  
8:241:20595:20:0:75:538:86:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:suboptimal.  But  it  does  indicate  that  these  practices  produce  incentives  to  expand  that  boards  
9:242:20706:0:20:75:538:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:should  recognize,  and  that  researchers  studying  firm  acquisition,  investment,  and  distribution  
9:243:20812:20:21:75:249:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:decisions should take into account.  
9:244:20849:21:21:93:540:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that,  while  we  focus  on  identifying  whether  compensation  
9:245:20947:21:20:75:541:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:practices  provide  incentives  to  expand  firm  size,  such  incentives  may  be  reinforced  or  
9:246:21047:20:21:75:538:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:countervailed  by  other  factors.  Expansion  decisions  might  affect  the  CEO’s  utility  in  ways  
9:247:21151:21:21:75:537:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:other than through their effect on the CEO’s compensation. A larger firm size might affect the 
9:248:21246:21:20:75:538:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO’s  utility  directly  both  positively  (by  enhancing  the  CEO’s  prestige,  power,  perquisites,  
9:249:21351:20:21:75:538:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:etc.)  and  negatively  (by  increasing  the  effort  the  CEO  will  have  to  exert  or  the  pressures  to  
9:250:21462:21:21:75:537:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:which the CEO will be subject). In addition, firm expansion, and the effect that it will have on 
9:251:21559:21:21:75:537:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:returns,  will  affect  the  likelihood  that  the  CEO  will  be  able  to  remain  in  office  as  well  as  the  
9:252:21675:21:20:75:349:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsequent career opportunities that the CEO will have.

9:256:21758:15:20:75:537:433:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:  There  is  a  large  body  of  empirical  literature  on  CEO  compensation  (see  Murphy  (1999),  
9:257:21860:20:21:75:538:413:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:and  Core,  Guay,  and  Larcker  (2003)  for  excellent  surveys).  In  existing  studies,  researchers  
9:258:21965:21:21:75:538:392:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:seeking  to  explain  current  CEO  compensation  often  include  current  firm  size  as  well  as  past  
9:259:22072:21:20:75:539:371:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:stock  return  performance  in  their  regressions.  The  general  findings  in  the  literature  are  that  
9:260:22181:20:21:75:540:351:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO  pay  is  correlated  with  current  firm  size  and  with  the  firm’s  stock  performance  in  
9:261:22282:21:21:75:538:330:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:preceding  years  (see,  e.g.,  Murphy  (1985,  1986),  Jensen  and  Murphy  (1990),  Hubbard  and  
9:262:22382:21:20:75:538:309:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Palia  (1995),  Core,  Holthausen,  and  Larcker  (1999),  Cyert.  Kang,  and  Kumar  (2002)).  Our  
9:263:22483:20:21:75:537:289:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:analysis also finds, unsurprisingly, that compensation is correlated with past stock returns. We 
9:264:22580:21:21:75:538:268:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:seek  to  contribute,  however,  by  adding  as  independent  variables  other  changes  in  the  firm  
9:265:22684:21:21:75:540:247:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:during  the  preceding  years  of  the  CEO’s  service,  including  the  rate  of  growth  of  shares  
9:266:22787:21:20:75:497:226:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:outstanding, the growth in per share assets and per share sales, and dividend decisions.  
9:267:22877:20:21:93:541:206:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:There   has   also   been   some   significant   empirical   work   on   the   connection   between   
9:268:22979:21:21:75:534:185:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  and  decisions  to  make  acquisitions,  which  are  an  important  type  of  firm-
9:269:23076:21:20:75:541:164:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expansion  decisions.  Several  papers  study  how  acquisition  decisions  are  influenced  by  
9:270:23173:20:21:75:537:144:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:managers’ holdings of shares and options at the time of the acquisition decision (Agrawal and

9:272:23368:21:20:75:538:102:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:closely  related  to  our  work  are  several  papers  that  focus  on  how  acquisition  decisions  affect  
9:273:23477:20:0:75:538:82:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsequent  executive  pay.  Bliss  and  Rosen  (2001),  Grinstein  and  Hribar  (2004),  and  Harford  
10:274:23583:0:20:75:539:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:and  Li  (2005)  find  that  acquisitions  have  a  positive  effect  on  subsequent  pay,  but  Avery,  
10:275:23688:20:21:75:356:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Chevalier, and Schaefer(1998) do not find such an effect.  
10:276:23747:21:21:93:538:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We complement the above studies of the association between acquisitions and subsequent 
10:277:23834:21:20:75:536:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:pay by looking at a broader set of expansion decisions and strategies. While these studies focus 
10:278:23931:20:21:75:537:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:on firms that make large acquisitions, some firms grow substantially through a series of small 
10:279:24026:21:21:75:538:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:or  medium  acquisitions  rather  than  one  large  acquisition.  Furthermore,  acquisition  decisions  
10:280:24130:21:20:75:537:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:are not the only decisions made by CEOs that have an effect on firm size. Executives can also 
10:281:24224:20:21:75:536:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increase firm size by raising equity to finance internal expansion, avoiding dividends and share 
10:282:24321:21:21:75:538:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:buybacks,  making  operating  decisions  that  would  increase  sales  or  assets  without  necessarily  
10:283:24426:21:21:75:538:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:contributing  to  profits,  and  so  on  and  so  forth.  Our  strategy  is  to  focus  on  the  correlation  
10:284:24536:21:20:75:539:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:between  a  CEO’s  compensation  and  the  whole  universe  of  the  CEO’s  expanding  decisions  
10:285:24634:20:21:75:295:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:during a period of the past two to four years.  
10:286:24682:21:21:93:540:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  the  significant  literature  that  documents  the  tendency  of  
10:287:24781:21:20:75:538:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:managers  to  make  some  size-increasing  decisions  that  are  not  value-enhancing.  For  example,  
10:288:24884:20:21:75:538:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:there  is  a  significant  body  of  empirical  work  suggesting  that  managers  sometimes  elect  to  
10:289:24988:21:21:75:539:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:make  acquisition  decisions  that  appear  to  be  value-reducing,  (see,  e.g.,  Lang,  Stulz,  and

10:301:25655:21:20:75:540:164:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:S&P  500,  Mid-Cap  400  and  Small-Cap  600  companies,  as  well  as  companies  that  once  
10:302:25750:20:21:75:538:144:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:belonged to these indexes. Together, these firms constitute more than 80% of the total market 
10:303:25844:21:21:75:538:123:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:capitalization of U.S. public firms. We obtain financial information about firms in our sample 
10:304:25939:21:20:75:339:102:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:from the Compustat database and the CRSP database.  
10:305:25991:20:21:93:538:82:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Our  strategy  is  to  study  the  relation  between  the  compensation  of  CEOs  and  their  prior  
10:306:26093:21:0:75:543:61:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:performance   and   firm-expansion   decisions.   We   therefore   include   in   our   analysis   of   
11:307:26199:0:20:75:538:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  in  any  given  year  only  “continuing”  CEOs  who  have  been  in  the  Execucomp  
11:308:26298:20:21:75:541:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:database  and  served  in  their  position  for  a  given  period  of  time.  We  initially  look  at  
11:309:26401:21:21:75:537:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:performance and firm expansion in the preceding three years, and therefore focus on the set of 
11:310:26496:21:20:75:538:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEOs who already served for three or more years. For robustness, we later perform a similar 
11:311:26588:20:21:75:537:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:analysis for different time windows, looking at the past two-year record of CEOs with two or 
11:312:26681:21:21:75:538:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:more  years  of  experience  and  the  past  four-year  record  of  CEOs  with  four  or  more  years  of  
11:313:26788:21:20:75:280:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:experience, and we obtain similar results.  
11:314:26832:20:21:93:538:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We  focus  on  CEO  compensation  during  the  years  1997-2002.  Throughout  the  study  we  
11:315:26926:21:21:75:538:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:divide our sample into six subsets of data, one for every year, and perform the cross-sectional 
11:316:27022:21:21:75:538:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:analysis  separately  on  each  of  these  subsets.  We  do  not  use  pooled  regressions  in  order  to  
11:317:27129:21:20:75:538:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:avoid  the  potential  correlations  in  errors  in  panel-data  studies  with  repeated  observations.  To  
11:318:27238:20:21:75:471:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:adjust for inflation, we translate throughout all monetary figures to 2002 dollars.   
11:319:27324:21:21:93:539:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Table  1  displays  summary  statistics  of  the  characteristics  of  the  firms  in  which  CEOs  
11:320:27424:21:20:75:273:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:served during the preceding three years.  
11:321:27466:20:21:93:537:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We define throughout our analysis annual CEO compensation as the TDC1 variable in the 
11:322:27552:21:21:75:536:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Execucomp database, which is the sum of salary, bonus, total value of restricted stock granted, 
11:323:27648:21:20:75:538:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:total  value  of  stock  options  granted  (using  Black-Scholes),  long-term  incentive  payouts,  and  
11:324:27753:20:21:75:538:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:other compensation. Median annual compensation is $2.36 million in 1997 and $3.04 million 
11:325:27843:21:21:75:302:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in 2002, and it peaks at $3.26 million in 2000.  
11:326:27892:21:20:93:537:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Market  capitalization  is  defined  as  the  price  per  share  multiplied  by  the  number  of  shares  
11:327:27998:20:21:75:538:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:outstanding  (in  millions)  at  the  end  of  the  calendar  year.  Median  market  capitalization  in  our  
11:328:28108:21:21:75:537:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:annual  subsets  ranges  between  $1.83  billion  in  1997  and  $1.13  billion  in  2002.  Sales  are  the  
11:329:28217:21:21:75:538:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:net sales of the firm at the end of the year (Compustat item #12). Median sales in our annual 
11:330:28311:21:20:75:413:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsets range between $1.4 billion in 1997 and $1.13 billion in 2002.  
11:331:28382:20:21:93:538:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:  The  stock  return  variable  is  the  total  stock  return,  with  dividend,  net  of  inflation.  The  
11:332:28489:21:21:75:538:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:returns  are  calculated  from  the  end  of  calendar  year  t-3  to  the  end  of  calendar  year  t.  The  
11:333:28599:21:20:75:511:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:median three-year return of firms in our sample is 66% in 1997, and drops to 4% in 2002.  
11:334:28689:20:21:93:539:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:The  growth  in  shares  outstanding  variables  is  defined  as  the  three-year  net  percentage  
11:335:28789:21:21:75:537:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increase in shares outstanding, adjusted for stock splits. This variable captures changes in the 
11:336:28886:21:20:75:539:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:size  of  existing  assets  due  to  managerial  decisions  to  make  equity-financed  acquisition  or  
11:337:28990:20:21:75:538:97:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:investments,  to  pay  employees  with  options  and  shares  in  lieu  of  cash  compensation,  and  to  
11:338:29096:21:21:75:540:76:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:avoid  share  repurchases.  The  percentage  of  firms  that  had  a  positive  growth  of  shares  
11:339:29196:21:0:75:508:55:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:outstanding in the preceding three years ranges between 52%-63% in our annual subsets.  
12:340:29360:0:20:93:536:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Since the distribution of change-in-size variables is important to our analysis, we report the 
12:341:29455:20:21:75:536:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:bottom quartile, median, and top quartile values for these variables. The threshold of growth of 
12:342:29552:21:21:75:538:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shares  outstanding  that  defines  the  top  quartile  ranges  between  14%  and  20%  in  our  annual  
12:343:29657:21:20:75:536:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsets. The threshold that defines the bottom quartile ranges from -6% to -2%. The three-year 
12:344:29752:20:21:75:537:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:growth  in  sales  per  share  that  defines  the  top  quartile  ranges  between  14%  and  39%,  and  the  
12:345:29861:21:21:75:538:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:growth  that  defines  the  bottom  quartile  ranges  between  -4%  to  -6%.  There  is  also  substantial  
12:346:29969:21:20:75:537:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variability in growth in asset per share. The growth that defines the top quartile ranges between 
12:347:30067:20:21:75:510:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:39%-61%, and the growth that defines the bottom quartile ranges between -8% and -7%.

12:351:30177:20:21:93:542:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Our   starting   point   is   the   correlation   documented   in   the   literature   between   CEO   
12:352:30280:21:21:75:542:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation   and   firm   size.   We   therefore   start   by   establishing   the   relation   between   
12:353:30388:21:20:75:536:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation and firm size in our sample. To this end, we regress log (CEO compensation) on 
12:354:30480:20:21:75:539:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the  firm’s  log  market  capitalization  and  log  sales.  (We  will  use  log  assets  as  another  size  
12:355:30588:21:21:75:280:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variable in the regressions of Section 3.7.) 
12:356:30633:21:20:93:540:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We  include  in  the  regression,  as  well  as  in  subsequent  regressions,  several  control  
12:357:30730:20:21:75:541:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variables.   We   include   industry   dummies,   following   the   classification   of   48   industries   
12:358:30838:21:21:75:538:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:introduced  by  Fama  and  French  (1997).  We  also  include  a  New  Economy  dummy,  using  the  
12:359:30938:21:20:75:538:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:classification  of  Murphy  (2003),  to  account  for  growth  opportunities  specific  to  internet  and  
12:360:31045:20:21:75:194:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:computer-related firms.  
12:361:31070:21:21:93:539:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Smith  and  Watts  (1992)  show  that  growth  opportunities  are  positively  related  to  CEO  
12:362:31167:21:21:75:537:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation. To control for growth opportunities, we include industry-adjusted Tobin’s Q as 
12:363:31260:21:20:75:539:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:an  independent  variable.  We  use  industry  adjustment  here  because  our  regressions  already  
12:364:31361:20:21:75:537:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:include  industry  dummies.  We  define  industry-adjusted  Q  as  log(Q)  of  the  firm  at  the  end  of  
12:365:31469:21:21:75:538:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the compensation year minus the median log(Q) in the firm’s industry at that time. We define 
12:366:31562:21:20:75:537:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Q as the market value of equity plus the book value of assets minus the book value of equity, 
12:367:31656:20:21:75:537:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:all divided by the book value of assets. To control for firms’ risk, we also include the standard 
12:368:31754:21:21:75:537:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:deviation of the firm’s return, which we estimate over the preceding four years. The regression

13:378:32172:21:21:75:537:641:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:As  Table  2  indicates,  compensation  is  positively  correlated  with  each  of  the  two  measures  of

13:380:32375:21:20:75:540:599:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:between  0.29  and  0.32  and  is  statistically  significant  at  the  1%  level  in  all  years.  The  
13:381:32480:20:21:75:537:579:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:coefficient of Log(Sales) is also positive, ranging between 0.18 and 0.30, and is significant in 
13:382:32577:21:21:75:538:558:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:all  years  (and  at  the  1%  level  in  five  out  of  the  six  years).  Consistent  with  previous  studies  
13:383:32690:21:20:75:539:537:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:(e.g.,  Cyert,  Kang,  and  Kumar  (2002),  and  Core,  Guay,  and  Larcker  (1999)),  the  return  
13:384:32790:20:21:75:538:517:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variability  coefficient  is  positive  and  significant  at  the  1%  or  5%  level  throughout.  The  New  
13:385:32899:21:35:75:394:496:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Economy dummy is positive and significant in most of the years.

13:388:33012:21:21:93:537:420:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Our first step in the analysis of the relation between compensation and firm size is to take 
13:389:33105:21:20:75:537:399:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:into account the fact that firm size is not an exogenous variable but rather is partly a product of 
13:390:33205:20:21:75:538:379:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the CEO’s decisions during the preceding years. Recognizing this fact, we decompose market 
13:391:33296:21:21:75:290:358:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:capitalization and sales in year t as follows:

13:413:33808:21:21:75:538:109:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:are  correlated  with  past  increases  in  market  capitalization  and  sales.  The  coefficient  of  the  
13:414:33916:21:20:75:538:88:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increase  in  market  capitalization  during  the  preceding  three  years  is  positive  and  statistically  
13:415:34026:20:0:75:537:68:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:significant at the 1% level in each of the annual regressions. The coefficient of the increase in 
14:416:34200:0:20:75:537:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:sales during the preceding three years is also positive in all six regressions, and it is significant 
14:417:34302:20:21:75:405:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:at the 1% level in four of them and at the 5% level in the other two.

14:421:34430:21:21:93:537:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We saw in the preceding section that current compensation is correlated with past increases 
14:422:34522:21:20:75:536:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in market capitalization and sales. This finding, however, could be fully driven by a correlation 
14:423:34620:20:21:75:538:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:between compensation and past stock returns. Past increases in market capitalization might be 
14:424:34714:21:21:75:539:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:fully  driven  by  increases  in  the  firm’s  stock  prices,  and  past  increases  in  sales  might  be  
14:425:34821:21:21:75:537:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:correlated with past stock returns. Thus, the above results do not indicate that increases in firm 
14:426:34920:21:20:75:534:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:size are correlated with subsequent pay other than through their effects on stockholder returns.  
14:427:35018:20:21:93:537:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:In our next regression we therefore replace the growth of market cap from t-3 to t with two 
14:428:35110:21:21:75:537:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variables:  the  stock  market  return  from  t-3  to  t,  and  the  rate  of  growth  of  shares  outstanding  
14:429:35222:21:20:75:537:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:from t-3 to t. The stock return represents how much shareholder wealth has appreciated, and it 
14:430:35317:20:21:75:536:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:is the primary variable that the literature has used as a measure of past performance. Other than 
14:431:35415:21:21:75:537:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:by increasing stock returns, however, executives can increase the firm’s market capitalization 
14:432:35510:21:20:75:538:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:by  increasing  the  number  of  shares  outstanding.  By  issuing  additional  shares  at  the  current  
14:433:35616:20:21:75:540:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:market  price,  executives  can  increase  the  firm’s  capital  and  equity  capitalization  without  
14:434:35719:21:21:75:222:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increasing the stock price.  
14:435:35747:21:20:93:537:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:As  Fama  and  French  (2005)  document,  firms  change  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  in  
14:436:35846:20:21:75:538:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:connection  with  several  main  types  of  transactions/events.  First,  firms  make  stock-financed  
14:437:35949:21:21:75:537:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:acquisitions. Second, firms raise capital through secondary equity offerings, private placements 
14:438:36046:21:21:75:539:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:of  equity,  and  rights  offerings.  Third,  by  paying  employees  (and  sometimes  creditors)  with  
14:439:36150:21:20:75:538:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:equity  rather  than  cash,  firms  are  able  to  retain  cash  they  would  otherwise  have  to  expend.  
14:440:36258:20:21:75:537:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Finally, firms also sometimes take steps, such as share repurchases, that reduce the number of 
14:441:36353:21:21:75:173:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shares outstanding.  
14:442:36374:21:20:93:537:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Since we are interested in the aggregate effect of executives’ firm-expansion decisions, we 
14:443:36466:20:21:75:537:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:use in our regression the net growth in shares outstanding (from all sources). In our sample, the 
14:444:36564:21:21:75:537:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:number of firms with net share issuances in the previous three years ranges between 52% and 
14:445:36656:21:20:75:538:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:63%. As a comparison, Fama and French (2005), report that 66.5% of firms that are larger in 
14:446:36748:20:21:75:537:97:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:assets than the median New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firm have a positive annual growth 
14:447:36837:21:0:75:326:76:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in shares outstanding between the years 1993-2002. 
15:448:36964:0:20:93:537:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Given the inclusion of the growth of shares outstanding in the regression, and the potential 
15:449:37057:20:21:75:538:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:correlation  between  increase  in  shares  outstanding  and  increase  in  sales,  we  decomposed  the  
15:450:37162:21:21:75:537:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increase in sales into the growth in shares outstanding component and the growth in per share 
15:451:37256:21:20:75:538:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:sales,  and  we  therefore  include  the  latter  in  the  regression  alongside  the  former.  With  these  
15:452:37365:20:21:75:304:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:substitutions, we run the following regression:

15:472:37645:20:21:93:537:492:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:The results of the estimation of regression (3) appear in Table 4. Consistent with the results 
15:473:37740:21:21:75:540:471:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in  the  literature,  compensation  is  correlated  with  three-year  stock  returns.  The  result  is  
15:474:37844:21:20:75:538:450:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:significant  at  the  5%  level  or  better  in  each  of  the  annual  regressions.  But  the  correlation  of  
15:475:37957:20:21:75:537:430:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:current compensation with past changes goes beyond the relationship of current compensation 
15:476:38049:21:21:75:538:409:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:with  past  stock  returns.  The  coefficient  of  the  growth  in  shares  outstanding  is  positive  and  
15:477:38157:21:21:75:539:388:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:significant  at  the  1%  level  in  each  of  the  regressions.  Clearly,  transactions  involving  an  
15:478:38262:21:20:75:537:367:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:increase in the number of shares (e.g., making a stock-financed acquisition) are not necessarily 
15:479:38359:20:21:75:538:347:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:value-increasing.  Thus,  the  association  between  increases  in  shares  outstanding  and  higher  
15:480:38461:21:21:75:220:326:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsequent pay is of interest.  
15:481:38493:21:20:93:539:305:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:In  addition,  the  coefficient  of  growth  in  sales  per  share  is  positive  in  all  regressions,  
15:482:38598:20:21:75:538:285:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:significant  at  the  5%  level  or  better,  in  four  out  of  the  six  regressions.  Note  that  firms  can  
15:483:38711:21:21:75:537:264:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:expand per share sales without increasing stock returns (say, by increasing sales at prices that 
15:484:38808:21:20:75:537:243:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:do not contribute to increasing profits). Furthermore, when two strategies to increase per share 
15:485:38905:20:21:75:538:223:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:sales  could  both  contribute  to  increasing  stock  returns,  the  strategy  that  increases  per  share  
15:486:39014:21:21:75:536:202:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:sales the most might not be the one that would increase returns the most. Thus, the finding that, 
15:487:39112:21:21:75:537:181:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:controlling for returns, increase in per share sales are correlated with higher subsequent pay is 
15:488:39210:21:20:75:132:160:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:of interest.  
15:489:39224:20:21:93:537:140:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:The log-log specification implies that the coefficients of the independent variables in Table

16:504:40741:21:20:75:538:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:29% (in 2001), with an average of 38%. Thus, the association between compensation and net 
16:505:40831:20:21:75:289:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:share issuance is economically meaningful.  
16:506:40875:21:21:93:538:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We  similarly  also  reran  regression  (3)  replacing  the  growth  in  per-share  sales  with  three

16:509:41189:21:21:75:537:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in these regressions ranges between 7% (in 1997) and 35% (in 2001), with an average of 22%. 
16:510:41281:21:20:75:540:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Therefore,  controlling  for  past  stock  returns,  increases  in  sales  per  share  also  have  an

16:517:41657:21:20:75:541:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:However,   there   remains   the   possibility   that   our   results   concerning   the   correlation   of

16:519:41862:21:21:75:538:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variable  that  is  correlated  with  one  or  both  of  these  variables.  While  such  a  possibility  is  
16:520:41971:21:20:75:540:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:commonly  difficult  to  rule  out  completely,  we  seek  to  explore  it  by  comparing  current

16:522:42165:21:21:75:299:138:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:to current compensation levels in other firms.  
16:523:42213:21:20:93:539:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:In  particular,  we  rerun  regression  3,  but  use  compensation  growth  over  the  past  three

17:527:42684:20:21:75:130:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in Table 5. 
17:528:42696:21:21:93:540:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:As  one  can  expect,  the  adjusted  R-square  in  the  change-in-compensation  regressions  
17:529:42790:21:20:75:541:655:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:displayed   in   Table   5   is   considerably   smaller   than   the   one   in   the   compensation   level   
17:530:42902:20:21:75:537:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:regressions.  However,  the  association  between  compensation  changes  and  our  main  variables  
17:531:43003:21:21:75:537:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:of interest is similar to the association that we found earlier between compensation levels and 
17:532:43099:21:20:75:537:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:these variables. The coefficient of the growth in shares outstanding is positive in all regressions 
17:533:43199:20:21:75:537:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:and significant at the 1% level in five out of the six regressions. The coefficient of the growth 
17:534:43297:21:21:75:538:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in  sales  per  share  is  positive  and  significant  in  four  out  of  the  six  regressions.  Thus,  these  
17:535:43409:21:21:75:540:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:results  reinforce  the  results  of  the  preceding  sections  that  firm-expansion  decisions  are  
17:536:43511:21:34:75:342:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:correlated with increases in subsequent compensation.

17:540:43790:20:21:75:537:400:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:focused in each year on the set of CEOs who have served in this position in the preceding three 
17:541:43886:21:21:75:537:379:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:years. Since the choice of a three-year period is an ad hoc one, we reran our regressions once 
17:542:43981:21:20:75:536:358:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:focusing on changes in the preceding two years (and using the set of all CEOs who have served 
17:543:44075:20:21:75:538:338:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in their position during this period) and once focusing on changes in the preceding four years 
17:544:44170:21:21:75:499:317:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:(and using here all CEOs with four or more years of preceding service in this position).

18:558:45584:21:21:93:537:676:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:These results are consistent with the results obtained earlier in the regressions focusing on

18:564:45877:21:21:75:537:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:which measure of firm size should be correlated with managerial compensation. We have thus 
18:565:45968:21:21:75:537:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:far focused on two measures of size — market capitalization and sales. A third measure of firm 
18:566:46063:21:20:75:537:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:size that is used in the literature is firms’ book value of assets. We therefore run the regressions 
18:567:46164:20:21:75:538:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in  sections  D,  E,  and  F  using  the  book  value  of  assets  instead  of  sales.  Consistent  with  our  
18:568:46275:21:21:75:538:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:methodology,  we  decompose  the  growth  in  firm  assets  into  growth  in  assets-per-share  and  
18:569:46376:21:20:75:521:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:growth in shares outstanding and include the former in the regressions along with the latter.

18:574:46852:21:21:93:540:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Consistent  with  our  previous  results,  the  coefficient  of  growth  in  shares  outstanding  
18:575:46950:21:20:75:539:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:remains  positive  and  significant  in  almost  all  the  regressions.  We  also  find  that  growth  in  
18:576:47057:20:21:75:537:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:assets-per-share is positive in almost all the regressions and significant in the majority of them. 
18:577:47157:21:21:75:538:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Thus,  our  finding  of  a  correlation  between  compensation  and  increases  in  size  per  share  is  
18:578:47263:21:21:75:396:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:robust to using assets rather than sales as the measure of firm size. 
18:579:47333:21:20:93:539:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We  also  reran  the  level  regressions,  replacing  the  growth  in  per-share  assets  with  three

18:581:47546:21:21:75:539:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:growth  in  assets-per-share  in  the  yearly  sub-samples.  The  estimated  coefficient  of  the  top  
18:582:47650:21:20:75:537:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:quartile in these regressions ranges between 7% (in 1997) and 42% (in 1999), with an average 
18:583:47743:20:21:75:539:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:of  27%.  Thus,  controlling  for  past  stock  returns,  increases  in  assets  per  share  also  have  an

18:585:47907:21:20:93:537:117:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Because  a  firm  can  add  assets  that  would  not  add  to  profitability  (and  might  even  reduce

18:587:48109:21:0:75:537:76:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:maximize stockholders’ returns. Thus, as with our finding concerning the correlation between 
19:588:48278:0:20:75:537:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  and  growth  in  sales-per-share,  the  finding  that  compensation  is  correlated  with  
19:589:48383:20:21:75:395:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:growth in assets per share during the CEO’s service is of interest.

19:601:49248:21:20:75:537:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:growth and negative growth. This decomposition permits the coefficient to differ across firms 
19:602:49342:20:21:75:487:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:that increase in size and firms that decrease in size. We present the results in Table 8. 
19:603:49432:21:21:93:538:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Table  8  indicates  that,  for  companies  that  increased  shares  outstanding,  the  coefficient  of  
19:604:49537:21:20:75:537:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:changes  in  shares  outstanding  is  positive  and  significant  across  all  regressions.  For  firms  that  
19:605:49648:20:21:75:538:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:reduced  shares  outstanding,  however,  the  coefficient  of  changes  in  shares  outstanding  is  not  
19:606:49754:21:21:75:540:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:significant  in  any  of  the  regressions.  This  result  suggests  that  the  correlation  between  
19:607:49856:21:20:75:537:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation and changes in shares outstanding is driven by firms with CEOs who increased 
19:608:49946:20:21:75:537:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:firm  size.  There  is  an  asymmetry  in  the  response  of  current  compensation  to  changes  in  firm  
19:609:50054:21:21:75:541:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:size  under  the  CEO’s  management:  When  firm  size  increases,  there  is  an  increase  in  
19:610:50151:21:21:75:475:262:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation; but when firm size decreases, there is no decrease in compensation. 
19:611:50233:21:20:93:537:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We obtain similar results for the coefficient of sales-per-share. For firms that had a positive 
19:612:50329:20:21:75:537:221:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:change in sales-per-share, the coefficient of change in such sales is positive and significant in 
19:613:50427:21:21:75:537:200:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:all the level regressions and in three of the change-in-compensation regressions. In contrast, for 
19:614:50526:21:20:75:537:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:firms that had a negative change in sales-per-share, the coefficient of change in sales-per-share 
19:615:50624:20:21:75:534:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:is  not  significant  in  all  of  the  level  regressions  and  in  five  out  of  the  six  change-in-

20:623:50874:13:21:75:78:704:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C: 
20:624:50874:21:21:93:539:683:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:We  have  thus  far  included  in  our  regressions  the  standard  stock  return  variable,  which  
20:625:50975:21:20:75:538:662:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:measures  total  returns  to  shareholders,  including  dividends.  The  literature,  seeking  to  explain  
20:626:51083:20:21:75:537:642:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO compensation, uses total stockholder returns because it assumes that shareholders benefit 
20:627:51177:21:21:75:540:621:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:from  total  returns,  including  their  dividend  component,  and  therefore  CEOs  should  be  
20:628:51274:21:21:75:534:600:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:rewarded for both the capital gains component and the dividend component of the total return.  
20:629:51369:21:20:93:538:579:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:However,  given  our  finding  that  current  compensation  is  correlated  with  past  changes  in  
20:630:51470:20:21:75:539:559:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:firm  size,  it  is  worth  separating  the  stock  return  into  the  capital  gain  component  and  the  
20:631:51577:21:21:75:538:538:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:dividend component. The part of the total stock return that is in the form of capital gain does 
20:632:51673:21:20:75:539:517:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:contribute  to  increasing  the  firm’s  market  capitalization,  but  the  part  that  is  distributed  as  
20:633:51782:20:21:75:440:497:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:dividend does not contribute to increasing the firm’s market capitalization.  
20:634:51860:21:21:93:537:476:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Having  seen  that  current  compensation  is  correlated  with  past  stock  returns,  we  therefore  
20:635:51963:21:20:75:538:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:now  wish  to  explore  whether  compensation  is  correlated  to  the  same  extent  with  the  capital  
20:636:52069:20:21:75:540:435:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:gains  component  and  the  dividend  component  of  stock  returns.  We  therefore  extend  our  
20:637:52167:21:21:75:539:414:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:analysis  by  decomposing  past  stock  returns  into  two  components:  (i)  the  return  excluding  
20:638:52269:21:21:75:537:393:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:dividends (taken from CRSP), and (ii) the return from dividends, which is defined as the total 
20:639:52364:21:20:75:534:372:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:return with dividend reinvested (also from CRSP) minus return without dividends. We then re-
20:640:52456:20:21:75:538:352:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:run  the  basic  regressions  of  sections  D  (where  the  dependent  variable  is  the  level  of  CEO  
20:641:52562:21:21:75:541:331:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation)  and  of  section  E  (where  the  dependent  variable  is  the  change  in  CEO  
20:642:52658:21:20:75:539:310:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation),  replacing  the  (total)  stock  return  variable  with  a  return  excluding  dividends  
20:643:52763:20:21:75:539:290:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:variable  and  a  dividend  return  variable.  For  robustness,  we  also  check  whether  our  results  
20:644:52868:21:21:75:328:269:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:extend to two-year intervals and four-year intervals. 
20:645:52922:21:20:93:537:248:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:Table 9 presents the coefficients of the return excluding dividends and the dividend return 
20:646:53014:20:21:75:538:228:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in  all  of  these  regressions.  The  results  in  Table  9  indicate  that  the  coefficient  of  the  return  
20:647:53127:21:21:75:541:207:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:excluding   dividends   variable   is   positive   and   significant   in   all   the   compensation   level   
20:648:53238:21:20:75:538:186:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:regressions and in all the change-in-compensation regressions. It is also significant across the 
20:649:53335:20:21:75:297:166:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:two-year, three-year, and four-year intervals.  
20:650:53383:21:21:93:538:145:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:In  contrast,  the  coefficient  of  the  dividend  return  is,  in  general,  not  positively  significant.  
20:651:53493:21:21:75:537:124:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:Out of the 34 annual regressions we run, the coefficient of the dividend return is not significant 
20:652:53592:21:20:75:538:103:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:in 28 of them, is negative and significant in 3 of  them,  and  is  positive  and  significant  in  3  of  
20:653:53699:20:21:75:539:83:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:them.  Thus,  we  find  no  evidence  that  a  CEO’s  current  compensation  is  correlated  with  the  
20:654:53803:21:0:75:537:62:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:dividend  component  of  past  returns  under  the  CEO  in  the  same  way  that  it  is  correlated  with  
21:655:53988:0:20:75:538:717:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:the  undistributed,  capital  gain  component  of  past  returns.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the  
21:656:54097:20:21:75:506:697:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:concern of Jensen (1986) that CEOs might have insufficient incentives to pay dividends.

21:659:54200:20:21:75:78:635:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B: 
21:660:54200:21:21:93:538:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:This  paper  has  investigated  empirically  the  validity  of  the  concern  expressed  by  Jensen  
21:661:54301:21:20:75:538:593:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:(1986)  and  others  that  executive  compensation  practices  might,  overall,  provide  executives  
21:662:54403:20:21:75:538:573:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:with  incentives  to  expand  firm  size.  We  have  found  that  increases  in  a  firm’s  size  during  a  
21:663:54512:21:21:75:539:552:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:CEO’s  service  are  associated  with  higher  subsequent  pay—both  relative  to  CEOs  in  other  
21:664:54612:21:21:75:537:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:companies and relative to the compensation the CEO had earlier. Decomposing changes in size 
21:665:54704:21:20:75:538:510:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:(as  measured  by  either  assets  or  sales)  into  changes  in  size  per  share  and  in  the  number  of  
21:666:54814:20:21:75:539:490:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:shares  outstanding,  we  find  that  changes  in  either  component  are  associated  with  higher  
21:667:54915:21:21:75:539:469:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:subsequent  pay  for  the  CEO.  We  also  find  that  compensation  is  correlated  only  with  the  
21:668:55017:21:20:75:435:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:component of past stockholder returns that is not distributed as dividends.  
21:669:55094:20:21:93:537:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A:The association we find between increases in firm size and higher subsequent CEO pay is 
21:670:55182:21:21:75:539:407:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:economically  meaningful.  As  emphasized  throughout,  this  association  does  not  indicate  that  
21:671:55284:21:20:75:541:386:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:compensation  practices  are  suboptimal.  But  it  does  indicate  that,  overall,  compensation  
21:672:55383:20:21:75:537:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:practices provide managers with excessive incentives to expand firm size. The effects of these 
21:673:55478:21:21:75:537:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:incentives might be mitigated in part or wholly by other factors affecting managers’ decisions. 
21:674:55574:21:20:75:537:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:But taking these incentives into account is necessary for a full understanding of the decisions 
21:675:55670:20:21:75:538:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:that  public  firms  make  with  respect  to  acquisitions,  share  issuance,  capital-raising,  operating  
21:676:55778:21:21:75:275:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:B:strategy, share buybacks, and dividends.

25:780:61102:31:11:75:537:686:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:F:The  sample  consists  of  firms  that  have  CEO  compensation  data  in  the  Execucomp  database.  In  each  year,  we  
25:781:61225:11:12:75:538:675:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:F:consider  firms  whose  CEOs  were  not  replaced  in  the  preceding  three  years.  Financial  information  is  from
