2:28:1483:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:The expansion of U.S. universities after World War II gained from the arrival of immigrant scientists
2:29:1584:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:and graduate students, the broadening of access to universities, and the development of military research
2:30:1689:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:and high technology industry. Since the 1980s, however, growth of scientific research in Europe and
2:31:1788:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:East Asia has exceeded that of the U.S., suggesting convergence in world science and engineering
2:32:1884:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:and a falling U.S. share. But the slowdown of U.S. publication rates in the late 1990s is a different
2:33:1985:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:matter, in that the rise of science elsewhere does not imply a U.S. slowdown in any obvious sense.
2:34:2083:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:Using a panel of U.S. universities, fields and years, evidence is found of a slowdown in the growth
2:35:2182:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:of resources.  In turn, this has caused a deceleration in the growth of research output in public universities
2:36:2292:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:and university-fields falling into the middle 40 percent and bottom 40 percent of their disciplines.
2:37:2392:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:These developments can be traced to slower growth in tuition and state appropriations in public universities
2:38:2500:14:42:72:459:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:compared to revenue growth, including from endowment, in private universities.

3:46:2717:0:24:108:235:705:257:Times:257:Times:C:I. Introduction 
3:47:2732:24:28:90:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:For more than half a century U.S. universities have led the world in research and graduate 
3:48:2823:28:27:71:532:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:education, building on firm foundations laid down in the 19th century, and rising to new heights 
3:49:2920:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:during the 20th century.  But in recent years doubts have begun to arise concerning the future of 
3:50:3018:28:28:72:536:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. higher education, considered as a producer of graduate and professional students as well as 
3:51:3115:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scientific discoveries.  The two are complementary: faculty that are not at the research frontier 
3:52:3213:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are less likely to produce top PhDs and MDs, and conversely, faculty who lack top students are 
3:53:3308:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less likely to do cutting-edge research.  It follows that this paper’s emphasis on research extends 
3:54:3408:27:28:72:500:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to advanced students1.  Furthermore, a strong research enterprise improves the quality of 
3:55:3498:28:28:72:517:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undergraduate education in the long run and contributes to the ability to undertake advanced 
3:56:3591:28:27:72:413:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:training.  As far as higher education is concerned, none of this is new.  
3:57:3665:27:28:90:537:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The U.S. is losing share in scientific research, and perhaps in papers accepted in top journals 
3:58:3761:28:27:71:506:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Hicks, 2007), in part because the number of countries that devote significant resources to 
3:59:3853:27:28:72:496:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scientific research has increased.  This implies intensified competition for scientific and 
3:60:3945:28:27:72:531:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:engineering talent and also greater competitiveness of foreign high technology firms (Freeman, 
3:61:4040:27:28:72:515:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2006).  But in addition to growth overseas, a slowdown has taken place within the U.S. The 
3:62:4131:28:28:72:528:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth rate of financial resources of U.S. public universities has declined and this has reduced 
3:63:4228:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the growth rate in their publications2.  This development is important, because public universities 
3:64:4328:27:28:72:272:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account for a large share of U.S. science. 
3:65:4371:28:27:90:517:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:It may come as a surprise to hear that U.S. universities could be in danger of losing their 
3:66:4463:27:28:72:531:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preeminence, since top U.S. private and public universities invariably rank near the pinnacle of 
3:67:4560:28:20:72:503:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:world institutions (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, various years).  But university growth 
3:68:4650:20:8:108:254:109:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:?:                                                            
3:69:4710:8:16:72:542:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1 In confirmation of this point, the National Research Council rankings of graduate programs reveal a strong positive 
3:70:4828:16:7:71:503:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:correlation between research and the quality of graduate programs.  See National Research Council (1995). 
3:71:4934:7:0:72:310:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2 See Ehrenberg (2006) and Adams and Clemmons (2009). 
4:72:4992:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:overseas implies that this dominance may not last forever.  Moreover, public universities in the 
4:73:5089:27:28:72:246:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. have struggled in recent years. 
4:74:5126:28:27:90:530:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:To understand how top private universities in the U.S. have reached unparalleled heights at 
4:75:5218:27:28:72:505:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the same time that top public universities have fallen behind, it is necessary to explain the 
4:76:5312:28:28:72:520:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:organization of U.S. higher education.  It is a mixed public-private system.  Top U.S. private 
4:77:5407:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities rely on federal grants, endowment, gifts, and tuition to hire the best faculty, select 
4:78:5507:27:28:72:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the best students, and sustain their competitive advantage.  In this they are not constrained by 
4:79:5604:28:27:72:539:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:state interests.  The situation is otherwise with U.S. public universities, whose charter, beginning 
4:80:5705:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the Morrill Act of 1862, enjoins them to support state industries by providing affordable and 
4:81:5804:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:practical higher education.  If state budgets contract, or if competition for state funds strengthens, 
4:82:5907:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:then funding diminishes and the competitive advantage of U.S. public universities declines.  A 
4:83:6002:27:28:72:512:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pillar of public support for higher education, its accountability to state interests, erodes and 
4:84:6099:28:27:72:555:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:becomes a constraint on university growth.  In recent years this appears to have taken place.              
4:85:6206:27:28:90:503:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The paper’s focal point is a panel of universities and fields observed over time.  Main 
4:86:6294:28:27:72:516:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:findings from an analysis of these data are as follows.  Starting with growth facts, I find that 
4:87:6391:27:28:72:512:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research output grows at about the same rate in the late 20th century in private schools as in 
4:88:6486:28:28:72:533:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:public, until the 1990s, when public university growth slows down.  This is despite the fact that 
4:89:6584:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stocks of Research and Development (R&D), which are mostly federally funded, rise appreciably 
4:90:6678:27:28:71:542:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faster in public universities.  A slowdown in papers and in papers per dollar of R&D is evident in 
4:91:6777:28:27:72:531:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the late 1990s, again in public universities.  Given the challenges of measuring R&D, I provide 
4:92:6873:27:28:72:526:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty counts as a supplementary measure.  It turns out that faculty grow at a slower rate than 
4:93:6970:28:28:72:533:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers so research productivity indeed rises.  Once again, though, it rises more slowly in public 
4:94:7068:28:0:72:540:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities, especially during the late 1990s.  In addition, the evidence reveals that current funds 
5:95:7174:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rise more rapidly in private universities, suggesting that in public universities, faster growth of 
5:96:7274:27:28:71:530:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(mostly federal) R&D stocks is cancelled by slower growth in tuition and state appropriations.  
5:97:7370:28:27:71:523:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Hence, faster growth of current funds in private schools contributes to faster growth of wages 
5:98:7465:27:28:71:321:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and research output in these universities.                  
5:99:7525:28:28:89:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:  Continuing with regression findings, I show that public and private universities obtain 
5:100:7615:28:27:71:500:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:similar percentage increases in scientific papers and citation-weighted papers from equal 
5:101:7705:27:28:72:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(percentage) increases in R&D, graduate students, and current funds, so that differences in 
5:102:7797:28:27:72:516:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth of research output between the two sets of institutions are the result of differences in 
5:103:7893:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth of resources.  Here private universities have recently held the advantage.  Departments 
5:104:7988:28:28:72:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ranked in the top 20 percent of their disciplines obtain a larger increase in papers for the same 
5:105:8086:28:27:72:518:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase in R&D and students than departments of lower rank.  Graduate students contribute 
5:106:8177:27:28:72:514:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more to papers in top 20 percent departments than elsewhere, suggesting the high degree of 
5:107:8268:28:27:72:488:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:complementarity of faculty and graduate students at the top of the quality distribution. 
5:108:8357:27:28:90:535:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Compensation in private universities rises faster than it does in public universities by almost 
5:109:8453:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one percent per year.  Compared to public universities, where the wage structure is relatively flat, 
5:110:8554:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compensation in private schools is higher at all ranks and rises more markedly for full professors.  
5:111:8655:28:28:72:535:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests incentives for researchers, especially senior researchers, to migrate from public to 
5:112:8754:28:27:72:528:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private universities.  Combined with slower growth in current funds in public universities, this 
5:113:8851:27:28:72:511:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:helps to produce slower growth in their research output than in that of private universities.  
5:114:8946:28:27:90:487:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.  Sections II and III provide an historical 
5:115:9032:27:28:72:489:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:perspective on U.S. universities.  Section II recounts the expansion of research in U.S. 
5:116:9121:28:28:72:524:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities before, during, and after the Second World War.  This is the period in which U.S. 
5:117:9216:28:0:72:537:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities progress relative to the rest of the world.  Section III considers the U.S. contribution

6:119:9418:27:28:72:478:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:period.  While this is inevitable in the face of postwar recovery and world economic 
6:120:9503:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:development, the section also points to a slowdown in research output during the 1990s in the 
6:121:9597:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:U.S., due largely to a deceleration in the growth rate of resources in U.S. public universities.

6:129:10152:24:28:108:477:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: Prior to World War II and quite unlike the present day, federal Research and

6:132:10419:28:27:72:515:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by the Morrill Act of 1862 and the Land-Grant Act of 1890, extending the 1862 Act to state

6:139:10978:8:16:72:516:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:3 The democratic and equal-opportunity conditions set by the early U.S. patent system (Khan, 2005) may have 
6:140:11086:16:11:71:538:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:complemented the later establishment of universities focused on the agricultural and mechanical arts—the very type 
6:141:11201:11:0:71:192:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:envisaged by the Morrill Act.

7:143:11328:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research expenditures of 50 million $.  Of this amount, 16 million was earmarked for experiment 
7:144:11424:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stations, much of this funded by the Department of Agriculture5.  Of the remaining 34 million, 
7:145:11519:27:28:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:17 derived from endowment, 8 from foundations, 4 from gifts, 2 from contract research, and 2 
7:146:11612:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from state government.  Therefore, the federal government’s main role in university research was 
7:147:11709:28:27:72:206:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:its support for agriculture.   
7:148:11740:27:28:108:529:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: Bush (1945, P. 86) contains estimates of research expenditure by sector from the 1930s 
7:149:11827:28:27:72:539:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:through World War II.  The data are limited to natural science6.  Using as a basis the figure of 50 
7:150:11927:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:million $ reported in National Resources Committee (1938), this yields 25 million $ for natural 
7:151:12023:28:28:72:534:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:science research in 1936.  Using survey data on research faculty, this figure is then extrapolated 
7:152:12122:28:27:71:536:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:backward to 1930 and forward to 1942 to arrive at natural science R&D for universities.  This is 
7:153:12219:27:28:71:351:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the relatively crude university series shown in Figure 17.   
7:154:12280:28:27:108:542:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: The above summarizes the prewar setting.  Events surrounding World War II led to a vast 
7:155:12368:27:28:72:512:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expansion of university R&D.  First, before the war, immigration of scientists from Europe 
7:156:12459:28:27:72:532:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly increased the science and engineering work force. Second, during the war, a sharp 
7:157:12555:27:28:72:530:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rise in defense research increased the demand for scientists and engineers, which the Cold War 
7:158:12650:28:28:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:institutionalized8.  Third, after the war, the GI Bill helped finance college education for returning 
7:159:12752:28:27:72:540:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:soldiers, which subsequently produced a spike in enrollments and increased post-war demand for 
7:160:12847:27:23:72:298:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty.  I discuss each of these factors in turn.

7:162:12958:7:16:72:540:182:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:4 Individual evidence on university R&D exists before 1935-1936.  The University of Chicago conducted an internal 
7:163:13072:16:12:72:527:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:survey of research costs in 1929-1930 and the University of California undertook a similar survey in 1928-1929.  
7:164:13185:12:7:72:434:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:But these data lack the comparative breadth of the National Resources Committee survey. 
7:165:13273:7:16:72:529:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:5 In 1940 federal R&D expenditures were 74 million $, of which 29 million $ or 39%, consisted of Department of 
7:166:13384:16:11:71:536:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Agriculture R&D (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1998, p. 27).  Clearly, agricultural research assumed a much larger role 
7:167:13496:11:7:71:321:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:in the federal government and universities than it does today.  
7:168:13560:7:12:72:514:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:6 In these early data, natural science includes biological, mathematical and physical science, plus engineering. 
7:169:13673:12:16:72:528:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:7 Industrial R&D statistics are obtained by multiplying industrial researchers by R&D per worker of 4,000 $.  See

7:171:13882:7:0:72:531:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:8 By an increase in demand I mean throughout a shift to the right of the demand curve for scientists and engineers.

8:173:14059:24:28:108:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: The supply of highly skilled scientists to the United States increased due to the flight 
8:174:14148:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from Hitler’s Europe, but by how much, and in what proportion?  The main statistical source is 
8:175:14243:27:28:72:486:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Davie (1947), who directed data collection for the Committee for the Study of Recent 
8:176:14328:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Immigration from Europe9.  Using the criterion of “refugee, arrival from Europe as place of last 
8:177:14425:28:27:72:485:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:residence”, statistics of immigration and naturalization yielded 22,842 refugees in the 
8:178:14513:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:professions during 1933-1944.  The refugees were assigned to detailed occupations: 507 were 
8:179:14605:28:27:72:530:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:chemists, 2,471 engineers, 3,415 professors and teachers, and 1,907 were “scientists or literary 
8:180:14702:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:persons,” yielding a total of 8,300 refugees in science, engineering and related professions.  In 
8:181:14800:28:28:71:529:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1938 the National Resources Committee, using American Men of Science, 6th Edition (1938), 
8:182:14890:28:27:71:521:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated that 28,000 U.S. men and women were researchers in the natural sciences, and that 
8:183:14982:27:28:71:531:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:22,000 more were in the humanities and social sciences (National Resources Committee, 1938, 
8:184:15074:28:27:71:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:p. 171) for a total of 50,000 across all sectors of the economy10.  Thus, while the intellectual 
8:185:15171:27:28:71:518:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration from Europe during the 1930s was small by modern standards, it was large for the 
8:186:15262:28:27:71:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time.  Put another way, if half of the roughly 8,000 refugees in science and engineering and 
8:187:15355:27:28:71:509:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:related fields were engaged in research—not excessive, given their occupations—then this 
8:188:15444:28:28:71:531:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constitutes an increase of 4,000 persons on a base of 50,000, or 8%. And since they specialized 
8:189:15540:28:27:71:534:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in natural science and engineering, then the increase could be almost 4,000 on a base of 28,000, 
8:190:15637:27:68:72:121:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or 14%11.

8:192:15707:8:16:72:508:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:9 Fermi (1971) recounts individual biographies of this wave of immigrants by detailed occupation, including 
8:193:15815:16:12:71:512:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:scientists and engineers by their separate specialties. Her time period, 1930-1941, is earlier than that of Davie 
8:194:15929:12:7:71:231:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:(1947), whose perspective I adopt here. 
8:195:15969:7:11:72:512:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:10 The Committee judged that of the existing stock of 50,000 researchers, 5,000 or 10% were in the first rank. 
8:196:16080:11:16:72:535:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:11 Following the usage of Bush (1945) and Davie (1947), in this section natural science refers to biology, medicine, 
8:197:16197:16:0:72:400:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:mathematics and statistics, and engineering, in addition to chemistry and physics. 
9:198:16284:0:27:108:545:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: There is reason to think that even this understates growth at the highest levels of research.  
9:199:16379:27:28:72:514:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 1 illustrates12.  Twelve refugees had won a Nobel Prize by 1947, the most prestigious 
9:200:16471:28:27:72:537:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:international award13.  Using a sample collected by Davie (1947) of 707 refugees who served on 
9:201:16566:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university faculties in Europe, 203 persons were accounted distinguished in their disciplines, of 
9:202:16664:28:28:72:501:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which 181 were in natural science.  To assess the meaning of this, turn to Table 2, which 
9:203:16754:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compiles U.S.-resident Nobel Prize winners by decade.  The number of foreign-born is shown in 
9:204:16848:27:28:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parentheses for each subject area, except for the sum across areas, where the foreign-born appear 
9:205:16946:28:27:72:513:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as column two14.  Noting that 23 prizes had been won by U.S. residents by 1940, with none 
9:206:17036:27:28:72:504:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:foreign-born except for one award, I conclude that the intellectual migration from Europe 
9:207:17126:28:28:72:313:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increased resident Nobel Prize winners by 50%15.

9:211:17446:27:32:72:455:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:prizes for the 1930s is half the native-born total, per decade, during 1971-2007.

11:260:21473:27:28:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scientific papers as a measure of the public or “commons” aspects of science21.  Figure 5 shows

11:263:21756:28:28:72:535:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth equals zero from 1997-2002.  The EU-15 countries surpass the U.S. in total publications 
11:264:21851:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by 1997 and they maintain this lead into the 21st century.  East Asia grows more rapidly than any

12:284:23670:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The charts show an accelerating decline in the U.S. share of citations, though nowhere is this as

12:286:23864:27:28:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:small, grows the fastest. At the end of the period, because of gains in Europe, 75% of citations 
12:287:23961:28:28:72:426:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are still received by America and Europe compared with 70% at the start. 
12:288:24034:28:27:90:533:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Figure 10 depicts the U.S. share in the top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% most cited papers from

12:290:24225:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is less for top 1% papers than top 5% papers.  The top 1% share declines from 65% of the world 
12:291:24320:27:28:72:518:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:total in 1992 to 55% in 2005.  This is a decline of 15 percentage points (10/65).  The top 5% 
12:292:24414:28:28:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:share declines from 38% to 30%, a decline of 21 percentage points.  So erosion in share is less at 
12:293:24513:28:27:71:435:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher levels of citation impact, though some may see this as cold comfort. 
12:294:24589:27:28:89:512:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:But what does all this mean?  Share data tell us little about welfare. Output adjusted for 
12:295:24680:28:27:71:523:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:quality, and output relative to input, are what matter for growth and technical efficiency of an 
12:296:24777:27:28:72:532:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:industry, and universities are no exception to this rule.  All we can say is that the growth rate of 
12:297:24878:28:27:72:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. scientific publications has fallen and that growth is slow relative to other regions, but we 
12:298:24976:27:28:72:349:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have not addressed the factors that drive this slowdown.

12:300:25129:28:38:71:536:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that were the reason, then the skill of foreign science and engineering graduate students entering

12:304:25456:12:16:72:534:170:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:27 In the long run, arguments concerning the diffusion of science and R&D vary in their implications for welfare of 
12:305:25572:16:11:72:520:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:advanced countries like the U.S.  If technology converges in science and in industrial research then the share of 
12:306:25686:11:12:72:536:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:innovative products produced in advanced countries will decline. Standard models build on the theory of trade with 
12:307:25801:12:11:72:524:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:differentiated products (Helpman and Krugman, 1986).   North-South models of innovation, imitation, and trade 
12:308:25911:11:12:72:539:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:based on this approach (Krugman, 1979; Grossman and Helpman, 1991) assume that all innovation occurs in North, 
12:309:26022:12:11:72:540:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:while South merely imitates.   But if advanced human resources arise in South as well, then innovation is distributed 
12:310:26140:11:12:72:518:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:across both North and South, as Freeman (2006) points out.  In that case the profits from new products are also 
12:311:26252:12:11:72:535:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:distributed across both regions and North can lose some industries with supra-normal profits.  Applying this line of 
12:312:26369:11:0:72:521:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:reasoning to universities as an industry suggests that the U.S. could lose the lead in some sciences which in turn 
13:313:26489:0:27:72:493:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. universities would have undergone serious decline in recent years.  But this seems 
13:314:26577:27:28:72:509:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implausible given the attractiveness of U.S. education and employment.  Alternatively, the 
13:315:26668:28:27:72:500:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:slowdown could represent crowding out of U.S. authors in top journals (Hicks, 2007), or 
13:316:26756:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:diversion to commercial activities (Toole and Czarnitski, 2007), or earmarking to less efficient 
13:317:26853:28:28:71:313:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:institutions (De Figueiredo and Silverman, 2006). 
13:318:26903:28:27:89:538:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The recent slowdown could derive from other domestic causes and this is the approach that I 
13:319:26995:27:28:71:519:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:am about to pursue.  I show in Section V that growth of scientific publication in U.S. private 
13:320:27090:28:27:71:508:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities did not slow down much in the 1990s compared with the 1980s.  In contrast, a 
13:321:27180:27:28:71:497:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pronounced deceleration did occur in public universities.  In explaining the difference, a 
13:322:27271:28:28:72:537:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:deceleration in resource growth during the 1990s seems to be the most likely explanation for the 
13:323:27368:28:31:72:475:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:slowdown in public universities.  I explore this hypothesis in Sections V and VI.

13:326:27510:23:28:90:515:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:With the goal of explaining the slowdown in U.S. academic research, I turn to empirical 
13:327:27598:28:27:72:519:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work using a panel of 110 top U.S. universities.   I begin by describing the data.  In their raw 
13:328:27695:27:28:72:536:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:form they consist of 2.4 million scientific papers, published during 1981-1999, that have at least 
13:329:27794:28:28:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one author from a set of leading U.S. universities.  These universities account for more than 80 
13:330:27891:28:38:72:338:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:Times:B:percent of U.S. academic research during this period28.

13:332:28123:12:12:72:519:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:might contribute to less effective industrial research in the U.S.  But countervailing forces also apply if product 
13:333:28239:12:11:72:525:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:varieties grow with the world economy. First, knowledge flows to industries in advanced countries will increase, 
13:334:28352:11:12:72:520:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:including universities, so that scientific discoveries and inventions of new products could increase.  Second, the 
13:335:28467:12:11:72:529:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:larger world economy that results from South’s entry into advanced nation status would create markets for North, 
13:336:28580:11:7:72:543:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:including in scientific research.  So it is not clear whether North gains or loses as a result of South’s development.      
13:337:28704:7:16:72:533:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:28 According to National Science Board (2002), Appendix Table 5-4, in 1999 the top 100 U.S. universities account 
13:338:28817:16:12:72:542:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:for $22.10 billion of R&D out of $27.49 billion of R&D for all U.S. universities.  This equals 80.4 percent.  National 
13:339:28936:12:11:72:520:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Science Board (2008), Appendix Table 5-11 indicates that in 2006 the top 100 account for $38.09 billion out of 
13:340:29047:11:12:72:531:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:$47.76 billion for all U.S. universities.  This equals 79.8 percent.  Since the sample consists of the top 110 and not 
13:341:29166:12:11:72:515:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the top 100, its share in R&D expenditures exceeds 80 percent.  Publication data reflect R&D spending, so the 
13:342:29276:11:0:72:250:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:publication share also exceeds 80 percent.    
14:343:29327:0:27:108:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Papers consist of articles, reviews, notes, and proceedings.   The data source is Thomson-
14:344:29417:27:28:72:534:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Reuters Scientific29.   Papers follow the field that Thomson assigns to the journal in which they  
14:345:29516:28:27:72:509:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appear30.  Field in this case is one of 88 subfields.  To link the data to the National Science 
14:346:29612:27:28:71:550:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Foundation’s (NSF) CASPAR database, I assign each of the 88 to one of NSF’s 12 main fields31.    
14:347:29709:28:28:108:487:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The data record publication year, journal field, institutional affiliation, address 
14:348:29793:28:27:72:506:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information on city, state, and country, and author names as well as number of authors32.   
14:349:29885:27:28:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Address information is used to identify university affiliations of those who collaborate on a paper 
14:350:29985:28:27:71:532:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and to compute fractional papers.  By fractional, I mean that if a paper is written by researchers 
14:351:30084:27:28:71:539:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in two universities, then each university is assigned half the paper. If three collaborate, then each 
14:352:30186:28:28:71:519:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:receives a third, and so on33.  I add up fractional papers by university, field, and year to form 
14:353:30284:28:27:72:503:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:“effective” papers produced in a university-field.  By treating the data in this way I avoid 
14:354:30377:27:28:72:538:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:multiple counting of papers of U.S. universities taken as a whole.  Likewise I compute (forward) 
14:355:30474:28:27:71:529:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:citations received by a paper in its first five years including year of publication, and I calculate 
14:356:30575:27:28:71:531:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fractional five-year citations in the same manner as for papers, but excluding citations from the 
14:357:30673:28:64:71:511:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:same institution.  I accumulate fractional citations by university, field, and year to form an  
14:358:30769:64:7:108:254:258:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:?:                                                            
14:359:30829:7:16:72:502:251:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:29 The journal set consists of approximately 5500 journals that were active in 1999 as well as 1600 inactive 
14:360:30938:16:7:72:349:235:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:(renamed or out of print) journals that were cited by active journals.  
14:361:31010:7:16:72:534:228:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:30 This assignment is reasonable for specialized journals because of the breadth of fields that I use.  But the method 
14:362:31129:16:12:72:539:212:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:produces serious errors for the one percent of journals (about 70) that fall into Thomson-Reuters’s Multidisciplinary 
14:363:31247:12:11:72:523:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:category.  Thomson treats this category as part of biology because biology accounts for the largest number of its 
14:364:31361:11:12:72:526:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:Times:F:papers.  Multidisciplinary journals include Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 
14:365:31470:12:11:72:518:177:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:F:USA, and Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.  Wholesale assignment to biology here is clearly 
14:366:31577:11:12:72:490:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:wrong.  But to correct the problem would require article (not journal) assignments to fields.  Also, some 
14:367:31683:12:11:72:539:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Multidisciplinary journals are primarily focused on biology.  Therefore, the problem applies to less than one percent 
14:368:31801:11:7:72:135:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:of the journals. 
14:369:31818:7:16:72:526:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:31 The twelve fields are: agriculture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences, economics 
14:370:31932:16:7:72:439:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and business, engineering, mathematics and statistics, medicine, physics, and psychology.   
14:371:32024:7:12:72:532:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:32 There is no limit on the number of authors.  The maximum number in the sample is 210 while the mean is 2.36.  
14:372:32137:12:16:72:540:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:33 The cumulative distribution of universities listed on papers is: 1 university, 79.6%; 2 universities or less, 96.8%; 3 
14:373:32259:16:11:72:541:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:universities or less, 98.3%; and 4 universities or less, 99.5%.  It follows that the fractions assigned are almost always 
14:374:32381:11:0:72:141:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1, ½, 1/3, or ¼.

15:376:32484:27:28:108:536:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:These steps yield research “output” in a university, field and year. Following along these 
15:377:32575:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lines I form a panel of universities, fields and years.  The panel combines papers and citations 
15:378:32672:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with university-field level (R&D), university-field PhD students and post-doctoral students, and 
15:379:32769:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics of doctoral programs; as well as financial characteristics of parent universities.  
15:380:32869:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The measure used for R&D is a calculated depreciated stock based on past R&D expenditures.

15:387:33509:28:27:72:345:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:I use these to stratify departments by relative standing35. 
15:388:33569:27:28:108:541:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:In the basic panel of universities I consider only leading university-fields (“departments”) 
15:389:33662:28:27:72:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from the top 110. Their number depends on size of field: I include the top 25 universities in 
15:390:33756:27:28:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:astronomy, the top 50 in agriculture, chemistry, computer science, economics and business, earth

15:392:33943:28:27:71:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:medicine, and engineering.  Summing across fields, and accounting for the fact that 48 formal 
15:393:34037:27:28:71:511:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools of agriculture exist, the panel consists of 648 top university-fields.   My purpose in 
15:394:34132:28:64:71:520:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:breaking out few individual schools in small fields and more in large fields is to avoid empty

15:396:34287:7:16:72:536:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:34 It is tempting to think of university-fields as departments, but this is misleading.  The same field can be practiced 
15:397:34408:16:7:72:469:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:by more than one department and (rarely) multiple fields can be practiced within one department.   
15:398:34507:7:16:72:534:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:35 NRC ranks are not available for agriculture and medicine.  For these fields I sort universities by their 1998 R&D 
15:399:34624:16:0:72:445:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and assign a rank of 1 to the university with the largest R&D and so on in descending order.  
16:400:34723:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cells for universities where fields are small or non-existent36.   The result is a panel that contains 
16:401:34826:27:28:72:526:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers and citation-weighted papers for 648 university-fields in 12 main sciences during 1981-
16:402:34920:28:27:72:526:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1999.  This implies a total of 12,312 observations before exclusions due to missing values.  In 
16:403:35016:27:28:72:513:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some cases I stratify the data into top 20 percent, middle 40 percent, and bottom 40 percent 
16:404:35109:28:28:71:540:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university-fields.  A field that contains 50 university-fields has 10 in the top 20 percent, 20 in the 
16:405:35212:28:27:71:514:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:middle percent, and 20 in the bottom 40 percent, and so on.  The university-field dimension 
16:406:35304:27:28:71:510:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:allows for greater variability of R&D stock, graduate students, and other variables within a 
16:407:35397:28:27:71:522:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university.  It increases the robustness of the findings when university dummies are included. 
16:408:35492:27:28:71:537:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The price of this detail is that lagged faculty counts must be replaced by lagged R&D stocks and

16:415:36014:27:28:108:515:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:I begin with research output.  Mean (fractional) papers in all universities are 177 per 
16:416:36102:28:28:72:490:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university-field and year. They are slightly larger in private schools.  The data indicate 
16:417:36193:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:considerable variation, especially among private schools.  The field with the most papers is in a 
16:418:36291:27:28:72:507:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private university. The mean of five-year (fractional) citations received (citation-weighted 
16:419:36384:28:27:72:517:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers) is 520 per university, field and year.  This is 33% higher in private schools and 17% 
16:420:36478:27:60:72:439:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower in public schools.  Again the maximum occurs in a private university.

16:422:36614:7:16:72:518:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:36 The size of the remainder of the top 110 equals an average university-field in the individual top 25, 50, or 75 
16:423:36729:16:0:72:539:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:schools.  This reflects the positive skew of academic R&D.  For more on this point see Adams and Griliches (1998). 
17:424:36849:0:27:108:539:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:For comparison I report faculty counts.  Since these exist only at the university level they 
17:425:36942:27:28:71:522:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicate total research labor37.  The average school employs slightly more than 1,200 faculty; 
17:426:37037:28:27:72:512:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private schools employ 800; and public schools employ 1,500.  A smaller faculty in private 
17:427:37128:27:28:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools produces the same papers per university-field, but appreciably more citation-weighted 
17:428:37222:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers, than do faculty in public schools.   Note that I compare total faculty in universities with 
17:429:37322:28:27:72:494:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers and citations at the university-field level. But this comparison is also valid at the 
17:430:37415:27:28:72:308:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university level (Adams and Clemmons, 2009).

17:445:38453:28:35:72:537:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example, tuition in private universities is used to cover start-up packages for assistant professors

17:447:38614:8:16:72:533:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:37 The data include untenured as well as tenure track faculty.  In the Top 110 about 90% are tenure track according 
17:448:38730:16:7:71:457:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:to HEGIS.  Note that data on faculty by university and field have not been collected since 1985. 
17:449:38827:7:16:72:540:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:38 I chose an 8-year lagged stock because the NSF CASPAR R&D data begin in 1973 and papers begin in 1981. It is 
17:450:38939:16:7:72:357:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:therefore the maximum length of stock that is available given the data. 
17:451:39011:7:16:72:503:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:39 One difficulty with the financial variables is that they are not available for the late 1990s.  This causes an 
17:452:39125:16:0:72:233:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:appreciable loss of data as we shall see. 
18:453:39172:0:27:72:508:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in science and engineering (Ehrenberg, Rizzo, and Jakubson, 2007).  Not surprisingly, and 
18:454:39262:27:28:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:despite smaller enrollments, private schools have larger tuition revenues and larger (non-tax) 
18:455:39357:28:28:72:501:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:endowments.  State appropriations capture the “tax endowment” of public universities.  I 
18:456:39446:28:30:71:396:625:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:construct the following measure of current revenue in universityj:

18:459:39671:28:27:72:535:542:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in private universities revenue is tuition, since Public equals zero. But in public universities it is 
18:460:39774:27:28:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tuition plus state appropriations on the assumption that appropriations substitute for tuition in 
18:461:39872:28:28:72:524:487:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:public universities. I lack a history of revenue, but I lag (2) by one year in the research output 
18:462:39971:28:27:72:534:459:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equations to approximate lagged resources.  I treat endowment separately from revenue, since it 
18:463:40067:27:28:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is a stock, and since it may be earmarked for different uses. Note that I use the endowment stock 
18:464:40165:28:27:72:367:404:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because endowment income is poorly measured in HEGIS.

18:470:40398:20:28:72:493:292:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 3 shows that public universities employ more graduate students.  But numbers of 
18:471:40484:28:28:72:511:264:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undergraduates are also larger, requiring more of the graduate students to serve as teaching 
18:472:40577:28:27:72:536:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assistants.  Besides this, large public university programs in engineering include masters as well 
18:473:40676:27:28:72:525:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as PhD students.  For these reasons, (3) is likely to be a noisy indicator of research assistance, 
18:474:40775:28:27:71:272:181:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and yet it is the best measure that I have.  
18:475:40820:27:28:107:512:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:I use the ratio of auxiliary/total revenues (from HEGIS) to indicate financial duress. 
18:476:40907:28:0:71:507:126:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Auxiliary revenues are fee-for-service charges for residence halls, food services, athletics, 
19:477:41006:0:27:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student unions, stores, and movie theaters40.  I divide auxiliary by total revenues to abstract from 
19:478:41107:27:28:72:497:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:size of university.  The mean of this ratio is 0.10,  although it ranges from zero to 0.30.   
19:479:41201:28:27:107:537:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:To motivate the use of auxiliary/total revenues, suppose that tuition is price-controlled in 
19:480:41294:27:28:71:541:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a public university.  This could occur in states that guarantee tuition to families of students, since 
19:481:41397:28:28:71:523:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the states must then cover tuition if the price cap were to be lifted (Rizzo, 2006).  If fees were 
19:482:41496:28:27:71:510:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increased in small amounts, then they might substitute for tuition in this setting.  Likewise, 
19:483:41591:27:28:71:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private universities with small endowments and gifts could use fees to finance their operations.  
19:484:41689:28:27:71:436:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Fees in this interpretation resemble hidden prices for university attendance.

19:486:41855:28:28:71:533:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plus state appropriations per student, and endowment per student.  The enrollment/faculty ratio, 
19:487:41952:28:27:71:504:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or the student-teacher ratio, is positively correlated with auxiliary/total revenue.  Since an 
19:488:42047:27:28:71:522:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the student-teacher ratio spreads limited resources over more students, it also may 
19:489:42143:28:27:71:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicate financial duress41.  Tuition plus state appropriations per student and endowment per 
19:490:42237:27:28:72:531:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student capture more abundant resources per student.  They are the opposite of financial duress 
19:491:42333:28:27:72:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Ehrenberg, 2002).  They should be, and are, negatively correlated with the financial duress 
19:492:42426:27:32:72:469:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:Times:B:indicators, which in this study are auxiliary/total revenue and enrollment/faculty.

19:494:42546:24:27:90:520:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:I now use the university panel data described in Section IV to provide an overview of the

19:497:42827:27:28:72:531:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tables that are designed to facilitate discussion of trends in university research productivity and

19:501:43105:11:16:72:534:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:41  An alternative view is that a higher student-teacher ratio automatically increases the share of auxiliary fees.  It is 
19:502:43228:16:0:72:294:74:100:g_d0_f3:42:g_d0_f3:F:by no means perfect as an indicator of financial duress.

20:504:43379:27:28:72:519:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock in private and public universities.  The data consist of 620 university-fields (out of 648 
20:505:43476:28:27:72:503:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possible), observed over 1982-1999, for which there are no missing values.  To aid in the 
20:506:43566:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interpretation, I report values relative to 1982 in square brackets.  In brief, the data tell us that the 
20:507:43672:28:28:72:501:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:output of papers grows by slightly more (slightly less) than 50 percent in private (public) 
20:508:43764:28:27:71:535:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities; that citations grow by 125 percent in both groups (from 1982-1995); and that PhDs 
20:509:43860:27:28:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grow by a third in both.  Since citations rise with the growing ease of citation and with the 
20:510:43954:28:27:72:506:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:number of researchers who cite, citation growth is best regarded as an upper bound on the 
20:511:44044:27:28:71:535:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth of research output.  But since papers have genuinely become more influential, growth of 
20:512:44139:28:28:71:537:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers is a lower bound.  Therefore, growth of research output lies between 50 and 125 percent.  
20:513:44236:28:27:89:521:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:This provides a broad range of growth in research output, but what about input? I start by

20:516:44512:27:28:71:539:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth: surely, one supposes, this is a recipe for a slowdown in research productivity.  But R&D 
20:517:44609:28:27:71:518:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth is overstated, because the GDP deflator understates cost increases in universities and 
20:518:44703:27:28:71:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:overstates growth of real R&D.  The evidence in Table 13 below, on rising real compensation of 
20:519:44798:28:28:71:230:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty, helps to make this clear. 
20:520:44833:28:27:89:527:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:For this reason I prefer the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) price index for university 
20:521:44923:27:28:71:541:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D (Robbins and Moylan, 2007), because it takes university wage costs into account, and I use 
20:522:45018:28:27:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the BEA index to deflate R&D stock in all the regressions to follow.  When I use the BEA index 
20:523:45113:27:28:71:485:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:instead of the implicit GDP deflator to calculate real R&D, I find that R&D in private 
20:524:45200:28:28:71:532:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities grows by 72 percent, not 105 percent. Likewise I find that growth in public schools 
20:525:45297:28:0:71:535:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is 93 percent, not 130 percent.  Using the improved deflator real R&D grows by 70 (90) percent 
21:526:45397:0:27:72:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in private (public) universities, while research output grows by 50/125 percent in both. In this 
21:527:45494:27:28:71:428:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:way the gap narrows between growth of articles and growth of real R&D. 
21:528:45565:28:27:90:532:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Even so, growth of real R&D is likely to be overstated despite the use of the BEA deflator.  
21:529:45658:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:First, inter-university grants probably grow in importance during this time because of large 
21:530:45751:28:28:72:511:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:projects in biology and other fields.  Since grants are not apportioned among schools in the 
21:531:45844:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistics until well after 1999, R&D is increasingly over-counted because of this.  Second, an 
21:532:45940:27:28:72:514:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increasing amount of funding could be targeted for training of graduate students rather than 
21:533:46033:28:27:72:506:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty research. To assess research productivity with more accuracy it would be useful to 
21:534:46124:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:separate funds for research from funds for pure training.  A related point might be important, if  
21:535:46223:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities move from institutional to grant support of graduate students.  To that extent, grants 
21:536:46323:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:replace internal funds and they are not additional funds for research.  I mention these problems 
21:537:46420:27:28:72:541:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not because I have solutions to them but in the interest of producing better statistics on university 
21:538:46522:28:27:72:172:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D in the future.   
21:539:46543:27:28:90:529:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Table 5 shows that publications in private universities grow more slowly than R&D stock.  
21:540:46633:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The same point applies even more strongly to public universities. While growth of papers slows 
21:541:46728:27:28:72:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:down during 1995-1999 in private universities, it virtually stops in public universities. However, 
21:542:46827:28:28:72:535:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the growth rate of papers recovers somewhat during 2000-2005 (see Figure 5) so this slowdown 
21:543:46920:28:27:72:219:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is to some extent temporary42. 
21:544:46951:27:28:90:542:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Table 6 constructs ratios of papers, citations, and PhD students to R&D stocks using the GDP 
21:545:47044:28:27:72:532:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and BEA deflators, and it examines their growth.  Using the BEA deflator, papers per million $ 
21:546:47139:27:28:72:513:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:decline over time in private schools by -11% but the decline is -23% in public universities.  
21:547:47233:28:20:72:540:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Citations per million also grow significantly faster in private universities.  In comparing research

21:549:47394:8:16:72:534:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:42 For all academic institutions, total scientific papers published fell from 139,168 in 1995 to 138,472 in 1999.  But 
21:550:47513:16:11:72:520:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:by 2005 this total had increased to 159,972.  Numbers of scientific papers reflect year of entry into the database 
21:551:47628:11:0:72:477:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:rather than year of publication.  See National Science Board, 2008, Chapter 5, Appendix Table 5-36. 
22:552:47733:0:27:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:productivity, it is useful to remember that faculty compensation rises by almost one percent 
22:553:47826:27:28:72:493:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faster a year in private universities.  Almost paradoxically this may explain why papers 
22:554:47915:28:27:72:540:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(citations) per million $ of R&D fall less (rise more).  It is because labor quality grows at a faster 
22:555:48018:27:28:72:538:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate in private universities due to faster wage growth in these universities.  Finally, PhD students 
22:556:48119:28:28:72:375:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:per million $ decline by 50 percent in both types of university. 
22:557:48184:28:27:90:537:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Table 7 takes a different look at university resources.  It records enrollment, tenure track and 
22:558:48281:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-tenure track faculty, tuition (in public universities, tuition plus state appropriations). All 
22:559:48380:28:27:72:540:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variables are at the university level.  Values relative to 1982 are again placed in square brackets.  
22:560:48482:27:28:72:500:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:These measures track teaching loads as well as human and financial resources over time. 
22:561:48570:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Growth in enrollments in both private and public institutions is about 10 percent by 1997.  
22:562:48662:28:27:72:508:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Since PhD degrees increase by one third, enrollment shifts towards (more costly) graduate 
22:563:48752:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:education.  Numbers of faculty grow by 25 percent in private universities, but by eight percent in 
22:564:48851:28:27:72:535:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:public universities.  Most of the growth in private universities occurs at the end, during a period 
22:565:48951:27:28:72:545:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of rapid growth in stock market and endowment values.  Its effects will be felt in the 21st century.  
22:566:49053:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Tuition revenue grows by 124 percent in private universities but tuition plus state appropriations 
22:567:49152:27:28:71:522:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in public universities grow by just 46 percent.  The divergence in resources becomes obvious 
22:568:49245:28:28:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:during the 1990s.  It helps to account for differences in private-public productivity, since I shall 
22:569:49346:28:27:71:294:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:show that current revenues support research.   
22:570:49393:27:28:89:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: Endowments grow at the same rate in all institutions, though the difference in endowment 
22:571:49483:28:27:71:527:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:per faculty remains large. It is 1.39 million in private universities versus 0.15 million in public 
22:572:49583:27:28:71:495:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities. Endowment is simply too small in most public institutions to affect faculty 
22:573:49673:28:0:71:176:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:resources very much. 
23:574:49699:0:27:90:514:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Together Tables 5 and 7 provide a new perspective on university research productivity.  
23:575:49787:27:28:72:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 5 shows that papers increase by 50 percent during this period, while citation-weighted 
23:576:49880:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:papers increase by 125 percent.  Table 7 shows that faculty increase by 10-25 percent.  Papers 
23:577:49975:27:28:72:521:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:per faculty increase by either measure, and this draws attention to the point made earlier, that 
23:578:50072:28:28:72:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth of university R&D is overstated.  At the same time, research productivity in public 
23:579:50163:28:31:72:346:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities has clearly fallen behind that of the privates.

23:582:50265:23:28:90:539:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:To better understand the determinants of research productivity, I turn to a regression analysis 
23:583:50360:28:28:71:540:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the university, field and year panel. Tables 8 and 9 present pooled OLS regressions for private 
23:584:50459:28:27:71:541:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and public universities.  By pooled, I specifically mean regressions that combine fields in a given 
23:585:50559:27:28:72:520:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university.  As I have shown, the university-field dimension of the data allows for variability 
23:586:50655:28:28:72:474:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:within universities that helps to identify effects of R&D stock and other variables.   
23:587:50742:28:33:107:537:349:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The regressions follow three basic formats that I describe next.  Let ijty be the logarithm 
23:588:50834:33:32:71:499:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of research output (papers or citations) in fieldi, universityj, at timet, let ijtx consist of 
23:589:50929:32:28:72:539:284:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:logarithms of R&D stock, graduate students, and current revenue defined by (1), (3) and (2); and 
23:590:51026:28:33:72:481:256:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:let jtz stand for financial variables at the university level (endowment in logarithms; 
23:591:51114:33:31:72:528:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:auxiliary/total revenue, and enrollment/faculty).  Also,iD is a vector of field dummies.43 Then 
23:592:51210:31:28:71:332:192:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the “total” equation that omits university dummies is:

23:596:51443:7:16:72:515:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:43 In other regressions I include shares of full and associate professors to capture aging effects.  The shares are 
23:597:51559:16:12:72:540:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:insignificant. Unlike individual productivity of scientists (Stephan and Levin, 1991, 1992) where age is significantly 
23:598:51678:12:11:72:528:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:negative, at the university and field level rank is insignificant.  One explanation for the difference is that selective 
23:599:51799:11:0:72:485:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:pressures favor more productive researchers. Promotion in the aggregate counteracts individual aging.

24:610:52493:28:27:71:528:443:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when university effects are included, then this may indicate that research output shifts towards 
24:611:52590:27:32:71:444:416:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities where output grows more slowly (Adams and Clemmons, 2009).

24:614:52803:27:28:71:510:333:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D stock and the stock of graduate students. All are highly significant, and together they 
24:615:52895:28:27:71:510:305:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:explain most of the variation in papers45.  The elasticity of R&D stock is 0.41 while that of

24:617:53081:28:28:72:532:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent results in 5.7 percent more papers in private universities, indicating diminishing returns 
24:618:53180:28:27:71:537:222:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to research resources.  Following (4′) 8.2 adds financial variables.  Lagged tuition is linked to an 
24:619:53281:27:28:71:508:195:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase in papers, but this is not statistically significant.  The coefficient of endowment is 
24:620:53377:28:27:71:523:167:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:positive and marginally significant.  Auxiliary/total revenue and enrollment/faculty (financial 
24:621:53473:27:31:71:535:140:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:duress) reduce research output, but again are not statistically significant.  As in (5), equation 8.3

25:626:53825:0:27:72:507:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adds university dummies.  Tuition revenue now enters significantly as do the indicators of 
25:627:53916:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial duress.  In 8.2 and 8.3, trend becomes insignificant so that growth of research output is 
25:628:54016:28:27:72:508:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fully explained. R&D stock and graduate students decline slightly, but remain significant.

25:630:54199:28:28:72:527:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases compared to the earlier regressions for papers, that of graduate students declines and 
25:631:54296:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:becomes insignificant.  Endowment is linked to an increase in citations, suggesting that private 
25:632:54393:27:28:72:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities use endowment to buy release time and hire star faculty.  As with papers, trend is not 
25:633:54493:28:27:72:328:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significant once the financial indicators are included. 
25:634:54549:27:28:90:504:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:In all these production functions and those in succeeding tables, the sum of the output

25:636:54737:28:27:72:515:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests decreasing returns to scale in university research and limits to university size, 
25:637:54833:27:28:72:529:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with Adams and Clemmons (2009).  The relevance of this point is that, allowing for 
25:638:54927:28:27:72:529:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fixed costs of research and after the efficient scale is reached, research may be better shifted to 
25:639:55027:27:28:72:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities in which it was previously missing. I shall return to this point in the summary and 
25:640:55124:28:31:72:213:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conclusion in Section VII.     
25:641:55155:31:24:126:417:291:257:Times:257:Times:C:C. Pooled Regressions: Public Universities 
25:642:55197:24:28:90:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Table 9 reports results for public universities.  In general, output elasticities of R&D stock 
25:643:55292:28:27:72:537:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are less than in Table 8 for private schools.  One difference, though, is the larger elasticity of the 
25:644:55395:27:28:72:530:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock of graduate students, about 0.1 higher and significant throughout.  This may indicate that 
25:645:55492:28:27:72:526:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:graduate student assistants are funded in public universities, to a larger extent, by means other 
25:646:55590:27:28:72:520:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than R&D, such as teaching assistantships.  Research output rises, usually significantly, with 
25:647:55685:28:28:72:523:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tuition plus state appropriations.  Endowment does not contribute to research output in public 
25:648:55780:28:0:72:505:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities, because amounts per faculty member are too small to matter.  Auxiliary/total 
26:649:55876:0:27:72:517:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:revenues and enrollment/faculty enter with the expected negative signs, but are insignificant 
26:650:55970:27:28:72:300:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:once university effects are taken into account.   
26:651:56020:28:27:90:529:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The trend coefficient is also greater in the public university regressions.  The coefficient of 
26:652:56116:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trend is even higher in the “within” regressions (9.3 and 9.6) than in total.  Again, this may 
26:653:56211:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reflect a shift of research towards schools where output growth is slower (Adams and Clemmons, 
26:654:56306:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2009).  Some of trend growth could also be due to knowledge flows from private universities, 
26:655:56399:27:28:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:since knowledge flows are more likely to take place from higher to lower ranked departments 
26:656:56491:28:27:72:514:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Adams, Clemmons, and Stephan, 2006) and since top departments are more often found in 
26:657:56578:27:32:72:176:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private universities.   
26:658:56602:32:24:126:492:456:257:Times:257:Times:C:D. Regressions Stratified by Rank of University-Field 
26:659:56655:24:27:90:528:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Let us now consider university-fields stratified into groups according to top 20, middle 40, 
26:660:56748:27:28:71:538:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and bottom 40 percent rankings.  Table 10 contains frequency distributions of the top 20, middle 
26:661:56845:28:27:71:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:40, and bottom 40 by private and public ownership. The top 20 and middle 40 percent account 
26:662:56937:27:28:71:536:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for most of the private school observations.  In contrast public school observations cluster in the 
26:663:57037:28:27:71:516:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:middle and bottom 40 percent. Even so, public universities contain almost half of the top 20 
26:664:57130:27:28:71:489:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent university-fields. The stratified regressions take this into account by analyzing 
26:665:57220:28:28:71:289:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differences in quality wherever they occur.    
26:666:57267:28:27:89:518:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Table 11 reports estimates of (4′) and (5).  It shows results for the top 20, middle 40, and

26:668:57457:28:40:71:534:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:groups by rank, the regressions are stratified, though they are pooled across fields46.   I focus on

26:670:57618:8:16:72:505:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:46 Following Section IV, top 20 percent regressions include the top five in astronomy, the top 15 in biology, 
26:671:57728:16:12:72:530:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:medicine, and engineering, and the top 10 in all other fields.  Middle 40 percent regressions include the next 10 in 
26:672:57845:12:11:72:537:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:astronomy, the next 30 in biology, medicine, and engineering, and the next 20 in all other fields. Bottom 40 percent 
26:673:57962:11:12:72:513:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:regressions include the bottom 10 in astronomy, the bottom 30 in biology, medicine, and engineering, and the 
26:674:58071:12:11:72:191:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:bottom 20 in all other fields.  
26:675:58103:11:0:72:75:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F: 
27:676:58108:0:27:72:510:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:key variables consisting of trend, R&D, and graduate students, not reporting results for the 
27:677:58201:27:28:72:391:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial variables, although these are included in the regressions. 
27:678:58270:28:27:108:522:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: Top 20 percent university-fields obtain more research output from R&D and graduate 
27:679:58353:27:28:72:516:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students than the middle or bottom 40 percent47.  Indeed, graduate students in the bottom 40 
27:680:58446:28:28:72:516:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent fail to make any significant contribution to research.  This implies that their primary 
27:681:58542:28:27:72:539:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:duties are to teach and work on thesis research.  This and the faculty time needed for dissertation 
27:682:58642:27:28:72:495:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work, reduce the net student contribution to zero in bottom 40 percent university-fields. 
27:683:58732:28:27:108:509:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: Below the top 20 percent the pattern in the trend coefficients suggests that research 
27:684:58818:27:28:72:539:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:output grows more rapidly in the within regressions, which include university effects, than in the 
27:685:58917:28:28:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:total regressions that exclude these effects. As before, this pattern could be due to a shift in 
27:686:59014:28:31:72:472:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:output towards universities in which growth is less (Adams and Clemmons, 2009). 
27:687:59094:31:24:126:451:401:257:Times:257:Times:C:E.  Faculty Compensation and Wage Structure  
27:688:59136:24:27:90:499:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The empirical work concludes with a regression analysis of faculty compensation by 
27:689:59219:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:professorial rank—or in other words, the academic wage structure. Studying this structure could 
27:690:59315:28:27:72:528:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:help us to further understand the financial condition of universities.  The dependent variable is 
27:691:59413:27:28:71:527:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the logarithm of wages plus fringe benefits in ’92 $ at the full and assistant professor ranks48.   
27:692:59513:28:28:71:528:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:These are university-wide averages, since HEGIS, which is their source, does not collect wage 
27:693:59607:28:27:71:511:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data by university-field. Since compensation is an average I cannot estimate a typical wage 
27:694:59699:27:28:71:537:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equation where wages are a function of education, experience, and tenure.  But faculty quality is 
27:695:59797:28:29:71:535:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reflected in the logarithm of the university-wide R&D stock per faculty, the logarithm of tuition

27:697:59955:8:16:72:525:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:47 These results are similar to findings for Top 10 universities not reported here.  The Top 10 are selected on the 
27:698:60070:16:11:72:518:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:basis of top 10 citation impact per paper in a set of 21 fields during 1981-1993.  Schools ranked as top 10 most 
27:699:60183:11:12:72:522:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:frequently among these fields are considered a Top 10 University.  They include eight private schools (Harvard,

27:701:60407:11:12:72:530:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:schools (Berkeley and the University of Washington). It should come as no surprise that top 20 percent university-
27:702:60521:12:7:72:251:85:100:g_d0_f3:576:Times:C:fields predominate in Top 10 universities.

28:720:62035:27:28:71:528:269:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in a large city raises private school wages by 5-10 percent, although it has no significant effect 
28:721:62134:28:27:71:530:241:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on wages in public schools, probably because state institutions are mostly located outside large 
28:722:62231:27:28:71:486:214:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cities.  For full professors in private universities, R&D stock and endowment increase 
28:723:62318:28:28:71:505:186:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compensation.  Besides trend, the only significant determinant of compensation in public  
28:724:62408:28:37:71:442:158:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities is current revenue consisting of tuition plus state appropriations.

28:726:62549:7:17:72:501:114:42:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f3:F:49 The compensation gap between private and public universities rises at the rate of 0.8% a year.  In simple 
28:727:62658:17:12:71:539:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:regressions that include trend and intercept, I find that, relative to the GDP deflator, both full and assistant professor 
28:728:62781:12:11:71:519:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:compensation grows at 2.3% per year in private universities and at 1.5% per year in public universities. Top 10 
28:729:62893:11:0:71:455:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:university compensation grows at 2.2% per year. R2s for these regressions range from 0.3-0.5.   
29:730:62994:0:27:108:542:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C: Equations 12.3 and 12.6 display the results for the difference in compensation for full and 
29:731:63086:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assistant professors.  In the private university equation (12.3), we see that location in a large city, 
29:732:63190:28:27:71:477:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tuition, and endowment increase the wage premium for senior faculty, but trend and 
29:733:63273:27:28:71:538:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment/faculty decrease it.  In the public university equation (12.6), the wage structure is flat 
29:734:63375:28:28:72:515:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across ranks.  Together the findings suggest that successful researchers have an incentive to 
29:735:63469:28:31:71:579:570:144:g_d0_f3:257:Times:B:move to private universities that increases with the rank of full professor.                                        
29:736:63585:31:24:107:413:539:257:Times:144:g_d0_f3:C:VII.  Discussion, Synthesis, and Conclusion  
29:737:63628:24:27:89:537:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Is the U.S. losing its preeminence in higher education?  The evidence presented in this paper 
29:738:63722:27:28:71:541:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that in a relative sense it is.  Sections II and III tell a story of rapid postwar expansion of 
29:739:63827:28:28:71:518:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. universities, followed by a tapering off after 1980. A series of natural experiments took 
29:740:63922:28:27:71:535:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:place in the 1930s and 1940s that contributed to this growth.  Because of their exogeneity, these 
29:741:64020:27:28:71:510:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:early events may in time capture the imagination of researchers studying higher education. 
29:742:64111:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:In the early years growth of U.S. universities was aided by refugee scientists, with foreign 
29:743:64204:27:28:71:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:graduate students playing a larger role after 1980.  Additional early factors that contributed to 
29:744:64302:28:27:71:532:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expansion of U.S. universities include a broadening of access to universities, increased military 
29:745:64400:27:28:71:541:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research during World War II and the Cold War, and the expansion of high technology industries 
29:746:64495:28:28:71:537:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:during the postwar period.  Since the 1980s we observe more rapid growth of academic research 
29:747:64589:28:27:71:532:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in Europe, and especially East Asia, that implies convergence in world science and engineering 
29:748:64684:27:28:71:223:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and a decline in the U.S. share. 
29:749:64717:28:27:89:505:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:But this is not the entire story. Most recently, in the 1990s, we observe a slowdown of 
29:750:64805:27:28:72:533:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:publication output in the U.S. This becomes the central puzzle of the paper, and Sections IV-VI 
29:751:64901:28:28:72:529:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:address it using panel data on universities, fields and years.  In Section IV I describe the panel, 
29:752:65001:28:0:71:524:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and in Section V I present growth facts concerning U.S. university research. These reveal that 
30:753:65101:0:27:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:much of the slowdown in publication is located in public universities.  While R&D stocks grow 
30:754:65195:27:28:72:530:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more rapidly in public than private schools, current revenues grow more slowly.  This suggests 
30:755:65290:28:27:72:498:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that public universities fall behind because of slower growth in their financial resources. 
30:756:65382:27:28:90:506:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:The regression findings in Section VI indicate a fairly similar if not perfectly identical 
30:757:65473:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:production process in public and private universities.  On average, both obtain similar increases 
30:758:65571:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in scientific papers from similar combined increases in R&D, graduate students, tuition revenues, 
30:759:65669:27:28:72:492:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and endowment.  This is true even though graduate students play a larger role in public 
30:760:65757:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities, perhaps because research is cross-subsidized by teaching assistantships more of the 
30:761:65855:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time.  In view of this broad similarity,  a divergence in research output over time, in which public 
30:762:65956:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities fall behind, can only be accounted for by a lower rate of increase in public university 
30:763:66057:28:27:72:230:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:resources, as Section V reveals.  
30:764:66091:27:28:90:533:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:In support of this hypothesis compensation in private universities rises almost one percent a 
30:765:66185:28:27:71:522:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year faster than in public universities.  And besides, wages are flat across professorial rank in 
30:766:66283:27:28:71:506:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:public universities, whereas they rise noticeably with rank in private universities.  All this 
30:767:66378:28:27:71:526:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggests reasons for top scientists to migrate from public to private universities.  Therefore, in 
30:768:66477:27:28:71:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:several ways slower growth in current revenues in public universities produces slower growth of 
30:769:66573:28:28:71:157:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research as well.  
30:770:66592:28:27:89:537:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:At the same time, (mostly federal) research funding expands at a faster rate in public schools 
30:771:66687:27:28:72:541:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Adams and Clemmons, 2009).  Together this tells an interesting story of state and federal policy 
30:772:66785:28:27:72:538:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interactions.  Even as (mostly federal) R&D is expanding, the states are subjected to a portion of 
30:773:66884:27:28:71:531:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rising health care costs under Medicaid. In addition, some are subject to mandated equalization 
30:774:66980:28:28:71:515:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of K-12 education expenditures which raise the cost of elementary and secondary education 
30:775:67070:28:0:71:499:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Murray, Evans, and Schwab, 1998).  Towards the end of the period some states commit 
31:776:67160:0:27:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:themselves to pre-paid tuition plans that are inadequately funded (Rizzo, 2006). So growth of 
31:777:67254:27:28:71:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mostly federal research dollars is cancelled out by the slower growth of state dollars in public 
31:778:67351:28:27:71:132:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities. 
31:779:67365:27:28:89:534:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:An obvious question that arises is whether this situation will persist.  If it is temporary, then 
31:780:67463:28:28:71:494:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the downward fluctuations of finances of public universities during the 1990s would be 
31:781:67550:28:27:71:510:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compensated by upward fluctuations at a later time, leaving public institutions on the same 
31:782:67642:27:28:71:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unaltered trend line with little to be concerned about in the long run.  But if the situation is 
31:783:67739:28:27:71:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:permanent and state funding remains below trend and perhaps increasingly so, then top public 
31:784:67832:27:28:71:535:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities would have to seek alternative sources of funding to begin to catch up to top private 
31:785:67931:28:28:71:510:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities.  They might for example, seek to obtain freely floating tuition from parents of 
31:786:68025:28:27:71:514:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students anywhere in the world.  But this solution seems unlikely given the charters of state 
31:787:68119:27:28:71:534:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities and ownership of their real assets by the states.  More likely is a gradual removal of 
31:788:68219:28:27:71:527:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tuition price controls to in-state families amidst a frank recognition that price caps deny public 
31:789:68318:27:28:71:529:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities the resources that are essential to a good education.  Still another solution revolves 
31:790:68418:28:27:71:502:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:around increased commercialization of university inventions as well as increased sales of 
31:791:68508:27:28:71:502:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:merchandise and entertainment, though the latter are hardly consistent with the academic 
31:792:68597:28:28:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:missions of these institutions.  All these adjustments to the new realities seem destined to occur 
31:793:68696:28:27:71:519:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:slowly, so that relative shortfalls of public universities are likely to persist for years to come. 
31:794:68796:27:28:89:525:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:On a world-wide scale, the relatively faster growth of universities in newly industrializing 
31:795:68889:28:27:71:511:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries will continue.  This is because this growth is part of a convergence process in the 
31:796:68983:27:28:71:511:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing world, in which steady state incomes and growth rates increase as a function of 
31:797:69074:28:0:71:504:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases in education and stocks of knowledge.  Even if funding problems of U.S. public 
32:798:69168:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities could be resolved through improved mechanisms of finance, the decline in the U.S. 
32:799:69263:27:28:72:317:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:share of world science will likely persist.                
32:800:69322:28:27:90:539:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Yet another possibility arises. All that we have seen in this paper, which covers more than 80 
32:801:69417:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of academic research in the U.S., consists of a fixed set of top 110 institutions.   Tables 8, 
32:802:69520:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:9 and 11 show that these universities are subject to decreasing returns to scale in research, since 
32:803:69620:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the sum of the output elasticities of R&D stock, graduate students,  and financial resources is less 
32:804:69721:27:28:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than one. Since this is the definition of decreasing returns, one might suppose that beyond the 
32:805:69817:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:efficient scale, more growth could be obtained at less cost by spreading research funds over a 
32:806:69912:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wider range of universities. Of course, organizational assets in smaller research institutions are 
32:807:70011:28:28:72:510:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not necessarily the equal of those in top 110 schools.  It follows that if sustained growth of 
32:808:70106:28:27:72:536:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research output is the objective, then the challenge is not only that of spreading resources across 
32:809:70206:27:28:72:507:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more schools, but also that of replicating the assets of top universities.  At present, growth 
32:810:70301:28:27:72:592:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be more rapid in universities where this kind of replication remains an open question.
