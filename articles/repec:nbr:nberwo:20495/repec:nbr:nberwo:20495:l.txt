2:26:1218:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:A:We argue that the welfare gains from trade in new models with micro-level margins exceed those in
2:27:1315:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:frameworks without these margins. Theoretically, we show that for fixed trade elasticity, different
2:28:1414:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:models predict identical trade flows, but different patterns of micro-level price variation. Thus, given
2:29:1518:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:data on trade flows and micro-level prices, different models have different implied trade elasticities
2:30:1620:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:and welfare gains. Empirically, models with extensive or variable mark-up margins yield significantly
2:31:1721:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:larger welfare gains. The results are robust to incorporating into the estimation moment conditions
2:32:1820:14:42:72:499:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:that use trade-flow and tariff data, which imply a common trade elasticity across models.

3:47:2182:0:27:56:157:719:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1. Introduction
3:48:2197:27:18:57:555:692:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This paper argues both theoretically and empirically that the welfare gains from trade in new
3:49:2290:18:18:56:554:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade models with various micro-level margins are larger relative to models without these mar-
3:50:2384:18:18:56:555:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gins. In an important class of trade models, we show that for fixed trade elasticity, different
3:51:2479:18:18:56:555:638:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models have different implications for micro-level price variation, even though their predic-
3:52:2572:18:17:56:555:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions for aggregate trade are identical. These facts imply that, given data on aggregate trade
3:53:2666:17:18:56:555:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and micro-level prices, different assumptions about the underlying model result in different
3:54:2758:18:18:56:554:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade elasticities and consequently different welfare gains from trade. Empirically, we quantify
3:55:2854:18:18:56:555:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these differences and we find significantly larger welfare gains in new models with various
3:56:2945:18:25:56:386:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:micro-level margins versus old models without these margins.
3:57:3005:25:18:57:555:524:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our theoretical analysis focuses on three canonical modelsof trade:Anderson(1979) (hence-
3:58:3094:18:17:56:555:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forth Armington),Eaton and Kortum(2002) (henceforth EK), andBernard, Eaton, Jensen, and
3:59:3181:17:18:56:555:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Kortum(2003) (henceforth BEJK). Analyzing these three models is insightful because each
3:60:3268:18:18:56:554:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model adds an additional micro-level margin of adjustment from a reduction in trade costs.
3:61:3358:18:18:56:555:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In particular, Armington features an intensive margin only(i.e. reductions in trade costs lead
3:62:3452:18:18:56:555:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to higher cross-border purchases of previously traded goods). EK features an intensive and
3:63:3542:18:18:56:555:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:extensive margin (i.e. reductions in trade costs further lead to additional goods being traded).
3:64:3638:18:18:56:555:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, BEJK further adds to EK a variable mark-up margin. All three models fit into the class
3:65:3733:18:18:56:555:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of models examined byArkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare(2012) where the trade elas-
3:66:3822:18:18:56:555:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticity and the share of expenditure on domestic goods are sufficient statistics to measure the
3:67:3916:18:24:56:178:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:welfare cost of autarky.
3:68:3940:24:18:57:555:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To understand the link between trade elasticities and micro-level prices, we examine the theo-
3:69:4034:18:18:56:555:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:retical distribution of price gaps of identical goods across countries in a symmetric, two-country
3:70:4132:18:18:56:555:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:version of each model. Assuming a fixed trade elasticity, we show that the price gap distri-
3:71:4224:18:18:56:554:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bution in the Armington model stochastically dominates that in the EK model, which further
3:72:4314:18:18:56:555:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dominates the one in the BEJK model. The ranking of these distributions implies a similar rank-
3:73:4409:18:18:56:555:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing in the expectation of the largest order statistic of price gaps from each model. In turn, this
3:74:4507:18:18:56:555:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:statistic is inversely related to the trade elasticity. Hence, to match an observed order statistic
3:75:4606:18:18:56:555:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the data, the Armington model requires the highest trade elasticity, while the BEJK model
3:76:4698:18:18:56:555:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:needs the lowest. Because the analysis constrains all models to generate identical aggregate
3:77:4790:18:18:56:555:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade flows, the elasticity ranking result together with thesufficient statistic formula ofArko-
3:78:4886:18:17:56:555:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lakis et al.(2012) implies that the welfare cost of autarky is different across models. In particular,
3:79:4988:17:18:56:554:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the BEJK model yields the highest, while the Armington modelyields the lowest welfare gains
3:80:5079:18:25:56:115:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from trade.
3:81:5090:25:18:57:554:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We quantify the importance of the theoretical results by estimating the trade elasticities in the
3:82:5187:18:0:56:555:63:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:multi-country asymmetric version of each model. The particular estimation approach that we
4:83:5278:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:use builds both on the theory described above and on our earlier work inSimonovska and
4:84:5364:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Waugh(2014) which focused on the specifics of the EK model. The basic ideabehind our esti-
4:85:5454:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mation strategy is to choose the trade elasticity to match moments between the model and the
4:86:5546:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data about order statistics of bilateral price gaps. While we focus on a broader set of models
4:87:5640:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and moments than inSimonovska and Waugh(2014), the methodological approach is similar in
4:88:5728:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:spirit. First, we estimate the parameters of the models necessary to simulate micro-level price
4:89:5823:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data using bilateral trade-flow data, which guarantees thatall models have identical aggregate
4:90:5917:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade predictions. Second, we use these parameter estimates and a given trade elasticity to
4:91:6008:18:18:56:555:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simulate micro-level prices from each model and to construct the model-implied moments. We
4:92:6098:18:17:56:554:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:then choose the trade elasticity to minimize the distance between the moments in each model
4:93:6189:17:25:56:125:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the data.
4:94:6202:25:18:57:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Using price and trade-flow data for the year 2004 for the 30 largest countries in terms of gross
4:95:6298:18:18:56:554:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:output, we estimate trade elasticities for each of the threemodels under various specifications
4:96:6393:18:18:56:555:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:including exactly-identified and overidentified specifications using different weighting matri-
4:97:6488:18:18:56:555:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ces. Across all specifications, the estimate of the trade elasticity is systematically lower for BEJK
4:98:6589:18:17:56:555:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative to EK and EK relative to the Armington model. The difference in magnitudes is sub-
4:99:6680:17:18:56:555:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stantial. The EK estimate is about 20 percent lower than Armington, implying that the welfare
4:100:6773:18:18:56:555:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost of autarky is 20 percent higher in the model that features an extensive margin. In compar-
4:101:6868:18:18:56:555:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ison, the estimate of the trade elasticity in the BEJK model is about 33 percent lower relative to
4:102:6966:18:18:56:555:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:EK, implying the welfare gains are estimated to be 50 percentlarger in a model that features an
4:103:7061:18:18:56:555:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:extensive and variable mark-up margin relative to the benchmark model that only captures an
4:104:7152:18:25:56:192:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intensive margin of trade.
4:105:7178:25:17:57:554:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We further examine versions of the two canonical endogenousvariety models: the monopolis-
4:106:7267:17:18:56:555:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tic competition framework ofKrugman(1980) and the framework ofMelitz(2003) which has
4:107:7351:18:18:56:554:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an extensive margin of trade with productivity-based firm selection. We apply our estimation
4:108:7443:18:18:56:555:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:procedure on the two frameworks and obtain trade elasticityestimates in the Melitz model that
4:109:7536:18:18:56:555:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are 30 percent lower than Krugman, resulting in 30 percent higher welfare gains from trade in
4:110:7629:18:18:56:555:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the former. The result is due to presence of an extensive margin of trade in Melitz, but not in
4:111:7724:18:24:56:110:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Krugman.
4:112:7732:24:18:57:554:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A natural question is why we focus on micro-level price variation as a means to estimating
4:113:7822:18:18:56:554:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade elasticities.  The focus on micro-level price variation is important for several reasons.
4:114:7917:18:18:56:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:First, emphasis on prices is important because all models make concrete and distinct predic-
4:115:8009:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions about price variation, e.g. in contrast, moments about the firm/sales size distribution are
4:116:8106:18:25:56:307:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indeterminate in the Armington and EK model.
4:117:8150:25:18:57:555:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Second, alternative approaches to estimating the trade elasticity do not appear to be very infor-
4:118:8247:18:0:56:554:69:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mative relative to our “micro” approach. There are estimation approaches that utilize aggregate
5:119:8343:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data and relationships between model and data that are straightforward to implement and are
5:120:8434:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:common across models (see, e.g., the discussion inArkolakis et al.(2012) andCaliendo and
5:121:8522:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Parro(2014)). These are not invalid approaches and provide additionalevidence on the elastic-
5:122:8615:18:24:56:117:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ity of trade.
5:123:8628:24:18:57:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We show, however, that the aggregate moments employed by these alternative approaches
5:124:8713:18:18:56:554:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are not informative relative to our approach. To demonstrate this point, we carry out a joint

5:126:8898:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our moment conditions with those utilized byCaliendo and Parro(2014) (i.e. triple differenced
5:127:8991:18:18:56:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade flows and tariffs, and a model-independent orthogonality condition). Thus, depending
5:128:9081:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upon aspects of the data, the combined estimation procedurehas the ability to deliver an esti-
5:129:9175:18:24:56:361:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mate of the trade elasticity that is common across models.
5:130:9233:24:18:57:555:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We find that the macro moment conditions have no impact on our estimates (see, e.g. third
5:131:9322:18:18:56:555:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:column of Table7). The reason is that cross-country tariff data is extremelynoisy and has
5:132:9411:18:18:56:555:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:virtually no explanatory power for trade flows. Thus, any loss in fit due to the failure to satisfy
5:133:9510:18:18:56:554:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the linear best fit between trade flows and tariff-elasticityestimates is trivial; hence, tariff-based
5:134:9612:18:24:56:430:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:moment conditions have little power relative to our “micro”approach.
5:135:9680:24:18:57:555:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The final reason to focus on micro-level price variation is that it speaks directly to the economic
5:136:9779:18:18:56:555:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mechanisms at work in each model. The active extensive margin in the EK or Melitz model
5:137:9866:18:18:56:555:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or variable markups in BEJK all manifest themselves in different patterns of micro-level price
5:138:9960:18:18:56:555:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variation. Thus, to learn about the importance of these margins, one should focus on data
5:139:10049:18:18:56:555:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that these margins can speak to. Moreover, even if aggregate, model-independent approaches
5:140:10139:18:18:56:555:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:were informative about the trade elasticity, these approaches lack the ability to discriminate
5:141:10233:18:18:56:555:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across models and are uninformative about the mechanisms atwork in the data. We make
5:142:10317:18:18:56:555:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some preliminary steps in this direction by finding that Armington/Krugman and BEJK do not
5:143:10407:18:24:56:533:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:describe well (in a formal statistical sense) the micro-level price patterns found in the data.
5:144:10502:24:18:57:555:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A closely related paper to ours is the work byMelitz and Redding(2014), who focus on the
5:145:10590:18:18:56:555:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subset of endogenous variety models that we examine. Their welfare ranking between the
5:146:10676:18:18:56:555:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Krugman and the Melitz model is identical to ours. The argument, however, differs. Keeping
5:147:10766:18:18:56:555:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other parameters fixed,Melitz and Redding(2014) argue that the Melitz model generates higher
5:148:10858:18:18:56:555:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade shares than the Krugman model, thus yielding higher welfare gains from trade. Instead,
5:149:10950:18:18:56:555:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we estimate the trade-elasticity parameters of the two models subject to the restriction that the
5:150:11047:18:18:56:555:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models generateidenticaltrade shares—the ones observed in the data. Hence, our approach is
5:151:11137:18:18:56:555:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:most closely related toArkolakis et al.’s (2012). LikeArkolakis et al.(2012), we keep trade shares
5:152:11235:18:18:56:555:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fixed, since all models generate identical predictions along that dimension. UnlikeArkolakis
5:153:11327:18:18:56:554:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:et al.(2012), we do not assume an identical trade elasticity across models; rather, we allow data
5:154:11424:18:0:56:555:69:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to determine the appropriate trade elasticity for each model. Our welfare conclusions, then,
6:155:11517:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differ fromArkolakis et al.’s (2012) because trade elasticities turn out to systematically vary
6:156:11612:18:36:56:458:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across models due to the differences in the models’ predictions about prices.

9:334:19302:18:18:56:555:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:change bilateral trade between two countries. This elasticity is important because if one wants
9:335:19397:18:18:56:555:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to understand how a bilateral trade agreement will impact aggregate trade or to simply under-

10:349:19865:36:18:56:555:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hence, decreasing the domestic expenditure share by one percent generates a(1/θ)/100-percent

10:351:20051:18:18:56:555:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is sufficient to obtain data on realized domestic expenditures and an estimate of the elasticity

10:353:20159:24:18:57:555:572:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Givenθ’s impact on trade flows and welfare, this elasticity is absolutely critical in any quanti-

10:355:20292:24:18:57:554:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The challenge with estimating the trade elasticity is that one mustseparatelydisentangleθfrom

10:359:20667:18:18:56:555:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticity, which implies that in order to match the observed price variation in the data, different

10:362:20843:27:18:57:555:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This section shows that different trade models have different implications for the distribution of
10:363:20941:18:18:56:554:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative price gaps. This implies that, given data on trade flows and micro-level prices, different
10:364:21040:18:25:56:493:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models have different trade elasticities and thus different welfare gains from trade.
10:365:21125:25:18:57:555:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To illustrate the argument theoretically, we focus on a symmetric, two country world with the
10:366:21218:18:18:56:555:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries denoted as home(h)and foreign (f). In a symmetric two-country world, the only
10:367:21305:18:17:56:554:280:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:two parameters that govern trade flows (as well as prices) in the models above areθandτ.3
10:368:21394:17:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Throughout this section, we assume thatθandτare constrained to fit the bilateral trade share.
10:369:21487:18:25:56:258:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This implies that ifθ > θ′, thenτ < τ′.
10:370:21526:25:18:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Given the constraint that all models must imply the same bilateral trade flows, we then make
10:371:21618:18:18:56:555:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the following argument. First, we describe properties of the distribution of relative prices at
10:372:21713:18:18:56:554:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the micro-level. Second, we order these distributions (across models and for differentθs) by
10:373:21805:18:18:56:554:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first-order stochastic dominance and, in turn, by the largest order statistic or maximal price gap
10:374:21903:18:17:56:554:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in a finite sample. This then allows us to order the impliedθs across models given the observed
10:375:21998:17:27:56:287:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:largest order statistic from a sample of data.
10:376:22044:27:16:70:554:104:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:3To see this, from the first equality in expression (4) and the definition ofΦnin (2), notice that, given trade share
10:377:22161:16:0:56:470:88:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:data and a value forθ,logτcan be computed immediately in a symmetric two-country world.

11:379:22328:27:18:57:555:695:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we focus on deviations from the law of one price at the micro level, i.e. for an
11:380:22425:18:18:56:554:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual variety. Specifically, we focus on the logged price gap between the home and the

11:384:22699:34:18:56:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Throughout, we drop the subscriptℓfor brevity, and we only use it when it is necessary to
11:385:22788:18:25:56:223:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distinguish prices across goods.

11:398:23103:54:18:56:555:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Note that we index the density by parameterθ. This indexing is sufficient because other pa-
11:399:23194:18:18:56:555:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rameters are either the same across models (e.g. the technology parameters), or are determined
11:400:23288:18:24:56:423:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by the valueθ, e.g.θdeterminesτso aggregate trade is held constant.
11:401:23355:24:18:57:555:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:An important property of this density is that all price gaps lie belowlogτ. The reason is the
11:402:23448:18:18:56:555:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:following: suppose thatlogPh,ℓ−logPf,ℓ>logτ, then an arbitrage opportunity exists as an
11:403:23535:18:18:56:555:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agent could import goodℓfrom the foreign country at a lower price. Thus, this inequality places
11:404:23630:18:18:56:554:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an upper bound on the possible observable price gaps. This property is important because the
11:405:23722:18:18:56:555:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:support of the density depends onθ. Differentθs imply differentτs because aggregate trade
11:406:23811:18:18:56:555:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constrains the values that these parameters can take. Thus,this property allows us to make
11:407:23901:18:18:56:555:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conclusions as to how parts of the density shift in a model with parameterθrelative to the
11:408:23991:18:24:56:189:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model with parameterθ′.
11:409:24014:24:18:57:554:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:How the density shifts asθchanges at any price gap in certain models is analytically intractable
11:410:24110:18:18:56:555:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(though numerically verifiable). Thus, we assert that the following regularity conditions holds
11:411:24205:18:27:56:210:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the price gap distribution.

11:413:24336:18:33:56:264:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:property. Ifθ′> θ, then forlog  ̃ph<logτ′:

12:415:24437:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This property says the following: Fix a modelM. If we lower the elasticity fromθ′toθand
12:416:24524:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constrain aggregate trade to stay the same, the probabilityof seeing a particular price gap can-
12:417:24620:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not increase. So as the upper end of the support increases fromlogτ′tologτ, it can not induce
12:418:24713:18:24:56:180:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a “cross” in the density.
12:419:24738:24:18:57:554:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This property clearly holds in the Armington model. In the Armington model, all goods are
12:420:24827:18:18:56:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:traded and thus the probability mass of the price gaps lies completely atlogτ′. If we lower
12:421:24918:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the elasticity fromθ′toθ, then all the probability mass shifts rightward tologτ. For the EK
12:422:25009:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model, this holds as well (see online appendix ofSimonovska and Waugh(2014)). For the BEJK
12:423:25099:18:18:56:555:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model, analytically verifying this is difficult because a closed-form expression for the price
12:424:25193:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gap distribution does not exist; we have, however, verified that this holds numerically for all
12:425:25288:18:24:56:197:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relevant parameter values.
12:426:25314:24:18:57:555:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Below, we define the data features we will focus on. Specifically, the maximal price gap from a

12:438:25931:18:17:56:555:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of thought as it has been used inEaton and Kortum(2002) andSimonovska and Waugh(2014)
12:439:26016:17:18:56:555:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the estimation ofθ. Second, order statistics encode much information about the underlying
12:440:26108:18:18:56:555:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f5:B:density. For example, one can show that a sequence of largestorder statistics (that is forL=
12:441:26200:18:18:56:555:290:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f2:B:1,2, . . .) completely characterizes the densityG(see, e.g.,Arnold, Balakrishnan, and Nagaraja
12:442:26294:18:18:56:555:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1992)). We will never have access to an infinite sequence of largest order statistics. However,

13:477:27760:18:18:56:555:554:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implies thatτ′< τ. Then,τ′< τand Regularity Condition1implies that, forlog  ̃ph<logτ′,
13:478:27846:18:18:56:554:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the cumulative probability in the model withθis weakly less than the cumulative probability
13:479:27937:18:18:56:554:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the model withθ′. Forlog  ̃ph= logτ′, the cumulative probability in the model withθ′is equal
13:480:28032:18:18:56:555:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to one, and because there is strictly positive probability mass in the regionlog  ̃ph>logτ′for the
13:481:28130:18:18:56:554:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model withθ, this implies a strict inequality in probability mass atlog  ̃ph= logτ′. This implies
13:482:28227:18:24:56:555:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f18:B:first-order stochastic dominance. From Lemma1, the ordering of the order statistics follows.-
13:483:28320:24:18:57:555:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Lemma2allows us, for a given model,M, an ability to strictly rank expected maximal price
13:484:28408:18:18:56:554:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gaps byθ. One implication of this result is that the expected maximalprice gap identifies the
13:485:28501:18:18:56:554:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:θparameter. We exploit this result in Proposition3. The second implication is that it assists us
13:486:28597:18:18:56:555:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in showing that if all models have the same expected maximal price gap, then they must have
13:487:28688:18:35:56:305:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differentθs. We state the result formally below:

13:503:29053:32:18:56:555:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Proof:The proof proceeds by contradiction in the following two cases with the focus on the EK
13:504:29146:18:0:56:413:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model. The same argument applies with respect to the BEJK model.

14:507:29327:33:18:85:555:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:because for anylog  ̃ph<logτ, the probability mass in the Armington model is zero as all
14:508:29415:18:18:85:554:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:goods are traded and hence all positive price differences are equal to the trade friction.
14:509:29505:18:17:85:555:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This is strictly less than in the EK model as for anylog  ̃ph<logτ, the probability mass
14:510:29593:17:18:85:555:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:is greater than zero because there are non-traded goods. This argument implies the dis-

14:512:29767:18:18:85:555:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:distribution in the EK model. Application of Lemma1then implies the expected maximal
14:513:29851:18:28:85:370:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:price gaps should be ranked, which is a contradiction.

14:528:30137:46:18:85:555:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:and the last inequality follows from the observation made inCase #1 above, that for the
14:529:30224:18:17:85:555:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:sameθ, the Armington price gap distribution strictly dominates the EK price gap distri-
14:530:30311:17:18:85:555:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:bution. This implication contradicts the assumption that the expected maximal price gap
14:531:30398:18:28:85:217:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:is the same in all models.
14:532:30424:28:18:56:554:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally note that the same exact arguments apply for the BEJKmodel, where some goods are
14:533:30512:18:18:56:555:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:non-traded as in the EK model. Thus, if the Armington model, EK model, and BEJK model, all
14:534:30602:18:17:56:555:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have the same expected maximal price gap, then the elasticity in the Armington model must be
14:535:30694:17:25:56:321:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f18:B:strictly greater than the elasticity in EK or BEJK.-
14:536:30746:25:18:57:555:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure1illustrates the intuition behind this result. The top panelplots the cumulative distri-
14:537:30840:18:18:56:555:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bution function of log price gaps for the Armington (solid blue line), the EK (dashed red line)
14:538:30935:18:24:56:342:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the BEJK (solid black line) model—for the sameθ.
14:539:30987:24:18:57:555:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the Armington model, notice that all the mass lies onlogτ. This is because all goods are
14:540:31078:18:18:56:555:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:traded, i.e. there is no active extensive margin in the Armington model. If the home country
14:541:31170:18:18:56:555:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports the good from the foreign country, then the price gapexactly reflects the trade friction.
14:542:31267:18:18:56:554:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The distribution of price gaps in the EK model is different asit places a positive mass in the
14:543:31361:18:18:56:555:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:region between zero and the trade friction and hence the density in EK is stochastically dom-
14:544:31454:18:18:56:555:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inated by that of Armington. This is because there are endogenously non-traded goods, i.e.
14:545:31544:18:18:56:555:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:there is an active extensive margin. In the EK model, there are instances where consumers in
14:546:31636:18:18:56:554:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:bothcountries find it cheaper to consume a variety from the local producer rather than import-
14:547:31730:18:17:56:555:75:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing the good. If a good is non-traded, the price difference across locations reflects differences
14:548:31827:17:0:56:554:58:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in costs which are strictly less than the trade friction. This implies a positive mass in the region

16:588:32283:25:17:57:555:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Proposition2says that because the price gap density in Armington dominates the density in
16:589:32372:17:18:56:555:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:EK, the only way for the expected maximal price gap to be the same is if the EK model has a
16:590:32463:18:18:56:555:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lowerθ. The bottom panel of Figure1illustrates this by plotting the densities when they have
16:591:32555:18:18:56:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the same expected largest order-statistic. Here, the EK density is spread to the left with a larger
16:592:32654:18:25:56:544:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upper bound to ensure that the largest order statistic is thesame as in the Armington model.
16:593:32746:25:18:57:555:602:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:What about the relationship between EK and BEJK? Generically, we can say the following: if
16:594:32836:18:17:56:555:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the density in EK strictly stochastically dominates the density in BEJK and the largest order
16:595:32929:17:18:56:555:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:statistics are the same, then by logic of Proposition2this implies thatθEK> θBJ EK. A stronger
16:596:33023:18:18:56:555:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:statement is currently not possible as it is difficult to theoretically construct the BEJK price gap
16:597:33123:18:25:56:362:531:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:distribution because of the presence of variable markups.4
16:598:33181:25:18:57:554:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The top panel in Figure1shows that for the sameθ, the price gap density in EK dominates the
16:599:33272:18:18:56:555:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:density in BEJK. More generally we have verified that this relationship holds numerically for all

16:601:33460:18:18:56:555:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:always result in a ranking ofθEK> θBJ EK. Furthermore, the bottom panel of Figure1verifies
16:602:33550:18:17:56:555:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that if the largest order statistic is the same in EK and BEJK,then the BEJK model must have
16:603:33642:17:18:56:554:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a lower theta. This can be seen as the density in BEJK is spreadeven further to the left with a
16:604:33737:18:18:56:555:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:larger upper bound to ensure that the largest order statistic equals that in the EK and Armington
16:605:33834:18:25:56:98:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models.
16:606:33841:25:18:57:555:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Variable markups and how they correlate with costs in the BEJK model explain why the price
16:607:33931:18:18:56:555:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gap density in EK strictly dominates the density in BEJK. In the EK model, price gaps corre-
16:608:34023:18:18:56:555:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:spond to cost gaps and these cost gaps are identical in the twomodels. In BEJK, cost gaps do
16:609:34115:18:17:56:555:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not correspond with price gaps as producers are able to priceat a markup over marginal cost
16:610:34206:17:18:56:555:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depending on other latent competitors.5Thus, the price gap in BEJK reflects both markups,
16:611:34295:18:18:56:555:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost differences (if the good is non-traded), and trade frictions (if the good is traded). In BEJK,
16:612:34394:18:18:56:555:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:markups are negatively correlated with marginal costs. This results in the BEJK distribution
16:613:34486:18:25:56:320:231:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:being more compressed than the EK distribution.6
16:614:34534:25:18:57:554:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Consider the following example to illustrate this point. Take a producer in the foreign country
16:615:34629:18:17:56:555:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:who has a very high productivity and is the lowest cost producer in his country of origin as
16:616:34721:17:18:56:555:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well as the home country. This producer will likely charge a high markup (call itm′) in the
16:617:34812:18:19:56:555:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreign country because she has a very low cost relative to her latent competitors as that is
16:618:34905:19:16:70:555:134:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:4In the Appendix, we show that, in the case in whichρ= 1and the Dixit-Stiglitz mark-up is infinite, the
16:619:35008:16:12:56:555:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:probability that the log price gap reaches the boundaries isstrictly lower in the BEJK than in the EK model. This
16:620:35121:12:12:56:554:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:implies that the mass has to be distributed between these twoend-points—meaning, in the non-traded good
16:621:35224:12:8:56:422:94:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:region. However, the exact shape of the distribution cannotbe easily characterized.
16:622:35307:8:12:70:540:86:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:?:5Seede Blas and Russ(2010) for discussion ofnthe importance of the number of latent competitors in BEJK.
16:623:35411:12:16:70:555:74:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:6A related property is that it is straightforward to show thatthe EK price distribution (not price gaps) is a mean
16:624:35525:16:0:56:245:58:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:preserving spread of the BEJK distribution.
17:625:35570:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:her country of origin. In contrast, she will likely charge a relatively lower markup (call itm′′)
17:626:35667:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the home country because her cost advantage is eroded fromthe trade friction faced when
17:627:35757:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exporting to the home country. This implies that the price gap,log  ̃ph, will beless thanthe trade
17:628:35855:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:friction even though the good is traded, i.e. the price gap equalsm′′−m′+ logτ <logτ. This
17:629:35945:18:18:56:554:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observation implies that the BEJK distribution will have less mass around the log of the trade
17:630:36039:18:32:56:513:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:friction because of producers differentially marking up their products across locations.

17:632:36186:27:17:57:555:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We now connect Proposition2with an econometrician’s inference aboutθgiven a sample of
17:633:36271:17:18:56:555:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data (i.e. aggregate trade flows and a sample of micro-level prices) and discuss how this infer-
17:634:36367:18:18:56:555:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ence depends upon assumptions about the underlying model. Proposition3suggests a simple
17:635:36454:18:18:56:555:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:method of moments estimator and states that the estimatedθwill (i) depend on the econometri-

17:657:37016:26:18:71:555:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2. The estimate of the welfare cost of autarky in the Armington model is strictly less than the estimate
17:658:37120:18:27:85:307:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:of the welfare cost of autarky in EK and BEJK.
17:659:37166:27:18:71:555:211:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f15:F:3. If the density in EK stochastically dominates the densityin BEJK, then the estimateˆθEK>ˆθBEJ K
17:660:37264:18:23:85:464:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:and the welfare gains from trade in EK are strictly less than the gains in BEJK.
17:661:37344:23:18:56:555:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Proof:The first statement follows from Lemma2which implies that the order statistic uniquely
17:662:37436:18:18:56:554:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:determines theθfor a given model and Proposition2which implies that across models, theθ
17:663:37523:18:18:56:554:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:must differ. The second statement follows from the fact thatequation (6) is the same across
17:664:37614:18:18:56:555:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models and that, by construction, all models have the same predictions for aggregate trade
17:665:37704:18:24:56:182:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f18:B:flows, but differentθ.-
17:666:37727:24:18:57:555:74:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A couple of comments are in order about this result. First, the estimator is quite simple. How-
17:667:37822:18:0:56:555:56:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ever, our estimation strategy in Section4builds off the intuition from this result. Moreover,
18:668:37917:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we include alternative moment conditions to enrich the estimation, to be able to test over-
18:669:38008:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identifying restrictions, and to exploit empirical regularities we see in the data. We discuss
18:670:38102:18:24:56:256:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these moment conditions in Section4.
18:671:38138:24:18:57:555:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Second, compare Proposition3to the discussion in Section 6 inArkolakis et al.(2012). In this
18:672:38230:18:18:56:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section, they propose an alternative estimator of the tradeelasticity that delivers a common
18:673:38322:18:18:56:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate ofθacross models. Their estimator uses aggregate trade flows and some measure
18:674:38408:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of trade frictions (say tariffs) and the common connection between aggregate trade flows (i.e.
18:675:38502:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equation (5)) that all these models share. The final piece of their argument is toassumethat
18:676:38594:18:18:56:555:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the orthogonality condition that the estimate ofθis based on is model independent. In other
18:677:38685:18:18:56:554:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:words, their analog to the expectation of the functionh({θ,M})is assumed not to depend on
18:678:38774:18:18:56:554:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the modelM. Thus, the estimate ofθas well as the gains from trade will be the same across
18:679:38863:18:24:56:98:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models.
18:680:38870:24:18:57:555:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The key distinction between our argument and that ofArkolakis et al.(2012) is that the or-
18:681:38960:18:18:56:554:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thogonality condition we focus on is model dependent. Moreover, the structure of each model
18:682:39051:18:18:56:554:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implies a specific ranking as to how the estimate ofθshould relate to each other across models.
18:683:39146:18:18:56:555:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Ultimately, however, how different margins of trade affectestimates of the welfare gains from
18:684:39239:18:36:56:335:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade is an empirical question which we turn to next.
18:685:39292:36:27:56:233:387:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4. Estimating the Elasticity
18:686:39320:27:18:57:555:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This section describes how we estimate the trade elasticitygiven a data set that features micro-
18:687:39416:18:18:56:555:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level prices and bilateral trade flows across countries. Thebasic idea is captured in Proposition
18:688:39513:18:18:56:555:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:3: we use moment conditions that compare statistics from a sample of micro-level prices with
18:689:39605:18:18:56:555:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their expected values from each model, where the latter are functions ofθand depend on as-
18:690:39695:18:18:56:555:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumptions about the model that generated the data. Because the expected values do not have
18:691:39785:18:18:56:555:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:closed form expressions, we use simulation methods to approximate the expected value and
18:692:39873:18:18:56:555:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss how we are able to simulate prices from the different models. Finally, we provide
18:693:39965:18:32:56:395:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monte-carlo evidence that our estimation procedure works well.

19:713:40723:25:18:57:555:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:One difference from the previous section is that equation (10) adjusts the maximal price gap
19:714:40815:18:18:56:555:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by average price differences in the two locations. There areempirical and theoretical reasons
19:715:40908:18:17:56:555:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for this adjustment. Empirically, adjusting for price levels in each country helps us control for
19:716:41005:17:18:56:555:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country specific factors that may be present in the price databut not in our model.7Theoreti-
19:717:41098:18:18:56:555:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cally, if one wants to use the maximal price gap as a proxy for trade frictions and connect this
19:718:41194:18:18:56:554:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value with trade flows, then expression (5) suggests adjusting for the difference inΦs across
19:719:41287:18:18:56:555:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries as well. It turns out that the difference in the means of logged prices equals the dif-

19:721:41449:24:41:57:365:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Given thednis from data, we define the following function

19:730:41725:18:18:56:555:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simulation. The next section provides the exact details behind a simulation, but the basic idea
19:731:41820:18:18:56:555:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is the following: given a modelMand a value ofθ, we simulate prices, constructssynthetic
19:732:41908:18:17:56:555:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data sets, and then construct simulated values fordni(θ, us,M). The expected value ofdniis the
19:733:42002:17:19:56:212:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average across simulationsS.
19:734:42030:19:16:70:555:171:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:7For example, suppose there are country-specific factors such as sales taxes, which are multiples of the goods’
19:735:42141:16:12:56:554:155:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:prices. Then, the maximum log price difference between countriesnandiwill reflect the log differences in the
19:736:42249:12:12:56:555:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:country-specific sales taxes. The tax wedge washes out once we add the difference in the means of logged prices
19:737:42360:12:8:56:173:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:between countriesiandn.

19:739:42483:16:12:56:555:107:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:obtained for the Armington and BEJK models where price levels are also proportional to the price parameters as
19:740:42593:12:0:56:221:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:demonstrated in Proposition1above.
20:741:42629:0:33:57:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the exactly identified case, our estimation is based on thefollowing orthogonality restriction

20:743:42750:33:18:56:554:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:That is, at the true valueθo, in expectation the difference between the observeddniand its

20:759:43129:42:18:57:554:473:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Overidentified Case.The overidentified case focuses on two additional moments: (i) the price
20:760:43221:18:18:56:555:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gap in the 85th percentile adjusted by average prices and (ii) the covariance ofdniwith the
20:761:43312:18:25:56:218:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:logarithm of bilateral distance.
20:762:43344:25:18:57:554:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The focus on the price gap in the 85th percentile is a way to incorporate more information about
20:763:43440:18:18:56:555:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the underlying distribution of price gaps and, hence, information about the underlying model.
20:764:43533:18:17:56:554:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:For example, as discussed in Section3, the two country Armington model places a restriction
20:765:43624:17:18:56:554:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the data that the max should be the same as the price gap in the 85th percentile. The price
20:766:43718:18:18:56:555:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gap in the 85th percentile is not the only statistic that has this property. We explored other
20:767:43812:18:25:56:421:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percentiles (e.g. 90 or 75) and found virtually no effect on our results.
20:768:43885:25:18:57:555:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The covariance between thednistatistic and the logarithm of distance was chosen for two rea-
20:769:43977:18:18:56:554:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sons. First, as we show in Section5.1, there is a strong correlation between maximal price gaps
20:770:44072:18:17:56:555:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and distance. Given the strong role that distance plays in explaining trade flows, we feel this is
20:771:44170:17:18:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a natural statistic to target. Second, this also helps guardagainst estimating the elasticity off of
20:772:44270:18:18:56:554:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measurement error in the data by focusing on the systematic relationship between price gaps
20:773:44361:18:25:56:126:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and distance.
20:774:44374:25:18:57:554:184:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f20:B:Given these moments, the functionh(θ,dni,M)is now a3×1vector. The first element ofdni

20:776:44552:18:18:56:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the third is the covariance betweendniand the logarithm of bilateral distance. We are

21:795:45005:24:18:57:555:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:For the weighting matrix, we will present two sets of results: one using the identity matrix
21:796:45097:18:18:56:555:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and another using the optimal weighting matrix suggested byGouri ́eroux and Monfort(1996)
21:797:45186:18:18:56:555:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and described inAdda and Cooper(2003). Because the optimal weighting matrix depends on
21:798:45272:18:18:56:555:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our estimate ofθ, we use a continuous-updating estimator ofWwhich continually updates the
21:799:45361:18:18:56:555:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weighting matrix within the minimization routine (see e.g.the discussion of this estimator in
21:800:45454:18:24:56:244:467:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hansen, Heaton, and Yaron(1996)).
21:801:45487:24:18:57:555:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We compute standard errors using a parametric bootstrap technique (see e.g.Davison and
21:802:45573:18:18:56:554:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hinkley(1997)). We add error terms to the trade data (given our parametricassumption on
21:803:45660:18:18:56:555:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the error term in (19)) and re-estimate the country-specific parameters from thesimulated data
21:804:45754:18:18:56:555:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:necessary to simulate prices. Given these parameters, we simulate a sample of prices given our
21:805:45848:18:18:56:554:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate ofθand the assumed underlying model, and then implement our estimation routine
21:806:45935:18:18:56:554:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the simulated data. Thus, this procedure takes into account uncertainty in the technology
21:807:46027:18:18:56:554:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parameters and scaled trade costs estimated from trade dataand sampling variability in the
21:808:46117:18:18:56:554:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:micro-level prices. We repeat this procedure 100 times to construct 90-10 percentile confidence
21:809:46212:18:24:56:105:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intervals.
21:810:46222:24:18:57:554:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the instances where we use an optimal weighting matrix, wealso perform tests of overiden-
21:811:46314:18:33:56:376:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tifying restrictions. Specifically, we construct the test statistic

21:813:46413:33:18:56:555:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which is the standard “J-statistic” used to test the null-hypothesis that the data generating pro-
21:814:46511:18:17:56:555:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cess is correct. Asymptotically, this test statistic is distributed chi-squared with a certain number
21:815:46612:17:18:56:555:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of degrees of freedom, though in small samples this may not provide an accurate approxima-
21:816:46702:18:18:56:555:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion (see e.g.Hansen et al.(1996)). To avoid these difficulties, we use a parametric bootstrap to
21:817:46799:18:18:56:555:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:construct the finite sample distribution of the test statistic in (18) under the null hypothesis that
21:818:46900:18:25:56:433:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the data generating process is correct (seeDavison and Hinkley(1997)).
21:819:46970:25:18:57:555:77:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:BEJK Details.One detail associated with the BEJK model is that the value ofρ, the CES param-
21:820:47062:18:0:56:555:59:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eter, matters unlike in the EK model. The issue is thatρdetermines the monopoly pricing rule
22:821:47156:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which shapes the distribution of price gaps. To deal with this issue we proceed in two ways.
22:822:47248:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The first approach is to pre-calibrate this parameter to the value of 2.5 (which is consistent with

22:824:47433:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:second approach is to estimateρandθin the BEJK model. Specifically, in the overidentified
22:825:47522:18:24:56:411:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case, we pickθandρto jointly minimize the quadratic form in (17).
22:826:47587:24:18:57:555:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Relation to Previous Work.The statisticdnithat we use to estimateθis developing a history of
22:827:47679:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thought, so a couple of comments are necessary. First, EK used this statistic to directly estimate
22:828:47777:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:θ. If the maximal price difference accurately revealed the trade friction, then by examining (4)
22:829:47873:18:18:56:555:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one can see how averaging across normalized trade shares relative to the averagedniyields
22:830:47962:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an estimate ofθ. Using this method, they arrived at the value 8.28. As we demonstrate in
22:831:48050:18:18:56:554:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Simonovska and Waugh(2014), the maximal price gap generally underestimates the tradefric-
22:832:48139:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion, and hence overestimates the value ofθ. InSimonovska and Waugh(2014), we use indirect
22:833:48229:18:18:56:555:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inference to correct this bias by matching the observed EK estimate ofθto the model implied
22:834:48320:18:24:56:387:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value. Using this method, we arrived at the value around four.
22:835:48382:24:18:57:555:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We depart from our previous work for the following reasons. First, the new procedure fits
22:836:48471:18:18:56:554:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transparently within the GMM framework which allows us to formally test the overidentifying
22:837:48562:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:restrictions of various models and allows us to incorporateadditional moment conditions that
22:838:48654:18:18:56:555:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:existing work uses to estimate the trade elasticity (see e.g.Caliendo and Parro(2014)). Second,
22:839:48749:18:18:56:554:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we avoid a difficulty that arose when using both simulated trade flows and prices to construct
22:840:48843:18:18:56:555:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model implied EK estimate. One difficulty was that the simulated trade flows depended
22:841:48932:18:18:56:555:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the number of goods in the economy and for the simulated trade flows to mimic observed
22:842:49021:18:18:56:554:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade flows accurately this had to be a very large number. By just simulating prices, we avoid
22:843:49115:18:17:56:555:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the dependence on the number of goods in the economy and achieve a very large speed up
22:844:49201:17:18:56:555:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in computation time. Finally, in the exactly identified caseour new approach gives nearly the
22:845:49294:18:18:56:555:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exact same answer for the EK model as the approach used inSimonovska and Waugh(2014),
22:846:49379:18:25:56:161:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which is reassuring.
22:847:49399:25:18:57:555:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Why these Moments.The discussion above provided a brief, tactical rationale for why we
22:848:49485:18:18:56:555:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:chose the particular moments we did. We have carefully chosen the moments, explored a wide
22:849:49575:18:17:56:554:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variety of alternatives (such as different percentiles, order statistics from different-sized sam-
22:850:49673:17:25:56:394:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ples via recurrence relationships, etc.) and found similarresults.
22:851:49739:25:18:57:555:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are, however, deeper, strategic issues regarding thechoice of moments that are worth
22:852:49829:18:18:56:555:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pointing out. One may wonder why we do not use other micro moments such as the firm
22:853:49912:18:18:56:554:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size/sales distribution. The reasoning is simple: Momentsabout the firm/sales size distribu-
22:854:50004:18:18:56:555:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion are indeterminate in the Armington and EK models. In contrast, all models make concrete
22:855:50096:18:18:56:555:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and distinct predictions about price variation; hence, moments from the price distribution are
22:856:50190:18:0:56:121:69:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:informative.
23:857:50204:0:18:57:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:One may also wonder why we do not find and then use information regarding the existence
23:858:50291:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of traded versus non-traded goods for the identification of trade elasticities. If we could find
23:859:50387:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a good where the arbitrage relationship bound and under the assumption perfect competition,
23:860:50478:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this good’s price difference could be used to estimate a trade friction, and consequently, a trade
23:861:50576:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity. While this information may help, it does not help one answer the central question:
23:862:50670:18:18:56:554:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Are trade elasticities (and therefore welfare gains) different across models? For example, if the
23:863:50767:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:true data generating process is BEJK, then prices reflect variable mark-ups, so cross-country
23:864:50860:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price differences intradedgoods are not necessarily equal to trade costs as discussed in Sec-
23:865:50953:18:18:56:554:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion3. Furthermore, focusing on traded goods does not inform us about the underlying data
23:866:51042:18:17:56:555:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:generating process. As the arguments in Section3suggest and Figure1makes clear, the data
23:867:51130:17:18:56:555:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:features that distinguish different models are price gapsawayfrom the trade costs. Moreover,
23:868:51222:18:18:56:555:526:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the economic mechanisms (margins of trade) behind each of these models shape the pattern of
23:869:51313:18:18:56:555:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price gapsawayfrom the trade costs. This is the exact rationale for focusing on moments from
23:870:51405:18:18:56:555:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the price gap distribution that are away from the trade cost,such as the 85th percentile of the
23:871:51500:18:32:56:108:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price gap.
23:872:51510:32:27:56:198:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.2. Simulation Approach
23:873:51534:27:18:57:555:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A key step in the estimation procedure is the approximation ofE(dni;{θ,M})via simulation.
23:874:51623:18:18:56:555:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Below we describe in detail how we simulate prices from each model and in turn how we
23:875:51708:18:24:56:207:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approximateE(dni;{θ,M}).
23:876:51732:24:18:57:554:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are basically three steps. The distribution of pricesdepends onθand the country-specific
23:877:51826:18:18:56:555:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:technology parameters and bilateral trade costs. We use thegravity equation implied by all
23:878:51916:18:18:56:555:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models (derived in expression (19) below) to estimate the technology parameters and trade
23:879:52005:18:18:56:555:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs (up to a scalarθ) from trade flow data. This ensures that all models will have the same
23:880:52098:18:18:56:555:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate predictions for trade flows. Second, we show how the estimates from the gravity
23:881:52187:18:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equation are sufficient to simulate micro-level prices given a specified model. Third, we specify
23:882:52284:18:18:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a protocol as to how the data is sampled. These three steps allow us to create synthetic data sets
23:883:52382:18:24:56:337:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from which we can then approximateE(dni;{θ,M}).
23:884:52429:24:18:57:555:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 1.—We estimate the parameters for the country-specific productivity distributions and
23:885:52519:18:18:56:555:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade costs from bilateral trade-flow data. We follow closely the methodologies proposed by
23:886:52610:18:18:56:554:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Eaton and Kortum(2002) andWaugh(2010). First, we derive the gravity equation from expres-

24:902:53195:18:33:56:266:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs take the following functional form

24:904:53265:33:17:56:555:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Here, trade costs are a logarithmic function of distance, wheremniis the distance in miles

24:908:53593:18:18:56:554:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upon the exporter.Waugh(2010) shows that including this term helps trade models match
24:909:53678:18:18:56:555:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both cross-country variation in aggregate prices and tradeflows. As we showed inSimonovska
24:910:53768:18:18:56:555:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Waugh(2014), using importer fixed effects (as in EK) or aggregate price data to exactly

24:912:53952:17:18:56:555:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:amounts. Finally, our results are robust to incorporating bilateral colonial, language, and legal
24:913:54049:18:25:56:346:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:origin ties as well as countries’ geographical attributes.
24:914:54107:25:18:57:555:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The termexiis an exporter fixed effect and allows for the trade-cost level to vary depending
24:915:54199:18:24:56:452:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upon the exporter. We use least squares to estimate equations (19) and (20).
24:916:54275:24:18:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 2.—The parameter estimates obtained from the first-stage gravity regression are sufficient
24:917:54370:18:24:56:391:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to simulate micro-level prices in each model up to a constant,θ.
24:918:54434:24:18:57:554:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 2a.—The simulation of the Armington model is simple as there is no micro-level hetero-

24:920:54616:18:25:56:193:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all producers in countryi.
24:921:54642:25:18:57:555:284:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 2b.—To simulate micro-level prices in the EK model we followSimonovska and Waugh
24:922:54727:18:18:56:554:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2014). Notice that for any goodj, the model implies thatpni(j) =τniwi/zi(j). Thus, rather than
24:923:54822:18:18:56:555:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simulating productivities, it is sufficient to simulate theinverse of marginal costs of production

24:930:55063:33:18:56:555:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, having obtained estimates ofSifrom the gravity regression, we can simulate the inverse
24:931:55155:18:18:56:555:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of marginal costs. To construct prices at which goods are traded, we take the inverse marginal
24:932:55249:18:18:56:555:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs that are drawn from the country-specific distributions above and are assigned to each

24:934:55431:18:24:56:300:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tries is found and realized prices are recorded.

25:936:55572:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only, we draw on an argument in BEJK. To simulate their model,BEJK reformulate the model
25:937:55660:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f5:B:in terms of efficiency. In particular, given two productivity draws for goodjin countryi,z1i(j)
25:938:55755:18:33:56:284:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:andz2i(j), they define the following objects

25:941:55835:32:33:56:395:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:BEJK demonstrate that these objects are distributed according to

25:958:56219:33:32:56:106:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Similarly,
25:959:56229:32:33:188:555:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:A:P r[v2i≤v2|v1i=v1] = 1−exp(− ̃Siv2+ ̃Siv1),(23)
25:960:56276:33:24:56:195:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:where ̃Siis defined above.
25:961:56302:24:18:57:555:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, to simulate the model we draw minimum unit costs from (22), and conditional on these
25:962:56392:18:18:56:555:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:draws, we draw the second lowest unit costs from (23). Hence, having obtained the estimates
25:963:56483:18:25:56:530:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofSifrom the first-stage gravity regression, we can simulate theinverse of marginal costs.
25:964:56573:25:18:57:555:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To construct prices at which goods are traded, we take the inverse marginal costs that are drawn
25:965:56669:18:17:56:554:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from the country-specific distributions above and are assigned to each good. Then, for each
25:966:56760:17:18:56:555:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:importing country and each good, the two lowest-cost suppliers across countries are found and
25:967:56853:18:25:56:205:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:realized prices are recorded.
25:968:56882:25:18:57:555:95:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 3.—From the realized prices, a subset of goods common to all countries is defined and
25:969:56972:18:18:56:555:77:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the subsample of prices is recorded—i.e., we are acting as ifwe were collecting prices for the
25:970:57066:18:0:56:555:59:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:international organization that collects the data. The three models give a natural common bas-
26:971:57162:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ket of goods to be priced across countries. In these models, agents in all countries consume all
26:972:57258:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods that lie within a fixed interval,[0,1]. Thus, we consider this common list in the simulated
26:973:57355:18:24:56:441:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models and we randomly sample the prices of its goods across countries.
26:974:57426:24:18:57:555:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These steps then provide us with an artificial data set of micro-level prices that mimic their
26:975:57520:18:18:56:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analogs in the data. Given this artificial data set, we can then compute moments—as functions
26:976:57613:18:32:56:333:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofθ—and compare them to the moments in the data.

26:980:57869:18:31:56:517:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exposition purposes, we letθbe the same across the models, and we set it equal to four.

27:1004:59182:27:18:57:555:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our sample contains the thirty largest countries in the world (in terms of absorption). We use
27:1005:59276:18:18:56:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade flows and production data for the year 2004 to constructtrade shares. The price data used
27:1006:59371:18:18:56:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to compute moments on price gaps and aggregate price levels come from basic-heading-level
27:1007:59460:18:18:56:554:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data from the 2005 round of the International Comparison Programme (ICP). The dataset has
27:1008:59549:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:been employed in a number of empirical studies. For example,Bradford(2003) andBradford
27:1009:59635:18:18:56:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Lawrence(2004) use the ICP price data in order to measure the degree of fragmentation, or
27:1010:59728:18:18:56:554:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the level of trade barriers, among OECD countries. In addition, the authors provide an excellent
27:1011:59824:18:17:56:555:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:description of the data-collection process.Eaton and Kortum(2002) use a similar dataset for the

27:1013:59950:25:18:57:554:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The ICP collects price data on goods with identical characteristics across retail locations in

27:1015:60136:18:18:56:554:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a narrowly-defined group of goods for which expenditure dataare available. The data set
27:1016:60223:18:18:56:555:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contains a total of 129 basic headings, and we reduce the sample to 62 categories based on their
27:1017:60319:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correspondence with the trade data employed.Simonovska and Waugh(2014) provide a more

27:1019:60441:24:18:57:554:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The ICP provides a common list of “representative” goods whose prices are to be randomly
27:1020:60529:18:18:56:555:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sampled in each country over a certain period of time. A good is representative of a country if
27:1021:60624:18:18:56:555:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it comprises a significant share of a typical consumer’s bundle there. Thus, the ICP samples the
27:1022:60720:18:18:56:554:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices of a common basket of goods across countries, where the goods have been pre-selected
27:1023:60811:18:18:56:555:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:due to their highly informative content for the purpose of international comparisons. It is pre-
27:1024:60907:18:24:56:554:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cisely this sampling procedure that we mimic in the simulation methodology described above.
27:1025:60998:24:18:57:555:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table3reports how price gaps in the ICP data covary with typical gravity variables that de-

27:1028:61270:18:18:56:554:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rising in distance and are lower for countries that share a border. The second row repeats the

27:1030:61460:18:18:56:555:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:patterns are identical, the magnitudes are lower. Given thesystematic relationship between

27:1032:61661:16:12:56:555:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:(EIU) data. The EIU surveys the prices of individual goods across various cities in two types of retail stores:
27:1033:61772:12:12:56:555:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:mid-priced, or branded stores, and supermarkets, or chain stores. The dataset contains the nominal prices of 110
27:1034:61884:12:12:56:555:119:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:tradable goods, reported in local currency, as well as nominal exchange rates relative to the US dollar, which are
27:1035:61998:12:12:56:555:107:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:recorded at the time of the survey.Crucini, Telmer, and Zachariadis(2003) andCrucini and Yilmazkuday(2013)

28:1060:63272:18:18:56:555:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Proposition3. Consistent with the theoretical results, the estimate ofθis systematically lower

28:1062:63456:18:18:56:555:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is lower than for EK. The difference in magnitudes is substantial. The EK estimate is about 20
28:1063:63550:18:18:56:554:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent lower than Armington, implying that the welfare cost of autarky is 20 percent higher in
28:1064:63645:18:18:56:555:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the EK model. In comparison, our estimate of the trade elasticity in the BEJK model is about 33
28:1065:63740:18:18:56:555:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent lower relative to EK, implying the welfare gains areestimated to be 50 percent larger in

29:1091:65172:18:25:56:246:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results in the exactly identified case.
29:1092:65211:25:18:57:555:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:When the optimal weighting matrix is used, results do begin to change. Specifically, our es-
29:1093:65303:18:17:56:555:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:timate for the Armington model declines substantially relative to the previous two columns.
29:1094:65394:17:18:56:554:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This may seem problematic relative to our results in Proposition3, yet in fact it is highly symp-
29:1095:65491:18:18:56:555:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tomatic of the fact that the Armington model is misspecified.The first and second row of Table
29:1096:65585:18:18:56:555:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:5illustrate this point. The top two rows present the data and moments implied by the Arm-
29:1097:65674:18:18:56:555:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ington model. Across all moments, the Armington model has problems: it overpredicts the
29:1098:65761:18:18:56:555:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mean order statistic by a large margin, underpredicts the 85th percentile by a large margin, and
29:1099:65857:18:25:56:328:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:overpredicts the covariance term by a large margin.
29:1100:65908:25:17:57:554:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The difficulties of the Armington model are formalized in theP-value for the J-statistic which
29:1101:66002:17:18:56:555:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tests the null hypothesis that the Armington model is the data generating process. For the
29:1102:66092:18:18:56:555:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Armington model, the null hypothesis is rejected at a level of less than one percent. Given the
29:1103:66187:18:25:56:420:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:starkness of the Armington model, this should be a reassuring result.
29:1104:66256:25:18:57:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:For the EK model, the results with the optimal weighting matrix are nearly identical to the
29:1105:66347:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other results. The third row of Table5provides an informal sense of fit. The EK model exactly
29:1106:66440:18:18:56:555:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matches the 85th percentile (which is given the most weight)and it comes very close to match-
29:1107:66533:18:17:56:555:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing the mean order statistic and the covariance term. The J-statistic formalizes this and we fail
29:1108:66630:17:0:56:463:77:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to reject the null hypothesis that the EK model is the data generating process.
30:1109:66711:0:18:57:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Across specifications, the results for the BEJK model are similar. The one instance where the es-
30:1110:66808:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:timate changes is in the joint estimation of the CES parameterρandθwith the optimal weight-
30:1111:66899:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing matrix. In this instance, our estimate ofθbecomes smaller and our estimate ofρis lower
30:1112:66989:18:24:56:221:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than the calibrated value of 2.5.
30:1113:67022:24:18:57:554:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:While the BEJK model is the richer of the three models in termsof market structure and pricing
30:1114:67116:18:18:56:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:patterns, there is evidence that it is misspecified as the null hypothesis that the BEJK model
30:1115:67210:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:generated the data is rejected at the 1 percent level. Interestingly, the issue with the BEJK model
30:1116:67309:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is that it has a difficult time fitting the covariance between thedniand distance. This can be
30:1117:67403:18:18:56:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seen, for example, in the last row/final column of Table5; while the BEJK model has the ability
30:1118:67498:18:18:56:554:555:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:to match both the order statistics and 85th percentile; it has trouble with the covariance term.11
30:1119:67596:18:18:56:555:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The problem is due to variable markups. Variable markups naturally induce “noise” between
30:1120:67685:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price gaps (even if the good is traded in which case price gapsreflect the distance cost), which
30:1121:67781:18:18:56:555:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:makes it harder for the BEJK model to replicate the strong covariance observed in the data
30:1122:67871:18:36:56:231:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between price gaps and distance.

30:1124:67931:27:18:57:555:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The analysis thus far has focused on three canonical models of trade where the set of vari-

30:1127:68187:18:18:56:555:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Melitz. While these models can satisfy the same aggregate restrictions as the three models
30:1128:68277:18:18:56:555:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analyzed, we have kept them separate largely because we makeadditional assumptions about
30:1129:68365:18:18:56:554:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the structure of fixed costs and how we interpret the data whenthe set of varieties varies across
30:1130:68462:18:24:56:108:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries.
30:1131:68472:24:18:57:555:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Below, we outline versions of these two models and we repeat the quantitative exercises from
30:1132:68564:18:18:56:554:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above. We find that the Melitz model yields a lower estimate ofthe trade elasticity than the
30:1133:68656:18:32:56:405:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Krugman model, thus generating higher welfare gains from trade.

31:1155:69339:33:0:56:284:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:Thus a firm incurs a marginal cost ofwi/T

31:1157:69383:10:14:284:554:618:8:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:A:ias well as a fixed cost of entryei, both in labor
31:1158:69433:14:18:56:555:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:units. There is an unbounded pool of potential producers andthe mass of firms is pinned down
31:1159:69525:18:25:56:240:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:via a zero average profit condition.
31:1160:69561:25:18:57:555:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We make the assumption that fixed costs are proportional to the mass of workers in countryi,
31:1161:69653:18:18:56:555:543:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:Li. Under the proportionality assumption on fixed costs, the mass of entrants is identical across
31:1162:69750:18:24:56:265:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries and proportional to1/(1 +θ).
31:1163:69788:24:18:57:555:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Conditional on entry, all consumers buy all products from all sources. Moreover, due to the
31:1164:69879:18:18:56:555:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proportionality assumption on entry costs, each country contributes a measure of1/Ntoward

31:1169:70234:27:18:57:555:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we outline a variant of theMelitz(2003) model parameterized as inChaney(2008). In
31:1170:70324:18:24:56:546:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the exposition, we follow closelyArkolakis, Demidova, Klenow, and Rodr ́ıguez-Clare(2008).
31:1171:70414:24:18:57:555:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The preference relation as well as the market structure are identical to theKrugman(1980)
31:1172:70503:18:18:56:555:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model described above. There are two novel features. First,in order to sell its product to
31:1173:70593:18:18:56:555:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marketn, a firm from any countryiincurs an additional market access cost,an, which is pro-
31:1174:70683:18:18:56:555:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portional to the mass of workers in the destination,Ln. Second, marginal costs of production
31:1175:70775:18:18:56:555:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are not identical across producers within a country. In particular, upon paying the entry cost
31:1176:70869:18:18:56:554:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:ei, a firm fromidraws a productivity realization for goodj,zi(j), from the country-specific
31:1177:70960:18:18:56:555:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Pareto distribution with pdfTiz−θ. As in the Frechet distribution, the parameterθin the Pareto
31:1178:71054:18:24:56:397:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distribution governs the variability of productivity among firms.
31:1179:71119:24:18:57:555:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The two additional assumptions imply that there exist cost thresholds that limit the participa-
31:1180:71214:18:18:56:555:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion of certain firms to certain markets. In particular, if a firm obtains a cost draw above the
31:1181:71310:18:18:56:555:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:threshold cost that characterizes the “most accessible” destination, it exits immediately with-
31:1182:71405:18:18:56:555:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:out operating. Thus, because of free entry, in equilibrium expected profits of a firm must be
31:1183:71498:18:18:56:555:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equal to the fixed entry cost. In addition, more productive firms serve more markets and the
31:1184:71590:18:24:56:436:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:“toughest” markets attract the most efficient producers from all sources.
31:1185:71663:24:0:57:554:64:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As in theKrugman(1980) model, firms charge a constant mark-up over their marginal cost of
32:1186:71754:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:production. However, unlike theKrugman(1980) model, the prices of goods offered by a given
32:1187:71844:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country differ according to the efficiency of the individualproducer. More importantly, even
32:1188:71936:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:though entry costs are proportional to the mass of workers, the measure of firms that serve
32:1189:72027:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:each market is no longer constant. Thus, selection among exporters alters the composition of
32:1190:72119:18:32:56:222:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the bundle of consumed goods.

32:1192:72195:27:18:57:555:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we show that the two models with an endogenous set of varieties produce
32:1193:72283:18:18:56:555:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identical aggregate outcomes to the models with an exogenous set of varieties. In particular,
32:1194:72376:18:18:56:554:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:under the parametric assumption made above, all five models yield the same expressions for
32:1195:72466:18:18:56:555:538:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade flows, price indices (up to a constant scalar), and welfare gains from trade. Proposition4

32:1228:73465:27:18:57:555:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Since the endogenous variety models yield an identical gravity equation of trade as the exoge-
32:1229:73559:18:18:56:555:84:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nous variety models, the first stage of the estimation is identical. What remains is to describe
32:1230:73655:18:0:56:227:66:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the micro price-level simulation.
33:1231:73690:0:18:57:555:723:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 2d.—The simulation of the Krugman model is trivial because it does not feature micro-
33:1232:73780:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level heterogeneity. In this model, ̃Sifully characterizes the common marginal cost of produc-
33:1233:73874:18:24:56:253:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion across all producers in countryi.
33:1234:73912:24:18:57:555:663:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 2e.—The simulation of theMelitz(2003) model is more intricate. In theEaton and Kortum
33:1235:74002:18:18:56:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2002) andBernard et al.(2003) models—which feature heterogeneity—a good is indexed by
33:1236:74088:18:18:56:554:627:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:j∈[0,1]or an integer when discretized on the computer. In theMelitz(2003) model, different
33:1237:74178:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries are consuming and producing different goods. To carry out the simulation, we dis-
33:1238:74269:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cretize the continuum to a set of potentially produced goods. We proceed to determine the sub-
33:1239:74363:18:18:56:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:set of goods produced domestically for each country. Then, we simulate inverse marginal costs
33:1240:74456:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for each good. Inverse marginal costs are determined followingEaton, Kortum, and Kramarz
33:1241:74544:18:18:56:554:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2011) who show how normalized inverse marginal costs can be sampled from a parameter free
33:1242:74634:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:uniform distribution. Then, we determine the set of exported varieties for all country-pairs and
33:1243:74730:18:24:56:186:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we compute their prices.
33:1244:74754:24:18:57:555:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As in the exogenous variety models, we must specify how the subsample of prices is recorded.
33:1245:74846:18:18:56:555:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the fixed variety models, because all goods are consumed everywhere, there is a natural
33:1246:74936:18:18:56:555:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:common list from which we randomly sample the prices of its goods across countries. The key
33:1247:75027:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issue in the Melitz model is that the set of goods consumed is different across countries. Below
33:1248:75123:18:24:56:272:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we describe how we deal with this issue.
33:1249:75163:24:18:57:555:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 3a.—In the Krugman model, all produced goods appear in all countries, and each country
33:1250:75254:18:18:56:555:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contributes a fraction1/Nof them. Thus, like the exogenous variety models, there is a natural
33:1251:75347:18:25:56:474:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:common basket of goods prices to be randomly sampled from across countries.
33:1252:75422:25:18:57:555:320:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Step 3b.—In the Melitz model, we define the common set of goods whose prices will be sam-
33:1253:75511:18:17:56:554:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pled to be the set of goods produced by firms with low enough cost draws so that they serve

33:1277:75950:45:18:56:555:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Notice that this share varies across countries. This variation is precisely the reason behind the
33:1278:76047:18:18:56:555:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different elasticity estimates that we obtain from the two models. In the Krugman model, the
33:1279:76139:18:18:56:554:104:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:maximal bilateral price difference is likely to equal the unobserved trade friction (exactly like
33:1280:76236:18:18:56:555:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the Armington model). In the Melitz model, only goods soldby firms that enter all markets
33:1281:76328:18:0:56:555:68:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are able to make the sample of prices that data collectors would consider. Moreover, the firms
34:1282:76424:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that enter all markets are likely to be from source countrieswith low trade costs to export. This
34:1283:76521:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implies that, in the Melitz model, the average maximal pricedifference across country pairs is
34:1284:76615:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to be below the average trade friction across countrypairs. Thus, one needs a lower trade
34:1285:76711:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity in Melitz relative to Krugman to rationalize thesame amount of trade observed in the
34:1286:76806:18:18:56:554:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data. The differences in trade elasticities then translateinto differences in the measured welfare
34:1287:76904:18:32:56:244:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gains from trade in the two models.

34:1291:77135:18:18:56:554:538:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model yields an estimate ofθthat is roughly 30 percent lower than the estimate for the Krugman
34:1292:77229:18:18:56:555:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model. Hence, adding an extensive margin of trade increasesthe welfare gains from trade by

34:1313:77775:45:18:57:555:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The last three columns report the results from the overidentified estimation. Once again a sim-
34:1314:77870:18:17:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ilar picture emerges as in the estimation of the exogenous variety models. The overidentified
34:1315:77963:17:18:56:554:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimation that uses the optimal weighting matrix yields anestimate ofθfor the model that
34:1316:78052:18:18:56:555:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:features an extensive margin—Melitz in this case—that is roughly the same as in the overiden-
34:1317:78145:18:18:56:555:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tified case with an identity matrix and the exactly identifiedcase. However, when using the
34:1318:78236:18:18:56:555:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:optimal weighting matrix, the estimate ofθfalls considerably for the model that features only
34:1319:78329:18:18:56:554:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an intensive margin of trade—in this case Krugman. Once again, the J statistic allows us to
34:1320:78420:18:18:56:555:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reject the hypothesis that the model with an intensive margin only has generated the data. In
34:1321:78513:18:24:56:475:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, we cannot reject the null that the Melitz model hasgenerated the data.
34:1322:78593:24:18:57:555:96:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Relation to Melitz and Redding (2014).Our estimation yields a lower trade elasticity estimate
34:1323:78686:18:18:56:555:78:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the Melitz model than the Krugman model, which translates into higher welfare gains from
34:1324:78778:18:0:56:555:60:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade in the former.  Recently,Melitz and Redding(2014) also argue that the Melitz model
35:1325:78868:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:generates higher welfare gains from trade than the Krugman model. Their argument, however,
35:1326:78958:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is very different from ours and it goes as follows. The Krugman model is a special case of the
35:1327:79052:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Melitz model where the distribution of firm productivities becomes degenerate. Naturally,θis
35:1328:79144:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the central parameter that governs this distribution. The authors then demonstrate that, if all
35:1329:79239:18:18:56:554:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other parameters of the two models are kept identical, the Melitz model generates higher trade
35:1330:79333:18:24:56:336:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shares and therefore higher welfare gains from trade.
35:1331:79386:24:18:57:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Instead, our exercise estimates the parameters of the two models such that they generateiden-
35:1332:79479:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticaltrade shares—the ones observed in the data. Then, the reasonwhy the welfare gains differ
35:1333:79572:18:36:56:506:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is because differentθ’s are necessary in order to match the price moments in the data.

35:1335:79686:27:18:57:555:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we present the results from two exercises. First, we modify our estimation ap-
35:1336:79781:18:18:56:555:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proach to incorporate “macro” moment conditions of the sortarticulated inArkolakis et al.
35:1337:79870:18:18:56:555:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2012). We find that these aggregate moments are not informative about the trade elasticity
35:1338:79961:18:18:56:555:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative to our “micro” approach. Second, we evaluate the sensitivity of our estimates of trade
35:1339:80056:18:18:56:555:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticities to the presence of measurement error in the micro price data. We find that incorpo-
35:1340:80152:18:18:56:555:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rating measurement error only strengthens our results by magnifying the quantitative differ-

35:1343:80295:27:18:57:554:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:How do our estimates of trade elasticities compare to estimates that one would obtain by fol-
35:1344:80388:18:18:56:555:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lowing a “macro” based approach using aggregate measures oftrade frictions? This is a par-
35:1345:80478:18:18:56:555:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticularly relevant question in light of the results ofArkolakis et al.(2012). As they suggest, a
35:1346:80574:18:18:56:555:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:macro based approach that uses tariffs and assumes a model-independent orthogonality con-
35:1347:80663:18:18:56:555:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dition results in an estimate ofθthat is model independent. This implies that the welfare gains
35:1348:80758:18:24:56:261:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from trade are the same across models.
35:1349:80796:24:18:57:554:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To compare the two approaches, we modify our estimation to incorporate macro moment con-
35:1350:80884:18:18:56:555:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ditions that use aggregate measures of tariffs. The idea behind this exercise is to let the data
35:1351:80980:18:18:56:555:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:speak to which moment conditions are more powerful. In otherwords, depending upon as-
35:1352:81065:18:18:56:555:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pects of the data, the combined estimation procedure has theability to deliver an estimate of
35:1353:81158:18:24:56:381:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the trade elasticity that is common across models or different.
35:1354:81221:24:18:57:555:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We build onCaliendo and Parro’s (2014) approach, which represents the state-of-the-art tech-

37:1422:83801:45:18:56:555:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ulating the variability in our micro moments is exactly as described in Section4. To simulate
37:1423:83894:18:18:56:554:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variability in the macro moments, we assume that the deviation between triple differenced
37:1424:83983:18:18:56:554:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade flows and triple differenced tariffs is normally distributed.  Given our parametric as-
37:1425:84076:18:18:56:555:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumption on the residuals, we are able to simulate variability in the macro moments. Together,
37:1426:84170:18:25:56:444:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this approach allows us to construct 90-10 percentile confidence intervals.
37:1427:84245:25:17:57:555:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Data.To implement this approach we used the trade flow and tariff data fromParro(2013). In
37:1428:84335:17:18:56:555:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this data set, there are 24 countries (20 of them are in our data set) for the year 1990. Because
37:1429:84432:18:18:56:555:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the years differ between our data set andParro’s (2013) data set, our underlying assumption is
37:1430:84526:18:18:56:555:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the trade elasticity is invariant across time.Parro’s (2013) data set contains data on tariffs
37:1431:84625:18:18:56:555:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for capital goods and non-capital goods. Since we are interested in an aggregate tariff measure,
37:1432:84721:18:18:56:555:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we construct aggregate tariffs by taking a trade-weighted average of the two sectors. Simple
37:1433:84813:18:25:56:220:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:averaging gives similar results.
37:1434:84845:25:17:57:555:245:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Results.The first column of Table7presents the results using only the tariff based estimation
37:1435:84938:17:18:56:555:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approach. Using this data we find an estimate ofθof around 4.6. This result is very much
37:1436:85026:18:18:56:555:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the results thatParro(2013) reports. The second column reproduces the results
37:1437:85119:18:18:56:555:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from our exactly identified estimation. For the BEJK model, we set the value ofρequal to 1.37,
37:1438:85213:18:25:56:296:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its estimated value from the previous section.
37:1439:85259:25:18:57:555:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The third and fourth column of Table7report our estimate ofθwhen both the micro moment
37:1440:85345:18:18:56:555:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conditions and the macro moment conditions are used. The keyresult is that the third and
37:1441:85433:18:17:56:555:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fourth column are nearly identical to the second column. Either with an identity or optimal
37:1442:85524:17:18:56:555:96:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weighting matrix, incorporating macro based moment conditions has virtually zero effect on
37:1443:85614:18:0:56:130:78:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our estimates.

38:1464:85879:35:18:57:555:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The reason for this result is that the tariff based method provides very little information about
38:1465:85976:18:18:56:555:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the exact nature of the trade elasticity. To see this, Figure2plots the triple differenced tariff data
38:1466:86078:18:18:56:555:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the x-axis and triple differenced trade flow data on the y-axis. Plotted on top of the data are
38:1467:86176:18:25:56:455:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the “best fit” lines implied by the different estimation methods and models.
38:1468:86252:25:17:57:554:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The key thing to notice is that the data are exceptionally noisy and that the pure tariff based
38:1469:86347:17:18:56:555:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approach does not describe the data that well. This implies that large deviations (say from 4.6
38:1470:86442:18:18:56:555:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to 2.7) from the least square best fit provide negligible losses in mean square error. This means
38:1471:86539:18:18:56:554:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that tariffs provide little valuable information with regards toθ. Thus when the macro approach
38:1472:86634:18:32:56:515:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is combined with our estimation method, the tariff data doesnot assist in identifyingθ.

38:1474:86753:27:18:57:555:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The second extension we explore is the role of measurement error in our micro price data. Mea-

38:1476:86942:18:18:56:555:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Simonovska and Waugh(2014), abstracting from measurement error will bias our estimates of
38:1477:87031:18:18:56:554:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the trade elasticity downwards. A second concern, is that this bias may be model specific. That
38:1478:87126:18:18:56:555:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is the differences inθacross models could be smaller (or larger) depending on how measure-
38:1479:87216:18:24:56:330:104:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment error interacts with the structure of the model.
38:1480:87269:24:18:57:555:80:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To address these concerns we jointly estimateθand the amount of measurement error in the

39:1493:88167:33:18:56:554:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wherepn(ℓ)is the observed price of goodℓin countryn,p∗n(ℓ)is the true price, andǫis the

39:1495:88344:18:24:56:437:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thatǫis distributed normally with mean zero and standard deviationσǫ.
39:1496:88413:24:18:57:554:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We then jointly estimate the two parameters,θandσǫ, to minimize the distance between the
39:1497:88501:18:18:56:555:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three model moments and the three data moments in the overidentified case as described in
39:1498:88590:18:18:56:555:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Section4. We present the results with both the identity and optimal weighting matrix. Standard
39:1499:88684:18:24:56:436:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:errors and the weighting matrix are computed as described inSection4.
39:1500:88753:24:18:57:555:279:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Results.Table8presents the results. The first two columns present the estimate ofθand
39:1501:88838:18:18:56:555:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measurement error with an identity matrix. The last three columns present the results with the
39:1502:88932:18:24:56:195:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:optimal weighting matrix.
39:1503:88957:24:18:57:555:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The main result from Table8is that even in the presence of measurement error, we find thatthe
39:1504:89050:18:18:56:555:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ordering of models is still preserved with new trade models delivering lower trade elasticities.
39:1505:89146:18:18:56:554:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In fact, the quantitative differences are larger, e.g. EK isnow nearly 50 percent lower relative
39:1506:89242:18:18:56:554:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:to Armington/Krugman. This difference is largely because we find a much higher value ofθ
39:1507:89330:18:18:56:555:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(6.78 versus 5.23) in the Armington/Krugman model relativeto our baseline results. What is
39:1508:89420:18:18:56:555:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:occurring is that the Armington/Krugman model requires a substantial amount of measure-
39:1509:89507:18:18:56:555:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment error with an offsetting reduction in the trade elasticity to best fit the observed amount
39:1510:89602:18:18:56:554:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of price variation. This does not imply, however, that Armington/Krugman plus measurement
39:1511:89691:18:18:56:554:75:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:error is an accurate description of the data; we clearly reject the null hypothesis in this case that
39:1512:89792:18:0:56:240:57:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the data generating process is true.
40:1513:89830:0:18:57:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are several other notable features of these results. For both EK and BEJK, our point
40:1514:89920:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates forθare effectively the same as our baseline results. While the point estimates for
40:1515:90013:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:σǫindicate little presence of measurement error, the confidence interval is wide. Second, like
40:1516:90107:18:18:56:554:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our results in Table4and Table6, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the EK model or the
40:1517:90202:18:36:56:231:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Melitz model generated the data.
40:1518:90234:36:27:56:149:615:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:8. Conclusion
40:1519:90247:27:18:57:554:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We argue that the welfare gains from trade in new trade modelswith various micro-level mar-
40:1520:90338:18:18:56:554:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gins are larger relative to models without these margins. First, we make a theoretical argument:
40:1521:90434:18:18:56:554:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Assuming a fixed trade elasticity, different models have identical predictions for bilateral trade
40:1522:90532:18:18:56:555:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:flows but different predictions for cross-country price variation. Thus, for given data on trade
40:1523:90628:18:18:56:555:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:flows and prices, different models have different trade elasticities and thus different welfare
40:1524:90723:18:18:56:555:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gains from trade. Second, we estimate the trade elasticity and the welfare cost of autarky under
40:1525:90819:18:18:56:555:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different assumptions about the underlying model. Relative to an Armington trade model, an
40:1526:90909:18:18:56:555:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:active extensive margin increases the welfare cost of autarky by 20 percent; variable markups
40:1527:91002:18:18:56:555:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:further increase the cost by 30 percent. In addition, relative to a Krugman model, an active
40:1528:91094:18:18:56:555:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:extensive margin as in Melitz increases the welfare cost of autarky by 30 percent. Third, we
40:1529:91186:18:18:56:555:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incorporate into our estimation moment conditions that usetrade flow and tariff data, which
40:1530:91277:18:0:56:518:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imply a common trade elasticity; this modification has virtually no effect on our results.
