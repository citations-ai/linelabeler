2:38:2309:28:14:72:545:588:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:How much capital should financial intermediaries hold? We propose a general equilibrium model 
2:39:2402:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:with a financial sector that makes risky long-term loans to firms, funded by deposits from savers. 
2:40:2501:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:Government guarantees  create  a  role  for  bank  capital  regulation.  The  model  captures  the  sharp 
2:41:2606:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:and  persistent  drop in  macro-economic  aggregates  and  credit  provision  as  well  as  the  sharp 
2:42:2708:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:change in credit spreads observed during the Great Recession. Policies requiring intermediaries to 
2:43:2806:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:hold  more  capital  reduce  financial fragility,  reduce  the  size  of  the  financial  and  non-financial 
2:44:2914:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:sectors,  and  locally  increase  macro-economic volatility.  They  redistribute  wealth  from  savers  to 
2:45:3020:14:42:72:527:490:12:Times:12:Times:the owners of banks and non-financial firms. Current capital requirements are close to optimal.

3:66:3486:0:37:64:200:715:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1    Introduction
3:67:3503:37:21:64:546:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-09 underscored the importance of the financial
3:68:3598:21:21:64:546:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:system for the broader economy.  Borrower default rates, bank insolvencies, government bailouts
3:69:3693:21:21:64:546:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of financial institutions, and credit spreads all spiked while real interest rates were very low. The
3:70:3794:21:21:64:546:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disruptions in financial intermediation fed back on the real economy.  Consumption, investment,
3:71:3889:21:25:64:314:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and output all fell substantially and persistently.
3:72:3940:25:21:75:547:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These events have prompted a vigorous yet unresolved debate among policymakers and aca-
3:73:4027:21:21:64:546:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demics on whether the economy would be better off with stricter bank capital requirements.
3:74:4117:21:21:64:546:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The December 2017 Minneapolis Plan reflects the Federal Reserve’s view and proposes raising
3:75:4208:21:21:64:546:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank capital requirements to 23.5% of risk-weighted assets, with further increases to 38% for
3:76:4301:21:20:64:546:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks that remain systemically important.  In their seminal book, Admati and Hellwig (2013)
3:77:4392:20:21:64:546:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:propose raising capital requirements to 25% of assets.  Larger equity capital buffers would re-
3:78:4487:21:21:64:546:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sult  in  less  risk-taking,  lower  risk  of  bank  failure  and  concomitant  government  bailouts,  but
3:79:4593:21:21:64:546:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also in a smaller banking sector that lends less to the real economy, depressing investment and
3:80:4688:21:21:64:546:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:output.  Considering this trade-off,  Admati and Hellwig argue that “for society,  there are in
3:81:4783:21:21:64:546:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fact  significant  benefits  and  essentially  no  cost  from  much  higher  equity  requirements.”  The
3:82:4887:21:21:64:546:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authors of the Minneapolis Plan agree, writing that their plan “will have paid for itself many
3:83:4981:21:21:64:546:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:times over if it avoids one financial crisis.” This argument is not without controversy in the
3:84:5075:21:25:64:402:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:academy (Calomeris, 2013) and heavily contested by the industry.
3:85:5139:25:21:75:547:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:What  is  missing  in  this  debate  is  a  quantitative  general  equilibrium  model  that  embeds  a
3:86:5241:21:21:64:546:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial sector in a model of the macro-economy, and that can capture infrequent but large
3:87:5332:21:21:64:546:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial  crises.   Our  paper  proposes  such  a  model.   In  the  model,  banks  extend  long-term
3:88:5434:21:21:64:546:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loans to firms who invest and are subject to aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
3:89:5527:21:21:64:546:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Firm  default  results  in  losses  for  their  lenders,  which  can  trigger  bank  default.   Even  banks
3:90:5634:21:21:64:546:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that remain standing become fragile and cut lending to firms.  A large and persistent decline
3:91:5727:21:21:64:546:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in credit depresses output persistently.  The high leverage of banks, which far exceeds that of
3:92:5822:21:21:64:546:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms, amplifies modest credit losses into financial disasters.  The nonlinear behavior of credit
3:93:5919:21:21:64:546:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spreads reflects this financial distress.  The government bails out the creditors of the banks that
3:94:6018:21:20:64:546:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fail by issuing government debt, gradually repaid through future taxation.  Because financial
3:95:6111:20:0:64:546:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intermediaries  are  constrained  in  their  ability  to  re-lever  and  raising  new  equity  from  their
4:96:6218:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shareholders is expensive, the banking sector shrinks substantially and persistently.  Real inter-
4:97:6316:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:est rates must fall to induce savers to accommodate the reduction in deposits.  Banks’ reduced
4:98:6410:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ability to absorb aggregate risk in financial crises results in a deterioration of risk sharing and
4:99:6509:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher macro-economic volatility.  The intermediary-driven dynamics arise in equilibrium since
4:100:6603:21:25:64:313:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all aggregate shocks emerge from the real sector.
4:101:6652:25:21:75:547:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The calibrated model matches many features of the data, both in terms of macro-economic
4:102:6739:21:21:64:546:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quantities  and  prices.   It  matches  the  average  credit  spread  and  its  volatility.   Faced  with  a
4:103:6847:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:realistic corporate bond rate, firms choose the observed amount of leverage.  The non-financial
4:104:6942:21:21:64:546:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leverage ratio is 37%, close to the U.S. data. The model delivers a 93% leverage ratio for financial
4:105:7042:21:21:64:546:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms, a key moment not directly targeted by the calibration, which is close to the data.  Debt
4:106:7137:21:21:64:546:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is attractive to banks for four reasons.  First, debt enjoys a tax shield.  Second, the government
4:107:7235:21:21:64:546:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:guarantees the liabilities of the bank.  This guarantee captures not only deposit insurance but
4:108:7330:21:21:64:546:459:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:also broader too-big-to-fail guarantees to banks and the rest of the levered financial system.1
4:109:7425:21:20:64:546:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, banks face equity adjustment costs which increase the cost of equity relative to debt.
4:110:7518:20:21:64:546:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Fourth, banks provide a safe asset to patient households with a strong preference for holding
4:111:7611:21:21:64:546:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such risk-free assets. While the first motive for debt financing also applies to non-financial firms,
4:112:7712:21:21:64:546:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the other three do not.  The large wedge between financial and non-financial sector leverage is a
4:113:7809:21:21:64:546:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:key feature of many developed economies and crucial to understanding systemic risk in society.
4:114:7903:21:21:64:546:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The equilibrium fully takes into account that the cost of bank debt changes endogenously with
4:115:7996:21:25:64:231:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the safety of the financial sector.
4:116:8031:25:21:75:547:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  main  exercise  is  to  study  macro-prudential  policy  in  this  environment.   We  study  in-
4:117:8132:21:21:64:546:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creasing the minimum bank equity capital requirement from its pre-crisis level of 6% of assets.
4:118:8227:21:21:64:546:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Higher capital requirements reduce financial fragility but at the cost of shrinking the economy
4:119:8322:21:21:64:546:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and, in some cases, increasing macroeconomic volatility.  They are successful at reducing finan-
4:120:8418:21:21:64:546:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cial leverage and the bank failure rate.  Banks that hold more equity capital become effectively
4:121:8514:21:21:64:546:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more  risk  averse  and  stay  away  farther  from  their  regulatory  constraint.   They  also  become
4:122:8617:21:21:64:546:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:smaller,  shrinking  both  assets  and  liabilities.   The  charter  value  of  a  bank  shrinks  because
4:123:8722:21:18:64:546:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks with more onerous equity capital requirements have reduced ability to take advantage of
4:124:8815:18:15:78:546:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:1We use the labels intermediaries and banks interchangeably to mean the entire levered financial sector.  That
4:125:8925:15:12:64:546:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sector also includes broker-dealers and insurance companies, which are subject to macro-prudential regulation
4:126:9034:12:12:64:546:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and  enjoy  explicit  or  implicit  government  guarantees  on  their  liabilities.   Appendix  C.7  provides  a  detailed
4:127:9156:12:0:64:224:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:definition of our intermediary sector.

5:129:9216:25:21:75:547:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Corporate debt also becomes safer and loss rates fall.  Firms borrow less and reduce leverage.
5:130:9310:21:21:64:546:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Equilibrium  credit  spreads  are  higher  despite  a  reduction  in  loss  rates.   In  other  words,  the
5:131:9417:21:21:64:546:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price of credit increases strongly with bank capital requirements since intermediaries are forced
5:132:9514:21:21:64:546:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to move away from cheap deposit financing.  Higher credit spreads are consistent with lower
5:133:9605:21:25:64:178:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-financial leverage.
5:134:9628:25:21:75:547:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The reduction in firm and bank bankruptcies is good news for the economy, as it frees up
5:135:9716:21:21:64:546:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources  otherwise  spent  on  deadweight  losses  from  bankruptcy.   However,  firms’  reduced
5:136:9814:21:21:64:546:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ability to borrow from smaller banks reduces investment, the capital stock, and output.  The
5:137:9906:21:25:64:530:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduced size of the economy is the first adverse effect from tighter macro-prudential policy.
5:138:9999:25:21:75:547:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  second  adverse  effect  is  that  macro-economic  volatility  rises,  locally,  with  tighter  bank
5:139:10102:21:21:64:546:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital  constraints.   Two  offsetting  effects  determine  macro  volatility.   First,  a  reduction  in
5:140:10208:21:21:64:546:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial fragility lowers macro-economic volatility.  Second, a reduction in risk sharing increases
5:141:10308:21:20:64:546:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:macro-economic  volatility.   The  latter  effect  dominates  the  former  as  minimum  bank  equity
5:142:10408:20:21:64:546:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases from 6% to 15% of assets, and macro-economic volatility increases.  Increasing bank
5:143:10501:21:21:64:546:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity  capital  further  gradually  lowers  volatility.   Loosening  capital  requirements  from  6%
5:144:10602:21:25:64:406:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:downward also increases volatility as the fragility effect dominates.
5:145:10671:25:21:75:547:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To rank economies that differ in capital requirement, we calculate welfare for the two types of
5:146:10766:21:21:64:546:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households in the model:  patient savers who invest in risk-free assets and impatient borrowers
5:147:10861:21:21:64:546:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who are the equity holders of the non-financial and financial firms.  Tighter capital requirements
5:148:10959:21:21:64:546:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistribute wealth from savers to borrowers.  A smaller banking sector reduces deposits and
5:149:11051:21:21:64:546:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:thereby the wealth of the savers.  Borrower-equity holders receive a larger fraction of aggregate
5:150:11148:21:21:64:546:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income as banks and firms shift their capital structure towards equity.  Thus, perversely, the
5:151:11242:21:21:64:546:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:owners of the banks gain from tighter regulation.  Depending on the aggregation scheme, welfare
5:152:11337:21:21:64:546:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maximizing capital requirements are either slightly higher or slightly lower than the pre-crisis
5:153:11433:21:21:64:546:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:level.  A utilitarian social welfare function generates modest positive aggregate welfare gains
5:154:11528:21:21:64:546:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from  tighter  bank  equity  capital  requirements,  with  gains  reaching  a  maximum  at  a  9%  eq-
5:155:11630:21:21:64:546:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uity capital-asset ratio.  A tax-and-transfer scheme that induces Pareto improvements instead
5:156:11723:21:21:64:546:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggests that slightly looser capital requirements,  at 4%,  would be optimal.  Current capital
5:157:11818:21:21:64:546:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirement levels are straddled by these two numbers.  An alternative counter-cyclical capital
5:158:11913:21:0:64:546:70:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirement policy that tightens capital requirements in good times and relaxes them in times
6:159:12007:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of financial stress allows for a larger financial sector and for improved risk sharing.  Out of the
6:160:12106:21:25:64:387:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policies we evaluate, it admits the largest Pareto improvement.
6:161:12169:25:21:75:547:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  work  is  at  the  intersection  of  macro-economics,  asset  pricing,  corporate  finance,  and
6:162:12270:21:21:64:546:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banking.   We  contribute  to  the  literature  on  the  role  of  credit  constraints  in  models  of  the
6:163:12377:21:21:64:546:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:macro-economy.  Building on early work that emphasized the importance of credit markets in
6:164:12467:21:21:64:546:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amplifying business cycle shocks, notably Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1996) and Kiyotaki
6:165:12561:21:21:64:546:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  Moore  (1997),  a  second  generation  of  models  has  explored  nonlinear  dynamics,  notably
6:166:12661:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) and He and Krishnamurthy (2013).  A first modeling con-
6:167:12749:21:21:64:546:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tribution is to separate out the role of producers and banks, while the prior literature usually
6:168:12845:21:21:64:546:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:combines their roles.  Combining balance sheets implicitly assumes that financial intermediaries
6:169:12941:21:21:64:546:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hold  equity  claims  in  productive  firms,  while  in  reality,  banks  hold  debt-like  claims.   These
6:170:13047:21:21:64:547:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt contracts are subject to default risk of the borrowers.2Intermediaries help to allocate risk
6:171:13144:21:21:64:546:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between borrowers and savers, and their risk-bearing capacity is a key state variable.  The sep-
6:172:13240:21:20:64:546:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aration of producers and intermediaries not only allows us to generate the large wedge between
6:173:13334:20:21:64:546:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial and non-financial leverage, it also activates a second financial accelerator in addition
6:174:13432:21:21:64:546:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the traditional financial accelerator mechanism.  Losses on corporate loans reduce intermedi-
6:175:13528:21:21:64:546:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ary net worth, reduce banks’ ability and willingness to extend loans to producers, which hurts
6:176:13622:21:25:64:287:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investment and output in the real economy.
6:177:13664:25:21:75:547:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The second new model ingredient is to introduce the possibility of default for financial in-
6:178:13756:21:21:64:546:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:termediaries, with the government guaranteeing bank debt for savers (deposit insurance).  As
6:179:13848:21:21:64:546:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2014) make clear, financial in-
6:180:13941:21:21:64:546:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:termediaries frequently become insolvent.  When they do,  their creditors (mostly depositors)
6:181:14034:21:21:64:546:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are typically bailed out by the government.  The combination of limited liability and govern-
6:182:14127:21:21:64:546:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment guarantees affects banks’ risk taking incentives and creates scope for regulation that limits
6:183:14225:21:18:64:547:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank leverage.3We model a Basel-style regulatory capital requirement that limits intermediary
6:184:14318:18:15:78:546:186:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:2It  is  well  understood  that  debt-like  contracts  arise  in  order  to  reduce  the  cost  of  gathering  information
6:185:14440:15:12:64:546:171:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and to mitigate principal-agent problems.  See the costly state verification models in the tradition of Townsend
6:186:14552:12:12:64:546:159:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(1979) and Gale and Hellwig (1985), and the work on the information insensitivity of debt by Dang, Gorton,
6:187:14658:12:12:64:546:147:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and Holmstrom (2015).  Our debt is non-state contingent which confers the advantage that loan defaults induce
6:188:14767:12:12:64:546:135:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:losses for the intermediaries.  Costly state verification models also justify the existence of financial intermediaries
6:189:14886:12:12:64:546:123:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:who avoid the duplication of verification costs, as in Williamson (1987), Krasa and Villamil (1992), Diamond
6:190:14994:12:12:64:546:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(1984).  Recent work by Klimenko,  Pfeil,  Rochet,  and Nicolo (2016),  Rampini and Viswanathan (2017),  and
6:191:15102:12:12:64:546:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Gale and Gottardi (2017) also models intermediaries separately from producers.  The setting is simpler since
6:192:15210:12:8:64:262:87:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:their focus is theoretical; ours is quantitative.
6:193:15259:8:0:78:546:79:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:3See Kareken and Wallace (1978), Van den Heuvel (2008), Farhi and Tirole (2012), or Gomes, Grotteria, and
7:194:15365:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:liabilities to a certain fraction of their assets.  The minimum regulatory capital that banks must
7:195:15463:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hold is the key macro-prudential policy parameter.  Banks optimally trade off the costs and
7:196:15554:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benefits of default for their shareholders.  Our equilibrium features a counter-cyclical fraction
7:197:15651:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of banks defaulting, consistent with the data.  In case of bank default, the government steps
7:198:15744:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in, liquidates the bank’s assets and makes whole their creditors.  By allowing for the possibility
7:199:15842:21:21:64:546:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of bank insolvencies, our model helps explain how a corporate default wave triggers financial
7:200:15935:21:21:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fragility.  Intermediaries perform the traditional role of maturity and risk transformation.  Most
7:201:16033:21:21:64:547:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:models in the intermediary literature feature no default on corporate loans.4Those that do
7:202:16123:21:21:64:546:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:feature default employ short-term debt, abstracting from a key source of risk associated with
7:203:16216:21:21:64:546:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial intermediation.  Long-term debt allows us to realistically model liquidity-based default
7:204:16314:21:25:64:176:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of non-financial firms.
7:205:16337:25:21:75:547:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The third key model element is the inclusion of savers who do not participate in risky asset
7:206:16429:21:21:64:546:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:markets and the endogenous determination of safe asset rates.  The data reveal that a large
7:207:16520:21:20:64:546:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fraction of households indeed do not participate in risky asset markets.  These savers are the
7:208:16614:20:21:64:546:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marginal agents in the market for safe debt.  With risk averse savers and endogenous safe asset
7:209:16709:21:21:64:546:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates, the dynamics of the model change substantially.  In a crisis, intermediaries contract the
7:210:16805:21:21:64:546:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size of their balance sheet, reducing the supply of safe assets.  This is only partially offset by
7:211:16903:21:21:64:546:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an increase in government debt due to counter-cyclical fiscal policy.  To clear the market, the
7:212:16998:21:21:64:546:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium  real  interest  rates  must  fall.   The  low  cost  of  debt  allows  the  intermediaries  to
7:213:17105:21:21:64:546:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recapitalize more quickly,  dampening the effect of the crisis.  More generally,  a key question
7:214:17201:21:21:64:546:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  the  literature  is  how  tighter  bank  capital  regulation  affects  bank  profitability.   To  answer
7:215:17309:21:21:64:546:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this question, one needs to understand how supply and demand in both major markets banks
7:216:17397:21:21:64:546:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:operate in, the loan market and the market for safe debt, respond in general equilibrium.  Our
7:217:17491:21:21:64:546:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model endogenously determines supply, demand, and risk in both markets.  While the safe debt
7:218:17583:21:21:64:546:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issued by banks is guaranteed by the government and therefore risk-free for savers,  it is not
7:219:17677:21:25:64:355:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risk-free to society due to the possibility of bank default.
7:220:17737:25:21:75:547:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our paper belongs to the literature on quantitative models of optimal bank regulation, includ-
7:221:17831:21:12:64:546:141:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Wachter (2018).  Others justify the presence of bank leverage or net worth constraints by the ability of banks
7:222:17941:12:9:64:350:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to divert cash flows, as in Gertler, Kiyotaki, and Queralto (2012).

8:229:18548:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:study a general equilibrium model that features severe financial recessions arising due to the
8:230:18642:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonlinear interaction of financial constraints in the production and intermediation sectors.  This
8:231:18740:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allows us to quantify the benefit of preventing such financial crises using regulation.  A different
8:232:18840:21:21:64:546:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:branch of the normative literature instead studies the interactions between conventional and

8:237:19277:21:21:64:546:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generates the volatility and counter-cyclicality of that spread, consistent with patterns docu-
8:238:19372:21:21:64:546:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mented by Krishnamurthy and Muir (2017).  For the observed amount of credit risk, substantial
8:239:19465:21:21:64:546:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variation in intermediary wealth generates a high enough price of credit risk.  The (shadow)
8:240:19557:21:20:64:546:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stochastic discount factor of the intermediaries, driven by the intermediary net worth dynamics,
8:241:19653:20:25:64:222:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is volatile and counter-cyclical.
8:242:19686:25:21:75:547:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also contribute to the literature on second-moment shocks to firm productivity, since a
8:243:19776:21:21:64:546:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:key shock in our model is an increase in the cross-sectional dispersion of firm-level productivity
8:244:19874:21:21:64:546:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth.7In our setup, these shocks cause costly firm defaults and intermediary losses, which
8:245:19966:21:21:64:546:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in turn lead to lower credit supply and investment.  This is a complementary mechanism to
8:246:20055:21:21:64:546:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the inaction effect of Bloom (2009), where increased uncertainty causes depressed investment
8:247:20147:21:21:64:546:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because of fixed costs.  Alfaro, Bloom, and Lin (2016) study how financial frictions amplify the
8:248:20243:21:25:64:339:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect of uncertainty shocks on investment and hiring.

8:253:20648:9:15:78:546:188:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:6In addition to the work cited above, notable contributions are He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013, 2014),
8:254:20752:15:12:64:546:173:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Gˆarleanu and Pedersen (2011), Adrian and Boyarchenko (2012), Maggiori (2013), and Moreira and Savov (2016).
8:255:20860:12:12:64:546:161:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:On the empirical side, He, Kelly, and Manela (2017) develop a risk factor which captures the systematic risk
8:256:20968:12:12:64:546:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:associated  with  declines  in  intermediary  equity  capital,  and  Adrian,  Etula,  and  Muir  (2014)  document  that
8:257:21087:12:9:64:414:137:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:intermediary leverage performs well in pricing the cross-section of stock returns.
8:258:21169:9:15:78:546:128:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:7The shock is calibrated from firm-level evidence in Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten, and Terry
8:259:21276:15:12:64:546:113:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(2012).  Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014) introduce a similar “risk” shock and argue it is an important
8:260:21385:12:12:64:546:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:driver of business cycle dynamics.  Jermann and Quadrini (2012) study how financial shocks affect balance sheet
8:261:21496:12:12:64:546:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variables.  One interpretation of our uncertainty shocks is as aggregate misallocation shocks, as in Hsieh and
8:262:21606:12:0:64:527:77:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Klenow (2009).  Ai, Li, and Yang (2016) study the role of intermediaries in reducing capital misallocation.

9:264:21812:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between borrower, saver, and intermediation sectors.  The only purpose of heterogeneity within
9:265:21906:21:25:64:513:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the borrower sector and within the intermediary sector is to generate fractional default.
9:266:21995:25:21:75:547:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, our paper contributes in its solution technique.  The model has two exogenous and
9:267:22085:21:21:64:546:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:persistent sources of aggregate risk and five endogenous aggregate state variables, which capture
9:268:22182:21:21:64:546:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the wealth distribution.  It features default and occasionally binding borrowing constraints in
9:269:22277:21:21:64:546:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:both non-financial and financial sectors.  To solve this problem, we provide a nonlinear global
9:270:22372:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:solution  method.   The  algorithm,  detailed  in  computational  appendix  B,  solves  for  a  set  of
9:271:22475:21:25:64:505:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonlinear equations including the Euler, Kuhn-Tucker, and market clearing equations.
9:272:22559:25:21:75:547:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 discusses the model setup.  Section 3
9:273:22654:21:21:64:546:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presents the calibration.  Section 4 contains the main results.  Section 5 uses the model to study
9:274:22752:21:21:64:546:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:various macro-prudential policies.  Section 6 concludes.  All model derivations, some details on
9:275:22848:21:53:64:510:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the calibration, and some additional quantitative results are relegated to the appendix.

10:305:23890:21:38:64:300:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:turns capital and labor into aggregate output:

10:309:24148:21:21:64:546:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consumption goods, firms also have access to a technology that turns consumption into capital
10:310:24241:21:25:64:242:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goods subject to adjustment costs.
10:311:24275:25:20:75:547:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Firms are funded by long-term corporate debt issued by intermediaries, and by equity pro-
10:312:24364:20:21:64:546:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vided by borrower-entrepreneurs.  There are no frictions associated with changing the equity
10:313:24456:21:21:64:546:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital of non-financial firms.  This is equivalent to assuming that borrower-entrepreneurs hold
10:314:24552:21:25:64:226:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the firms’ capital stock directly.
10:315:24586:25:21:75:547:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Financial intermediaries,  or banks for short,  are profit-maximizing firms that extend loans
10:316:24679:21:21:64:546:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to non-financial firms.  They fund these loans through deposits that they issue to savers and
10:317:24772:21:21:64:546:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity capital that they raise from borrower-entrepreneurs.  Banks face equity issuance costs,
10:318:24866:21:25:64:353:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an important financial friction described in detail below.
10:319:24924:25:21:75:547:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We assume that savers only hold risk-free assets to capture the reality of limited participation
10:320:25020:21:21:64:546:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in risky asset markets.  The provision of safe assets to savers is an important function of the
10:321:25115:21:21:64:547:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intermediary sector.  Borrower-entrepreneurs and savers are endowed with ̄LBand ̄LSunits of
10:322:25206:21:25:64:518:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor, respectively.  Both types of households supply their labor endowment inelastically.
10:323:25296:25:21:75:547:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As explained below, both firms and banks face idiosyncratic shocks.  This within-type het-
10:324:25386:21:21:64:546:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:erogeneity  allows  us  to  capture  fractional  default.   Perfect  within-type  risk  sharing  implies
10:325:25490:21:21:64:546:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no further implications from within-type heterogeneity, and allows us to focus on incomplete
10:326:25582:21:25:64:203:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risk-sharing between types.

10:329:25817:21:20:64:546:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variable.  Each agent must forecast how that state variable evolves, including the bankruptcy

15:491:34344:33:21:64:546:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Intermediaries (“banks”) are financial firms that buy long-term risky corporate debt issued by
15:492:34438:21:21:64:546:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:producers (AIt) and use this debt as collateral to issue short-term debt to savers (BIt).  They

15:495:34705:35:21:79:547:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.  Moving equity into or out of banks is costly, i.e.  paying a (positive or negative) dividend

15:498:34961:19:15:74:546:91:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:11The full model in the appendix adds a hard borrowing constraint for firms.  The model is calibrated so that
15:499:35070:15:0:64:503:76:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:this constraint is rarely binding; the constraint plays a minor role for the results.  See Appendix C.3.

16:527:36834:21:21:64:546:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lems.   In  appendix  A.2.1,  we  show  more  formally  that  given  our  assumptions,  the  problem

16:532:37282:18:16:74:546:115:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:12The idiosyncratic shocks to bank profitability capture unmodeled heterogeneity in bank portfolios, such as

22:698:45972:37:21:64:546:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The model is calibrated at annual frequency.  The parameters of the model and their targets
22:699:46063:21:21:64:546:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  summarized  in  Table  1.   Appendix  C.1  conducts  a  parameter  sensitivity  analysis  of  the
22:700:46165:21:21:64:546:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:type suggested by Andrews, Gentzkow, and Shapiro (2017) that helps clarify what moments
22:701:46252:21:42:64:259:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:structurally identify what parameters.
22:702:46290:42:20:64:542:573:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:Aggregate  ProductivityFollowing  the  macro-economics  literature,  the  TFP  processZAt

22:704:46469:21:21:64:546:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:TFP is persistent, it becomes a state variable.  We discretizeZAtinto a 5-state Markov chain
22:705:46561:21:21:64:546:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:using  the  Rouwenhorst  (1995)  method.   The  procedure  chooses  the  productivity  grid  points
22:706:46660:21:21:64:546:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the transition probabilities between them to match the volatility and persistence of HP-
22:707:46752:21:21:64:546:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:detrended GDP. GDP is endogenously determined but heavily influenced by TFP. Consistent
22:708:46839:21:21:64:546:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the model, our measurement of GDP excludes net exports and government investment.
22:709:46925:21:21:64:546:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We define the GDP deflator correspondingly.  Observed real per capita HP-detrended GDP has
22:710:47015:21:21:64:546:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a volatility of 2.53% and its persistence is 0.55.  The model generates a volatility of 2.43% and
22:711:47112:21:42:64:171:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a persistence of 0.55.
22:712:47134:42:21:64:546:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Idiosyncratic  ProductivityWe  calibrate  the  firm-level  productivity  risk  directly  to  the
22:713:47230:21:21:64:547:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:micro  evidence.   We  normalize  the  mean  of  idiosyncratic  productivity  atμω=  1.   We  let

22:719:47822:21:21:64:547:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default  rate.   The  model-implied  average  default  rate  of  2.2%  is  similar  to  the  data.14The
22:720:47925:21:21:64:547:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high value,σH,ω, is chosen to match the time-series standard deviation of the cross-sectional
22:721:48018:21:18:64:546:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interquartile range of firm productivity, which is 4.9% according to Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich,
22:722:48115:18:16:74:546:137:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:14We look at two sources of data:  corporate loans and corporate bonds.  From the Federal Reserve Board
22:723:48218:16:12:64:546:121:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of Governors, we obtain delinquency and charge-off rates on Commercial and Industrial loans and Commercial
22:724:48324:12:12:64:546:109:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Real Estate loans by U.S. Commercial Banks for the period 1991-2015.  The average delinquency rate is 3.1%.
22:725:48431:12:11:64:546:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The second source of data is Standard & Poors’ default rates on publicly-rated corporate bonds for 1981-2014.
22:726:48540:11:12:64:546:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The average default rate is 1.5%; 0.1% on investment-grade bonds and 4.1% on high-yield bonds.  The model is
22:727:48648:12:0:64:188:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in between these two values.
23:728:48678:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Saporta-Eksten, and Terry (2012) (their Table 6).  The transition probabilities from the low to
23:729:48773:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the high uncertainty state of 9% and from the high to the low state of 20% are also taken directly
23:730:48871:21:21:64:547:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from Bloom et al.  (2012).15The model spends 31% of periods in the high uncertainty regime.
23:731:48962:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Like in Bloom et al., our uncertainty process is independent of the first-moment shocks.  About
23:732:49057:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:10% of periods feature both high uncertainty and low TFP realizations.  We will refer to those
23:733:49151:21:21:64:546:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:periods as financial recessions or financial crises, since those periods will feature (endogenous)
23:734:49249:21:21:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial fragility in the equilibrium of the model. Using a long time series for the U.S., Reinhart
23:735:49349:21:41:64:402:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Rogoff (2009) find the same 10% frequency of financial crises.
23:736:49415:41:21:64:547:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:ProductionAdjustment costs are quadratic.  We set the marginal adjustment cost parameter
23:737:49503:21:21:64:547:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:ψ= 2 in order to match the observed volatility of the ratio of investment to GDP,X/Y, of
23:738:49591:21:21:64:546:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.58%.  The model generates a value of 1.56%.  The adjustment costs on average amount to
23:739:49679:21:21:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0.04% of GDP. We set the parameterαin the Cobb-Douglas production function equal to 0.71,
23:740:49768:21:21:64:546:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which  yields  an  overall  labor  income  share  of  65%,  the  standard  value  in  the  business  cycle
23:741:49874:21:21:64:546:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature.  We choose an annual depreciation of capitalδKof 8% to match the investment-to-
23:742:49965:21:41:64:277:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:output ratio of 18% observed in the data.

23:744:50089:21:21:64:546:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ferent types of households we turn to the Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF). We use all survey
23:745:50182:21:21:64:546:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:waves from 1995 until 2013 and average across them.  We compute for each SCF household the
23:746:50272:21:21:64:546:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share of assets (excluding real estate) held in stocks or private business equity, considering both
23:747:50371:21:21:64:546:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:direct and indirect holdings of stock.  Using this definition of the risky share, we then calculate
23:748:50470:21:21:64:546:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the fraction of households whose risky share is less than one percent.  This amounts to 69%
23:749:50561:21:21:64:547:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  SCF  households.   These  are  the  savers  in  our  model  who  hold  only  safe  assets  (`S).   The

23:751:50758:21:21:64:546:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of savers in the SCF is 60%.  The income share of the borrower-entrepreneurs is the remaining
23:752:50851:21:41:64:460:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:40%.  The income shares determine the Cobb-Douglas parametersγBandγS.

25:799:53674:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the debt asF=θ/(1−δ).  We setδ= 0.937 andθ= 0.582 (F= 9.238) to match the observed
25:800:53756:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:duration of corporate bonds.  Appendix C.2 contains the details.  The model’s corporate loans
25:801:53849:21:25:64:268:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have a duration of 6.8 years on average.
25:802:53889:25:21:75:547:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We set the bankruptcy cost parameterζ= 0.6 to match the observed average severity rate
25:803:53975:21:21:64:546:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of 44% on corporate bonds rated by S&P and Moody’s rated during 1985-2004.  The model
25:804:54060:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produces a similar unconditional loss-given-default rate of 43%.  Combined with the average
25:805:54151:21:21:64:546:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default rate,  this LGD number implies a loss rate on corporate loans of 1.0%.  Our baseline
25:806:54243:21:25:64:506:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model generates a modest quantity of corporate default risk, consistent with the data.
25:807:54329:25:21:75:547:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A fractionηof the cost of distress to intermediaries is a deadweight loss to the economy.  The

25:809:54514:21:21:64:546:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:η= 0.2 based on evidence in Bris, Welch, and Zhu (2006) showing that firms loose on average
25:810:54605:21:24:64:432:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:20% of assets between the beginning and end of a Chapter 7 procedure.
25:811:54674:24:21:75:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We set the profit default threshold toπ= 0.04 to target average non-financial leverage.  The

25:813:54875:21:21:64:547:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since  defaults  are  costly  to  the  borrower  family,  borrower  leverage  is  decreasing  inπ.   The
25:814:54979:21:21:64:546:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model generates a ratio of borrower book debt-to-assets of 36%.  In the Flow of Funds data,

25:820:55499:21:21:64:546:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0.54%, which is exactly the asset-weighted failure rate of depository institutions in the FDIC

25:822:55598:25:38:75:518:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We adopt the following functional form for the dividend payout cost of intermediaries:

25:827:55706:38:0:64:546:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The marginal dividend payout cost for intermediaries is set toσI=  5 to match the average
26:828:55797:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit spread.  The higherσI,  the more costly it becomes for intermediaries to deviate from
26:829:55889:21:21:64:547:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their  dividend  target ̄d.   We  set  the  target  to  the  dividend  level  in  the  deterministic  steady
26:830:55997:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state of the model.  A higher adjustment cost causes a higher risk premium in the corporate
26:831:56088:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loan  market  and  thus  increases  the  credit  spread.   We  define  the  credit  spread  in  the  data
26:832:56193:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as a weighted average of the Moody’s Aaa and Baa yields and subtract the one-year constant
26:833:56283:21:21:64:546:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maturity Treasury rate.  To determine the portfolio weights on the Aaa versus Baa grade bonds,
26:834:56377:21:21:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we use market values of the amounts outstanding from Barclays.  The weights are 80% and 20%,
26:835:56469:21:21:64:546:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:respectively.  The mean spread over the 1953-2015 period is 2.08%, while the model generates
26:836:56561:21:25:64:189:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a mean spread of 2.05%.
26:837:56584:25:21:75:547:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The intermediary borrowing constraint parameterξcan be interpreted as a minimum reg-

26:859:58472:8:16:74:546:94:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:18We  have  solved  the  model  for  Epstein-Zin  preferences  with  a  range  of  risk  aversion  and  EIS  parameter

27:875:59772:25:21:75:547:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Similarly, we model the labor income tax rate asτt=τexp{bτ(gt− ̄g)}.  We set the tax rate
27:876:59861:21:21:64:546:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:τ= 29.5% in order to match observed average income tax revenue to GDP of 17.3%.  Appendix

27:882:60387:25:21:75:547:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Fourth, we set the corporate tax rate that both financial and non-financial corporations pay

28:903:62003:25:21:75:547:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 2 reports the standard deviation of aggregate quantities, their correlation with GDP,
28:904:62094:21:21:64:546:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and their autocorrelation.  Moments in the data are computed from HP-detrended log series.
28:905:62184:21:21:64:546:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moments in the model are by assumption stationary, and are also computed from log series.
28:906:62273:21:21:64:546:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The model matches the volatility of GDP and it autocorrelation.  TFP shocks with 2% volatility
28:907:62367:21:20:64:546:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are amplified and lead to 2.43% GDP volatility.  The model further matches the volatility of
28:908:62459:20:21:64:546:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the investment to GDP ratio and the investment rate.  The latter series display modest pro-
28:909:62550:21:21:64:546:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cyclicality in both data and model.  Investment rates are insufficiently persistent in the model.
28:910:62647:21:21:64:546:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The model somewhat overstates consumption volatility.  Consumption in the model exhibits
28:911:62735:21:21:64:546:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the right cyclicality, but is slightly too persistent relative to the data.  We return to the source
28:912:62835:21:25:64:317:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the consumption volatility in the model below.

29:926:63747:21:21:64:546:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:second case, the economy remains in the low uncertainty state; a non-financial recession (blue
29:927:63841:21:21:64:546:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:line).  From period 2 onwards, the two exogenous state variables follow their stochastic laws of
29:928:63937:21:21:64:546:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:motion.  For comparison, we also show a series that does not undergo any shock in period 1 but
29:929:64031:21:21:64:546:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where the exogenous states stochastically mean revert from the low-uncertainty state in period
29:930:64125:21:21:64:546:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0 (black line).  For each of the three scenarios,  we simulate 10,000 sample paths of 25 years
29:931:64219:21:21:64:546:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and average across them.  Figure 2 plots the macro-economic quantities.  The top left panel is
29:932:64313:21:21:64:547:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the productivity levelZA.  By construction,  it falls by the same amount in financial and
29:933:64406:21:21:64:546:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-financial recessions;  a 2% drop.  Productivity then gradually mean reverts over the next
29:934:64499:21:25:64:546:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decade.  The black line shows how productivity would have evolved absent a shock in period 1.
29:935:64592:25:21:75:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The other three panels show impulse-responses for output, consumption, and investment.  In
29:936:64682:21:21:64:546:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the initial period of the shock, the drop in output is the same when the economy is additionally
29:937:64778:21:21:64:546:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hit by an uncertainty shock (red line) and when it is not (blue line).  This has to be the case
29:938:64873:21:21:64:546:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because capital is a state variable, labor is supplied inelastically, and productivity is identical.
29:939:64973:21:21:64:546:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  financial  recessions,  the  economy  suffers  from  a  second  period  of  decline  in  consumption,
29:940:65078:21:21:64:546:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:despite the rebound in productivity.  Output remains lower for longer in a financial recession.
29:941:65173:21:21:64:546:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The added persistence resembles the slow recovery that typically follows a financial crisis.  The
29:942:65270:21:20:64:546:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bottom  right  panel  shows  a  28%  drop  in  investment  in  financial  recessions  but  only  a  mod-
29:943:65374:20:21:64:546:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:est drop in non-financial recessions.  Despite the bounce back in period 2, investment remains
29:944:65468:21:21:64:546:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:depressed for a prolonged period of time.  Aggregate consumption partially offsets the initial
29:945:65562:21:21:64:546:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decline in investment in a financial recession:  the initial drop in consumption is smaller than in
29:946:65661:21:21:64:546:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a non-financial recession.  The low rate of return on savings induces the saver to consume more
29:947:65756:21:18:64:547:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in a financial crisis.20Consumption drops subsequently and remains below the non-financial
29:948:65846:18:16:74:546:105:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:20Since output in the first period is by construction identical for both types of recessions, the approximately
29:949:65957:16:12:64:546:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:2.5% of output that are not reflected in consumption and investment in a financial recession are accounted for
29:950:66067:12:0:64:338:77:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by deadweight losses from firm and intermediary bankruptcies.

30:979:66474:12:12:64:546:386:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:0,  the economy is in the average TFP state.  The recession is either accompanied by high uncertainty (high

30:981:66694:12:12:64:546:362:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:From period 2 onwards, the economy evolves according to its regular probability laws.  The black line plots the

30:987:67254:21:21:64:546:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policy aims to remedy.  In appendix D.1, we include IRF graphs that compare a financial reces-
30:988:67348:21:21:64:547:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sion to a pure uncertainty shock, which is a switch toσω,Hwith TFP remaining constant.  This
30:989:67440:21:21:64:546:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:comparison demonstrates that the combination of both shocks leads to significant amplification,
30:990:67535:21:21:64:546:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:i.e.,  the financial recession triggered by the combination is much larger than the sum of the

30:992:67664:15:16:74:546:150:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:21This feature of  our model is consistent  with the empirical finding that  uncertainty shocks  alone  have at

31:1001:68377:21:21:64:546:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:GDP.  Their  difference  is  the  market  value  of  firm  equity  scaled  by  GDP.  Their  ratio  is  the
31:1002:68483:21:21:64:546:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market leverage ratio (row 4).  Book leverage, defined as the book value of debt to the book
31:1003:68575:21:21:64:546:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value of assets in row 5,  is 35.2%,  and matches the low observed corporate leverage ratio in

31:1009:69110:21:21:64:546:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0.96% points (row 8), respectively, implying an average loss-given-default rate of 43.1% (row
31:1010:69203:21:21:64:546:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:7).  Default and loss rates are 6-7 times higher in financial recessions (5.50% and 2.31%) than in

31:1017:69862:20:21:64:546:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below.  Hence, financial sector fragility feeds back on the real economy and amplifies the initial
31:1018:69960:21:21:64:546:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shock emanating from the real sector, a second financial accelerator.  Firms do not pursue the
31:1019:70054:21:21:64:546:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investment projects they would otherwise undertake.  Relative to expansions, output falls by
31:1020:70146:21:19:64:371:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.5% and investment by 20% in financial recessions (row 9).
31:1021:70205:19:15:74:546:132:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:22In the 1991 recession, the delinquency rate spiked at 8.2% and the charge-off rate at 2.2%.  For the 2007-09
31:1022:70315:15:12:64:546:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:crisis, the respective numbers are 6.8% and 2.7%.  These are far above the unconditional averages of 3.1% and

31:1024:70536:12:0:64:242:93:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:far above the 1981-2014 average of 4.1%.

32:1054:71817:21:21:64:546:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leverage  is  93.3%  on  average  in  market  values  (row  10)  and  93.3%  in  market  values.   The
32:1055:71919:21:21:64:546:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average ratio of total intermediary book debt-to-assets in the 1953-2014 data is 91.5%, close to
32:1056:72015:21:21:64:546:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the intermediaries in our model; see Appendix C.7 for the data calculations.  Financial leverage
32:1057:72111:21:21:64:546:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was not directly targeted in the calibration, yet is close to the data.  Several model ingredients
32:1058:72209:21:20:64:546:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contribute  to  the  high  financial  leverage.   Like  the  non-financial  firms,  they  are  owned  by
32:1059:72313:20:21:64:546:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:impatient  shareholders.   They  enjoy  a  tax  shield.   Unlike  firms,  they  benefit  from  deposit
32:1060:72415:21:21:64:546:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:insurance and they produce safe assets for patient savers, both of which keep down their cost
32:1061:72508:21:21:64:546:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of funding (2.19%,  row 18).  Finally,  they face dividend adjustment costs,  which makes debt
32:1062:72602:21:21:64:546:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issuance relatively attractive.  We explore the various drivers of leverage in Appendix D.2 and
32:1063:72697:21:21:64:546:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find that the dominant force is the wedge between the time discount factor of borrowers and
32:1064:72788:21:0:64:98:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:savers.
33:1065:72797:0:21:75:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Banks suffer losses on their credit portfolio in financial recessions (row 21),  reducing their
33:1066:72892:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:book value of assets.  At the same time risk is high.  Low prices (high yields, row 19) of corporate
33:1067:72992:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loans reflect the higher default risk (row 9) and the higher credit risk premium (row 20).  This
33:1068:73088:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduces the market value of intermediary assets,  amplifying the decline in the book value of
33:1069:73181:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assets.  A lower value of bank assets in turn tightens the regulatory bank capital constraint.
33:1070:73275:21:21:64:546:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The constraint binds in 91.1% of the financial crises compared to 61.3% unconditionally and
33:1071:73366:21:21:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:31.5% in expansions (row 12).  When binding,  intermediaries must reduce liabilities to meet
33:1072:73458:21:21:64:546:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital requirements, as measured by deposits to GDP in row 15, which explains the drop in
33:1073:73548:21:21:64:546:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks’ debt.  The decline in debt exceeds the decline in book assets, so that bank book leverage
33:1074:73644:21:21:64:546:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is pro-cyclical.  Book leverage falls from 98.4% in expansions to 92.2% in financial recessions.
33:1075:73740:21:21:64:546:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The decline in the price of loans, i.e., the larger fall in the market value of bank assets, results
33:1076:73840:21:21:64:546:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in a-cyclical market leverage.  This pattern is directionally consistent with the data.  Adrian,
33:1077:73936:21:21:64:546:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Boyarchenko,  and  Shin  (2015)  show  that  book  leverage  is  pro-cyclical  for  commercial  banks
33:1078:74037:21:24:64:375:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and broker-dealers, while market leverage is counter-cyclical.
33:1079:74099:24:21:75:547:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While banks are roughly equally likely to be constrained in financial and non-financial reces-
33:1080:74193:21:21:64:546:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sions, the reasons for the tightness of the bank capital constraint are fundamentally different.
33:1081:74289:21:21:64:546:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In financial recessions,  banks suffer large credit losses and are forced to shrink,  delever,  and
33:1082:74388:21:21:64:546:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issue equity.  Going forward, banks earn high risk yields on corporate debt (4.55%) and face low
33:1083:74484:21:21:64:546:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowing costs (0.26%), making lending very profitable.  They would like to expand lending,
33:1084:74576:21:21:64:546:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but are up against their borrowing constraint which prevents raising new debt.  They can and
33:1085:74668:21:21:64:546:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do raise outside equity (negative dividends of 1.26% of GDP, line 14), but are held back by the
33:1086:74763:21:25:64:173:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cost of raising equity.
33:1087:74786:25:21:75:547:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  contrast,  in  non-financial  recessions,  banking  becomes  much  less  profitable  due  to  the
33:1088:74887:21:21:64:546:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shrinking net interest margin (0.3%).  These recessions resemble standard TFP-induced reces-
33:1089:74979:21:21:64:546:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sions in real business cycle models: as productivity and labor income are temporarily low, savers
33:1090:75076:21:21:64:546:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduce their demand for safe assets in order to smooth consumption.  In addition, the supply
33:1091:75168:21:21:64:546:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of government debt goes up due to increased government spending and lower tax revenue (row
33:1092:75258:21:21:64:546:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:16).   The  risk  free  rate  has  to  rise  to  4.1%  to  clear  the  market  for  short-term  debt.   At  the
33:1093:75369:21:21:64:546:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:same time, low productivity reduces corporate loan demand.  In response to the drop in profits
33:1094:75463:21:21:64:546:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which depletes equity, banks lower dividend payments to 0.06% of GDP. To avoid raising costly
33:1095:75556:21:0:64:316:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity, banks exhaust their borrowing constraint.
34:1096:75607:0:21:75:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The size of the intermediary sector,  relative to GDP, shrinks in financial recessions.  Bank
34:1097:75700:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assets shrink about 3-5% relative to their levels in expansions (rows 2 and 3).  At the same time,
34:1098:75798:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their liabilities shrink from 78% of GDP in expansions to 72% of GDP in financial recessions
34:1099:75890:21:25:64:367:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(row 15).  Since GDP itself falls, bank deposits fall by 11%.
34:1100:75951:25:21:75:547:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  the  equilibrium  of  our  model,  0.54%  of  banks  are  insolvent  in  a  typical  year  (row  13).
34:1101:76056:21:21:64:546:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Intermediary  failures  are  concentrated  in  financial  recessions  (hence  the  name),  when  2.23%
34:1102:76158:21:21:64:546:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of banks are insolvent, 22 times as many as in expansions and 2.8 times as many as in non-
34:1103:76248:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial recessions.  The model generates rare financial disasters when a non-trivial fraction of
34:1104:76346:21:21:64:546:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the banking system is insolvent and needs to be bailed out.  These banking crises result from
34:1105:76439:21:21:64:546:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the balance of two forces.  Bank equity owners try to avoid low intermediary net worth states
34:1106:76532:21:21:64:546:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because they are risk averse and because of the cost of equity issuance.  But when net worth is
34:1107:76627:21:25:64:444:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sufficiently low they have an incentive to shift the risk onto the tax payer.
34:1108:76704:25:21:75:547:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An important quantitative success of the model is that it can generate the large observed
34:1109:76793:21:20:64:546:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit  spread  for  the  small  observed  amount  of  credit  risk,  a  challenge  in  standard  macro-
34:1110:76897:20:21:64:546:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:finance models; see Chen (2010).  The model generates not only the average spread, but also
34:1111:76988:21:21:64:546:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high  volatility  and  counter-cyclicality.   As  Appendix  D.3  explains  in  more  detail,  the  credit
34:1112:77093:21:21:64:546:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spread is high when intermediary net worth is low.  Intermediaries’ marginal value of equity
34:1113:77185:21:21:64:546:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital (shadow SDF) is high in those states of the world.  Like in Santos and Veronesi (2017),
34:1114:77280:21:21:64:546:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our model generates a large credit spread in a model where all aggregate shocks emanate form

34:1118:77576:21:21:64:546:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return to normal.  The high loan losses cause a spike in intermediary failures.  Both the asset
34:1119:77671:21:21:64:546:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and liability side of corporate and intermediary balance sheet shrinks.  The credit spread also
34:1120:77766:21:21:64:546:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spikes in the first period of a financial crisis.  The increased cost of credit is consistent with a
34:1121:77866:21:21:64:546:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduced loan demand from firms.  Credit declines persistently.  In contrast, asset prices recover
34:1122:77963:21:21:64:546:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quickly.   This  pattern  is  consistent  with  the  data,  where  the  credit  spread  normalizes  fairly
34:1123:78069:21:21:64:546:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quickly  after  the  initial  spike,  but  the  quantity  of  credit  takes  a  long  time  to  recover.   The
34:1124:78179:21:21:64:546:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:behavior  of  quantities  and  prices  in  financial  crises  is  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  much  milder
34:1125:78287:21:0:64:305:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes in non-financial recessions (blue lines).

35:1171:78839:36:20:64:546:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:SaversRisk averse savers only hold safe debt, provided both by the intermediaries and the
35:1172:78928:20:21:64:546:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government.  On average, these two sources of safe assets account for 77% (row 15) and 60%
35:1173:79018:21:21:64:546:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  GDP  (row  16).   In  financial  recessions,  intermediaries  have  to  delever  due  to  their  equity
35:1174:79125:21:21:64:546:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:losses.   An  increase  in  government  debt  due  to  counter-cyclical  fiscal  policy  partially  offsets
35:1175:79232:21:21:64:546:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the reduction in the supply of safe assets from bank deleveraging.  A drop in the interest rate
35:1176:79327:21:21:64:546:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is required to induce the savers to reduce their demand for safe assets and consume instead.
35:1177:79419:21:21:64:546:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On average the real interest rate is close to 2 percentage points lower in a financial recession
35:1178:79515:21:21:64:547:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compared to the unconditional average (row 18).23A substantial reduction in the real interest
35:1179:79608:21:21:64:546:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate is consistent with the experience in the Great Recession.  This reduction in interest rates
35:1180:79704:21:21:64:546:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benefits banks and helps them to rebuild their net worth.  This in turn restores their ability to
35:1181:79801:21:15:64:132:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lend to firms.
35:1182:79815:15:16:74:547:138:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:23The magnitude of the drop in real rates depends on the EIS of the saver.  For example, whenνS= 50>>1,
35:1183:79918:16:12:64:546:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the risk-free interest rate volatility approaches zero.  Intermediaries no longer benefit from low, even negative
35:1184:80031:12:12:64:546:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:interest rates in crises.  The absence of cheap funding in crises makes them more reluctant to take on leverage
35:1185:80142:12:0:64:98:98:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ex-ante.
36:1186:80152:0:33:64:364:715:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4.3    Importance of Intermediary Frictions
36:1187:80195:33:21:64:546:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Intermediary  frictions  are  essential  to  generate  financial  crises.   To  see  this,  we  successively
36:1188:80303:21:21:64:546:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relax two key intermediary frictions.  First, we turn off the equity adjustment cost by setting
36:1189:80398:21:21:64:547:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:σI= 0.  Then we turn off limited liability (deposit insurance) for intermediaries, so that they
36:1190:80493:21:21:64:546:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cannot go bankrupt.  Figure 4 compares financial recessions in these economies to those in the
36:1191:80587:21:21:64:546:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benchmark (black line).  The underlying shocks in all three economies are the same.  Clearly,
36:1192:80680:21:21:64:546:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the disruption in credit is not nearly as severe, and the credit spread does not increase nearly
36:1193:80776:21:21:64:546:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as much.  Macro-economic quantities are not nearly as adversely affected as in the benchmark
36:1194:80868:21:24:64:110:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economy.
36:1195:80876:24:21:75:547:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Eliminating  the  equity  adjustment  cost  (σI=  0,  blue  line)  means  that  shareholders  can
36:1196:80973:21:21:64:546:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quickly  recapitalize  intermediaries  in  crises,  which  results  in  less  shrinkage  of  the  financial
36:1197:81080:21:21:64:546:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sector.  However, limited liability still causes a suboptimally slow recapitalization when inter-
36:1198:81177:21:21:64:546:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mediaries are closer to default, as they have incentives to take on debt and shift the risk onto
36:1199:81273:21:21:64:546:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  taxpayer.   Turning  off  limited  liability  in  addition  (red  line)  eliminates  the  option  value
36:1200:81381:21:21:64:546:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of bankruptcy and banks recapitalize more quickly.  The end result is an economy that allows
36:1201:81473:21:21:64:546:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for more corporate debt and intermediary leverage, and suffers fewer DWL from bankruptcies.
36:1202:81564:21:21:64:546:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Consumption dynamics during financial recessions in this counterfactual economy look similar
36:1203:81656:21:25:64:201:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to non-financial recessions.
36:1204:81684:25:21:75:547:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This  special  case  without  equity  issuance  frictions  and  deposit  insurance  approaches  the
36:1205:81783:21:21:64:546:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model of Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) where the balance sheets of firms and banks are
36:1206:81872:21:54:64:546:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:merged.  The results show substantial amplification from the decoupling of the balance sheets.

36:1208:81994:36:21:64:546:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We use our calibrated model to investigate the effects of macro-prudential policy choices.  Our
36:1209:82089:21:21:64:546:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:main experiment is a variation in the intermediaries’ leverage constraint.  In the benchmark
36:1210:82181:21:21:64:546:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model, intermediaries can borrow 94 cents against every dollar in assets;  they must hold 6%
36:1211:82273:21:21:64:547:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity capital.  We explore tighter constraints (ξ < .94), as well as looser constraints (ξ > .94).
36:1212:82372:21:21:64:546:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also study a time-varying capital requirement conditional on the uncertainty state.  Our

38:1274:84377:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital requirements.  Interestingly, with tighter regulation, intermediaries’ leverage constraints

38:1276:84572:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capitalized, since equity capital adjustments become effectively more costly (as explained below)
38:1277:84669:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the option to default (limited liability) is farther out-of-the-money.  Tighter regulation leads
38:1278:84769:21:25:64:352:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to a safer intermediary sector, but also to a smaller one.
38:1279:84827:25:21:75:547:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  increased  safety  of  the  financial  sector  asξfalls  is  also  reflected  in  lower  corporate

38:1281:85036:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choose to reduce leverage (rows 4-5).  Firms’ reluctance to undertake more leverage despite the
38:1282:85131:21:21:64:546:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:safer environment may be understood from the higher interest rate they face on debt (row 19).
38:1283:85224:21:21:64:547:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When intermediary capacity shrinks (with lowerξ),  the reward for providing intermediation
38:1284:85314:21:21:64:547:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:services increases.  The  modest 25bps increase in the credit spread atξ=  0.75 is the result
38:1285:85407:21:21:64:546:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of large offsetting movements in the expected loss rate, which halves, and in the excess return

38:1287:85570:25:20:75:547:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To understand the effect of tighter regulation on intermediary profitability, we compute the
38:1288:85662:20:21:64:546:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:franchise value of intermediation, defined as the market value of banks to shareholders per dollar
38:1289:85760:21:21:64:547:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of equity capitalVI/WI−1 (row 15).  If the value of banks were simply equal to the difference
38:1290:85853:21:21:64:547:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between the market value of assets and liabilities, franchise value would be zero (VI=WI).
38:1291:85943:21:21:64:547:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The franchise value declines from 34% in the benchmark to 4% atξ=.75.  The drop can be
38:1292:86029:21:21:64:546:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:understood from the additional measures of bank profitability reported in rows 15a-c.  First,
38:1293:86122:21:21:64:546:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks become less profitable for shareholders as measured by the return on bank equity (in an
38:1294:86215:21:38:64:436:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accounting sense), reported in row 15a.  We compute accounting ROE as
38:1295:86284:38:39:89:521:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:AROE = Excess ret.  on loans (row 21)×book value of loans (row 3)/WI(row 14).
38:1296:86361:39:21:64:546:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Tighter regulation requires more bank equity (row 14) to operate a smaller banking sector (rows
38:1297:86456:21:21:64:546:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3).  This shrinkage effect dominates the rise in profitability per dollar of loans issued reflected
38:1298:86555:21:25:64:547:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the greater excess return (row 21), causing a decline in accounting ROE by 55% atξ= 75%.
38:1299:86646:25:20:75:547:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As Admati, DeMarzo, Hellwig, and Pfleiderer (2013) point out, this calculation may not tell
38:1300:86737:20:21:64:546:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the whole story.  The required return on equity will decline as banks are forced to hold more
38:1301:86830:21:21:64:546:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital and shareholders are exposed to less risk.  This force is also present in our model, and
38:1302:86926:21:0:64:546:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we can compute the equilibrium market return on equity for bank shareholders to measure its
39:1303:87019:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:magnitude.  The cum-dividend market value of intermediary equity to borrower-entrepreneurs

39:1315:87271:38:21:64:546:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Indeed we find that the market return on equity declines as we tighten regulation and banks
39:1316:87362:21:21:64:546:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:become less risky (row 15b).  However, we also compute the weighted average cost of capital
39:1317:87453:21:21:64:546:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(WACC) for banks in row 15c, using the market ROE from row 15b as cost of equity. To compute
39:1318:87545:21:21:64:547:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:WACC, first calculate the effective cost of debt finance to banks asrdebtt= (qt+τΠrft−κ)−1−1.
39:1319:87638:21:38:64:427:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The total firm value of the bank isVbankt=VIt+qt×Depositst.  Hence

39:1328:87852:21:21:64:547:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of funding, which shifts from deposits towards equity with lowerξ.  As a result, WACC rises
39:1329:87943:21:21:64:547:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by almost 50% relative to the benchmark atξ= 75%.  The reduced franchise value is a direct
39:1330:88033:21:21:64:546:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result of this sharp rise in WACC and consistent with bankers’ argument that tighter regulation
39:1331:88128:21:21:64:546:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:destroys shareholder value.  The main driver of this value in the benchmark economy is access
39:1332:88221:21:21:64:546:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to cheap deposit funding from savers.  As intermediaries are forced to fund each dollar of loans
39:1333:88317:21:21:64:546:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a greater proportion of equity, the value created for bank shareholders per dollar of capital
39:1334:88415:21:21:64:546:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:invested declines.  Banks charge higher spreads in the loan market, but can only partially pass
39:1335:88510:21:42:64:414:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through the higher funding cost to borrowers in general equilibrium.

39:1338:88770:21:21:64:546:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The capital stock shrinks sizeably (row 28).  The reduction in output arises because firms are
39:1339:88864:21:20:64:546:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:smaller and borrow less from a smaller intermediary sector,  since debt finance became more
39:1340:88955:20:21:64:546:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costly.  Even though GDP shrinks, aggregate consumption increases slightly (row 29) thanks to
39:1341:89048:21:25:64:379:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower deadweight losses from firm and bank failures (row 26).
39:1342:89109:25:21:75:547:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second adverse effect of tighter capital regulation is that it reduces the risk absorption ca-
39:1343:89205:21:0:64:546:75:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pacity of the intermediary sector.  Maintaining a larger equity buffer means that intermediaries
41:1344:90884:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:need to incur larger deviations from the dividend target (in absolute value).  At lowerξ, the

41:1346:91067:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expensive, relative to the benchmark.  Intermediaries adjust assets and debt instead of equity
41:1347:91161:21:21:64:547:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(rows 32-34): lowerξincreases the volatility of asset and debt growth, but reduces the volatility
41:1348:91258:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of dividend growth.  When going from the benchmark to modestly tighter regulation, the re-
41:1349:91348:21:21:64:546:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:duced ability of intermediaries to absorb aggregate risk spills over to higher investment growth

41:1355:91888:21:21:64:547:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aggregate risk.  Volatility of investment and consumption growth peak atξ=.85.  For capital

41:1358:92172:20:21:64:546:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:volatilities are lower than in the benchmark.  Interestingly, looser regulation than benchmark
41:1359:92266:21:21:64:547:397:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f3:alsoraises  macroeconomic  volatility.   The  economy  withξ=.97  experiences  more  severe

41:1365:92834:21:21:64:546:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:related losses; and (2), it effectively makes banks more risk averse, reducing their willingness to
41:1366:92933:21:21:64:546:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:absorb aggregate risk and causing higher macroeconomic volatility.  Figure 5 summarizes the

41:1371:93310:20:21:64:546:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leads to a modest aggregate welfare gain of 32 bps.  Higher equity requirements than 10% reduce
41:1372:93405:21:21:64:546:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the gains.  Locally, they increase volatility and reduce risk sharing without additional benefits
41:1373:93502:21:0:64:546:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from fewer defaults.  At a 25% capital requirement, ex-post welfare is back to the benchmark

43:1414:95868:21:25:64:156:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of tighter policies.

43:1416:95986:21:21:64:546:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:savers.  Tighter regulation redistributes wealth from savers to borrowers.  It both reduces the
43:1417:96081:21:21:64:546:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supply  of  safe  assets  and  makes  it  less  reliable.   As  debt  finance  becomes  more  expensive,
43:1418:96185:21:21:64:546:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers rely more on equity finance and a larger share of firm earnings accrues to them.  At
43:1419:96279:21:21:64:546:302:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:ξ=.90, borrower consumption is 3.4% higher than in the benchmark and saver consumption
43:1420:96365:21:21:64:546:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  2.7%  lower  (row  30  and  31),  leading  to  welfare  gains  and  losses  of  similar  size  (row  24
43:1421:96472:21:21:64:546:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 25);  see also the right panel of Figure 6.  Looser capital requirements have the opposite
43:1422:96566:21:21:64:546:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distributional  effect  and  increase  saver  wealth  at  the  expense  of  borrowers.   However,  DWL
43:1423:96668:21:21:64:546:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from firm and bank failures are so large atξ=.97 that consumption of both agents is lower
43:1424:96757:21:20:64:546:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than in the benchmark.  The increased financial fragility makes both agents worse off.  Maybe
43:1425:96850:20:21:64:546:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:surprisingly at first, forcing banks to hold more equity ends up benefiting their shareholders.  In
43:1426:96949:21:21:64:546:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sum, tighter capital requirements lead to small (population-weighted) aggregate welfare gains,
43:1427:97043:21:21:64:546:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they increase consumption and wealth inequality.  Policy makers have signaled concern about
43:1428:97134:21:21:64:546:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistributive implications of monetary policies adopted after the Great Financial Crisis.  We
43:1429:97228:21:25:64:369:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:show that macro-prudential policy has similar implications.
43:1430:97287:25:0:75:547:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While none of the variations ofξconsidered in Table 5 allow for a Pareto improving transfer
44:1431:97380:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:scheme (row 23), the red line in the left panel of Figure 6 makes clear that there is a Pareto
44:1432:97474:21:21:64:547:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:improvement possible atξ=.95 andξ=.96.  In those cases, the welfare gains to savers are
44:1433:97561:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sufficient to compensate borrowers for their losses and still have about 12% of GDP left over.
44:1434:97655:21:21:64:546:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Intuitively, borrowers are less patient than savers and require lower compensation for the same
44:1435:97750:21:21:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:permanent reduction in consumption.  In theξ=.96 economy, the policy maker could levy a tax
44:1436:97841:21:21:64:547:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on savers that reduces their utility to the level of the benchmark.  Thepresent valueof the tax
44:1437:97936:21:21:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenue stream would be 23% of benchmark GDP. The revenue could be used to pay a subsidy
44:1438:98024:21:21:64:546:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to borrowers that makes them exactly as well of as in the benchmark; the present value of this
44:1439:98118:21:21:64:546:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsidy stream would be 11.2% of GDP. The remaining revenue has a present value of 11.8%
44:1440:98206:21:21:64:546:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of GDP and measures the Pareto improvement.  By the same logic, a 25% capital requirement
44:1441:98295:21:21:64:546:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would require a massive transfer to the savers, much more than the impatient borrowers are
44:1442:98385:21:25:64:156:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:willing to give up.
44:1443:98404:25:21:75:547:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The two different ways of aggregating welfare lead to optimal capital requirements of 10%
44:1444:98493:21:20:64:546:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 4%, straddling the 6% in the benchmark.  The results suggest that the status quo capital
44:1445:98585:20:27:64:238:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirements are close to optimal.

45:1454:99321:21:21:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a capital requirement that varies conditional on the uncertainty stateσω,t.  When uncer-
45:1455:99414:21:21:64:546:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tainty is low, banks’ constraint is tightened (ξ=.93) compared to the benchmark, whereas it is
45:1456:99508:21:21:64:546:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loosened (ξ=.95) when uncertainty is high.  This counter-cyclical capital requirement causes
45:1457:99600:21:21:64:546:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a moderate expansion in corporate and financial leverage, leading to slightly higher loan losses

45:1459:99790:21:21:64:546:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher DWL are offset by a greater capital stock (+1.1%) and higher GDP (+.3%), such that
45:1460:99879:21:20:64:546:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aggregate consumption remains unchanged.  Even though credit risk increases, the credit spread
45:1461:99973:20:21:64:546:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shrinks due to a smaller credit risk premium (+.89% vs.  1.09%).  Since intermediaries are less
45:1462:100068:21:21:64:546:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constrained in financial crises now, they require less compensation for carrying aggregate risk
45:1463:100163:21:21:64:546:473:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and macroeconomic volatility decreases.  Risk sharing among borrowers and savers improves, as
45:1464:100256:21:21:64:546:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicated by the lower volatility of the MU ratio (row 41, -34.2%).  The larger financial sector
45:1465:100352:21:21:64:546:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distributes wealth from borrowers to savers:  saver consumption increases by 2.2% and welfare

45:1467:100538:21:21:64:546:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bps.  However, since the experiment makes the more patient savers significantly better off, it
45:1468:100632:21:21:64:546:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allows for Pareto improving wealth transfers.  The compensating variation wealth residual (row

45:1476:101296:21:21:64:546:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deposit.  While this is a direct tax on bank leverage, its incidence falls on non-financial firms
45:1477:101393:21:21:64:546:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and savers in equilibrium.  Firms bear most of the cost through a significantly higher credit risk
45:1478:101491:21:21:64:546:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:premium, paying a 2.39% credit spread (vs.  2.05%), despite a reduction in the loan loss rate
45:1479:101584:21:21:64:546:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from 0.96% to 0.50%.  As a result of the higher cost of debt, equilibrium firm leverage is much
45:1480:101679:21:21:64:546:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower.  Contrary to the presumed intention of the policy, banks lever up due to the high credit
45:1481:101774:21:0:64:546:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spread they earn and become more fragile (1.13% bank failures,  twice the benchmark level).
46:1482:101867:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The capital stock shrinks by 4.2% and GDP by 1.2%.  Since DWL from corporate defaults fall,
46:1483:101958:21:21:64:546:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aggregate consumption is unaffected.  Overall,  the policy redistributes wealth from savers to
46:1484:102052:21:21:64:546:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers, as the overall supply of risk free debt shrinks.  While there is an ex-post aggregate
46:1485:102148:21:54:64:464:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:welfare gain of .49%, the policy does not allow for Pareto improving transfers.
46:1486:102227:54:37:64:189:598:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:6    Robustness
46:1487:102242:37:21:64:546:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix D studies the robustness of the results.  Section D.5 shows transition dynamics from
46:1488:102335:21:21:64:546:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the benchmark economy to one with tighter capital requirements.  Along the transition path,
46:1489:102426:21:20:64:546:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is a consumption boom as the economy gradually adjusts to a permanently lower capital
46:1490:102517:20:25:64:94:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stock.
46:1491:102523:25:21:75:547:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix D.6 studies a range of values for the equity issuance cost around the benchmark.
46:1492:102612:21:21:64:546:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The effects of a greater adjustment cost are similar to those of tighter capital requirements.
46:1493:102706:21:21:64:547:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:HigherσIlimits banks’ ability to absorb aggregate risk and increases the cost of debt finance
46:1494:102799:21:21:64:546:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to firms.  In equilibrium, this leads to substantially lower corporate leverage and hence reduces
46:1495:102896:21:21:64:546:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial fragility for both producers and intermediaries.  At the same time, it causes a smaller
46:1496:102993:21:21:64:546:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital stock and lower output.  The exercise highlights the importance of the equity adjustment
46:1497:103089:21:21:64:547:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cost for generating a large credit risk premium. When we raiseσIto 7 from a benchmark value of
46:1498:103183:21:21:64:546:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5, the loss rate on corporate loans is cut in half, while the risk premium earned by intermediaries
46:1499:103282:21:25:64:525:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:doubles.  This implies that the price of risk earned by intermediaries increases by factor 4.
46:1500:103375:25:21:75:547:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix D.7 finds that the conclusions of our main macro-prudential policy experiment are
46:1501:103465:21:21:64:546:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:robust to changes in key model parameters.  Neither the presence of the bankruptcy option,
46:1502:103555:21:21:64:546:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nor  the  equity  adjustment  costs,  nor  the  tax  shield  for  banks  are  crucial  for  the  qualitative
46:1503:103663:21:21:64:546:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:macro-pru  implications  of  the  model.   In  every  case,  borrowers  gain  from  tighter  policy  and
46:1504:103767:21:21:64:546:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:savers loose.  The trade-off between less financial fragility and a smaller economy is present in
46:1505:103864:21:53:64:169:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:every model variant.
46:1506:103884:53:37:64:186:123:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:7    Conclusion
46:1507:103899:37:21:64:546:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We provide the first calibrated macro-economic model which features intermediaries who extend
46:1508:103992:21:0:64:546:65:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:long-term defaultable loans to firms producing output and raise deposits from risk averse savers,
47:1509:104091:0:21:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and in which both banks and firms can default. The model incorporates a rich set of fiscal policy
47:1510:104188:21:25:64:459:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rules, including deposit insurance, and endogenizes the risk-free interest rate.
47:1511:104268:25:21:75:547:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Like  in  the  standard  accelerator  model,  shocks  to  the  economy  affect  entrepreneurial  net
47:1512:104368:21:21:64:546:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth.  Since firm borrowing is constrained by net worth, macroeconomic shocks are potentially
47:1513:104462:21:21:64:546:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amplified by tighter borrowing constraints.  For realistic firm leverage ratios,  this traditional
47:1514:104560:21:21:64:546:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accelerator is not very powerful.  A second, much more powerful financial accelerator arises from
47:1515:104657:21:21:64:546:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explicitly modeling the financial intermediaries’ net worth dynamics.  Intermediaries are subject
47:1516:104754:21:21:64:546:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  regulatory  capital  constraints.   Macroeconomic  shocks  that  lead  to  binding  intermediary
47:1517:104854:21:21:64:546:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowing  constraints  amplify  the  shocks  through  their  direct  effect  on  intermediaries’  net
47:1518:104956:21:25:64:454:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth and the indirect effect on borrowers to whom the intermediaries lend.
47:1519:105031:25:21:75:547:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We find that tighter restrictions on bank leverage reduce financial fragility, but also shrinks
47:1520:105126:21:21:64:546:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  size  of  the  intermediation  sector  and  its  risk  absorption  capacity.   The  size  of  the  econ-
47:1521:105235:21:21:64:546:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:omy shrinks and macro-economic volatility may increase.  Counter-cyclical capital equity re-
47:1522:105327:21:20:64:546:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quirements centered around the current level generate a Pareto improvement.  Tighter macro-
47:1523:105418:20:21:64:546:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prudential policy has sizeable effects on inequality; the incidence of policies designed to limit

47:1525:105594:25:21:75:547:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Several  extensions  are  fruitful  directions  for  future  research.   One  could  study  monetary
47:1526:105694:21:21:64:546:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policy in a model that has endogenous labor supply and New-Keynesian ingredients.  Modeling
47:1527:105785:21:21:64:546:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity within the financial sector would be interesting, splitting institutions into levered
47:1528:105884:21:21:64:546:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and unlevered for example.  One can add mortgage borrowers and study interactions between
47:1529:105973:21:21:64:546:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stress in mortgage and corporate loans and their implications for the real economy.  Finally,

47:1531:106155:21:21:64:546:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:management’s incentives to gamble arising from compensation structures may affect optimal

62:2412:131241:14:14:64:546:578:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:solution methods.  First, portfolio restrictions such as leverage constraints may be occasionally binding
62:2413:131346:14:13:64:546:564:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in the true stochastic equilibrium.  Generally, a local approximation around the steady state (with a
62:2414:131447:13:14:64:546:551:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:binding or slack constraint) will therefore inaccurately capture nonlinear dynamics when constraints go
62:2415:131550:14:13:64:546:537:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:from slack to binding. Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015) propose a solution using local methods. Secondly,
62:2416:131654:13:14:64:546:524:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the portfolio allocation of agents across assets with different risk profiles is generally indeterminate
62:2417:131758:14:13:64:546:510:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:at the non-stochastic steady state.  This means that it is generally impossible to solve for equilibrium
62:2418:131862:13:18:64:525:497:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:dynamics using local methods since the point around which to perturb the system is not known.
62:2419:131955:18:13:75:547:479:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Global projection methods (Judd (1998)) avoid these problems by not relying on the deterministic
62:2420:132051:13:14:64:546:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:steady state.  Rather,  they directly approximate the transition and policy functions in the relevant
62:2421:132152:14:13:64:546:452:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:area of the state space.  Additional advantages of global nonlinear methods are greater flexibility in
62:2422:132254:13:14:64:546:439:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:dealing with highly nonlinear functions within the model such as probability distributions or option-like

62:2424:132367:37:25:64:240:388:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:B.1    Solution Procedure
62:2425:132392:25:26:64:448:363:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The projection-based solution approach used in this paper has three main steps:
62:2426:132471:26:14:54:547:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Step 1.Define approximating basis for the policy and transition functions.To approximate
62:2427:132559:14:13:94:547:323:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:these  unknown  functions,  we  discretize  the  state  space  and  use  multivariate  linear  interpola-
62:2428:132664:13:14:94:547:310:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:tion.  Our general solution framework provides an object-oriented MATLAB library that allows
62:2429:132756:14:13:94:547:296:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:approximation of arbitrary multivariate functions using linear interpolation, splines, or polyno-
62:2430:132853:13:14:94:547:283:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:mials.  For the model in this paper, splines or polynomials of various orders achieved inferior
62:2431:132948:14:23:94:347:269:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:results due to their lack of global shape preservation.
62:2432:133003:23:13:54:547:246:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Step 2.Iteratively solve for the unknown functions.Given an initial guess for policy and transi-
62:2433:133099:13:14:94:547:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:tion functions, at each point in the discretized state space compute the current-period optimal
62:2434:133194:14:13:94:547:219:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:policies.  Using the solutions, compute the next iterate of the transition functions.  Repeat until
62:2435:133293:13:14:94:547:206:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:convergence.  The system of nonlinear equations at each point in the state space is solved us-
62:2436:133387:14:13:94:547:192:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:ing a standard nonlinear equation solver.  Kuhn-Tucker conditions can be rewritten as equality
62:2437:133481:13:14:94:547:179:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:constraints for this purpose.  This step is completely parallelized across points in the state space
62:2438:133581:14:22:94:186:165:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:within each iterate.
62:2439:133601:22:14:54:546:143:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Step 3.Simulate the model for many periods using approximated functions.Verify that the
62:2440:133688:14:13:94:547:129:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:simulated time path stays within the bounds of the state space for which policy and transition
62:2441:133782:13:14:94:547:116:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:functions were computed.  Calculate relative Euler equation errors to assess the computational
62:2442:133876:14:14:94:547:102:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:accuracy of the solution.  If the simulated time path leaves the state space boundaries or errors
62:2443:133973:14:13:94:547:88:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:are too large, the solution procedure may have to be repeated with optimized grid bounds or
62:2444:134064:13:0:94:217:75:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:positioning of grid points.
63:2445:134093:0:33:75:373:715:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We will now provide a more detailed description for each step.
63:2446:134155:33:25:64:240:682:12:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:Step 1The state space consists of
63:2447:134188:25:22:84:306:657:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:-  two exogenous state variables [ZAt,σω,t], and
63:2448:134236:22:25:84:355:635:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:-  five endogenous state variables [KBt,ABt,WIt,WSt,BGt].
63:2449:134293:25:14:64:546:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We first discretizeZAtinto aNZA-state Markov chain using the Rouwenhorst (1995) method.  The

63:2453:134669:13:14:64:546:555:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:calibration section.  The 2 x 2 Markov transition matrix between these states is given by Πσω.  We
63:2454:134767:14:13:64:547:541:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:assume independence between both exogenous shocks.  Denote the set of theNx= 2NZAvalues the

63:2459:134981:17:14:75:547:497:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:One endogenous state variable can be eliminated for computational purposes since its value is implied
63:2460:135082:14:13:64:546:483:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:by the agents’ budget constraints, conditional on any four other state variables.  We eliminate saver

68:2830:148006:18:13:75:547:478:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:To assess the quality and accuracy of the solution, we perform two types of checks.  First, we verify
68:2831:148107:13:14:64:546:465:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:that all state variable realizations along the simulated path are within the bounds of the state variable
68:2832:148212:14:13:64:546:451:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:grids defined in step 1.  If the simulation exceeds the grid boundaries, we expand the grid bounds in
68:2833:148313:13:14:64:546:438:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the violated dimensions, and restart the procedure at step 1.  Secondly, we compute relative errors for
68:2834:148416:14:13:64:546:424:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:all equations of the system (E1) – E(12) and the transition functions (T1) – (T4) along the simulated
68:2835:148517:13:14:64:546:411:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:path.  For equations involving expectations (such as (E1)), this requires evaluating the transition and

68:2850:149091:13:14:64:546:296:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:those points.  However, the simulated path will likely visit many points that are between grid points,

69:2891:151530:13:14:64:547:441:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:tries out negative consumption values (and thus utility becomes ill-defined), we use log(ˆcnj),n=B,S,
69:2892:151631:14:13:64:546:427:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:as solution variable for the solver.  This means the solver can make consumption arbitrarily small, but

69:2897:152043:13:14:64:546:356:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:of variables, whereas analytically computed Jacobians are exact and require only one evaluation.  We
69:2898:152143:14:13:64:546:342:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:follow Elenev (2016) in “pre-computing” all forecasting functions in step 2B of the algorithm, so that
69:2899:152245:13:14:64:546:329:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:we can calculate the Jacobian of the system analytically.  To do so,  we employ the Symbolic Math
69:2900:152342:14:14:64:546:315:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Toolbox in MATLAB, passing the analytic Jacobian to fsolve at the beginning of step 2C. This greatly
69:2901:152442:14:32:64:173:301:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:speeds up calculations.

69:2907:152796:14:13:64:546:195:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:and the same information content.  The reason is that borrower wealth is much more stable in the
69:2908:152892:13:14:64:546:182:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:dynamics of the model than borrower debt, since borrower debt and capital are strongly correlated

70:2925:154094:14:13:64:546:534:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:as Kubler and Schmedders (2003), portfolio constraints lead to additional computational challenges
70:2926:154192:13:14:64:546:521:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:since  portfolio  policies  may  not  be  smooth  functions  of  state  variables  due  to  occasionally  binding
70:2927:154305:14:14:64:546:507:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:constraints.  Hence we cluster grid points in areas of the state space where constraints transition from
70:2928:154409:14:13:64:547:493:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:slack to binding. Our policy functions are particularly nonlinear in bank net worthWIt, since the status
70:2929:154513:13:14:64:546:480:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:of the bank leverage constraint (binding or not binding) depends predominantly on this state variable.
70:2930:154615:14:13:64:547:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:To achieve acceptable accuracy, we have to specify a very dense grid forWI, as can be seen above.
70:2931:154712:13:14:64:546:453:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f8:Also note that the lower end of theWIgrid includes some negative values.  Negative realizations ofWI
70:2932:154812:14:13:64:546:439:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:can occur in severe financial crisis episodes.  Recall thatWIis the beginning-of-period net worth of all
70:2933:154916:13:14:64:546:426:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:banks.  Depending on the realization of their idiosyncratic payout shock, banks decide whether or not
70:2934:155017:14:13:64:546:412:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:to default.  Thus the model contains two reasons why banks may not default despite initial negative
70:2935:155116:13:14:64:546:399:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f8:net worth:  (i) positive idiosyncratic shocks, and (ii) positive franchise value.  The lower bound ofWI
70:2936:155219:14:13:64:546:385:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:needs  to  be  low  enough  such  that  bank  net  worth  is  not  artificially  truncated  during  crises,  but  it
70:2937:155335:13:14:64:546:372:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:must not be so low that, given such low initial net worth, banks cannot be recapitalized to get back to
70:2938:155438:14:14:64:546:358:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:positive net worth.  Thus the “right” lower bound depends on the strength of the equity issuance cost
70:2939:155539:14:32:64:535:344:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:and other parameters.  Finding the right value for the lower bound is a matter of experimentation.
70:2940:155637:32:14:64:547:312:12:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:Generating an initial guess and iteration scheme.To find a good initial guess for the policy,
70:2941:155730:14:13:64:546:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:forecasting, and transition functions, we solve the deterministic “steady-state” of the model under the
70:2942:155833:13:14:64:546:285:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:assumption that the bank leverage constraint is binding and government debt/GDP is 40%.  We then
70:2943:155929:14:14:64:546:271:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:initialize all functions to their steady-state values, for all points in the state space.  Note that the only
70:2944:156038:14:13:64:546:257:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:role of the steady-state calculation is to generate an initial guess that enables the nonlinear equation
70:2945:156142:13:14:64:546:244:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:solver to find solutions at (almost) all points during the first iteration of the solution algorithm.  In
70:2946:156247:14:17:64:392:230:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:our experience, the steady state delivers a good enough initial guess.
70:2947:156317:17:14:75:547:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:In case the solver cannot find solutions for some points during the initial iterations, we revisit such
70:2948:156420:14:13:64:546:199:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:points at the end of each iteration.  We try to solve the system at these “failed” points using as initial
70:2949:156526:13:14:64:546:186:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:guess the solution of the closest neighboring point at which the solver was successful.  This method
70:2950:156626:14:17:64:438:172:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:works well to speed up convergence and eventually find solutions at all points.
70:2951:156705:17:14:75:547:155:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:To further speed up computation time, we run the initial 100 iterations with a coarser state space
70:2952:156803:14:13:64:546:141:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:grid (19,500 points total). After these iterations, the algorithm is usually close to convergence; however,
70:2953:156910:13:14:64:546:128:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the accuracy during simulation would be too low.  Therefore,  we initialize the finer (final) solution
70:2954:157012:14:14:64:546:114:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:grid using the policy, forecasting, and transition function obtained after 100 coarse grid iterations.  We
70:2955:157118:14:17:64:401:100:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:then run the algorithm for at most 40 more iterations on the fine grid.
70:2956:157189:17:14:75:547:83:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:To determine convergence, we check absolute errors in the value functions of households and banks,
70:2957:157287:14:0:64:546:69:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(V1) – V(3).  Out of all functions we approximate during the solution procedure,  these exhibit the
71:2958:157388:0:14:64:546:715:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:slowest convergence.  We stop the solution algorithm when the maximum absolute difference between
71:2959:157485:14:13:64:546:701:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:two iterations, and for all three functions and all points in the state space, falls below 1e-3 and the
71:2960:157588:13:14:64:546:688:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:mean distance falls below 1e-4.  For appropriately chosen grid boundaries, the algorithm will converge
71:2961:157690:14:17:64:203:674:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:within the final 40 iterations.
71:2962:157721:17:14:75:547:657:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:In some cases, our grid boundaries are wider than necessary, in the sense that the simulated economy
71:2963:157821:14:14:64:546:643:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:never visits the areas near the boundary on its equilibrium path.  Local convergence in those areas
71:2964:157920:14:13:64:546:629:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:is usually very slow, but not relevant for the equilibrium path of the economy.  If the algorithm has
71:2965:158021:13:14:64:546:616:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:not achieved convergence after the 40 additional iterations on the fine grid, we nonetheless stop the
71:2966:158122:14:13:64:546:602:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:procedure and simulate the economy.  If the resulting simulation produces low relative errors (see step
71:2967:158225:13:14:64:546:589:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:3 of the solution procedure),  we accept the solution.  After the 140 iterations described above,  our
71:2968:158327:14:13:64:546:575:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:simulated model economies either achieve acceptable accuracy in relative errors, or if not, the cause is
71:2969:158431:13:14:64:546:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:a badly configured state grid.  In the latter case, we need to improve the grid and restart the solution
71:2970:158535:14:13:64:546:548:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:procedure.  Additional iterations, beyond 100 on the coarse and 40 on the fine grid, do not change any

71:2973:158817:13:14:64:546:504:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(HPC) cluster.  As mentioned above, the nonlinear system of equations can be solved in parallel at
71:2974:158915:14:14:64:546:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:each point.  We parallelize across 28 CPU cores of a single HPC node.  From computing the initial

71:2976:159112:13:14:64:546:463:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:calibration is about 2 hours and 40 minutes.  Calibrations that exhibit more financial fragility and/or
71:2977:159215:14:32:64:272:449:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:macro volatility converge up to 15% slower.
71:2978:159258:32:14:64:547:417:12:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:Simulation.To  obtain  the  quantitative  results,  we  simulate  the  model  for  10,000  periods  after

71:2980:159478:14:13:64:546:389:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:state  variables.   As  described  in  detail  above,  we  verify  that  the  simulated  time  path  stays  within
71:2981:159592:13:14:64:546:376:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the bounds of the state space for which the policy functions were computed.  We fix the seed of the
71:2982:159691:14:13:64:546:362:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:random number generator so that we use the same sequence of exogenous shock realizations for each

71:2985:159909:13:14:64:546:318:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:each.   In  the  initial  period,  we  set  the  endogenous  state  variables  to  several  different  values  that
71:2986:160024:14:13:64:546:304:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:reflect the ergodic distribution of the states.  We use a clustering algorithm to represent the ergodic
71:2987:160127:13:14:64:546:291:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:distribution non-parametrically.  We fix the initial exogenous shock realization to mean productivity
71:2988:160228:14:13:64:546:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(ZA=  1)  and  low  uncertainty  (σω,low).   The  “impulse”  in  the  second  period  is  either  only  a  bad

71:2992:160638:13:37:64:254:223:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:10,000 paths given the initial condition.

71:2996:160904:14:14:64:547:134:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the 95thpercentile of the error distribution, the 99th, and 100thpercentiles during the 10,000 period
71:2997:161005:14:13:64:546:120:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:simulation of the model.  Median and 75th percentile errors are small for all equations.  Equations

71:3000:161306:13:14:64:546:80:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:placing more grid points in those areas of the state space.  In our experience, adding points to eliminate

72:3025:162512:33:13:64:546:336:12:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:Policy function plots.We further visually inspect policy functions to gauge whether the approx-
72:3026:162607:13:14:64:546:323:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:imated functions have the smoothness and monotonicity properties implied by our choices of utility
72:3027:162705:14:13:64:546:309:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:and adjustment cost functions.  Such plots also allow us to see the effect of binding constraints on
72:3028:162805:13:14:64:546:296:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:prices and quantities.  For example, figure 7 shows investment by firms and the Lagrange multiplier on
72:3029:162907:14:14:64:546:282:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the bank’s leverage constraint.  It is obvious from the graphs that a binding intermediary constraint
72:3030:163008:14:13:64:546:268:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:restricts investment.  The intermediary constraint becomes binding for low values of intermediary net
72:3031:163109:13:14:64:546:255:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:worth.  Further note the interaction with borrower-entrepreneur net worth:  holding fixed intermediary
72:3032:163211:14:32:64:456:241:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:net worth, the constraint is more likely to become biding for low borrower wealth.

72:3034:163387:14:14:64:546:195:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:overlaid with the placement of grid points.  These types of plots allow us to check that the simulated
72:3035:163489:14:13:64:546:181:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:path of the economy does not violate the state grid boundaries.  It further helps us to determine where
72:3036:163592:13:0:64:451:168:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:to place grid points.  Histogram plots for the benchmark economy are in figure 8.

74:3130:167350:13:14:64:546:294:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the moment chosen to pin down this parameter.  While there is a modest decline in the default rate,
74:3131:167449:14:13:64:546:280:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the overall loss rate still goes up.  There are more bank bankruptcies and a higher excess return on

74:3133:167651:14:13:64:546:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:of costlier credit.  With less corporate debt and unchanged financial sector leverage, the banking sector
74:3134:167756:13:14:64:546:240:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:shrinks (Deposits/Y). Lower corporate debt also results in a lower capital stock and a less volatile
74:3135:167856:14:18:64:347:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:economy, which improves risk sharing (MU vol goes down).

74:3138:168119:14:13:64:546:181:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:increases the excess return on bonds.  With increased duration, firms become better duration-matched
74:3139:168219:13:14:64:546:168:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:since the duration of their capital assets is high.  As a result, firm leverage slightly increases despite
74:3140:168325:14:17:64:175:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the higher cost of debt.

74:3142:168445:14:13:64:546:123:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:justment costs naturally reduce investment volatility.  They raise consumption volatility.  The increase
74:3143:168549:13:14:64:546:110:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in capital adjustment costs increases the volatility in the price of capital (not reported), which causes
74:3144:168654:14:13:64:546:96:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:risk-averse firms to de-lever.  Lower leverage reduces the quantity of default risk as well as the credit

77:3269:174482:14:24:64:491:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:additionally impose a hard constraint on leverage.  This is a standard leverage constraint:

77:3275:175011:14:18:64:330:389:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(59) imposes a hard upper bound on borrower leverage.
77:3276:175064:18:13:75:546:371:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We  set  the  maximum  LTV  ratio  parameter  Φ  =  0.45.   This  value  is  just  large  enough  so  that

77:3278:175270:14:13:64:546:344:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the benchmark model, the borrower’s LTV constraint binds in 3% of financial recessions.  The LTV
77:3279:175366:13:14:64:546:331:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:constraint limits corporate borrowing as a fraction of the market value of capital.  We set Φ to match
77:3280:175468:14:13:64:546:317:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the volatility of corporate debt-to-GDP of the non-financial sector, which is 5.2% in the data and 4.3%
77:3281:175571:13:18:64:127:304:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in the model.
77:3282:175584:18:13:75:547:286:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We have verified that relaxing this constraint to the extent that it is never binding does not signif-
77:3283:175686:13:14:64:546:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:icantly affect the results.  For example, setting the maximum leverage ratio to Φ =.55 yields almost
77:3284:175786:14:13:64:546:259:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:identical  results.   We  include  the  constraint  for  comparability  with  the  existing  literature  that  has

77:3286:176012:14:37:64:528:232:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:limiting corporate leverage is a standard trade-off between the benefits and costs of debt finance.

77:3288:176152:25:13:64:546:170:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We define income tax revenue as current personal tax receipts (line 3) plus current taxes on production
77:3289:176255:13:14:64:546:157:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:and imports (line 4) minus the net subsidies to government sponsored enterprises (line 30 minus line
77:3290:176355:14:13:64:546:143:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:19) minus the net government spending to the rest of the world (line 25 + line 26 + line 29 - line 6 - line
77:3291:176462:13:14:64:546:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:9 - line 18).  Our logic for adding the last three items to personal tax receipts is as follows.  Taxes on
77:3292:176568:14:14:64:546:116:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:production and export mostly consist of federal excise and state and local sales taxes, which are mostly
77:3293:176672:14:13:64:546:102:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:paid by consumers.  Net government spending on GSEs consists mostly of housing subsidies received
77:3294:176769:13:14:64:546:89:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:by households which can be treated equivalently as lowering the taxes that households pay.  Finally,
77:3295:176869:14:0:64:546:75:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in the data,  some of the domestic GDP is sent abroad in the form of net government expenditures
78:3296:176967:0:14:64:546:715:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:to the rest of the world rather than being consumed domestically.  Since the model has no foreigners,
78:3297:177068:14:13:64:546:701:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:we reduce personal taxes for this amount, essentially rebating this lost consumption back to domestic

78:3303:177517:18:13:75:547:581:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Second,  they earn interest on their public lending i.e.  government bonds.  In the data,  Treasury
78:3304:177616:13:14:64:547:568:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:coupons are taxed at the household’s marginal tax rate,τin the model.  However, the tax revenue
78:3305:177711:14:13:64:542:554:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f8:collected by the government from interest income on its own bonds is substantially lower thanτBGt

78:3321:178635:13:14:75:547:365:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We measure all quantities at December 31, 2014.  Private debt stocks are taken from the Financial

78:3324:178925:14:13:64:546:324:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:There is approximately $13 trillion each outstanding of private and public debt.  Almost all private

78:3332:179297:24:14:64:546:162:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:In  our  numerical  work,  we  guarantee  the  stationarity  of  the  ratio  of  government  debt  to  GDP  by

78:3335:179611:14:13:64:546:121:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:austerity region.  Specifically, taxes are gradually and smoothly lowered with a convex function until
78:3336:179713:13:14:64:546:108:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:they hit zero at debt to GDP of -0.1.  Tax rates are gradually and convexly increased until they hit 60%
78:3337:179817:14:14:64:546:94:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:at a debt-to-GDP ratio of 150%.  Our simulations never reach the -10% and +150% debt/GDP states.
78:3338:179913:14:13:64:546:80:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The simulation spends 24% of the time in the profligacy and 15% of the time in the austerity region.

79:3343:180448:14:13:64:546:674:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:primary surplus of (just about) zero.  Put differently, the actual U.S. fiscal path is unsustainable, i.e.,

79:3346:180637:24:14:64:546:599:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Our notion of the intermediary sector is the levered financial sector.  We take book values of assets and
79:3347:180742:14:13:64:546:585:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:liabilities of these sectors from the Financial Accounts of the United States (formerly Flow of Funds).
79:3348:180845:13:14:64:546:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:We subtract holding and funding company equity investments in subsidiaries from those subsidiaries’
79:3349:180944:14:13:64:546:558:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:liabilities.  Table 7 reports the assets, liabilities, and leverage of each sector as of 2014, as well as the
79:3350:181053:13:14:64:546:545:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:average leverage from 1953 to 2014.  We find that the average leverage ratio of the levered financial
79:3351:181154:14:17:64:294:531:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:sector was 91.5%.  This is our calibration target.
79:3352:181204:17:14:75:547:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2015) identify a similar group of financial institutions as net
79:3353:181304:14:14:64:546:500:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:suppliers of safe, liquid assets.  Their financial sector includes money market mutual funds (who do not
79:3354:181408:14:13:64:546:486:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:perform maturity transformation) and equity REITS (who operate physical assets) but excludes life
79:3355:181505:13:14:64:546:473:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:insurance companies (which are highly levered).  The financial sector definition of Krishnamurthy and
79:3356:181606:14:13:64:546:459:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Vissing-Jorgensen (2015) suggests a similar ratio of 90.9%.  As an aside, we note that Krishnamurthy
79:3357:181706:13:14:64:546:446:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:and  Vissing-Jorgensen  (2015)  report  lower  total  assets  and  liabilities  than  in  our  reconstruction  of
79:3358:181819:14:13:64:546:432:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:their procedure because they net out positions within the financial sector by instrument while we do

81:3384:183134:25:13:64:546:657:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Figure 10 compares the dynamics of important macro-economic aggregates and balance sheet variables
81:3385:183232:13:14:64:546:644:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in a financial recession (red lines) to the effect of a pure second-moment shock.  The IRF plots are
81:3386:183332:14:13:64:546:630:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:generated as explained in the main text.  The red line in the plots of figure 10 is identical to the red
81:3387:183436:13:14:64:546:617:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:lines in figures 2 and 3 in the main text, as both are caused by the same combination of a low TFP
81:3388:183534:14:13:64:546:603:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:realization and an increase inσωin period 1.  The blue lines in figure 10 show dynamics after the
81:3389:183631:13:14:64:547:590:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:economy is hit only by the increase inσω, with stable TFP. The plots show that this pure uncertainty
81:3390:183731:14:13:64:546:576:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:shock has much smaller negative effects on output, consumption and investment than the combination
81:3391:183829:13:14:64:546:563:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:that causes a financial recession.  This feature of our model is consistent with the empirical finding
81:3392:183931:14:13:64:546:549:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:that uncertainty shocks alone have at most moderate negative effects on output and investment, see
81:3393:184029:13:18:64:342:536:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:for example Bachmann and Bayer (2013) or Vavra (2014).
81:3394:184083:18:14:75:547:518:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A  closer  look  at  the  balance  sheet  variables  in  the  bottom  panel  reveals  that  the  fundamental
81:3395:184191:14:13:64:546:504:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:difference  between  both  types  of  shocks  lies  in  the  response  of  intermediaries.   The  losses  suffered
81:3396:184305:13:14:64:546:491:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:on loans during a financial crisis are only marginally larger than those from the uncertainty shock.
81:3397:184405:14:13:64:546:477:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:However, the financial sector does not shrink after the uncertainty shock. Rather, firms raise more debt
81:3398:184509:13:14:64:546:464:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(bottom left panel) despite a temporarily smaller capital stock (top right panel), effectively increasing
81:3399:184614:14:13:64:546:450:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:leverage.  Banks reduce deposit funding only marginally (bottom middle).  The spikes in bank failure
81:3400:184714:13:14:64:546:437:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:rate and credit spread are less than half of those experienced in a financial recession.  We can conclude
81:3401:184819:14:13:64:546:423:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:that only the combination of TFP and uncertainty shock activates the intermediary-based financial
81:3402:184916:13:18:64:119:410:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:accelerator.
81:3403:184928:18:14:75:547:392:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Why are financial recessions so much worse despite similar losses from borrower defaults for banks?
81:3404:185027:14:13:64:546:378:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Figure 11 shows that the dynamics of the corporate bond price (top right) are the key amplifying force.
81:3405:185130:13:14:64:546:365:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:This price drops sharply in financial recessions, causing large market value losses for intermediaries.
81:3406:185233:14:13:64:546:351:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:This large drop in price is driven by two main forces.  First, the negative TFP shock reduces bank
81:3407:185331:13:14:64:546:338:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:demand for corporate bonds, as seen in Figure 3 in the main text.  Second, the losses on corporate
81:3408:185429:14:13:64:546:324:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:bonds caused by the uncertainty shock reduce bank capital, and thus amplify the first effect of reduced
81:3409:185532:13:14:64:546:311:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:demand on prices.  The stronger financial accelerator means that intermediary net worth falls only half
81:3410:185635:14:13:64:546:297:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:as much in an uncertainty shock episode compared to a financial recession (bottom right).  As a result,
81:3411:185738:13:14:64:546:284:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:intermediaries  are  not  forced  to  shrink  as  they  are  in  a  financial  recession.   Continuity  in  lending
81:3412:185853:14:13:64:546:270:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:to  borrower-entrepreneurs  prevents  a  sharp  reduction  in  investment  and  the  capital  price  (bottom
81:3413:185961:13:14:64:546:257:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:left) despite intermediary losses on loans.  In the third period of a financial recession,  intermediary
81:3414:186065:14:14:64:546:243:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:wealth overshoots as banks earn large spreads due to the sharp drop in the risk-free rate. Intermediaries
81:3415:186170:14:13:64:546:229:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:deplete this extra wealth to gradually expand lending again as the production sector recovers to normal
81:3416:186273:13:14:64:546:216:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:levels of capital.  These dynamics are not present in an uncertainty shock episode, since lending never
81:3417:186376:14:37:64:185:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:contracted to begin with.

81:3421:186646:14:13:64:546:113:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:at the time:  (1) the bankruptcy option for banks, (2) equity adjustment costs (σI= 0), and (3) the
81:3422:186745:13:14:64:546:100:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:tax shield for financial firms.  Table 8 contains the results.  The main finding is that financial leverage
81:3423:186852:14:13:64:546:86:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:is affected very little by these financial frictions.  In other words, the main driver of the high financial
81:3424:186960:13:0:64:546:73:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:leverage is the wedge between the subjective time discount rate of borrowers and savers.  This wedge

83:3533:188204:35:14:75:547:364:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Furthermore, we see that when banks are not allowed to default, they stay away from their leverage

83:3535:188410:13:14:64:546:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:banks  for  their  shareholders.   This  acts  like  a  reduction  in  risk  aversion  for  bank  shareholders  and
83:3536:188525:14:14:64:546:323:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:their leverage constraint becomes binding all the time.  The slightly higher financial leverage results
83:3537:188628:14:13:64:546:309:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in  significantly  more  bank  bankruptcies.   The  effective  reduction  in  risk  aversion  also  lowers  the

83:3539:188838:14:13:64:546:282:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:on corporate bonds, despite a slightly higher loss rate on corporate loans.  The cheaper cost of debt
83:3540:188939:13:14:64:546:269:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in turn incentivizes non-financial firms to increase leverage.  In sum, a reduction in the cost of equity
83:3541:189044:14:17:64:496:255:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:finance for banks has a stronger effect on non-financial leverage than on financial leverage.
83:3542:189137:17:14:75:547:238:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The model without tax shield features higher credit spread and excess return and lower loss rates.

83:3545:189440:14:37:64:449:197:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(modestly).  The increased cost of credit coincides with lower corporate leverage.

83:3550:189860:13:14:64:546:95:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The  rise  in  the  credit  spread  in  financial  recessions  to  4.28%  reflects  not  only  the  increase  in  the

84:3585:191433:14:13:64:546:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:occurring in the future.  Consistent with the result in He and Krishnamurty (2013), the credit spread
84:3586:191534:13:14:64:546:340:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:is high when the financial intermediary’s wealth share is low.  Since our model has defaultable debt,
84:3587:191635:14:13:64:546:326:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the increase in the credit spread reflects both risk-neutral compensation for expected defaults and a
84:3588:191736:13:18:64:161:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:credit risk premium.
84:3589:191756:18:13:75:547:295:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:To  shed  further  light  on  the  source  of  the  high  credit  spread,  we  compute  the  expected  excess
84:3590:191865:13:14:64:546:282:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:return (EER) on corporate loans earned by the intermediary.  The EER consists both of the credit
84:3591:191961:14:14:64:546:268:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:risk  premium,  defined  as  the  (negative)  covariance  of  the  intermediary’s  stochastic  discount  factor
84:3592:192072:14:13:64:546:254:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:with  the  corporate  bond’s  excess  return,  and  an  additional  component  that  reflects  the  tightness
84:3593:192181:13:14:64:546:241:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:of the intermediary’s leverage constraint.  This component arises because the marginal agent in the
84:3594:192280:14:13:64:546:227:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:market for risk-free debt is the saver household, while corporate bonds are priced by the constrained
84:3595:192381:13:14:64:546:214:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:intermediary.   The  market  risk  free  rate  is  lower  than  the  “shadow”  risk  free  rate  implied  by  the
84:3596:192494:14:13:64:546:200:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:intermediary SDF. Given log preferences, most of the action in the EER comes from the constraint
84:3597:192590:13:14:64:546:187:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:tightness  component.   When  intermediary  wealth  is  relatively  high,  the  leverage  constraint  is  not
84:3598:192699:14:13:64:546:173:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:binding  and  the  EER  is  approximately  zero.   Low  levels  of  intermediary  wealth  result  from  credit
84:3599:192809:13:14:64:546:160:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:losses, and the lowest levels occur during financial crises.  At these times, credit risk increases and the
84:3600:192916:14:13:64:546:146:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:intermediary becomes constrained.  In the worst crisis episodes when intermediary wealth reaches zero
84:3601:193017:13:0:64:300:133:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:or drops below zero, the EER reaches 20 percent.

85:3630:193765:14:14:64:547:325:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:of these variables after a policy change from the benchmark to either a higher (ξ=.90) or a lower

85:3637:194337:25:13:64:547:195:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:Table 9 shows the effect of larger or smaller equity adjustment costs (σI) relative to the benchmark

85:3639:194540:14:13:64:546:168:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:tion have a similar effect to tightening the intermediaries’ capital requirement.  Higher marginal equity
85:3640:194645:13:14:64:547:155:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:adjustments costs (columnsσI= 6,σI= 7) lead to a smaller non-financial sector, both in terms of
85:3641:194740:14:13:64:546:141:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:assets  and  liabilities.   Corporate  leverage  declines,  and  as  a  result,  fewer  firms  default,  causing  an
85:3642:194856:13:18:64:287:128:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:overall decline in loss rates on corporate loans.

87:3744:198338:14:13:64:546:324:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:(row 15), since it raises the risk premium while at the same time not requiring banks to raise more
87:3745:198437:13:18:64:453:311:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:equity.  Hence greaterσIraises the return on bank equity, while lowerξdoes not.
87:3746:198516:18:14:75:547:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The overall welfare effects of larger equity adjustment frictions are comparable to the effects of tighter

87:3748:198722:13:14:64:546:266:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the size of the capital stock, leading to a small aggregate welfare gain based on the population-weighted
87:3749:198827:14:13:64:546:252:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:measure (row 22).  Like tighter capital regulation, greaterσIbenefits equity owners of producers at
87:3750:198926:13:18:64:167:239:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:the expense of savers.
87:3751:198948:18:13:75:547:221:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The effects on macroeconomic volatility are nonlinear based on the same opposing forces that are
87:3752:199044:13:14:64:546:208:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:at play with tighter capital constraints:  since higher intermediation frictions increase the cost of debt
87:3753:199150:14:13:64:546:194:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:funding,  producers reduce the debt share of financing,  which makes financial recessions less severe.
87:3754:199252:13:14:64:546:181:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:At  the  same  time,  greater  intermediation  frictions  hamper  banks’  ability  to  absorb  aggregate  risk
87:3755:199362:14:14:64:547:167:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:through their balance sheet.  The net effect, at least locally around the benchmark level ofσI, is that
87:3756:199465:14:13:64:546:153:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:aggregate investment and consumption growth become less volatile with lower equity adjustment costs

89:3825:202479:18:14:75:547:643:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:The main finding is that the aggregate welfare changes from macro-prudential policy are robust to
89:3826:202576:14:13:64:546:629:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:these parameter variations.  In all experiments, welfare decreases in response to the four percentage
89:3827:202677:13:14:64:546:616:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:point increase in maximum allowable financial sector leverage from 92% to 96%. The range of estimates
89:3828:202778:14:13:64:546:602:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:is -0.35%, when banks are not allowed to fail (and hence cannot be bailed out), to -1.01%.  In all cases,
89:3829:202883:13:14:64:546:589:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:we see more fragility in the form of higher corporate loss rates and higher bank bankruptcies (except
89:3830:202984:14:13:64:546:575:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:of course when banks are not allowed to go bankrupt).  When it is easier and cheaper for shareholders
89:3831:203085:13:14:64:546:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:to recapitalize banks, the size of the banking sector is naturally less sensitive to a change in macro-
89:3832:203188:14:13:64:546:548:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:prudential regulation.  The basic trade-off between a larger banking sector and size of the economy
89:3833:203287:13:14:64:546:535:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:and more financial fragility is also present in every model.  The quantitative slope of that trade-off
89:3834:203389:14:13:64:546:521:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:depends on the model details.  The only results that are more fragile are those on macro-economic
89:3835:203486:13:14:64:546:508:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:volatility.  That should not come as a surprise since, even in the benchmark model, macro-economic
89:3836:203584:14:14:64:547:494:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:volatility is non-monotonic inξ.  Risk sharing tends to improve (MU vol falls) as macro-prudential
89:3837:203682:14:13:64:546:480:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:policy is relaxed, reflecting the financial sector’s improved ability to absorb aggregate risk when it is
89:3838:203787:13:14:64:546:467:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:larger.  The one exception is when bank equity can be costlessly adjusted,  which is also the model
89:3839:203886:14:0:64:528:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:when the banking sector size changes the least and macro-economic volatility increases the most.
