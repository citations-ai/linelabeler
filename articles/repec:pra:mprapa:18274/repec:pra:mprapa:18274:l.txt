2:20:515:17:12:91:522:561:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  nature  of  international  trade  and  the  very  nature  of  globalization  have  changed  dramatically  in 
2:21:629:12:12:91:522:549:10:Times:10:Times:B:recent years, with the emergence of new global players and a radically different competitive landscape. 
2:22:733:12:12:91:522:537:10:Times:10:Times:B:This new landscape emerged during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the Berlin Wall fall brought 
2:23:833:12:12:91:521:525:10:Times:10:Times:B:down the barriers that had split the post-WWII world, and the Brady Bonds put an end to the decade-
2:24:932:12:12:91:522:513:10:Times:10:Times:B:long debt crisis that plagued many developing countries. The 1990s saw the conclusion of the Uruguay 
2:25:1033:12:12:91:522:501:10:Times:10:Times:B:Round  and  the  birth  of  the  WTO,  which  brought  down many  trade  barriers  and  led  to  further 
2:26:1138:12:17:91:490:489:10:Times:10:Times:B:liberalization in areas like telecommunications, financial services and information technologies. 
2:27:1236:17:12:91:522:472:10:Times:10:Times:B:This transformation, which was both geopolitical and economic, was accompanied by the emergence of 
2:28:1335:12:12:91:522:460:10:Times:10:Times:B:new  business  models  that  built  on  new  opportunities  to  develop  comparative  advantages  (Krugman, 
2:29:1443:12:12:91:522:448:10:Times:10:Times:B:1995;   Baldwin,   2006).  With   the  opening  of  new   markets,   the   technical  revolution  in  IT   and 
2:30:1554:12:12:91:522:436:10:Times:10:Times:B:communications,  and  the  closer  harmonization  of  economic  models  worldwide,  trade  became  much 
2:31:1658:12:12:91:522:424:10:Times:10:Times:B:more than  just a  simple exchange of merchandise across borders.  It  developed into a  constant flow  of 
2:32:1765:12:11:91:522:412:10:Times:10:Times:B:investment, of technologies and technicians, of goods for processing and business services, in what has 
2:33:1869:11:18:91:262:401:10:Times:10:Times:B:been called the "Global Supply Chain".   
2:34:1910:18:12:91:522:383:10:Times:10:Times:B:Those changes have led the American author Tom Freidman to proclaim that now "The World is flat". 
2:35:2008:12:12:91:524:371:10:Times:10:Times:B:This  "Copernican  revolution"  where  countries  do  not  trade  wine  for  clothes  anymore  (Grossman  and 
2:36:2118:12:12:91:524:359:10:Times:10:Times:B:Rossi-Hansberg,  2006)  obliged  trade  analysts  and  international  economists  to  revise  their  old  beliefs 
2:37:2232:12:12:91:522:347:10:Times:10:Times:B:and  models,  while  trade  statisticians  and  national account  specialists  were  struggling  to  adapts  their 
2:38:2346:12:12:91:522:335:10:Times:10:Times:B:instruments to the new reality (Escaith, 2008). Despite important advances, the analysis is still lacking 
2:39:2452:12:11:91:522:323:10:Times:10:Times:B:appropriate  models  and  good  data  to  understand  and measure  appropriately  this  new  dimension  of 
2:40:2559:11:12:91:522:312:10:Times:10:Times:B:globalization.  Yet,  less  than  twenty  years  after  its  emergence,  this  new  business  model  is  now 
2:41:2668:12:12:91:522:300:10:Times:10:Times:B:challenged on two grounds: firstly, because global supply chains may have been a causing factor of the 
2:42:2770:12:12:91:524:288:10:Times:10:Times:B:Great Recession which followed the financial collapse of September 2008; secondly because a return to 
2:43:2872:12:12:91:522:276:10:Times:10:Times:B:business  as  usual  after  the  international  crisis  is  not  possible  on  objective  economic  ground,  nor  it is 
2:44:2992:12:17:91:327:264:10:Times:10:Times:B:desirable for normative social or environmental reasons. 
2:45:3049:17:12:91:522:247:10:Times:10:Times:B:Indeed, if the cause of the global crisis is clearly financial, its particular mode of dissemination through 
2:46:3158:12:12:91:522:235:10:Times:10:Times:B:real  channels  has  been  related  to  the  interdependency  created  by  global  productive  networks,  which 
2:47:3270:12:12:91:521:223:10:Times:10:Times:B:served  both  as  transmission  and  amplification  channels.  While  the  crisis  spread  initially  to  all 
2:48:3380:12:12:91:521:211:10:Times:10:Times:B:developed countries through toxic assets and exposure to the US financial market and seemed to spare 
2:49:3481:12:12:91:521:199:10:Times:10:Times:B:the developing economies, the premise of a new North-South "decoupling" vanished rapidly when the 
2:50:3579:12:17:91:363:187:10:Times:10:Times:B:contagion spread to the real economy through the trade collapse.  
2:51:3645:17:12:91:521:170:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  amplitude  and  simultaneity  of  the  transmission of  shocks  came  as  a  surprise  to  many  analysts. 
2:52:3757:12:12:91:525:158:10:Times:10:Times:B:International  supply  chains,  one  of  the  most  salient  features  of  the  "new  globalization"  were  rapidly 
2:53:3873:12:12:91:522:146:10:Times:10:Times:B:identified  as  one  of  the  main  factors  for  such  a  synchronization  of  shocks.  With  unemployment 
2:54:3981:12:12:91:522:134:10:Times:10:Times:B:increasing as recession spread in developed countries, the debate was also put on the public place as the 
2:55:4087:12:12:91:521:122:10:Times:10:Times:B:delocalization  of  investment  and  jobs  that  rests  behind  these  new  productive  networks,  together  with 
2:56:4201:12:27:91:485:110:10:Times:10:Times:B:the lack of governance of the international finance, became the focus of much public scrutiny.

3:62:4586:18:17:91:383:696:10:Times:10:Times:B:Box 1  The Microeconomics of Supply Chains and Trade in Tasks 
3:63:4648:17:12:91:544:679:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  question  of  what  steers  imports  and  exports  has  a  very  long  history  in  the  economic  literature. 
3:64:4764:12:12:91:545:667:10:Times:10:Times:B:Traditional  normative  trade  theory  is  build  on  the premises  of  gains  from  international  trade,  based  on  the 
3:65:4887:12:12:91:545:655:10:Times:10:Times:B:Ricardo's  arguments  of  comparative  advantages  which  allow  to  increase  output  by  reallocating  resources 
3:66:5001:12:12:91:545:643:10:Times:10:Times:B:within countries. The Hecksher-Ohlin model extends the results when there are many productive factors and 
3:67:5107:12:12:91:545:631:10:Times:10:Times:B:different  factor  endowments  which  create  gains  from  international  specialization.  Economic  theory  points 
3:68:5223:12:11:91:545:619:10:Times:10:Times:B:also to other sources of gains which are not liked to comparative advantages, for example access to a wider 
3:69:5331:11:12:91:545:608:10:Times:10:Times:B:variety of  goods and economies of scale  on the consumption and production sides, or  contesting monopoly 
3:70:5438:12:12:91:545:596:10:Times:10:Times:B:powers  on  the  institutional  one.  The  critic  and  testing  of  these  traditional  hypotheses  has  led  to  a  vast 
3:71:5561:12:17:91:258:584:10:Times:10:Times:B:literature (see WTO 2008 for a review). 
3:72:5601:17:12:91:544:567:10:Times:10:Times:B:Trade in tasks and the fragmentation of production along global supply chains has challenged the validity of 
3:73:5710:12:12:91:545:555:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  traditional models, based on  the  exchange of final goods. As for  trade in intermediate goods, two main 
3:74:5821:12:11:91:545:543:10:Times:10:Times:B:approaches  have  been  explored.  The  first  one  rests on  the  hypothesis  that  factors  (capital  and  labour)  are 
3:75:5943:11:12:91:544:532:10:Times:10:Times:B:fixed. Offshoring is similar to technical progress in the production of the final good: by shifting production 
3:76:6054:12:12:91:545:520:10:Times:10:Times:B:processes  to  the  countries  with  comparative  advantages,  more  of  the  final  goods  can  be  produced  with  the 
3:77:6175:12:12:91:544:508:10:Times:10:Times:B:same (fixed) amount of factors. A firm with better technology at home will offshore some tasks if the initial 
3:78:6285:12:12:91:545:496:10:Times:10:Times:B:wage gap is larger than the offshoring costs. Offshoring releases domestic workers who, under the traditional 
3:79:6395:12:12:91:545:484:10:Times:10:Times:B:neo-classical market assumptions, can focus on the tasks where they have a trade-cost-adjusted comparative 
3:80:6502:12:16:91:138:472:10:Times:10:Times:B:advantage. 
3:81:6513:16:12:91:545:456:10:Times:10:Times:B:When  some  factors  are  mobile  sectorally  and  internationally,  the  law  of  comparative  advantage  can  be 
3:82:6628:12:12:91:545:444:10:Times:10:Times:B:generalized,  albeit  analyzing  the  outcome  of  even  simple  normative  models  becomes  a  complex  matter, 
3:83:6741:12:12:91:545:432:10:Times:10:Times:B:particularly regarding the distributional effects. Comparative advantages are no more a robust predictor of a 
3:84:6851:12:12:91:545:420:10:Times:10:Times:B:country's   trade   pattern.   For   example,   reversal   of   comparative   advantages   is   possible   under   certain 
3:85:6974:12:12:91:545:408:10:Times:10:Times:B:assumptions. When factors are mobile, movement of factors between sectors and between countries that tend 
3:86:7080:12:12:91:545:396:10:Times:10:Times:B:to equalize endowments reduce the incentives to trade. The return of the mobile factor rises, while those of to 
3:87:7192:12:12:91:545:384:10:Times:10:Times:B:sector-specific factors decline. But if factor prices are not equalized, factor mobility will at contrary lead to 
3:88:7306:12:16:91:236:372:10:Times:10:Times:B:an increase in the volume of trade. 
3:89:7342:16:12:91:545:356:10:Times:10:Times:B:The new trade theory, by introducing imperfect competition, consumer preference for variety and economies 
3:90:7448:12:12:91:545:344:10:Times:10:Times:B:of  scale,  look  at  explaining  why  countries  that  are  similar  in  factor  endowment  and  technology,  have  a 
3:91:7566:12:12:91:544:332:10:Times:10:Times:B:significant  part  of  their  trade  in  the  same  industries.  When  two  such  identical  countries  open  up  to  trade, 
3:92:7691:12:12:91:544:320:10:Times:10:Times:B:firms  with  differentiated  products  gain  access  to  larger  markets  and  offer  more  choice  to  consumers.  But 
3:93:7811:12:16:91:465:308:10:Times:10:Times:B:because the total size of the market does not increase, some firms will go out of business.  
3:94:7904:16:12:91:545:292:10:Times:10:Times:B:A similar pattern can be used to model trade in intermediate goods, provided the cost of production is lower 
3:95:8013:12:12:91:544:280:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  larger  is  the  number  and  scale  of  production  of  intermediates.  If  trade  is  restricted,  the  domestic  firm 
3:96:8139:12:12:91:545:268:10:Times:10:Times:B:needs  to  use  outsourcing  to  realize  these  economies  of  scale  and  choice.  If  trade  is  free,  it  does  not  matter 
3:97:8268:12:12:91:545:256:10:Times:10:Times:B:where  the  production  of  intermediaries  is  located, and  the  firm  producing  the  final  good  uses  a  mix  of 
3:98:8386:12:17:91:208:244:10:Times:10:Times:B:outsourcing and offshoring.

3:101:8461:17:12:91:522:193:10:Times:10:Times:B:International  transmission  of  shocks  takes  usually two  forms,  commercial  and  financial.  In  previous 
3:102:8572:12:12:91:522:181:10:Times:10:Times:B:instances   of   global   crisis,   most   of   the   systemic   commercial   and   financial   shocks   where   of 
3:103:8688:12:12:91:522:169:10:Times:10:Times:B:macroeconomic  nature.  The  present  crisis  has  also  a  systemic  micro-economic  dimension,  because  of 
3:104:8798:12:12:91:522:157:10:Times:10:Times:B:the geographical segmentation of the productive chains. These effects are still largely unknown as they 
3:105:8902:12:12:91:525:145:10:Times:10:Times:B:affect  firms  that  are  eminently  "heterogeneous",  as  recognized  by  the  new  "new  trade  theory".  It  is  a 
3:106:9020:12:12:91:522:133:10:Times:10:Times:B:cliché  to  say  that  time  is  accelerating,  but  it  carries  a  lot  of  truth  in  the  present  situation.  In  the  race 
3:107:9149:12:11:91:522:121:10:Times:10:Times:B:between the practitioners –engineering and business schools– on the one had, and the university, on the 
3:108:9253:11:18:91:485:110:10:Times:10:Times:B:other hand, praxis is well ahead despite significant advances in the theoretical aspects (Box1).  
3:109:9351:18:12:91:522:92:10:Times:10:Times:B:Since  the  every-day  reality  of  international  business  models  is  running  faster  than  the  elaboration  of 
3:110:9467:12:12:91:522:80:10:Times:10:Times:B:new  analytical  paradigms,  the  crisis  hit  the  global  economy  in  largely  uncharted  waters.  Guided  by 
3:111:9580:12:12:91:522:68:10:Times:10:Times:B:"old" economic models, the major developed and developing economies, known as G-20, met head-on 
3:112:9676:12:0:91:524:56:10:Times:10:Times:B:the risk of a world-wide depression and coordinated global responses in the early months of 2009. The 
4:113:9779:0:11:91:522:714:10:Times:10:Times:B:package,  reminiscent  of  traditional  Keynesian  recipes,  addressed  principally  the  macro-economic 
4:114:9884:11:12:91:521:703:10:Times:10:Times:B:transmission  channels  through  massive  fiscal  stimulus.  With  the  risk  of  global  recession  diminishing 
4:115:9997:12:18:91:432:691:10:Times:10:Times:B:after the second quarter of 2009, the debate has now shifted to the exit strategies.  
4:116:10083:18:12:91:522:673:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  huge  fiscal  deficits  have  sustained  public  consumption  in  industrialized  countries,  but  private 
4:117:10195:12:12:91:522:661:10:Times:10:Times:B:consumption  and  investment  remains  depressed.  If  the  danger  of  inflation  seems  under  control, 
4:118:10301:12:11:91:522:649:10:Times:10:Times:B:rebalancing  the  current  account  imbalances  which  characterized  the  pre-crisis  period  would  create  an 
4:119:10414:11:12:91:522:638:10:Times:10:Times:B:additional  negative  shock,  as  high  spending  countries  would  have  to  increase  their  national  savings. 
4:120:10528:12:12:91:522:626:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  alternatives  medium-term  forecasts  range  from  "back-to-business-as-usual"  to  "deglobalization" 
4:121:10635:12:18:91:379:614:10:Times:10:Times:B:scenarios, producing an alphabetical string of V, U, L or W profiles.

4:123:10811:12:12:91:522:584:10:Times:10:Times:B:external  shocks  initiating  in  the  financial  sector.  In  the  process,  the  analysis  highlights  some  proc-
4:124:10927:12:12:91:522:572:10:Times:10:Times:B:cyclical  implications  of  financial  prudential  regulation  and  re-considers  the  issue  of  the  global

4:128:11089:12:12:91:522:499:10:Times:10:Times:B:Like in previous global financial crisis, the international banking system came to a "sudden stop" after 
4:129:11194:12:12:91:522:487:10:Times:10:Times:B:September  2008.  Two  aspects  were  nevertheless  original:  the  shock  emanated  from  the  largest  world 
4:130:11305:12:12:91:522:475:10:Times:10:Times:B:financial  centre  instead  of  initiating  in  developing  countries,  and  the  shocks  spread  very  quickly  and 
4:131:11421:12:12:91:522:463:10:Times:10:Times:B:almost  simultaneously  to  many  industrial  and  emerging  countries.  In  particular,  trade  reacted  very 
4:132:11532:12:12:91:522:451:10:Times:10:Times:B:strongly to the first signals of recession, and sectors were differently affected. The sectors most affected 
4:133:11641:12:12:91:522:439:10:Times:10:Times:B:by  the  recession  were  fuels  and  minerals  (due  to  a strong  price  effect),  and  machinery  and  transport 
4:134:11757:12:17:91:239:427:10:Times:10:Times:B:equipment (strong demand effect).  
4:135:11792:17:12:91:524:410:10:Times:10:Times:B:With  the  financial  crisis,  the  sectors  producing  consumer  durable  and  capital  goods  were  on  the  front 
4:136:11909:12:12:91:522:398:10:Times:10:Times:B:line, as demand for these products relies on credit. In turn, the lower industrial activity reversed brutally 
4:137:12019:12:12:91:522:386:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  trend  in  the  prices  of  key  primary  commodities,  which  had  been  rising  substantively  since  2003. 
4:138:12134:12:12:91:521:374:10:Times:10:Times:B:Between the third and the fourth quarter of 2008, the difference in growth rate is, respectively, 56 and 
4:139:12239:12:12:91:521:362:10:Times:10:Times:B:51 percentage points for iron and steel, and for minerals (Table 1). The collapse in trade mostly affected 
4:140:12346:12:12:91:525:350:10:Times:10:Times:B:merchandises;  except  the  financial  transactions,  the  commercial  services,  other  than  those  related  to 
4:141:12460:12:17:91:240:338:10:Times:10:Times:B:trade in goods, were more resilient. 
4:142:12497:17:12:91:525:321:10:Times:10:Times:B:Indeed, world trade dropped five times more rapidly than global GDP, supply chains playing their part 
4:143:12599:12:12:91:522:309:10:Times:10:Times:B:in  explaining  the  magnifying  effect  of  the  crisis  on  international  trade.  Some  of  the  mechanisms  are 
4:144:12715:12:12:91:524:297:10:Times:10:Times:B:purely of accounting nature: while GDP is computed on a net basis, exports and imports are registered 
4:145:12817:12:12:91:522:285:10:Times:10:Times:B:on  their  gross  value.  In  addition,  because  supply  chains  cover  various  countries,  a  lot  of  double 
4:146:12930:12:12:91:522:273:10:Times:10:Times:B:counting  takes  place  while  goods  for  processing  cross  the  borders  at  each  step  of  the  production 
4:147:13042:12:17:91:496:261:10:Times:10:Times:B:process. But the core of the explanation is to be found in the nature itself of the 2008-2009 crisis. 
4:148:13144:17:12:91:521:244:10:Times:10:Times:B:In  previous occurrences of  global turmoil,  shocks were mainly of macroeconomic nature. A recession 
4:149:13246:12:12:91:522:232:10:Times:10:Times:B:in  a  foreign  economy  reduced  demand  for  exports,  which  in  turn  depressed  the  activity  in  the  home 
4:150:13360:12:12:91:521:220:10:Times:10:Times:B:country.  The  propagation  of  such  demand-driven  shocks  through  the  productive  sectors  of  the  home 
4:151:13470:12:12:91:522:208:10:Times:10:Times:B:economy  can  be  traced  using  an  input-output  model, through  traditional  Input-Output  modeling.  In 
4:152:13578:12:12:91:521:196:10:Times:10:Times:B:addition,  both  financial  and  real  channels  are  interlinked  at  the  macro  level,  because  credit  crunch 
4:153:13693:12:0:91:317:184:10:Times:10:Times:B:affects household consumption and firms' investment.

5:170:14266:12:12:91:522:499:10:Times:10:Times:B:changed  this  traditional  mode  of  transmission,  and added  another  layer  of  transmitters  which  are 
5:171:14375:12:12:91:525:487:10:Times:10:Times:B:operating at micro economic level. When industrial production is spread across various countries, and 
5:172:14477:12:12:91:522:475:10:Times:10:Times:B:that all segments of the chain are critical (supplied constrained), a shock affecting one segment of the 
5:173:14582:12:12:91:522:463:10:Times:10:Times:B:chain will reverberate through all the chain. At the difference of the macro-economic case, shocks are 
5:174:14684:12:11:91:522:451:10:Times:10:Times:B:moving  forward,  from  supplier  to  clients,  and  not  backward  as  in  the  demand-driven  Leontief  model 
5:175:14796:11:18:91:199:440:10:Times:10:Times:B:(from client to suppliers). 
5:176:14824:18:12:91:522:422:10:Times:10:Times:B:Escaith and Gonguet (2009) (E-G09 thereafter) jointly models the financial and real supply-side effects 
5:177:14928:12:12:91:522:410:10:Times:10:Times:B:from a complementary viewpoint of monetary circuit and international Input-Output matrices. In order 
5:178:15029:12:12:91:522:398:10:Times:10:Times:B:to produce, individual firms need to obtain a loan from a bank. The bank grants the loan in relation to 
5:179:15133:12:12:91:522:386:10:Times:10:Times:B:three  parameters:  the  macroeconomic  context,  the  specific  behavior  of  the  sector  of  activity  in  the 
5:180:15247:12:17:91:506:374:10:Times:10:Times:B:business cycle, and the specific situation of the firm (credit rating, soundness of the management).   
5:181:15349:17:12:91:521:357:10:Times:10:Times:B: Money  created  by  the  bank  when  according  the  loan is  spent  by  the  firm  on  wages  and  other 
5:182:15456:12:12:91:525:345:10:Times:10:Times:B:production  costs.  The  money  remains  in  the  circuit as  long  as  the  firm  does  not  sell  the  products  and 
5:183:15575:12:12:91:522:333:10:Times:10:Times:B:reimburse the loan.  A traditional result of the endogenous money theory is that any increase in stock of 
5:184:15681:12:12:91:524:321:10:Times:10:Times:B:credit  money  corresponds  to  an  increase  in  inventories  in  the  national  account  circuit.  E-G09  adds  to 
5:185:15798:12:12:91:522:309:10:Times:10:Times:B:this classical building blocks 2 a late XXth century feature: the capital-asset adequacy ratio, a prudential 
5:186:15907:12:11:91:522:297:10:Times:10:Times:B:mechanism  –such  as  in  Basel  I  and  II–  set  by  the  authorities  and  designed  to  guarantee  liquidity  and 
5:187:16025:11:12:91:522:286:10:Times:10:Times:B:solvability  of  the  banking  sector.  At  the  difference  of  monetary  circuit  and  I-O  tables,  which  track 
5:188:16141:12:18:91:476:274:10:Times:10:Times:B:flows, the adequacy ratio is a stock variable reflecting the accumulation of loans and assets.  
5:189:16237:18:12:91:522:256:10:Times:10:Times:B:Under normal conditions, the ratio is not binding and the circuit is almost a pure flow model. Bank can 
5:190:16341:12:12:91:522:244:10:Times:10:Times:B:modulate  their  assets  to  accommodate  new  credits,  and  client  firms  can  shift  to  alternative  partners 
5:191:16456:12:11:91:522:232:10:Times:10:Times:B:when faced with the unexpected failure of one of their suppliers. But shifting to an alternative supplier, 
5:192:16563:11:12:91:522:221:10:Times:10:Times:B:when  decision  results  from  an  unexpected  event  (a  shock),  always  carries  a  cost.  The  transmission 
5:193:16675:12:12:91:522:209:10:Times:10:Times:B:across  sectors  and  countries  of  the  increased  cost of  production  is  modelled  by  E-G09  using  an 
5:194:16784:12:12:91:521:197:10:Times:10:Times:B:international  input-output  matrix  (a  set  of  interlinked  national  I-O  matrices),  rearranged  to  track 
5:195:16896:12:18:91:170:185:10:Times:10:Times:B:forward linkages.3 
5:196:16914:18:12:91:525:167:10:Times:10:Times:B:E-G09 computes an indicator, called "imported real supply-driven impact coefficient" (IRSIC), defined 
5:197:17016:12:23:91:108:155:10:Times:10:Times:B:as:  
5:198:17021:23:17:91:449:132:10:Times:10:Times:B:IRSIC = -Q.(I-B)-1 ● 1/Q         Eq. 1

5:200:17100:7:15:91:513:108:6:Times:9:Times:F:2     Even if endogenous money and sectoral modeling seems quite heterodox now-a-days, both monetary circuit 
5:201:17209:15:7:105:314:93:9:Times:9:Times:F:and supply-use tables can be traced to the Physiocrats.  
5:202:17266:7:15:91:514:86:6:Times:9:Times:F:3     In an international IO matrix (I-IO), cross-national transactions of intermediate goods are identified: exports 
5:203:17384:15:11:105:515:71:9:Times:9:Times:F:of intermediate consumption are separated from final demand and traced to the importing country and sector. 
5:204:17492:11:10:105:488:60:9:Times:9:Times:F:This provides a better definition of vertical network participation of the countries included in the I-IO, 
5:205:17599:10:0:105:362:50:9:Times:9:Times:F:allowing tracking shock transmission caused by vertical integration.

6:215:18185:12:18:91:394:602:10:Times:10:Times:B:USA, Japan, Korea and selected emerging Asian countries, indicate that: 
6:216:18257:18:12:125:522:584:10:Times:10:Times:A:1.  In  2000  and  2006,  Japan  is  the  largest  potential  exporter  of  supply  shocks,  because  it  is  a 
6:217:18369:12:17:111:363:572:10:Times:10:Times:A:large supplier of intermediate goods to the other economies. 
6:218:18430:17:12:125:522:555:10:Times:10:Times:A:2. Malaysia  and Thailand are the largest importers of such shocks, because of the high degree 
6:219:18525:12:12:111:522:543:10:Times:10:Times:A:of  integration  of  their  manufacturing  sectors  in  international  supply  chains  and  their  reliance  on 
6:220:18637:12:17:111:292:531:10:Times:10:Times:A:imported inputs rather than domestic ones.  
6:221:18681:17:12:125:522:514:10:Times:10:Times:A:3.  Between  2000  and  2006,  China  increased  notably  its  forward  international  linkages  and  its 
6:222:18787:12:12:111:521:502:10:Times:10:Times:A:domestic  backward  linkages.  It  became  a  large  exporter  of  "shocks"  in  2006,  at  par  with    Japan, 
6:223:18899:12:12:111:522:490:10:Times:10:Times:A:but   its   vulnerability   to   an   imported   shock   remained   relatively   stable   because   Chinese 
6:224:19007:12:18:111:369:478:10:Times:10:Times:A:manufacturers are increasingly relying on domestic suppliers. 
6:225:19069:18:12:125:522:460:10:Times:10:Times:A:4.  Repatriating  the  production  of  manufactured  parts  in  Japan  and  the  USA  would  lead  to  an 
6:226:19175:12:11:111:522:448:10:Times:10:Times:A:average increase in sectoral production costs of 2%. Albeit this seems a small impact, it should be 
6:227:19275:11:12:111:522:437:10:Times:10:Times:A:remembered  that  the  input-output  matrix  used  to  compute  the  coefficients  are  based  on  nation-
6:228:19381:12:12:111:522:425:10:Times:10:Times:A:wide  samples  of  enterprises.  For  these  developed  economies,  most  intermediate  consumption  is 
6:229:19485:12:12:111:521:413:10:Times:10:Times:A:sourced  domestically  and  only  a  minority  of  firms  actively  engage  in  outsourcing:  this  average 
6:230:19593:12:12:111:522:401:10:Times:10:Times:A:impact would fall disproportionately on a few firms, causing serious disruptions at microeconomic 
6:231:19691:12:12:111:522:389:10:Times:10:Times:A:level.  Because  these  outward  oriented  firms  are  also  the  most  dynamic  and  innovative  ones  in  a 
6:232:19801:12:17:111:512:377:10:Times:10:Times:A:given sector, these microeconomic disruptions would have significant negative systemic effects. 
6:233:19897:17:12:91:522:360:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  accumulation  of  micro-disruptions  in  the  productive  chain,  typical  of  a  recession,  disturbs  the 
6:234:20010:12:12:91:522:348:10:Times:10:Times:B:monetary  circuit:  production  plans  take  longer  to  be  completed,  leading  to  an  accumulation  of 
6:235:20117:12:12:91:522:336:10:Times:10:Times:B:outstanding loans and a reduction of the credit worthiness of firms. Under Basel II, banks have to adjust 
6:236:20223:12:12:91:521:324:10:Times:10:Times:B:their asset holding in order to compensate for the higher risk of their loan portfolio. This is not an issue 
6:237:20332:12:12:91:522:312:10:Times:10:Times:B:when financial markets are functioning normally, but in times of global crisis and flight to liquidity, not 
6:238:20440:12:17:91:481:300:10:Times:10:Times:B:only the risk profile of borrowers deteriorates, but also the market value of assets goes down.  
6:239:20537:17:12:91:522:283:10:Times:10:Times:B:Because assets are priced to market when evaluating the capital adequacy ratio, banks can rapidly been 
6:240:20639:12:12:91:522:271:10:Times:10:Times:B:squeezed  between  the  rising  risk-rating  of  their  debtors  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  shrinking  value  of

6:242:20858:12:12:91:522:247:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  circuit  unravels:  banks  run  for  safety,  stop  extending  new  credit  and  even  do  not  renew  existing 
6:243:20975:12:12:91:522:235:10:Times:10:Times:B:credit lines. The very same pro-cyclical mechanisms that led to the apparition of financial bubbles, with 
6:244:21081:12:12:91:522:223:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  concomitant  asset  price  inflation  and  lower  perception  to  risk  (meaning  lower  interest  rates  and 
6:245:21196:12:12:91:522:211:10:Times:10:Times:B:larger  volume of credit), can have  a  catastrophic outcome when  the trend is reversed and a resonance

6:248:21431:7:15:91:513:173:6:Times:9:Times:F:4     In a typical supply-use table, horizontal lines show the use of goods and services to supply other firms, final 
6:249:21549:15:11:105:488:158:9:Times:9:Times:F:consumers and rest of the world (exports). The vertical columns describe the requirements by sector j: 
6:250:21651:11:11:105:521:147:9:Times:9:Times:F:purchases from suppliers (domestic and rest of the world) needed to produce the goods, value added and taxes. 
6:251:21761:11:11:105:512:136:9:Times:9:Times:F:Inter-sectoral relationships are represented by the coefficients Qij. The technical coefficients conforming the 
6:252:21873:11:11:105:505:125:9:Times:9:Times:F:input-output matrix (I-O) are derived by normalizing the intermediate coefficients Qij by the value of total 
6:253:21982:11:10:105:484:114:9:Times:9:Times:F:production (aij= Qij/Qi). These I-O coefficients present the direct requirements of inputs from "i" for 
6:254:22086:10:11:105:505:104:9:Times:9:Times:F:producing one unit of output of industry "j". As in the Leontief case, the Ghosh matrix B is build using the 
6:255:22195:11:11:105:497:93:9:Times:9:Times:F:inter-sectoral transaction matrix Qij, but the allocation coefficients are normalized in line (destination of 
6:256:22305:11:11:105:520:82:9:Times:9:Times:F:output) by the value of production, and not in column as for technical coefficients (origin of productive factors 
6:257:22419:11:11:105:493:71:9:Times:9:Times:F:used in the production). The Ghosh matrices are similar to the Leontief demand-driven model, but their 
6:258:22521:11:10:105:516:60:9:Times:9:Times:F:theoretical robustness for modeling supply shock is much weaker. For this reason, E-G09 uses them only as a 
6:259:22629:10:0:105:185:50:9:Times:9:Times:F:tracking mechanism. 
7:260:22650:0:11:91:522:714:10:Times:10:Times:B:Moreover,  the  accumulation  of  supply  shocks  leads  to  secondary  demand-driven  adjustments,  either 
7:261:22758:11:12:91:522:703:10:Times:10:Times:B:through a price effect (increasing production costs translate into higher retail prices and lower demand) 
7:262:22864:12:12:91:522:691:10:Times:10:Times:B:or income effect (lower activity leading to unemployment). The succession of micro waves followed by 
7:263:22965:12:12:91:522:679:10:Times:10:Times:B:secondary macro shocks leads to a "W" crisis pattern and can be jointly modelled through international 
7:264:23067:12:12:91:521:667:10:Times:10:Times:B:I-O. IRSIC is well suited to model the secondary demand effects created by an increase in prices: after 
7:265:23171:12:12:91:522:655:10:Times:10:Times:B:adjusting  the  price  effect  by  their  respective  demand  elasticity,  E-G09  applies  a  traditional  Leontief 
7:266:23286:12:12:91:522:643:10:Times:10:Times:B:model  to  the  international  input-output  matrix.  But  a  similar  reasoning  can  be  applied  to  a  demand

7:291:24161:18:12:91:522:172:10:Times:10:Times:B:Various  authors  attribute  the  large  drop  in  trade  registered  since  the  end  of  2008,  with  an  apparent 
7:292:24278:12:12:91:521:160:10:Times:10:Times:B:trade-GDP  elasticity  close  to  5,  to  the  leverage  effect  induced  by  the  geographical  fragmentation  of 
7:293:24393:12:12:91:524:148:10:Times:10:Times:B:production (Tanaka, 2009; Yi, 2009). Others contest the hypothesis of higher demand elasticity due to 
7:294:24495:12:12:91:521:136:10:Times:10:Times:B:vertical integration (Benassy-Queré et al., 2009) because it affects only the relative volume of trade in 
7:295:24601:12:11:91:522:124:10:Times:10:Times:B:relation to GDP, while elasticity should remain constant in a general equilibrium context. It is probable 
7:296:24707:11:12:91:522:113:10:Times:10:Times:B:that  the observed  reality  lays  somewhere  in-between  the  variable  trade  elasticity  hypothesis  and  the 
7:297:24820:12:0:91:151:101:10:Times:10:Times:B:constant one.  
8:298:24836:0:11:91:288:714:10:Times:10:Times:B:As  seen  in Figure  2,  the world  trade  elasticity 
8:299:24890:11:12:91:288:703:10:Times:10:Times:B:is  shaped  like  an  inversed  "U",  increasing  at 
8:300:24943:12:12:91:288:691:10:Times:10:Times:B:the end of the 1980s and decreasing in the most 
8:301:24991:12:12:91:288:679:10:Times:10:Times:B:recent  years.  Because  elasticity  should  indeed 
8:302:25043:12:12:91:288:667:10:Times:10:Times:B:remain constant in an equilibrium context, this 
8:303:25091:12:12:91:288:655:10:Times:10:Times:B:humped  shape  probably  signals  a  long-term 
8:304:25138:12:17:91:284:643:10:Times:10:Times:B:transition from one steady state to a new one.  
8:305:25186:17:12:91:292:626:10:Times:10:Times:B:Short-term   shocks   can   also   affect apparent 
8:306:25236:12:12:91:288:614:10:Times:10:Times:B:elasticity,  even  in  presence  of  stable  structural 
8:307:25292:12:12:91:288:602:10:Times:10:Times:B:relationships.  These  short-term  variations  are 
8:308:25343:12:12:91:288:590:10:Times:10:Times:B:to  be  expected  when  external  shocks  do  not 
8:309:25393:12:12:91:288:578:10:Times:10:Times:B:apply  uniformly  to  all  industries.  A  negative 
8:310:25445:12:12:91:288:566:10:Times:10:Times:B:shock  suffered  by  a  single  sector  with  high 
8:311:25496:12:12:91:288:554:10:Times:10:Times:B:reliance    on    imported    input    will    initially 
8:312:25553:12:12:91:288:542:10:Times:10:Times:B:translate  into  a  higher  change  in  trade  than  in 
8:313:25609:12:17:91:256:530:10:Times:10:Times:B:total GDP, leading to higher elasticity.

8:326:26334:18:12:91:510:345:10:Times:10:Times:B:Similarly, changes in total production caused by the demand shock (including the intermediate inputs 
8:327:26435:12:24:91:316:333:10:Times:10:Times:B:required to produce the final goods) is obtained from: 
8:328:26490:24:23:91:383:309:10:Symbol:10:Times:B:∆Q = u. A. ∆Q + ∆D      Eq. 3 
8:329:26515:23:24:91:273:286:10:Times:10:Times:B:Solving for ∆Q yields the traditional result: 
8:330:26561:24:24:91:383:262:10:Symbol:10:Times:B:∆Q = u. (I-A)-1 . ∆D      Eq. 4 
8:331:26587:24:12:91:518:238:10:Times:10:Times:B:The comparison between equations 2 and 4 is illustrative. Since [M°. (I-A)-1] is a linear combination of 
8:332:26692:12:19:91:317:226:10:Times:10:Times:B:fixed coefficients, the ratio (∆MIC / ∆Q) is a constant.  
8:333:26750:19:11:91:522:207:10:Times:10:Times:B:Nevertheless, this tells only part of the story, because the initial shock ∆D is not a scalar, but a vector (s 
8:334:26861:11:12:91:522:196:9:Times:10:Times:B:x 1), and the individual  shocks  affecting  each  sector  do not need to be  always in the same proportion 
8:335:26969:12:12:91:522:184:10:Times:10:Times:B:from  one  year  to  another  one.  As  the  sectoral  import  requirements  [M°s]  differ  from  sector  to  sector, 
8:336:27087:12:25:91:504:172:10:Times:10:Times:B:then the apparent import elasticity will change according to the sectoral distribution of the shock.  7

8:338:27238:7:15:91:500:140:6:Times:9:Times:F:5    The model can be extended easily to the case of "n" countries, as in E-G09 by modifying accordingly the 
8:339:27347:15:11:105:94:125:9:Times:6:Times:F:summation vector "u". 6
8:340:27370:11:10:94:504:114:9:Times:9:Times:F:    In this traditional IO framework considering one country and the rest of the world, exports of intermediate 
8:341:27482:10:11:105:479:104:9:Times:9:Times:F:goods are considered as being part of the final demand. The situation differs when extending the IO 
8:342:27582:11:7:105:471:93:9:Times:9:Times:F:relationship to include international transactions of intermediate consumptions, as in equation 1.  
8:343:27682:7:15:91:505:86:6:Times:9:Times:F:7    The more complex the production process, the more potential for gaining in outsourcing part of it (Box 1); 
8:344:27794:15:11:105:484:71:9:Times:9:Times:F:thus it is natural to expect much more vertical integration in the manufacturing sector. Miroudot and 
8:345:27896:11:10:105:508:60:9:Times:9:Times:F:Ragoussis (2009) shows that manufacturing sectors in OECD countries generally use more imported inputs 
8:346:27998:10:0:105:522:50:9:Times:9:Times:F:than other industrial and services sectors. It is specially the case for final consumer goods like ‘motor vehicles’

9:361:28427:0:11:91:525:714:10:Times:10:Times:B:It  was  in  particular  the  case  after  the  financial  crisis  of  September  2008,  as  the  demand  of  consumer 
9:362:28546:11:12:91:522:703:10:Times:10:Times:B:durable  and  investment  goods  (consumer  electronics,  automobile  and  transport  equipment,  office 
9:363:28651:12:12:91:522:691:10:Times:10:Times:B:equipment  and  computers,  etc.)  was  particularly  affected  by  the  sudden  stop  in bank  credits.  Because 
9:364:28765:12:12:91:522:679:10:Times:10:Times:B:these  sectors  are  also  vertically  integrated,  the  impact  on  international  trade  in  intermediate  and  final 
9:365:28885:12:12:91:522:667:10:Times:10:Times:B:goods  was  high.  And  because  services  sectors,  which  are  the  main  contributors  to  GDP  in  developed 
9:366:28998:12:12:91:522:655:10:Times:10:Times:B:countries,  were  also  more  resilient  to  the  financial  crisis  contribute,  the  drop  in  imports  was  much 
9:367:29114:12:12:91:522:643:10:Times:10:Times:B:higher than the drop in GDP.  Thus, in the initial phase of the financial crisis, the apparent Trade-GDP

9:374:29500:12:11:91:522:258:10:Times:10:Times:B:When the initial shock reverberates through the rest of the economy, transforming the global financial 
9:375:29602:11:12:91:522:247:10:Times:10:Times:B:crisis into a great recession, GDP will continue to slow down; meanwhile, the rate of decrease in trade 
9:376:29706:12:12:91:522:235:10:Times:10:Times:B:will  tend  to  stabilise   as   the   import   content   of  services   sectors  is   much   lower   than   those   of 
9:377:29826:12:12:91:522:223:10:Times:10:Times:B:manufacturing sectors.  As can be seen in Figure 3, there is a negative correlation between the variation 
9:378:29932:12:12:91:522:211:10:Times:10:Times:B:in  the  volume  of  production  of  goods  and  the  growth  in  total  GDP  that  can  be  attributed,  at  least 
9:379:30048:12:12:91:525:199:10:Times:10:Times:B:partially,  to  this  lag  effect  between  goods  and  services.  It  is  thus  normal  to  expect  a  regression  to 
9:380:30167:12:104:91:267:187:10:Times:10:Times:B:normality of the trade elasticity for 2010.

9:383:30467:11:10:105:501:60:9:Times:9:Times:F:integrated into the world economy. But even these activities show an upward trend in the use of imported

10:403:30920:18:12:91:522:696:10:Times:10:Times:B:But  recent  changes  in  the apparent  trade  elasticity  are  also  probably  linked  to  global  supply  chain 
10:404:31034:12:12:91:522:684:10:Times:10:Times:B:management  practices.  Even  under  "just-in-time"  management  (production-to-order),  geographically 
10:405:31138:12:11:91:522:672:10:Times:10:Times:B:fragmented networks need to maintain a minimum level of inventories (buffer stocks) in order to face 
10:406:31239:11:12:91:522:661:10:Times:10:Times:B:the usual risks attached to international transportation. While large players try to keep their inventories 
10:407:31347:12:12:91:522:649:10:Times:10:Times:B:at  the  lowest  possible  level  considering  their  sales  plans  and  the  acceptable  level  of risk, they  tend  in 
10:408:31468:12:12:91:522:637:10:Times:10:Times:B:the same time to force their suppliers to maintain large stocks (production-to-stock) in order to be able 
10:409:31574:12:12:91:522:625:10:Times:10:Times:B:to  supply  them  quickly  upon  request.  In  addition,  some  up-stream  suppliers,  engaged  in  highly 
10:410:31681:12:12:91:522:613:10:Times:10:Times:B:capitalistic  processes  such  as  foundries,  need  to  process  large  batches  in  order  to  benefit  from 
10:411:31792:12:17:91:287:601:10:Times:10:Times:B:economies of scale and lower their unit costs.   
10:412:31841:17:12:91:522:584:10:Times:10:Times:B:As a result, there is always a significant level of inventories in a global supply chain, translating into a 
10:413:31950:12:12:91:522:572:10:Times:10:Times:B:higher demand for banking loans (Escaith and Gonguet, 2009). When  a drop in final demand reduces 
10:414:32048:12:12:91:522:560:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  activity  of  down-stream  firms,  or/and  when  they  face  a  credit  crunch,  their  first  reaction  is  to  run 
10:415:32170:12:12:91:522:548:10:Times:10:Times:B:down their inventories.   Thus,  a  slow-down in activity transforms itself  into a complete stand-still for 
10:416:32279:12:12:91:522:536:10:Times:10:Times:B:the supplying firms that are located up-stream. These amplified fluctuations in ordering and inventory 
10:417:32381:12:12:91:522:524:10:Times:10:Times:B:levels  result  in  what  is  known  as  "bullwhip  effect"  in  the  management  of  production-distribution 
10:418:32491:12:12:91:522:512:10:Times:10:Times:B:systems  (Stadtler,  2008).  As  long  as  the  down-stream  inventories  have  not  been  reduced  to  their  new 
10:419:32606:12:12:91:521:500:10:Times:10:Times:B:optimum level, suppliers are facing a sudden stop in their activity and must reduce their labour force or 
10:420:32712:12:17:91:157:488:10:Times:10:Times:B:keep them idle. 
10:421:32728:17:12:91:522:471:10:Times:10:Times:B:The timing  and intensity of  the international transmission of supply shock may  differ from traditional 
10:422:32833:12:12:91:522:459:10:Times:10:Times:B:demand  shocks  applying  on  final  goods.  For  example,  the  transmission  index  proposed  by  E-G09 
10:423:32939:12:12:91:522:447:10:Times:10:Times:B:implicitly   assumes   that   all   secondary   effects   captured   by   the   Ghosh   inverse   matrix   occur 
10:424:33052:12:12:91:522:435:10:Times:10:Times:B:simultaneously,  while  these  effects  may  propagate  more  slowly  than  traditional  final  demand  shocks 
10:425:33163:12:12:91:522:423:10:Times:10:Times:B:depending on the length of the production chain.  Also, there might be contractual pre-commitments for 
10:426:33265:12:12:91:522:411:10:Times:10:Times:B:the order of parts and material that manufacturers have to place well in advance in order to secure just-
10:427:33370:12:11:91:522:399:10:Times:10:Times:B:in-time delivery in accordance to their production plans (Uchida and Inomata, 2009).  Indeed, since the 
10:428:33474:11:12:91:522:388:10:Times:10:Times:B:1990s, in high-tech manufacturing, suppliers are no more minor partners in global supply chains. These 
10:429:33576:12:12:91:522:376:10:Times:10:Times:B:suppliers have consolidated, taking a more prominent role in the industry through a process of mergers 
10:430:33678:12:12:91:522:364:10:Times:10:Times:B:and  acquisitions  (Sturgeon  and  Van  Biesebroeck,  2009).    Lynn (2009)  provides  an  example  from  the 
10:431:33787:12:12:91:522:352:10:Times:10:Times:B:US automobile industry where key suppliers of parts  had a quasi-monopolistic position and were able 
10:432:33888:12:17:91:390:340:10:Times:10:Times:B:to impose their terms to the up-stream firms (automobile constructors).  
10:433:33961:17:12:91:522:323:10:Times:10:Times:B:Nevertheless,  in  closely  integrated  networks,  these  mitigating  effects  are  probably  reduced,  especially 
10:434:34076:12:12:91:522:311:10:Times:10:Times:B:when  the  initial  shock  is  large.  A  sudden  stop  in  final  demand  is  expected  to  reverberate  quickly 
10:435:34190:12:12:91:522:299:10:Times:10:Times:B:thorough the supply chain, as firms run-down their inventories in order to adjust to persistent changes 
10:436:34294:12:12:91:522:287:10:Times:10:Times:B:in  their  market.    This  inventory  effect  magnifies  demand  shocks  and  is  principally  to  blame  for  the 
10:437:34410:12:12:91:522:275:10:Times:10:Times:B:initial collapse of trade in manufacture that characterised the world economy from September 2008 to 
10:438:34511:12:18:91:141:263:10:Times:10:Times:B:June 2009.  
10:439:34523:18:11:91:522:245:10:Times:10:Times:B:Dvorak  (2009),  reporting  on  the  exposition  of  the  electronic  equipment  sector  during  the  crisis, 
10:440:34633:11:12:91:522:234:10:Times:10:Times:B:mentions that a fall in consumer purchase of 8% reverberated into a 10% drop in shipments of the final 
10:441:34735:12:12:91:522:222:10:Times:10:Times:B:good and a 20% reduction in shipments of the chips that go into the product. The velocity of the cuts, 
10:442:34837:12:12:91:522:210:10:Times:10:Times:B:according to operators, was much faster than in previous slumps, as reordering is now done on a weekly 
10:443:34939:12:12:91:522:198:10:Times:10:Times:B:basis,  instead  of  the  monthly  or  quarterly  schedules  that  prevailed  up  to  the  early  2000s.  In  addition, 
10:444:35059:12:12:91:522:186:10:Times:10:Times:B:previously,  supply  chains  were  simpler,  involving  fewer  links;  the  complexity  of  today's  productive 
10:445:35171:12:12:91:522:174:10:Times:10:Times:B:networks makes their management much more complex. When faced with an unprecedented crisis such 
10:446:35267:12:12:91:521:162:10:Times:10:Times:B:as  the  September  2008  one,  “everybody  under-bet  to a  certain  extent”,  with  forwards  and  backwards 
10:447:35378:12:11:91:521:150:10:Times:10:Times:B:ricocheting  effects  through  the  supply  chain,  affecting  in  turn  investment  plans  and  capital  goods 
10:448:35490:11:18:91:140:139:10:Times:10:Times:B:providers.   
10:449:35503:18:12:91:525:121:10:Times:10:Times:B:Because the reactivation of the supply chain is only gradual, and final demand (household consumption 
10:450:35605:12:12:91:522:109:10:Times:10:Times:B:and firm's investment) has been reduced because of higher unemployment and increased risk aversion, 
10:451:35705:12:12:91:522:97:10:Times:10:Times:B:the road to recovery can be a slow and bumpy one. This leads us to the last section of this article: the 
10:452:35810:12:61:91:332:85:10:Times:10:Times:B:future of global supply chains in the post-crisis scenarios.

11:455:35913:16:11:91:525:696:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  debate  on  the  role  of  vertical  specialization  in  shaping  globalization  and  international  trade  is 
11:456:36029:11:12:91:522:685:10:Times:10:Times:B:central  for  understanding  the  present  crisis,  but  even  more  crucial  for  analysing  alternative  exit 
11:457:36141:12:12:91:521:673:10:Times:10:Times:B:scenarios.  In  the  second  half  of  2009,  there  were  signs  that  the  crisis  was  reaching  a  bottom.  But 
11:458:36257:12:12:91:522:661:10:Times:10:Times:B:analysts remained divided on the medium-run prospects, offering a menu of alphabetical potages made 
11:459:36357:12:12:91:521:649:10:Times:10:Times:B:of  L, U, V and Ws. The last three scenarios are roughly based on a return to normal, after a period of 
11:460:36461:12:12:91:522:637:10:Times:10:Times:B:recession  that  could  be  short  (V),  long  (U)  or  bumpy  (W).  The  L  scenario  is  more  pessimistic  for 
11:461:36575:12:12:91:522:625:10:Times:10:Times:B:international trade, as it involves a lasting deterioration from the high levels of globalization registered 
11:462:36684:12:17:91:228:613:10:Times:10:Times:B:during the 1990s and the 2000s.  
11:463:36717:17:12:91:524:596:10:Times:10:Times:B:After  the collapse of world trade  in 2008-2009, and with the  rise of  murky protectionism as well as a 
11:464:36823:12:12:91:522:584:10:Times:10:Times:B:higher risk aversion after the crisis, the risk is that manufacturers abandon global strategies to repatriate 
11:465:36933:12:12:91:522:572:10:Times:10:Times:B:their operations domestically, or maintain them within a closer regional perspective. The globalization 
11:466:37037:12:12:91:521:560:10:Times:10:Times:B:process may  effectively be expected to slow  down  in the years  to  come. A  September 2009 report  by 
11:467:37142:12:12:91:522:548:10:Times:10:Times:B:OECD,  UNCTAD  and  WTO  prepared  before  G-20  leaders  meet  in  Pittsburgh  states  that  as  most 
11:468:37245:12:12:91:521:536:10:Times:10:Times:B:leading  economies  have  invoked  "trade  defence  mechanisms"  to  weather  the  downturn,  and  the 
11:469:37348:12:12:91:522:524:10:Times:10:Times:B:growing unemployment due to the crisis will also continue to fuel protectionist pressures for the years 
11:470:37452:12:11:91:522:512:10:Times:10:Times:B:to come. 8 Analysts  are also  concerned  about longer term developments, fearing that the  West-to-East 
11:471:37557:11:12:91:522:501:10:Times:10:Times:B:repositioning of the world trade gravity centre may spur a series of "buy domestic" and "produce where 
11:472:37659:12:12:91:522:489:10:Times:10:Times:B:you  sell"  pressures,  leading  to  renewed  trade  and  investment  confrontations  and  an  increase  in 
11:473:37767:12:18:91:153:477:10:Times:10:Times:B:protectionism. 
11:474:37782:18:12:91:525:459:10:Times:10:Times:B:This  outcome  would  have  dire  consequences  on  global  value  chains,  and  the  related  international 
11:475:37891:12:12:91:522:447:10:Times:10:Times:B:production  networks. 9  Indeed,  supply  chains  are  very  sensitive  to  even  small  increase  in  transaction 
11:476:38006:12:11:91:525:435:10:Times:10:Times:B:costs,  be  they  caused  by  higher  tariffs  or  oil  prices.  A  series  of  not-so-anecdotic  evidences  tend  to 
11:477:38124:11:12:91:522:424:10:Times:10:Times:B:support  this  hypothesis.  In  August  2009,  the  head  of  Ernst  &  Young's  supply  chains  department 
11:478:38232:12:12:91:522:412:10:Times:10:Times:B:declared  that  regulatory  changes  and  also  the  downturn  are  forcing  many  organizations  to  consider 
11:479:38343:12:12:91:522:400:10:Times:10:Times:B:restructuring their supply chains, leading to smaller and more regional supply chains (Financial Times, 
11:480:38447:12:18:91:161:388:10:Times:10:Times:B:9 August 2009). 
11:481:38463:18:11:91:524:370:10:Times:10:Times:B:This  deglobalization  is  not  only  linked  to  the  present  crisis  situation,  but  may  be  more  structurally 
11:482:38580:11:12:91:525:359:10:Times:10:Times:B:caused  by  the  difficulties  of  decentralizing  increasingly  complex  industrial  procedures.  For  example, 
11:483:38693:12:12:91:522:347:10:Times:10:Times:B:after  an  accumulation  of  delays,  and  confronted  with  a  series  of  difficulties  in  the  production  of  its 
11:484:38811:12:12:91:522:335:10:Times:10:Times:B:latest  model,  Boeing  decided  to  abandon  the  original  fragmented  chain  and  repatriate  key  production 
11:485:38924:12:12:91:522:323:10:Times:10:Times:B:processes  in  its  main  establishments.  Differentiated  regional  markets,  as  well  as  political  pressure  to 
11:486:39041:12:12:91:522:311:10:Times:10:Times:B:voluntarily restrict exports and “build where they sell” have also encourage automobile constructers to 
11:487:39145:12:12:91:522:299:10:Times:10:Times:B:relocate  their  final  assembly  closer  to  their  final  markets,  keeping  only  the  heavy  engineering  work

11:489:39313:17:12:91:522:270:10:Times:10:Times:B:Other structural factors are also at work, which may increase transaction costs and push global firms to 
11:490:39418:12:12:91:522:258:10:Times:10:Times:B:reconsider  their  production  networks.  Since  2003,  oil  price  has  been  increasing,  reflecting, inter  alia, 
11:491:39535:12:12:91:525:246:10:Times:10:Times:B:the additional demand coming from large emerging countries. This trend is probably installed for some 
11:492:39637:12:12:91:522:234:10:Times:10:Times:B:time now, and production mangers will have to adapt to a future where energy is more  expensive and 
11:493:39737:12:12:91:521:222:10:Times:10:Times:B:less plentifully available. The same structural factors that led to an increase in the consumption of fossil 
11:494:39846:12:12:91:522:210:10:Times:10:Times:B:fuels are also causing a change in the perception of businesses, consumers, and policy makers.  Indeed, 
11:495:39950:12:12:91:522:198:10:Times:10:Times:B:carbon footprints (accumulated CO2 emissions) have become increasingly associated with supply chain 
11:496:40050:12:11:91:522:186:10:Times:10:Times:B:or through the life-cycle of a product. Using input-output matrices, He r t w i c h a n d  G l e n p (2009)

11:499:40375:12:12:91:521:151:10:Times:10:Times:B:global  warming  increases,  purchasing  managers  are  concerned  about  the  carbon  footprint  of  their 
11:500:40483:12:12:91:521:139:10:Times:10:Times:B:supply  chains, while consumers  are  increasingly offered carbon-labelled products  and economists talk 
11:501:40588:12:17:91:522:127:10:Times:10:Times:B:about  internalizing  environment  costs  through  ad  hoc  consumption  taxes.  As  these  trends  accentuate,

11:504:40817:14:16:91:508:87:8:Times:9:Times:F:9 Global value chains include the conception and marketing aspects of the products, and are sensitive to risk of 
11:505:40930:16:11:105:511:71:9:Times:9:Times:F:breaches in intellectual property and patents; their production component (the supply chains) are also highly 
11:506:41040:11:10:105:518:60:9:Times:9:Times:F:sensitive to international and cross-border transaction costs as the goods for processing typically cross several 
11:507:41154:10:26:105:204:50:9:Times:9:Times:F:border during production. 
12:508:41181:26:0:518:526:24:11:Times:11:Times:C:1 
12:509:41182:0:17:91:515:714:10:Times:10:Times:B:there will be a natural tendency to shorten global supply rely more on regional or domestic networks.  
12:510:41284:17:12:91:522:697:10:Times:10:Times:B:If  this  trend  is  confirmed,  this  underlying  deglobalization  process  would  hinder  the  medium-term 
12:511:41393:12:12:91:522:685:10:Times:10:Times:B:possibilities of recovery for international trade at its pre-crisis level. Because the most dynamic markets 
12:512:41501:12:12:91:522:673:10:Times:10:Times:B:are  in  emerging  countries,  a  regionalization  or  a  repatriation  of  global  supply  chain  would  negatively 
12:513:41617:12:12:91:524:661:10:Times:10:Times:B:affect developed countries' exports of intermediate goods, slowing down their recovery and augmenting 
12:514:41719:12:11:91:521:649:10:Times:10:Times:B:the risk for an L shaped exit pattern. But because global supply chains are a source of efficiency gains 
12:515:41824:11:12:91:524:638:10:Times:10:Times:B:and technical  progress diffusion (see Box 1  again), even emerging  countries  would see their potential 
12:516:41930:12:18:91:225:626:10:Times:10:Times:B:growth reduced in the process.   
12:517:41963:18:12:91:521:608:10:Times:10:Times:B:More importantly, it may also deprive the poorest developing countries, located far from established or 
12:518:42067:12:12:91:522:596:10:Times:10:Times:B:emerging  markets,  of  the  opportunities  of  following  the  industrialization  path  taken  by  China  or 
12:519:42177:12:12:91:522:584:10:Times:10:Times:B:Mexico, a powerful strategy for frog-leaping through the Rostovian take-off model by attracting foreign 
12:520:42281:12:12:91:524:572:10:Times:10:Times:B:direct  investment, creating  large  volume of manufacturing  jobs  and transferring technologies (Box 2). 
12:521:42388:12:11:91:521:560:10:Times:10:Times:B:Thus the micro-economic debate on the future of global supply chains spills over very critical trade and 
12:522:42493:11:18:91:179:549:10:Times:10:Times:B:development issues.  
12:523:42514:18:12:91:522:531:10:Times:10:Times:B:Yet,  against  this  pessimistic  outcome,  many  considerations  militate  in  favour  of  productive  network 
12:524:42626:12:12:91:521:519:10:Times:10:Times:B:continuing  to  extend  their  global  reach.  In  the  short  run,  abandoning  the  present  global  network  of 
12:525:42741:12:12:91:522:507:10:Times:10:Times:B:suppliers carries  a heavy  cost for the multinational firms.   Off-shoring has been  a central  objective of 
12:526:42851:12:11:91:522:495:10:Times:10:Times:B:many key industries, which heavily invested in their international network. Often, the new plants build 
12:527:42955:11:12:91:522:484:10:Times:10:Times:B:off-shore are more modern and efficient than the older domestic ones, and selling them to a competitor 
12:528:43057:12:18:91:483:472:10:Times:10:Times:B:would create a comparative disadvantage (remember the dilemma of GM when selling Opel).  
12:529:43146:18:12:91:522:454:10:Times:10:Times:B:In  the  longer  run,  the  constant  flow  of innovations  and  the  extension  of  the  technological  frontier  are 
12:530:43265:12:12:91:522:442:10:Times:10:Times:B:lowering  the  cost  of  communication  and  creating  new  opportunities  for  redesigning  the  international

12:532:43398:19:18:91:412:411:11:Times:11:Times:C:Box 2. Global Supply Chains, Industrialization  and Development  
12:533:43463:18:12:91:522:393:10:Times:10:Times:B:There  is  a  heated  debate,  reminiscent  of  the  1970s controversies  about  the  role  of  trans-national 
12:534:43574:12:12:91:522:381:10:Times:10:Times:B:corporations,  between  the  liberal  and  the  heterodox  schools  on  the  role  of  global  supply  chains  in 
12:535:43688:12:12:91:522:369:10:Times:10:Times:B:fostering  industrialization  or,  at  the  contrary,  causing  "inmisering  growth",  low  labour  standards  and 
12:536:43802:12:17:91:172:357:10:Times:10:Times:B:more informality.   
12:537:43822:17:12:91:522:340:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  establishment  of  export  processing  zones  (EPZs)  in  developing  countries  and  their  success  in 
12:538:43932:12:12:91:524:328:10:Times:10:Times:B:attracting  foreign  direct  investment  have  usually  been  balanced  by  a  bias  towards  a  low  qualification 
12:539:44048:12:12:91:522:316:10:Times:10:Times:B:and  low  salary  profile  for  their  employees.  Because  the  establishments  in  EPzs  in  least  advanced 
12:540:44159:12:12:91:522:304:10:Times:10:Times:B:countries  are  predominantly  labour  intensive  and  foot-loose  industries  (e.g.,  apparel  and  garments), 
12:541:44271:12:12:91:521:292:10:Times:10:Times:B:critics  to  an  industrial  strategy  based  on  processing  industries  point  to  (i)  their  lack  of  backward  and 
12:542:44392:12:12:91:522:280:10:Times:10:Times:B:forward linkages with other domestic industries; (ii) their reliance on informal markets to lower labour 
12:543:44497:12:11:91:522:268:10:Times:10:Times:B:costs; and (iii) their sensitivity to conjunctural downturns. Partial field data from Asian countries on the 
12:544:44606:11:12:91:522:257:10:Times:10:Times:B:impact  of  the  crisis  show  declines  in  both  average working  hours  and  average  earnings,  especially  in 
12:545:44721:12:12:91:521:245:10:Times:10:Times:B:footwear and furniture industries. In addition, it seems that the crisis hurts more the formal sector, while 
12:546:44830:12:18:91:484:233:10:Times:10:Times:B:the informal sector saw increases in average working hours (Hurst, Buttle and Sandars, 2009). 
12:547:44924:18:12:91:522:215:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  controversy  is  partially  based  on  an  erroneous supposition  that  inward  oriented  (domestically 
12:548:45033:12:12:91:522:203:10:Times:10:Times:B:integrated)  and  outward  oriented  (globally  connected  to  supply  chains)  industrialization  processes  are 
12:549:45146:12:12:91:521:191:10:Times:10:Times:B:mutually exclusive forms of industrialization for developing countries. It needs not being so as capital 
12:550:45251:12:11:91:522:179:10:Times:10:Times:B:and  skill  requirements  are  quite  different,  especially  at  the  earliest  stages  of  the  export-processing 
12:551:45366:11:18:91:166:168:10:Times:10:Times:B:industrialization.  
12:552:45386:18:12:91:522:150:10:Times:10:Times:B:Bacchetta,  Bustamente  and  Ernst  (2009)  indicates  that  EPZs  actually  compete  more  with  informal 
12:553:45493:12:12:91:522:138:10:Times:10:Times:B:activities  than  established  national  industries,  "offering  better,  more  stable  employment  opportunities 
12:554:45607:12:12:91:522:126:10:Times:10:Times:B:for  those  previously  working  in  the  informal  economy"  (p.111).  Using  the  tools  of  structural 
12:555:45713:12:12:91:522:114:10:Times:10:Times:B:economics,   Escaith   (2007)   shows   also   that   outward-oriented   Asian   economies,   which   inserted 
12:556:45824:12:11:91:521:102:10:Times:10:Times:B:themselves  actively  in  global  supply  chains,  were  able  to  successfully  absorb  their  growing  active 
12:557:45936:11:12:91:522:91:10:Times:10:Times:B:population, while the more domestic based manufactures in Latin American countries could not provide 
12:558:46037:12:12:91:522:79:10:Times:10:Times:B:enough  formal  jobs  in  the  manufacturing  sectors  to the  new  entrants,  pushing  them  instead  into  a 
12:559:46148:12:43:91:259:67:10:Times:10:Times:B:growing urban informal service sector.

13:562:46227:16:11:91:522:696:10:Times:10:Times:B:During  the  1990s,  large  trade  imbalances  developed in  several  regions  of  the  world,  with  the  US 
13:563:46337:11:12:91:522:685:10:Times:10:Times:B:running  persistent  deficits  while  Japan,  Germany  and  later  China,  running  surpluses.  Many  trust  that 
13:564:46451:12:12:91:521:673:10:Times:10:Times:B:these  imbalances,  financed  by  an  increase  in  US  liabilities,  created  a  persistent  situation  of  financial 
13:565:46570:12:12:91:522:661:10:Times:10:Times:B:distortion  that      led  to  the September  2008  crisis.  Rebalancing  is  therefore  a  key  objective  in  the  exit 
13:566:46692:12:12:91:522:649:10:Times:10:Times:B:strategy, while many fears that such a rebalancing might lead to a secondary demand shock, fragilizing 
13:567:46794:12:12:91:522:637:10:Times:10:Times:B:further  the  international  financial  system  as  such correction  could  only  be  possible  thanks  to  a  large 
13:568:46910:12:12:91:522:625:10:Times:10:Times:B:correction in the bilateral exchange rates of  concerned countries.  From  a macroeconomic  perspective, 
13:569:47015:12:12:91:525:613:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  rebalancing  can  be  analysed  from  several  angles;  the  present  section  will  focus  on  two  particular 
13:570:47132:12:18:91:337:601:10:Times:10:Times:B:aspects: balance of payments and global effective demand. 
13:571:47190:18:17:108:215:583:10:Symbol:10:Times:A:• Balance of Payments 
13:572:47211:17:12:91:522:566:10:Times:10:Times:B:The role of supply chains in amplifying trade flows should prove some kind of blessing when it comes 
13:573:47312:12:12:91:522:554:10:Times:10:Times:B:to redress the "global imbalances", particularly the large trade deficit of the US economy. A back-of-the 
13:574:47418:12:12:91:522:542:10:Times:10:Times:B:envelope  calculation  shows  that  the  bilateral  deficit  of  the  USA  vis-à-vis  China  measured  with 
13:575:47526:12:12:91:522:530:10:Times:10:Times:B:conventional  trade  statistics  over-estimates  the  imbalances  measured  in  value  added  content  by  about 
13:576:47639:12:12:91:522:518:10:Times:10:Times:B:60% (Table 2). This estimate, derived from an indirect measurement of value added content estimated 
13:577:47739:12:12:91:524:506:10:Times:10:Times:B:from international input-output matrices, is based on the hypothesis of homogeneous production on the 
13:578:47841:12:12:91:521:494:10:Times:10:Times:B:US  side  (i.e.,  the  US  production  of  final  goods  is similar  for  exports  and  for  domestic  use)  and

13:590:48339:11:11:91:521:303:9:Times:9:Times:F:content  for  US  exports  is  about  0.9,  based  on  input-output  coefficients;  the  respective  value  for  China  was  0.8,

13:596:48818:12:12:91:522:233:10:Times:10:Times:B:importantly, cheaper in terms of lost welfare. This said, measuring trade in value added may, as in this 
13:597:48923:12:12:91:522:221:10:Times:10:Times:B:case,  reduce  bilateral  imbalances,  but  in  other  instances  it  will  increase  it,  or  even  change  its  sign 
13:598:49041:12:12:91:522:209:10:Times:10:Times:B:(Daudin  et  al.,  2009).  From  a  balance  of  payments  perspective,  the  overall  imbalance  of  an  economy 
13:599:49155:12:12:91:522:197:10:Times:10:Times:B:vis-à-vis  the  rest  of  the  world  will  remain  the  same;  but  because  its  actual  composition  differs,  the 
13:600:49273:12:18:91:407:185:10:Times:10:Times:B:implications in terms of effective bilateral exchange rates are also different.

13:603:49493:12:12:91:522:137:10:Times:10:Times:B:imply for the deficit countries a relative decrease in the final demand and an exacerbated competition to 
13:604:49599:12:11:91:525:125:10:Times:10:Times:B:generate  net  exports.  These  forces  will  lead  to  fundamental  changes  in  the  source  of  global  effective

13:608:49987:16:11:105:513:71:9:Times:9:Times:F:of effective demand refers to a demand-driven model, where production responds to final demand and where

14:621:50566:11:12:91:522:703:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  medium  term,  a  relative  reduction  in  the  international  demand  for  labour  intensive  manufactured

14:623:50789:12:18:91:327:679:10:Times:10:Times:B:(agricultural, fuels and minerals) and investment goods.  
14:624:50847:18:12:91:522:661:10:Times:10:Times:B:Adjusting to this trend will prove difficult for non-emerging countries, both in the North and the South.

14:626:51057:11:12:91:522:638:10:Times:10:Times:B:in commodity prices (see box 3), the long term impact is not clear. From both the effective demand and 
14:627:51159:12:12:91:522:626:10:Times:10:Times:B:the sustainable development perspective, exporting non-renewable commodities does not have the same 
14:628:51259:12:12:91:524:614:10:Times:10:Times:B:benefits  than  exporting  labour-intensive  merchandises.  For  the  poor  deficit  developing  countries,  the 
14:629:51372:12:12:91:522:602:10:Times:10:Times:B:situation will be worst as the potential for exporting labour intensive products to the North will decline 
14:630:51479:12:18:91:365:590:10:Times:10:Times:B:in the same time as their import bill in oil and food will increase.  
14:631:51549:18:12:91:522:572:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  reshaping  of  global  effective  demand  in  any  future  scenario  is  of  particular  importance  for  the 
14:632:51664:12:11:91:522:560:10:Times:10:Times:B:labour  abundant  developing  countries  that  where  relying  on  the  strength  of  the  global  supply  chain 
14:633:51777:11:12:91:522:549:10:Times:10:Times:B:movement   to   attract   productive   investments.   Global Supply   Chains   are   based   on   comparative 
14:634:51887:12:12:91:522:537:10:Times:10:Times:B:advantages derived from costs and specialization. Complementarities based on cost differential between 
14:635:51989:12:12:91:522:525:10:Times:10:Times:B:countries arise naturally when factors endowments are very different. This explains the specialization in 
14:636:52095:12:12:91:522:513:10:Times:10:Times:B:trade   in   tasks   between   industrialised   economies   and   labour   abundant   developing   countries. 
14:637:52205:12:12:91:522:501:10:Times:10:Times:B:Complementarities  based  on  specialization  are,  at  the  contrary,  the  domain  of  intra-sectoral  trade 
14:638:52316:12:12:91:522:489:10:Times:10:Times:B:between  complex  industries,  typical  of  the  developed  economies  (for  example,  intra-EU  trade  in 
14:639:52423:12:12:91:522:477:10:Times:10:Times:B:manufacture).  The  capacity  of  LDCs  and  least-advanced  developing  countries  to  successfully  insert 
14:640:52532:12:12:91:522:465:10:Times:10:Times:B:themselves  into  supply  chains  led  by  and  for  emerging  economies  is  still  unclear.  The  difference  in 
14:641:52647:12:11:91:522:453:10:Times:10:Times:B:factor endowments and production costs is not large (as in the case of mature industrialised countries), 
14:642:52752:11:30:91:390:442:10:Times:10:Times:B:and most emerging countries still count with a large reservoir of labour. 
14:643:52826:30:17:91:414:412:11:Times:11:Times:C:Box 3: Least Developed Countries Exports: Products and Markets 
14:644:52889:17:12:91:510:395:10:Times:10:Times:B:Export concentration has been a structural characteristic of LDC economies. Almost three quarters of 
14:645:52990:12:12:91:517:383:10:Times:10:Times:B:LDC total merchandise exports depends upon only three main products (which change from country to 
14:646:53088:12:11:91:493:371:10:Times:10:Times:B:country), accounting sometimes for more than 95 per cent of export receipts. The recent trends in 
14:647:53186:11:12:91:519:360:10:Times:10:Times:B:commodity prices reinforce this tendency, not only by increasing the weight of those commodities, but 
14:648:53288:12:17:91:278:348:10:Times:10:Times:B:also for discouraging diversification efforts.  
14:649:53336:17:12:91:515:331:10:Times:10:Times:B:The value of fuels and mineral exports between 2000 and 2007 rose annually by more than 27 per cent 
14:650:53436:12:12:91:499:319:10:Times:10:Times:B:and represent now 67 per cent of total LDC exports.  For commodity exporters, the non-traditional 
14:651:53534:12:12:91:524:307:10:Times:10:Times:B:(labour intensive) activities appear less lucrative to domestic investors due to their lower relative prices.  
14:652:53645:12:11:91:507:295:10:Times:10:Times:B:In addition, exchange rate appreciation linked to commodity booms – the so-called Dutch Disease – 
14:653:53743:11:12:91:517:284:10:Times:10:Times:B:reduces the international competitiveness of labour intensive activities, such as light manufacture. This 
14:654:53849:12:12:91:481:272:10:Times:10:Times:B:increased concentration on commodities reduced the weight of clothing, the second product in 
14:655:53942:12:12:91:514:260:10:Times:10:Times:B:importance, to below 13 per cent for the LDC group.  All other product groups, including agriculture, 
14:656:54044:12:17:91:376:248:10:Times:10:Times:B:are now contributing less than 10 per cent to the total export value.   
14:657:54116:17:12:91:521:231:10:Times:10:Times:B:The market for LDC exports have increasingly become diversified, with developing economies, such as 
14:658:54216:12:11:91:506:219:10:Times:10:Times:B:China, India and Thailand having a greater weight in LDC exports than one would expect from their 
14:659:54314:11:12:91:511:208:10:Times:10:Times:B:share in world total imports. As a result developing economies have become the major destination for 
14:660:54415:12:12:91:515:196:10:Times:10:Times:B:LDC exports of mineral fuels (56 per cent in 2006), copper (83 per cent), wood products (87 per cent), 
14:661:54517:12:12:91:510:184:10:Times:10:Times:B:cotton (89 per cent) or some food products like vegetables and oil seeds (84 and 73 per cent).  On the 
14:662:54619:12:12:91:515:172:10:Times:10:Times:B:contrary, developed economies remain largely a dominant export destination for manufactured articles 
14:663:54720:12:12:91:508:160:10:Times:10:Times:B:such as clothing (95 per cent) and some high value-added agricultural and food products such as fish 
14:664:54821:12:17:91:428:148:10:Times:10:Times:B:and crustaceans, beverages or tobacco, with 67, 73 and 57 per cent, respectively. 
14:665:54903:17:12:91:520:131:10:Times:10:Times:B:Service exports are of particular importance to some LDCs. Travel, a close proxy of tourism receipts, is 
14:666:55008:12:11:91:496:119:10:Times:10:Times:B:the dominant sector, representing 52 per cent of their services exports in 2008.  This activity grew 
14:667:55109:11:12:91:498:108:10:Times:10:Times:B:steadily since the beginning of 2000, at an average annual rate of 15 per cent, and was particularly 
14:668:55210:12:12:91:518:96:10:Times:10:Times:B:dynamic during the last three years.  This promising sector is vulnerable in the present economic cycle, 
14:669:55315:12:12:91:517:84:10:Times:10:Times:B:because a large part of these revenues originate from tourists arriving from developed countries, where 
14:670:55419:12:17:91:330:72:10:Times:10:Times:B:the economic impact of the crisis has been primarily felt.

15:675:55634:16:12:91:522:694:10:Times:10:Times:B:The geographical segmentation of industrial production has played a major role in shaping international 
15:676:55738:12:11:91:525:682:10:Times:10:Times:B:economy in the past 15 years. It was at the root of the emergence of new global players, such as China 
15:677:55840:11:12:91:522:671:10:Times:10:Times:B:or Malaysia, and the correlated dramatic reduction in absolute poverty levels. It allowed also some old 
15:678:55944:12:12:91:521:659:10:Times:10:Times:B:industrial  economies  like  Germany  or  the  USA,  to  regain  international  competitiveness  through 
15:679:56049:12:12:91:522:647:10:Times:10:Times:B:increased  productivity  and  efficiency.  In  the  same time,  the  content  of  merchandise  statistics  and  the 
15:680:56164:12:18:91:450:635:10:Times:10:Times:B:economic significance of trade balances became more and more difficult to interpret.   
15:681:56251:18:12:91:522:617:10:Times:10:Times:B:Supply   chains   reshaped   international   trade   and   changed   the   relationship   between   trade   and 
15:682:56363:12:12:91:522:605:10:Times:10:Times:B:development:  the  surge  of  trade  in  intermediate  commodities  remodeled  regional  and  international 
15:683:56471:12:11:91:521:593:10:Times:10:Times:B:networks through a bottom-up angle and  forced  governments  to reconsider the previous identification 
15:684:56574:11:12:91:521:582:10:Times:10:Times:B:of   industrial   development   with   protectionism;   developing   countries   were   able   to  leap-frog   the 
15:685:56689:12:12:91:521:570:10:Times:10:Times:B:traditional industrialization phases by inserting themselves into complex industrial networks; the criss-
15:686:56794:12:12:91:522:558:10:Times:10:Times:B:crossing   of   manufacture   networks   led   to   large   investments   in   transportation   equipment   and 
15:687:56906:12:12:91:522:546:10:Times:10:Times:B:infrastructure  in  order  to  accommodate  the  huge  transit  of  goods  for  processing  that  removed 
15:688:57012:12:17:91:296:534:10:Times:10:Times:B:bottlenecks and favored economic development.  
15:689:57059:17:12:91:522:517:10:Times:10:Times:B:Off-shoring  altered  also  the  social  panorama.  If  global  economic  and  welfare  benefits  have  been 
15:690:57168:12:12:91:522:505:10:Times:10:Times:B:substantial, their distribution remains contentious. While creating numerous jobs in emerging countries, 
15:691:57273:12:12:91:522:493:10:Times:10:Times:B:outsourcing  and  offshoring  increased  wage  disparity  in  both  developed  and  developing  economies, 
15:692:57380:12:18:91:386:481:10:Times:10:Times:B:fuelling an active political debate on the pro and cons of globalization. 
15:693:57454:18:11:91:521:463:10:Times:10:Times:B:The  role  of  global  supply  chains  in  explaining  the trade  collapse  that  followed  the  financial  crisis  of 
15:694:57573:11:12:91:522:452:10:Times:10:Times:B:September 2008 has been determinant. And determinant is also their role in shaping the alternative exit 
15:695:57677:12:18:91:479:440:10:Times:10:Times:B:scenarios from the Great Recession, as is their future contribution in any post-crisis scenario. 
15:696:57774:18:12:91:522:422:10:Times:10:Times:B:An  increase  in  objective  and  subjective  transaction  costs,  from  higher  oil  prices  to  "buy  local" 
15:697:57885:12:12:91:521:410:10:Times:10:Times:B:campaigns and murky protectionism, indicates that in the future, supply chains will probably be smaller 
15:698:57989:12:12:91:522:398:10:Times:10:Times:B:and  more  regional.  Let  unchecked,  these  centripetal  forces  may  well  cause  a  deglobalization  process 
15:699:58102:12:12:91:522:386:10:Times:10:Times:B:which will directly affect less advanced developing economies but, in the end, will also be detrimental 
15:700:58206:12:17:91:275:374:10:Times:10:Times:B:to both developed and emerging countries.   
15:701:58250:17:12:91:522:357:10:Times:10:Times:B:On the other hand, the technical factors that made possible the internationalization of production, from 
15:702:58355:12:12:91:522:345:10:Times:10:Times:B:the  IT  revolution  to  innovations  in  engineering  and  business  management,  still  promote  further 
15:703:58462:12:12:91:521:333:10:Times:10:Times:B:"flattening  of  the  Earth".  Large  emerging  countries  are  becoming  new  markets  for  final  goods  that 
15:704:58574:12:12:91:522:321:10:Times:10:Times:B:reshape  existing  production  networks,  while  new  actors  are  emerging  from  the  "not-so-emerging" 
15:705:58680:12:11:91:522:309:10:Times:10:Times:B:countries.  Thus deglobalization is probably a distant menace on objective  grounds, even if  it is a new 
15:706:58785:11:12:91:527:298:10:Times:10:Times:B:global effective demand that will drive the world economy, forcing some difficult adjustments. Indeed,  
15:707:58889:12:12:91:522:286:10:Times:10:Times:B:the 2008-2009 crisis is a structural break, and the world economy will certainly not return to "business 
15:708:58994:12:12:91:522:274:10:Times:10:Times:B:as  usual".  Old  giants  tumbled,  new  global  players  emerged.  Public  opinion  is  also  changing  and  the 
15:709:59108:12:12:91:522:262:10:Times:10:Times:B:citizens'  concerns  on  the  lack  of  governance  of  the  previous  phase  of  globalization  will  have  to  be 
15:710:59224:12:226:91:466:250:10:Times:10:Times:B:addressed, while the present gains in opening trade opportunities will have to be preserved.
