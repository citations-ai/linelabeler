2:36:2286:28:14:71:545:588:12:Times:12:Times:Scholars engage  in  extensive  debate  about  the  role  of  families  and  corporations  in  economic 
2:37:2390:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:growth. Some propose that personal ties provide a mechanism for overcoming such transactions 
2:38:2482:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:costs  as  asymmetrical information,  while  others  regard  familial  connections  as  conduits  for 
2:39:2583:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:inefficiency,  with  the  potential for  nepotism,  corruption  and  exploitation  of  other  stakeholders. 
2:40:2690:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:This  empirical  study  is  based  on  a unique  panel  dataset  comprising  all  of  the  shareholders  in  a 
2:41:2800:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:sample  of  early  corporations,  including information  on  such  characteristics  as  gender,  age, 
2:42:2901:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:occupation,  household  composition,  real  estate holdings  and  personal  wealth.  Related  investing 
2:43:3004:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:was  widespread  among  directors  and  elite  shareholders, but  was  also  pervasive  among  women 
2:44:3104:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:and  small  shareholders.    Personal  ties  were  especially  evident among  ordinary  investors  in  the 
2:45:3210:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:newer,  riskier  ventures,  and  helped  to  ensure  persistence  in  shareholding. “Outsider  investors” 
2:46:3315:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:were  able  to  overcome  a  lack  of  experience  and  information  by  taking  advantage of  their  own 
2:47:3420:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:networks.  The  link  between  related  investing  and  the  concentration  of  ownership  in  these 
2:48:3520:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:corporations suggests that this phenomenon was likely associated with a reduction in perceptions 
2:49:3617:14:14:72:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:of risk,  especially  beneficial  for  capital  mobilization  in  emerging  ventures.  These  patterns  are 
2:50:3724:14:14:71:545:392:12:Times:12:Times:consistent with  a  more  productive  interpretation  of  related  investing  and  its  function  in  newly 
2:51:3831:14:42:72:173:378:12:Times:12:Times:developing societies.

3:58:3947:0:28:72:176:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I. INTRODUCTION 
3:59:3963:28:28:72:538:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Related investing refers to investors whose personal ties influence their decisions to enter or exit 
3:60:4064:28:27:72:521:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the market, the composition of their portfolios, or other actions that they might not otherwise 
3:61:4160:27:28:72:536:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:undertake.  Market efficiency is in part    defined in terms of depersonalized transactions, so many 
3:62:4261:28:27:72:538:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analysts regard related investing as a sign of the existence of inefficiencies.  Some claim that the 
3:63:4362:27:28:72:527:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exploitation of family networks offers a haven for potential redistributive or criminal activity.  
3:64:4461:28:28:72:521:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Even if personalized interactions were initially prevalent because of productive reasons,  it is 
3:65:4558:28:27:72:528:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:commonly contended that such connections should tend to diminish in importance as financial 
3:66:4650:27:28:72:541:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:markets and the economy matured.  Most notably, Sir Henry Maine (1861) is frequently cited for 
3:67:4745:28:27:72:532:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:his proposal that societies evolve from communal relationships based on status or ascribed ties, 
3:68:4842:27:28:72:538:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to contracting by autonomous actors.   Thus, related investing is typically viewed as a temporary 
3:69:4940:28:28:72:521:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:phenomenon, and its persistence is associated with anomalous deviations from optimality, or 
3:70:5032:28:27:72:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:outright corruption.  As the economy evolves, according to this perspective, one might expect 
3:71:5126:27:28:72:527:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that transactions costs would fall, and that a transition would occur towards the arguably more 
3:72:5222:28:27:72:285:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:efficient state of depersonalized exchange.   
3:73:5268:27:28:108:511:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This evolutionary assumption is evident in the work of John Majewski (1996), who 
3:74:5349:28:28:72:536:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:examined the financing of transportation infrastructure in the antebellum period, drawing on the 
3:75:5446:28:27:72:497:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:experience of six railroad enterprises in Pennsylvania and Virginia.  He found that early 
3:76:5536:27:28:72:527:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expansions in transportation networks were financed by local residents or small investors who 
3:77:5630:28:27:72:531:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were connected by ties of kinship and social capital or community spirit.  Majewski argues that 
3:78:5726:27:28:72:527:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the development of the Southern economy was retarded by the continued involvement of local 
3:79:5817:28:28:72:543:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors, whereas the Northeast expanded in part because its investments evolved away from the 
3:80:5913:28:0:72:541:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“friends and family” approach towards arms-length professional transactions.  Others have raised 
4:81:6012:0:28:72:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the possibility that, while relational investing might be productive in certain circumstances, such 
4:82:6112:28:28:72:497:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ties might be incompatible with efficiency within some organizational structures, and in 
4:83:6201:28:27:72:203:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporations in particular.1 
4:84:6229:27:28:108:541:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In today’s developing countries, a parallel extensive debate centers on the role of families 
4:85:6322:28:27:72:541:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and  corporations in economic growth.  La Porta et al., (1999) point out that family businesses are 
4:86:6422:27:28:72:520:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:common in many parts of the world, and ownership in such firms is typically not dispersed.   
4:87:6515:28:28:72:515:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Even though family ownership and control in business enterprise is pervasive, the scholarly 
4:88:6607:28:27:72:528:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discussion tends to be somewhat skeptical and pessimistic about the contributions of  kinship 
4:89:6701:27:28:72:534:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:groups.  First, complementary institutions such as legal and political systems may be inefficient 
4:90:6799:28:27:72:534:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and  inadequate to support the needs of the corporate form.  Second, research points to problems 
4:91:6896:27:28:72:524:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in corporate governance, and the potential for the expropriation of shareholders by the groups 
4:92:6991:28:28:72:493:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that control the company.  Minority shareholders and other outside stakeholders can be 
4:93:7078:28:27:72:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expropriated by such practices as nepotism and on-the-job consumption by entrenched family 
4:94:7169:27:28:72:519:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:members.  Outside investors face the risk that both internal and external control mechanisms 
4:95:7262:28:27:72:517:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may be too weak to protect them from “tunneling” or corruption in the firm.   Acheson et al. 
4:96:7355:27:28:72:510:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2016) study Victorian England, and conclude that the negative effect of family ownership 
4:97:7445:28:28:72:516:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:depended on whether members of the group had control over the governance of the firm.  A 
4:98:7534:28:27:72:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survey of the extensive literature on tunneling and malfeasance by families points out that the 
4:99:7630:27:28:72:508:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:empirical context has been somewhat restricted, and calls for expansion of research to pay 
4:100:7721:28:27:72:449:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attention to other settings (Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar, and Andros Gregoriou 2010). 
4:101:7800:27:28:108:509:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Although agency costs may be magnified in the presence of kinship ties among the 
4:102:7881:28:20:72:531:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managers and leading shareholders, who can form blocks to transfer resources to themselves at 
4:103:7975:20:8:216:219:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
4:104:8028:8:16:72:538:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:1 See Ingram and Lifschitz (2006) who argue that kinship ties allowed family firms to reduce the risk of bankruptcy, 
4:105:8145:16:11:72:445:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:but that some types of relational governance conflicted with corporate modes of governance. 
4:106:8237:11:0:72:74:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2: 
5:107:8239:0:28:72:520:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the expense of outsiders,  groups with relational links can still generate net positive benefits.  
5:108:8338:28:28:72:525:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Such     benefits are especially evident in circumstances where institutional imperfections hinder 
5:109:8437:28:27:72:497:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market transactions.  Family networks can facilitate remedies for market failure, such as 
5:110:8527:27:28:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investments in trust and social capital, the ability to monitor group members more effectively, 
5:111:8623:28:27:72:478:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cheaper enforcement mechanisms, and the use of reputation to reduce informational 
5:112:8705:27:28:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:asymmetries.  Relational contracts may result in stronger commitments or incentives to adhere to 
5:113:8802:28:28:72:537:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:agreements.  Although one might expect that such ties would tend to weaken over geographic or 
5:114:8896:28:27:72:522:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:genetic distance, this is not necessarily the case.  For instance, Avner Greif (2006) found that 
5:115:8993:27:28:72:521:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Maghrebi traders formed coalitions that enabled them to overcome obstacles to long distance 
5:116:9085:28:27:72:522:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trade.  These private institutions functioned as commitment devices that enforced agreements 
5:117:9178:27:28:72:338:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and deterred opportunism among market participants.   
5:118:9232:28:28:108:535:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Research on the corporate form of business organizations has tended to focus on the role 
5:119:9321:28:27:72:515:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of managers, directors, and other elite investors in the firm.2  Naomi Lamoreaux (1996), for 
5:120:9414:27:28:72:528:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instance, demonstrated the importance of “insider lending” in early U.S. capital markets.3  She 
5:121:9510:28:27:72:538:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:found that elite investors in banks tended to be related to each other, and these owners directed a 
5:122:9610:27:28:72:493:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:significant fraction of the loans in the bank to other insiders.  Rather than unproductive 
5:123:9701:28:28:72:537:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“tunneling,” Lamoreaux finds that relational links in the banking sector were an effective means

5:126:9944:8:16:72:536:193:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2 A significant amount of research on the role of corporations in early American development has focused on issues 
5:127:10059:16:11:72:511:177:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in corporate governance (Bodenhorn 2012, Dunlavy 2006, Hilt 2008).  In particular, they examine ownership 
5:128:10165:11:12:72:516:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:structures of the firms, and the causes and consequences of different voting rules.  For instance, the charters of 
5:129:10280:12:11:72:528:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:corporations sometimes specified graduated voting rights that reduced the degree of control exerted by the largest 
5:130:10395:11:12:72:536:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:shareholders.  Hilt analyzed the ownership structure of corporations in New York State in the 1820s, and concludes 
5:131:10510:12:11:72:507:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that minority shareholders were in danger of being “oppressed” by majority shareholders, but the latter were 
5:132:10619:11:12:72:530:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:checked by corporate charters.  Thus minority shareholders were granted disproportionate representation, and this 
5:133:10733:12:11:72:521:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:reduced the cost of capital and enhanced diversification of portfolios.  Bodenhorn similarly finds that graduated 
5:134:10847:11:7:72:469:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:voting rules were prevalent in early American banks and were designed to attract small investors.

6:137:11114:0:28:72:525:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:innovative initiatives as industrialization got underway.  Outsiders were quite aware that their 
6:138:11211:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stock purchases in the bank were destined to finance the other enterprises owned by the directors 
6:139:11309:28:27:72:534:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the bank.  They likely benefited from access to investment opportunities in new ventures, for 
6:140:11406:27:28:72:541:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the arrangement offered the uneducated investor the opportunity to gain enhanced profits beyond 
6:141:11502:28:27:72:521:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the banking sector, while diversification reduced risk.  Insider lending comprised an efficient 
6:142:11598:27:28:72:541:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:response to supply and demand, whereby outsiders were induced to make investments in the new 
6:143:11691:28:28:72:511:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industries of the day primarily because of their trust in the reputation and experience of the 
6:144:11786:28:27:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prominent families who founded the financial institutions.  Familial and other social connections 
6:145:11884:27:28:72:531:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:substituted for incomplete markets and helped to resolve problems that arose in the presence of 
6:146:11980:28:27:72:420:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such market imperfections as high risk and asymmetrical information.    
6:147:12052:27:28:108:535:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The almost universal focus on the role of elite participants in the ownership of firms and 
6:148:12143:28:28:72:537:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporations leaves open the question about whether relational connections were pervasive at all 
6:149:12240:28:27:72:510:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:levels of business organization.  If family ties were concentrated among elite investors, the 
6:150:12334:27:28:72:534:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:implications for our understanding of the role of such ties would be different from the inference 
6:151:12432:28:27:72:541:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:if these patterns were common to all investors of the time.  Indeed, Naomi Tadmor (2001) rejects 
6:152:12529:27:28:72:526:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the conventional dichotomy between kinship circles and those who are unrelated, arguing that 
6:153:12622:28:28:72:533:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the family relationship is necessarily both affective and instrumental.  However, little empirical 
6:154:12721:28:27:72:541:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:research has been directed to the entire population of participants in the ownership and control of 
6:155:12821:27:28:72:530:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the firm, nor to the extent and implications of their heterogeneity.  Most research tends to be at 
6:156:12920:28:27:72:496:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the firm level, although within-firm heterogeneity among owners can lead to significant 
6:157:13008:27:28:72:501:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unobserved variation which necessitates the analysis of the cadre of investors outside the 
6:158:13099:28:28:72:525:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managerial class.  Such characteristics and patterns might have important implications for our 
6:159:13194:28:0:72:526:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:understanding of the nature and consequences of kinship ties in economic development.           
7:160:13292:0:28:108:520:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Similarly, although the structure of ownership might be expected to vary over the life 
7:161:13379:28:28:72:527:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cycle of the firm and over time, the dynamics of firm ownership is still an understudied topic.  
7:162:13476:28:27:72:525:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Kinship links are predicted to decline over time, but if they are found to have persisted during 
7:163:13573:27:28:72:513:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economic development in an effective institutional environment, then their existence is less 
7:164:13666:28:27:72:498:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:likely to owe entirely to market imperfections.  Helwege et al. (2007) examined how the 
7:165:13754:27:28:72:521:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ownership of insiders changed over time, and concluded that moral hazard and informational 
7:166:13845:28:28:72:528:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:asymmetries were “irrelevant” to understanding changes in insider ownership.  However, such 
7:167:13937:28:27:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:research does not control for family relationships which, as discussed above, tend to be pervasive 
7:168:14036:27:28:72:514:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:beyond the United States.4  Family ownership can be especially relevant to the dynamics of 
7:169:14127:28:27:72:526:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholding in corporate organizations.  Some regard familial relationships as a constraint on 
7:170:14223:27:28:72:526:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the longevity of the firm, owing to incompetence or nepotism.  On the other hand, the internal 
7:171:14318:28:28:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:incentives of the family unit might be more transparent and observable over time than in the case 
7:172:14416:28:27:72:530:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of unrelated shareholders. The intergenerational links that characterize family membership can 
7:173:14511:27:28:72:492:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:thus provide a cost-effective signal to outsiders that a firm values continuity and future 
7:174:14602:28:27:72:135:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exchange.     
7:175:14616:27:28:108:533:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper examines the nature of related investing at all levels in corporations and how 
7:176:14706:28:28:72:541:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such patterns changed over time.  The analysis is based on a new and unique data set drawn from 
7:177:14802:28:27:72:545:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the population of investors in all   Maine corporations during the antebellum period.  The sample 
7:178:14900:27:28:72:539:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:includes information on counties, industries, enterprises, as well as individual investors in banks, 
7:179:15001:28:27:72:528:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing firms and transportation enterprises.  The shareholders have been matched with 
7:180:15094:27:28:72:526:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the manuscript population censuses, to provide information on age, occupations and wealth of 
7:181:15187:28:20:72:517:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:individuals and household size. The data include cross-sections of the same firms over time, 
7:182:15280:20:8:216:219:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
7:183:15333:8:16:72:533:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:4 Sraer, D. and Thesmar, D. (2007) show that family firms comprised two thirds of enterprises listed on the French 
7:184:15448:16:11:72:523:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:stock exchange in the 1990s, and find that such firms out-performed their widely-held corporate counterparts by 
7:185:15560:11:0:72:221:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:making more effective use of inputs. 
8:186:15599:0:28:72:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which permits the investigation of longitudinal changes in corporate ownership and the structure 
8:187:15696:28:28:72:135:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the firm.   
8:188:15711:28:27:108:531:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The results confirm the conventional finding that corporate elites tended to be related to 
8:189:15802:27:28:72:530:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:others within the firm.  At the same time, nonelites, or the investors who were neither directors 
8:190:15900:28:27:72:519:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nor the largest shareholders, were also bound by kinship connections.  Related investing was 
8:191:15993:27:28:72:538:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:widespread among the ordinary investors, and seems to have been pervasive throughout the firm 
8:192:16087:28:28:72:526:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and the corporate economy, during the critical period of early industrialization.  The universal 
8:193:16184:28:27:72:532:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nature of relational investing in these data suggests that further attention needs to be paid to the 
8:194:16285:27:28:72:528:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:entire ownership structure and not just to the apex.  Family ties were especially evident among 
8:195:16381:28:27:72:542:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the ordinary investors in emerging industries and in the newer, riskier investments, and may have 
8:196:16479:27:28:72:509:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:played a role in inducing inexperienced investors to contribute to the venture capital of the 
8:197:16573:28:28:72:512:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:period.   The overall patterns are consistent with a more productive interpretation of related 
8:198:16668:28:27:72:316:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investing and its function in developing societies.

8:201:16753:27:28:72:531:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:From an international perspective, the corporate form of business enterprise has been prevalent 
8:202:16849:28:28:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the United States to a far greater extent than in other countries.  Unlike the general perspective 
8:203:16951:28:27:72:507:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from studies in developed economies at the present time, the conclusions from research in 
8:204:17041:27:28:72:537:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economic history tend to be more consistent with a favourable interpretation of the link between 
8:205:17138:28:27:72:519:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporations and family holdings.  Corporations developed rapidly, in tandem with deep and 
8:206:17229:27:28:72:522:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accessible financial markets in debt and equity.  In the American colonies local and interstate 
8:207:17325:28:28:72:512:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:debt contracting were extensive and functioned effectively from the earliest decades (Khan 
8:208:17416:28:0:72:533:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2008).  Many scholars credit financial markets and the spread of the corporate form of business 
9:209:17514:0:28:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:organization with aiding the rapid industrialization and economic progress of the United States in 
9:210:17613:28:28:72:303:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the nineteenth century (Irwin and Sylla, 2011).5 
9:211:17661:28:27:108:542:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In New England, banks and insurance companies were the first types of corporations with 
9:212:17749:27:28:72:496:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:diffuse ownership, and these enterprises attracted a diverse array of investors, including 
9:213:17840:28:27:72:521:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively risk-averse savers such as trustees, women and the elderly.  Banks provided “saver 
9:214:17934:27:28:72:528:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education” that helped to inform new entrants in the market for corporate capital mobilization, 
9:215:18030:28:28:72:536:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and both firms and investors in subsequent transportation and manufacturing ventures were able 
9:216:18125:28:27:72:530:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to benefit from their example.  In some instances, banks served as institutional investors which 
9:217:18222:27:28:72:515:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:helped to fund emerging enterprises and industries.  Prior research has investigated banking 
9:218:18315:28:27:72:520:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms extensively, but a lack of systematic data has made it difficult to ascertain the extent to 
9:219:18413:27:28:72:517:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which their investors differed from those who funded the “venture capital” of the nineteenth 
9:220:18506:28:28:72:317:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:century, and how these patterns varied over time.   
9:221:18558:28:27:108:513:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Records of the Maine experience offer insights into cross-sectional and longitudinal 
9:222:18643:27:28:72:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:comparisons of the financial structure of corporations.  Maine was an early leader in the 
9:223:18733:28:27:72:499:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:chartering of U.S. business corporations and, as Figure 1 shows, its rate of incorporation 
9:224:18824:27:28:72:491:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:remained competitive with states of much larger populations.  The growth in corporate 
9:225:18910:28:28:72:534:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enterprises reflected a general expansion in the Maine economy across all sectors, ranging from 
9:226:19006:28:27:72:530:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:banks to shipbuilding, fisheries, lumber, and manufacturing.  The state was among the nation’s 
9:227:19101:27:28:72:539:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:leaders in many extractive pursuits, most notably shipbuilding and lumber.  However, during the 
9:228:19197:28:27:72:539:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:period under review there was a marked structural transformation in the state that was associated 
9:229:19295:27:28:72:476:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with    rapid economic growth in manufacturing and transportation, as well as general 
9:230:19381:28:20:72:533:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industrialization.  The first sawmill in the American colonies was established in Maine in 1634,

9:232:19531:8:16:72:526:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:5 For an extremist exposition of this thesis, see Wright (2002) who is convinced that "the root cause of early U.S. 
9:233:19647:16:11:72:536:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:economic growth (1780-1850) . . . is the development of the financial sector, not transportation and communication

10:236:19931:28:28:72:519:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and cheap sources of power propelled manufacturing in the “take off” phase during the early 
10:237:20023:28:27:72:538:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nineteenth century.  The area was remarkably rich in inventive inputs, and Maine inventors were 
10:238:20119:27:28:72:534:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among the most innovative and productive in the nation, accounting for a substantial fraction of 
10:239:20216:28:27:72:519:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the most valuable patents filed in the United States (Khan 2005).  By 1860 the economy was 
10:240:20307:27:28:72:530:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:significantly diversified, the agricultural sector had shrunk to 40 percent, cotton manufacturing 
10:241:20405:28:28:72:523:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:was the fifth highest in the country, and the state ranked ninth overall in U.S. manufacturing.  
10:242:20502:28:27:72:532:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Some of the largest enterprises in the country were founded in Maine, and their average output, 
10:243:20598:27:28:72:530:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capital and employment in 1860 were exceeded only by firms in New York and Massachusetts 
10:244:20687:28:27:72:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Bateman and Weiss, 1975).  Thus, the experience of this state in the antebellum period provides 
10:245:20784:27:28:72:486:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a useful case study of the nature of capital mobilization during early industrialization. 
10:246:20874:28:28:108:536:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Maine granted charters to business enterprises through private acts of incorporation until 
10:247:20965:28:27:72:537:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1875, after which general incorporation laws were passed, implying that the charter applications 
10:248:21062:27:28:72:517:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for all of the firms in this study were individually vetted and approved by the legislature.  In 
10:249:21159:28:27:72:536:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1839 and 1841 the statutes required all business corporations to record and publish the complete 
10:250:21256:27:28:72:515:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:list of shareholders in the company, and this offers a unique opportunity to assess a panel of 
10:251:21351:28:28:72:542:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporate owners during a period of rapid industrialization.6   In 1845, 55 commercial enterprises 
10:252:21450:28:27:72:532:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were organized as corporations in Maine, with an average of 64 shareholders.  The Portsmouth, 
10:253:21544:27:28:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Saco and Portland Railroad company was the largest firm in terms of the number of shareholders 
10:254:21639:28:27:72:497:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(255), whereas the York Manufacturing Corporation had the greatest total capitalization 
10:255:21727:27:28:72:537:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:($1,000,000).  During the antebellum period the number of firms and the extent of capitalization 
10:256:21824:28:20:72:532:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expanded, and by 1855 the number of corporations had increased to 122 firms, with an average 
10:257:21917:20:8:216:219:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
10:258:21970:8:16:72:511:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:6 The 1839 law stipulated that banks should file their stockholders’ lists, and the law was extended in 1841 to 
10:259:22082:16:11:72:515:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:include all commercial (for-profit) corporations.  The data in this study exclude nonprofit corporations such as 
10:260:22195:11:0:72:256:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:towns, religious and educational institutions.  
11:261:22246:0:28:72:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of 107 shareholders.  The largest railroad firms were owned by some one thousand shareholders, 
11:262:22341:28:28:72:494:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and several corporations now had capital investments that exceeded a million dollars.7   
11:263:22430:28:27:108:518:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The data set (Table 1) comprises a random sample of roughly half of all corporations 
11:264:22515:27:28:72:512:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:filing in 1845, 1850 and 1855.8  These include 21 banks in 1845, and 15 nonbank firms; 13 
11:265:22605:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:banks and 17 nonbank firms in 1850; and 29 banks and 25 nonbank firms in 1855.  The    entire 
11:266:22699:27:28:72:500:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sample includes some 13,900 individual observations of investors in these corporations.  
11:267:22788:28:28:72:527:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Shareholder lists include the names of the individuals, the amount and/or value of shares held, 
11:268:22884:28:27:72:529:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and their place of residence.  The lists allow us to categorize related investors, who are defined 
11:269:22983:27:28:72:479:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as individuals within a company who share the same surname.  They also enable the 
11:270:23065:28:27:72:541:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:identification of women shareholders, corporate and nonprofit investors, trustees and other proxy 
11:271:23163:27:28:72:542:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors, the entire stock portfolio of a given investor, and persistence or turnover in ownership.  
11:272:23265:28:28:72:513:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The names of stockholders were matched with the federal manuscript censuses in 1850 and 
11:273:23353:28:27:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1860, which provided additional information on age, real estate and personal wealth, occupation, 
11:274:23450:27:28:72:283:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:household composition, and marital status.  
11:275:23494:28:27:108:493:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:At the firm level, the charters that were granted at time of incorporation yielded 
11:276:23577:27:28:72:525:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:additional information on the founding members of the company, governance rules, the initial 
11:277:23670:28:28:72:526:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capitalization, and stipulations about shareholder liability.9  These corporate charters provided 
11:278:23768:28:15:72:525:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insights into restrictions on directors and officers of the corporation, voting rights, accounting

11:280:23920:7:17:72:520:217:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:7 The Atlantic &St Lawrence Railroad had 1747 shareholders, and the Androscoggin & Kennebec Railroad had 
11:281:24025:17:11:72:517:200:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:1221 shareholders.  The Portland, Saco & Portsmouth Railroad had grown to 958 shareholders.  The Boston & 
11:282:24131:11:12:72:517:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Maine Railroad was capitalized at over four million dollars, firms with at least one million dollars included the 
11:283:24245:12:11:72:517:177:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad, the York Manufacturing Corporation, and the Lewiston Water Power 
11:284:24350:11:7:72:121:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Company.   
11:285:24361:7:16:72:530:159:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:8 The sample includes data for 1840, but they are not included in the analysis for this paper because they comprise 
11:286:24477:16:7:72:121:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:only banks. 
11:287:24489:7:16:72:517:136:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:9 Dick Sylla and Robert E. Wright generously provided access to their database of corporate charters in Maine, 
11:288:24600:16:12:72:537:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which supplemented the sample information on charters.  The provisions of Maine corporate charters between 1840 
11:289:24712:12:11:72:521:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and 1855 specified that the director should live in-state (40.4 % of all charters), directors had to be shareholders 
11:290:24829:11:12:72:535:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(37.4%), number of directors (72.5 %), officers had to give a bond (33.3%).  Proxy voting was allowed in all cases, 
11:291:24945:12:11:72:532:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and graduated voting schemes were stipulated in 37.4 % of the charters, with only 2.9 % that allowed one vote per 
11:292:25059:11:0:72:171:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:person (Carlson 2007).   
12:293:25087:0:28:72:495:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:standards, and disclosure requirements.  It is significant to note that Maine was an early 
12:294:25178:28:28:72:502:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:innovator in disclosure rules that were intended to protect outside investors: almost three-
12:295:25270:28:27:72:533:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quarters of the   charters required the firm to offer financial statements to shareholders, and in 
12:296:25369:27:28:72:500:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:many cases shareholders had the right to inspect the books of the firm at any time.  Each 
12:297:25459:28:27:72:505:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enterprise is associated with a date of incorporation (and thus the age of the firm), limited 
12:298:25553:27:28:72:547:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:liability status, industry, total    number of shareholders, total capitalization at par value (paid-in 
12:299:25657:28:28:72:512:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capital for some), the names of the directors, presidents and other officers, and measures of 
12:300:25751:28:27:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ownership concentration.  Finally, county-level variables include population and its density, and  
12:301:25850:27:28:72:539:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economic activity such as the percentage of employment and output in manufacturing, aggregate 
12:302:25944:28:27:72:327:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimated wealth from tax records, and urbanization. 
12:303:25997:27:28:108:524:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Many of these corporations under review were successful at the national, and even the 
12:304:26083:28:28:72:531:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:international, level.  For instance, the North Wayne Scythe Company of Kennebec County was 
12:305:26174:28:27:72:501:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:chartered in 1848, by Reuben B. Dunn and J. E. T. Dunn, along with four other founding 
12:306:26261:27:28:72:505:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:members.  Reuben Dunn was the President of the company, and he remained the majority 
12:307:26346:28:27:72:528:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholder, with $67,500 in shares.  The initial authorized capitalization of the enterprise was 
12:308:26444:27:28:72:517:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:$300,000, but in 1850 only $130,200 was paid in.  The firm manufactured scythes and other 
12:309:26534:28:28:72:512:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tools and implements, and ultimately grew to become the largest scythe manufactory in the 
12:310:26624:28:27:72:522:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:world.  North Wayne scythes were awarded the first prize, a silver medal, at the 1851 Crystal 
12:311:26718:27:28:72:542:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Palace Exhibition in London, England.  During the Civil War a military contract for ten thousand 
12:312:26815:28:27:72:421:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sword blades was granted and filled for the United States Government.

12:314:26887:28:0:72:327:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:III. GENERAL PATTERNS OF SHAREHOLDING 
13:315:26928:0:28:72:504:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section considers general patterns of shareholding during the antebellum period, and 
13:316:27018:28:28:72:511:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:identifies the characteristics of safer, low-risk investments in the banking sector, relative to 
13:317:27115:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:newer and riskier ventures in the incipient manufacturing industry and transportation enterprises.  
13:318:27215:27:28:72:529:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Banking and securities markets have been well-researched, especially financial centers such as 
13:319:27310:28:27:72:513:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Boston, Philadelphia and New York, which were extensive and integrated by the end of the 
13:320:27399:27:28:72:533:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:eighteenth century (Bodenhorn 2000, Wright 2002).  Lamoreaux (1996) shows that, in terms of 
13:321:27491:28:28:72:528:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:formal banking institutions, Maine was somewhat behind its Northeastern counterparts, but its 
13:322:27585:28:27:72:530:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per capita access to funds was on par with the national average.  Significantly less research has 
13:323:27683:27:28:72:525:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:been directed to the study of financial debt in “frontier regions,” although empirical evidence  
13:324:27779:28:27:72:496:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:does support the view that such markets were active and liquid from the earliest days of 
13:325:27868:27:28:72:317:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:settlement in the American colonies (Khan, 2008). 
13:326:27918:28:28:108:521:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: A key question for understanding the process and extent of capital mobilization is the 
13:327:28005:28:27:72:516:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:geographical origins of investors.  If shareholders reside in distant locations, it suggests that 
13:328:28103:27:28:72:517:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:information is cheaply available, or else that mechanisms to reduce transactions costs exist.  
13:329:28198:28:27:72:485:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Localization of adequate sources of funding, on the other hand, could point to a fairly 
13:330:28286:27:28:72:533:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sophisticated domestic financial system.  Changes in these patterns over time offer insights into 
13:331:28384:28:28:72:530:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the evolution of capital markets.  Table 2 therefore presents the distribution of shareholding by 
13:332:28482:28:27:72:530:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:residence and industry over time.  The residence of shareholders varies significantly by type of 
13:333:28579:27:28:72:531:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry, although in all cases the percentage of domestic investors increases over time.  Banks 
13:334:28676:28:27:72:550:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were predominantly owned by local residents, and    over eighty percent of the ir shareholders lived 
13:335:28777:27:28:72:528:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Maine, a proximity that reduced investor risk and transactions costs.  As might be expected, 
13:336:28873:28:28:72:502:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nonresident investors had addresses in nearby states such as Massachusetts, and very few 
13:337:28962:28:0:72:343:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stockholders were truly foreign (from other countries).   
14:338:29023:0:28:108:510:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: It is interesting to note, by way of contrast, that manufacturing shares initially were 
14:339:29111:28:28:72:533:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:primarily owned by investors from out of state.  However, this percentage fell over time, and in 
14:340:29208:28:27:72:528:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the 1850s local residents accounted for the majority of the value of capital invested, indicating 
14:341:29306:27:28:72:491:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that they held larger average numbers of shares of the company than the nonresidents.  
14:342:29393:28:27:72:523:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Transportation was a volatile and risky industry, with booms and waves of bankruptcies from 
14:343:29485:27:28:72:514:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turnpikes through railroads and the capital structure of transportation corporations similarly 
14:344:29580:28:28:72:536:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:experiences a marked change over time.10  Initially, out-of-state investors comprised almost two 
14:345:29677:28:27:72:514:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:thirds of the shareholders, but in the 1850s this pattern is reversed, and there is a significant 
14:346:29775:27:28:72:532:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:move towards local ownership of transportation corporations.  These results are consistent with 
14:347:29871:28:27:72:531:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the view that, over the course of economic development, a process of “investor education” was 
14:348:29965:27:28:72:528:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underway.  By the end of the antebellum era, Maine residents were adopting riskier portfolios, 
14:349:30060:28:28:72:533:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and in the process, they provided funding for the enterprises that would contribute to the course 
14:350:30158:28:27:72:466:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of industrialization and rapid economic growth that occurred during this period.11 
14:351:30240:27:28:108:537:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Alexander Gerschenkron had pointed to the special role of banks in promoting economic 
14:352:30326:28:27:72:530:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:development.  Table 3 provides a useful perspective on the contribution of banks, bankers, and 
14:353:30421:27:28:72:534:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:other financial sector transactors in funding the growth process.  Banks themselves were owned 
14:354:30516:28:28:72:518:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by investors with links to finance, but these individuals accounted for only one third of bank 
14:355:30611:28:27:72:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shares.  Instead, it is interesting to note that almost one quarter of bank shares were owned by 
14:356:30708:27:28:72:520:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors with primary links to manufacturing, highlighting the symbiotic relationship which 
14:357:30801:28:18:72:533:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Lamoreaux (1996) had identified.  Only 15 percent of shares in manufacturing enterprises were 
14:358:30895:18:7:216:219:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
14:359:30948:7:16:72:500:159:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:10 It is not a coincidence that American bankruptcy law was closely tied to the experience of transportation 
14:360:31057:16:12:72:504:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:corporations and, as Skeel (2001, p. 48) points out, “the history of corporate reorganization is the history of 
14:361:31169:12:7:72:219:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:nineteenth-century railroad failure.” 
14:362:31207:7:16:72:529:124:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:11 For a study of overall transportation patterns, see Wright and Murphy (2009), showing some 7,000 private U.S. 
14:363:31320:16:11:72:526:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:corporations had been chartered in the antebellum period to operate bridges, canals, ferries, railroads, and roads.  
14:364:31437:11:12:72:505:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Private capital investment accounted for a significant share of total domestic output; according to Klein and 
14:365:31547:12:11:72:539:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Majewski (2006) cumulative private sector investment in turnpikes between 1800 and 1830 in the New England and 
14:366:31658:11:0:72:357:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Middle Atlantic states likely comprised over six percent of 1830 GDP. 
15:367:31731:0:28:72:485:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owned by manufacturers, with 41.4 percent attributed to bankers and others in related 
15:368:31817:28:28:72:524:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:occupations.12  The role of manufacturers in capitalizing transportation networks is especially 
15:369:31913:28:27:72:541:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:noteworthy.  At the other end of the spectrum, artisans and farmers played a relatively minor role 
15:370:32012:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in securities markets throughout the economy, despite their prevalence in the population at large.  
15:371:32112:28:27:108:539:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The table also brings to the fore the disproportionately high participation of professionals 
15:372:32205:27:28:72:505:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and white-collar workers in the financial underwriting of corporate enterprises in all three 
15:373:32298:28:28:72:501:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sectors.  This group might have been expected to be more risk-averse than financiers and 
15:374:32387:28:27:72:510:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturers, and to have been primarily attracted to the security and low risk of banking 
15:375:32479:27:28:72:523:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investments.  Instead, only 14.9 percent of bank stocks were owned by white-collar workers.  
15:376:32572:28:27:72:491:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Another striking result is that this class invested more in the manufacturing sector than 
15:377:32662:27:28:72:519:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholders whose occupation was in manufacturing (although obviously the table does not 
15:378:32752:28:28:72:534:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:control for income levels), and comprised the largest proportion of the funders of transportation 
15:379:32850:28:27:72:520:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporations.  This finding is different from Majewski (1996) who argued that transportation 
15:380:32943:27:28:72:513:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:improvements generated spillover benefits that encouraged farmers to pay for railroads and 
15:381:33034:28:27:72:518:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turnpikes, even if they were privately unprofitable.  While manufacturers certainly benefited 
15:382:33128:27:28:72:506:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from internal improvements, it is unlikely that professional and white collar workers were 
15:383:33219:28:28:72:228:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:motivated by such externalities. 
15:384:33252:28:27:108:539:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Table 4 reveals another departure from previous findings, regarding the role of women in 
15:385:33341:27:28:72:522:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capital mobilization for firms.  The stereotype of women investors points to their tendency to 
15:386:33436:28:27:72:529:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cluster in the banking sector, which attracts the wealth of “widows and orphans” because of its 
15:387:33532:27:37:72:530:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:familiarity and perceived low risk, derived from  fixed-income returns and predictable dividend 
15:388:33628:37:7:216:219:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
15:389:33681:7:16:72:540:113:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:12 See Fear and Kobrak (2010) who examined the role of “banks on board” and found that banks played a significant 
15:390:33795:16:12:72:517:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:role in corporate governance during the second industrial revolution, and this was especially true in the case of 
15:391:33909:12:11:72:428:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:investment banks in the United States before the advent of the Federal Reserve system.   
15:392:33998:11:0:72:74:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2: 
16:393:34001:0:28:72:503:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:flows.  Scholarly arguments tend to be based on quite limited numbers of individuals and 
16:394:34090:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:institutions; for instance, Laurence (2008) studies six customers of Hoare’s Bank in England in a 
16:395:34188:28:27:72:557:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discussion of how    women evolved from consumers of banking services to purchasers of stocks.  
16:396:34284:27:28:72:517:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Women investors in Maine typically owned disproportionately higher shares in bank stocks, 
16:397:34374:28:27:72:531:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relative to manufacturing and transportation.  Women were even the largest shareholders in the 
16:398:34469:27:28:72:511:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medomak Bank of Waldboro, and the Exchange Bank of Bangor.  The percentage share of 
16:399:34553:28:28:72:522:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:female bank stockholders increased from almost 20 percent in 1845, to 26.1 percent a decade 
16:400:34645:28:27:72:541:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:later.  As might be expected, the average size and value of their holdings was lower than those of 
16:401:34744:27:28:72:518:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:male investors.  However, over time women’s portfolios increasingly included riskier equity 
16:402:34836:28:27:72:526:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shares in manufacturing and transportation corporations.  Most notable is the rapid increase in 
16:403:34932:27:28:72:541:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ownership of transportation shares: by 1855 women comprised almost one quarter of investors in 
16:404:35027:28:28:72:524:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this sector, and the value of their investments had more than tripled to 11.4 percent of shares.  
16:405:35125:28:27:72:526:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These results are inconsistent with those of such case studies as Majewski’s, which found that 
16:406:35220:27:28:72:533:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:few females invested in transportation stocks; instead, they suggest that women investors in the 
16:407:35317:28:27:72:499:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:antebellum period may have been more similar to their male counterparts.  Women were 
16:408:35402:27:28:72:529:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increasingly drawn into underwriting securities in riskier, newer ventures, in which it might be 
16:409:35499:28:28:72:448:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expected they would tend to have possessed little information or experience.   
16:410:35578:28:27:108:521:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These patterns raise the question of the mechanisms that underlay investors’ portfolio 
16:411:35665:27:28:72:522:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decision-making.  Laurence (2008) argues that, in England, both the business of the bank and 
16:412:35758:28:27:72:508:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investments in the stock market occurred within the context of groups who were linked by 
16:413:35847:27:28:72:520:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:kinship, religion, and other noneconomic ties.  This is a plausible hypothesis but, again, such 
16:414:35943:28:28:72:502:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:studies are limited to a few examples in a single industry.  It would therefore be useful to 
16:415:36036:28:0:72:542:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:examine the extent to which related investing was prevalent, not just in a single sector, but across 
17:416:36140:0:28:72:474:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the entire economy, and how these practices varied during the process of economic 
17:417:36222:28:28:72:534:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transformation.  The next section investigates the role of family connections in the mobilization 
17:418:36320:28:27:72:211:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of capital during this period. 
17:419:36351:27:28:108:111:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: 
17:420:36351:28:27:72:215:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV. RELATED INVESTING 
17:421:36373:27:28:72:530:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The    brothers of the Richardson family of Portland, Maine were all prosperous merchants in the 
17:422:36470:28:28:72:533:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:East India trade who, along with several other family members, became key insiders in some of 
17:423:36564:28:27:72:526:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the most important new Maine ventures.  Joshua Richardson was a Maine-born founder of the 
17:424:36654:27:28:72:499:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Cumberland Bank in 1813, and also started the Merchants’ Bank with his brothers Israel 
17:425:36741:28:27:72:525:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Richardson, and William Putnam Richardson.  Joshua was involved in the Portland Gas Light 
17:426:36831:27:28:72:512:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Company, the Portland Manufacturing Company, the Maine Bank, and the Atlantic and St. 
17:427:36917:28:28:72:516:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Lawrence Railroad.  He was an officer in several other firms, and acted as the President and 
17:428:37010:28:27:72:520:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Chief Executive Officer of the Manufacturers and Traders Bank, in which his mother Eunice 
17:429:37100:27:28:72:503:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Richardson was also a prominent shareholder.13  According to the census records, Joshua 
17:430:37188:28:27:72:505:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Richardson held over $20,000 in real estate assets in 1850, while his brother Israel owned 
17:431:37279:27:28:72:529:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:$15,000.  William Putnam was subsequently President of the American Insurance Company in 
17:432:37368:28:28:72:505:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Salem, Massachusetts.  In both developed and developing societies today, this network of 
17:433:37457:28:27:72:502:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:interlocking directorships and familial ties would likely raise questions about conflicts of 
17:434:37550:27:28:72:503:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:interest, and the potential for negative outcomes such as tunneling and the exploitation of 
17:435:37642:28:27:72:176:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“outside” investors.   
17:436:37665:27:28:108:494:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Table 5 illustrates the patterns of related investing in banks, manufacturing, and 
17:437:37748:28:32:72:533:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transportation corporations, by examining the percentage of investors within each industry who 
17:438:37843:32:7:216:219:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
17:439:37896:7:16:72:535:90:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:13 In 1845 Joshua Richardson held $1100 in shares, whereas Eunice Richardson owned $2100 in the Manufacturers 
17:440:38006:16:0:72:148:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and Traders Bank. 
18:441:38027:0:28:72:541:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owned shares in firms where at least one other shareholder was a relative.  Contrary to the notion 
18:442:38126:28:28:72:510:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the demise of related investing during market expansion, the significance of kinship ties 
18:443:38219:28:27:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instead increases significantly during the period of industrialization.  In 1845, 40 percent of bank 
18:444:38320:27:28:72:532:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholders could be counted as related investors, a figure which had grown to become almost 
18:445:38414:28:27:72:483:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:half of all shareholding a decade later.  This was also true of corporations engaged in 
18:446:38502:27:28:72:539:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing and transportation.  The importance of kinship ties in manufacturing corporations 
18:447:38598:28:28:72:537:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increased to the point where more than half of the value of shares was held by related investors.  
18:448:38697:28:27:72:510:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Again, the most marked change was evident in transportation, where close to 70 percent of 
18:449:38787:27:28:72:541:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholders could be considered as related investors.  Unlike manufacturing, related investors in 
18:450:38886:28:27:72:537:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transportation enterprises held smaller stakes on average, amounting to roughly half of the value 
18:451:38984:27:28:72:121:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of shares. 
18:452:38995:28:28:108:502:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The standard studies of kinship networks in an economic context tend to focus on 
18:453:39076:28:27:72:510:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporate insiders, or officers who hold key managerial positions or directorships.  Table 6 
18:454:39169:27:28:72:499:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shows the prevalence of overall ownership and of related investing among such officers, 
18:455:39257:28:27:72:535:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:comprising treasurers, directors, or presidents in Maine corporations.  Banks and manufacturing 
18:456:39353:27:28:72:504:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exhibit similar trends over time.  First, the officers of the firm remained roughly the same 
18:457:39446:28:28:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction of the total number of shareholders: bank insiders comprised around seven percent of all 
18:458:39544:28:27:72:523:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholders; directors and other key officials in manufacturing corporations numbered about 
18:459:39637:27:28:72:517:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:four percent of the shareholders.  Second, insiders held disproportionately larger amounts of 
18:460:39731:28:27:72:529:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capital, and their ownership shares increased significantly over time.  By the end of the period, 
18:461:39829:27:28:72:504:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insiders accounted for approximately 20 percent of the capital in banks, and 23 percent in 
18:462:39920:28:0:72:511:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing enterprises.  Once again, transportation is notably different from these other 
19:463:40016:0:28:72:518:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industries, with a more “democratic” distribution of shareholders and share value among the 
19:464:40108:28:28:72:204:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:officers of the corporation. 
19:465:40137:28:27:108:533:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The distribution of ownership concentration for overall corporate insiders is reflected in 
19:466:40228:27:28:72:490:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the patterns for related investors.  In 1845 a third of all officers were related to another 
19:467:40321:28:27:72:502:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholder in the same firm, and this soon increased to over half of all insiders.  Related 
19:468:40414:27:28:72:541:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investing was largely responsible for the increase in the influence of insiders in both banking and 
19:469:40514:28:28:72:506:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing corporations.  In banks, related insiders initially owned 5.3 percent of total 
19:470:40607:28:27:72:543:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capital, and this jumped to 13.5 percent of capital by 1855.  Similarly,  manufacturing exhibited a 
19:471:40707:27:28:72:515:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sharp rise in the concentration of shares in the hands of related insiders, to 18 percent of the 
19:472:40804:28:27:72:535:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capitalization of these firms.  In the case of transportation, the level and degree of concentration 
19:473:40905:27:28:72:501:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:was significantly lower, since related inside investors owned no more than 3.6 percent of 
19:474:40995:28:28:72:167:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:outstanding shares. 
19:475:41015:28:27:108:537:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Women were far more likely to share a surname with another investor in the same firm.   
19:476:41103:27:28:72:513:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In some cases, their shares were inherited from male relatives.  For instance, in 1840 David 
19:477:41196:28:27:72:539:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Wooster, a Justice of the Peace in Vinalhaven, owned $700 in the Lime Rock Bank of Rockland, 
19:478:41288:27:28:72:526:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:without any relatives listed in the roster.  In 1845, his name does not appear among the bank’s 
19:479:41384:28:28:72:560:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholders, but the records now    include Lydia Wooster, a 66-year-old widow with $200 in real 
19:480:41482:28:27:72:508:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate wealth, holding $700 in shares of the Lime Rock Bank of Rockland.  Her unmarried 
19:481:41570:27:28:72:519:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:daughter, 31-year-old Jane Wooster, who lived in the same household, owned $100 worth of 
19:482:41659:28:27:72:488:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shares in the same bank.  But apart from passively inheriting shares, women were also 
19:483:41745:27:28:72:530:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:represented as shareholders who had made active decisions about how to allocate their wealth.  
19:484:41840:28:0:72:518:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:When the York Bank was first incorporated in 1831, its biggest shareholder was the wealthy 
20:485:41934:0:28:72:531:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:widow Sarah Cleaves, followed by her children, Mary and Daniel.14  In 1845, after the death of 
20:486:42029:28:28:72:538:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their mother, Mary Cleaves became the majority shareholder, and owned 10 percent of the bank; 
20:487:42123:28:27:72:508:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereas, her brother Daniel Cleaves was the second-largest shareholder, and served as the 
20:488:42213:27:28:72:541:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:President of the bank from 1849 through 1865.  However, even if they were active investors, it is 
20:489:42311:28:27:72:507:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:impossible to determine whether these female related shareholders made decisions wholly 
20:490:42399:27:28:72:506:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:independently, or whether they were following the advice of relatives with more financial 
20:491:42489:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:experience.  In any event, the general point is that, whether as active or passive investors, women 
20:492:42589:28:27:72:448:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were more likely to be involved in financial decisions as part of a family unit. 
20:493:42670:27:28:108:509:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: We can gain more insights into the characteristics of related investing if we exploit 
20:494:42756:28:27:72:533:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variation in investments across industries in terms of gender.  Table 7 shows that the number of 
20:495:42853:27:28:72:538:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:women shareholders increased from 385 (8.9 percent of the total) in 1845 to 1681 (15.4 percent) 
20:496:42949:28:28:72:542:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a decade later.  In 1845, 57.9 of women appeared on the roster of related investors, growing to 66 
20:497:43048:28:27:72:542:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent in 1855, in comparison to the 30.4 percent of men who were related to other shareholders 
20:498:43145:27:28:72:530:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in 1845, and 54 percent in 1855.  Part of the rising prominence of related investors owed to the 
20:499:43242:28:27:72:531:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:experience of women shareholders in transportation enterprises.  By the end of the period, 78.5 
20:500:43338:27:28:72:521:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent of female stockholders in railroads, turnpikes, bridges, and similar corporations were 
20:501:43433:28:28:72:528:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:related to other investors in the same firm, significantly higher than the 50.7 percent in banks.  
20:502:43532:28:27:72:494:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The lower prevalence of related investing in the stable banking industry, and the higher 
20:503:43621:27:28:72:519:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:incidence in transportation suggests that kinship ties played a role in attenuating transactions 
20:504:43718:28:29:72:504:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs in more venturesome enterprises.15  In particular, it is likely that the burden of these 
20:505:43813:29:8:216:219:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
20:506:43866:8:16:72:540:147:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:14 The patriarch of the Cleaves family, the Daniel Cleaves Sr., had died in 1817 leaving the largest estate in Maine at 
20:507:43986:16:11:72:544:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that time, created from diverse successful investments and businesses in shipping, banking, land, and manufacturing.  
20:508:44104:11:12:72:541:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Daniel Cleaves Jr. was around 25 years of age when the decision was made to contribute to the founding of the York 
20:509:44219:12:7:72:98:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Bank. 
20:510:44225:7:16:72:539:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:15 Majewski (1996) similarly concludes from his study of transportation corporations in two counties in PA and VA, 
20:511:44340:16:11:72:522:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that kinship was a means of reducing transactions costs (in this case, a free rider problem).  He found that 40-50 
20:512:44455:11:0:72:405:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:percent of the shareholders in most of these enterprises shared the same surname.   
21:513:44542:0:28:72:534:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transactions costs were disproportionately felt by women and other groups that were financially 
21:514:44638:28:28:72:429:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uneducated, less wealthy, or otherwise disadvantaged at equity investing.  
21:515:44713:28:27:108:519:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The notion that related investing aided in the democratization of securities markets is 
21:516:44801:27:28:72:555:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supported by the kernel density distributions of related and unrelated investors, both    in terms of 
21:517:44903:28:27:72:535:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the value of shareholding (Figure 3) and the amount of real estate wealth    in their investment 
21:518:45000:27:28:72:520:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolio (Figure 4).16  Just as in the case of the kernel density estimate of the value of shares 
21:519:45099:28:28:72:529:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:held, there is greater “heaping” for related investors at the lower tails of the distribution of real 
21:520:45201:28:27:72:531:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate wealth, as well as in personal wealth (figure not included).  The density estimates for the 
21:521:45300:27:28:72:513:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transportation corporations and other enterprises are noticeably skewed leftward for related 
21:522:45393:28:27:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors, and to a greater extent than in the case of unrelated investors.  This result suggests that 
21:523:45496:27:28:72:535:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the current tendency for researchers to focus almost exclusively on the kinship networks of elite 
21:524:45594:28:28:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors is likely to miss what may be other crucial functions of related investing.  Indeed, these 
21:525:45695:28:27:72:515:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distributions provide visual confirmation that kinship ties were especially relevant for small 
21:526:45790:27:28:72:316:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors and individuals who were less wealthy.   
21:527:45841:28:27:108:529:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: What was the impact of related investing on ownership in the firm?  The regressions in 
21:528:45928:27:28:72:535:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 8 examine the effects of related investing, ceteris paribus, on the shareholders’ ownership 
21:529:46026:28:28:72:537:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stake in the firm, or the fraction of total shares that the individual holds.17  The cross-tabulations 
21:530:46129:28:27:72:531:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:had indicated that banks, manufacturing, and transportation corporations were characterized by 
21:531:46224:27:23:72:538:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different processes and outcomes.  Diffuse ownership in these industries was also determined by 
21:532:46320:23:7:216:219:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                      
21:533:46373:7:16:72:539:182:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:16  Kernel density estimation creates a hypothesized probability density function from the shareholder observations.  
21:534:46491:16:12:72:527:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A Gaussian density function was used as the kernel and nonparametric techniques were employed for the density 
21:535:46601:12:7:72:123:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:estimation.   
21:536:46615:7:16:72:501:147:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:17 Regressions were also run that allowed the coefficients and intercepts to vary over each time period, and 
21:537:46724:16:11:72:531:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:controlled for the size of the firm in terms of the number of stockholders, and for the age and location of the firm.  
21:538:46843:11:12:72:519:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:These results confirmed that ownership by local Maine residents rose in each subsequent year.  Shareholders in 
21:539:46954:12:11:72:507:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:transportation held lower amounts of ownership rights initially, but by 1855 they owned significantly higher 
21:540:47063:11:12:72:531:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fractions of total equity in corporations.  Related investing had grown over time, but the pattern was not due to the 
21:541:47181:12:11:72:516:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:elite insiders in the firm, it was rather because of the higher percentage of shares held by the “outsider” related 
21:542:47297:11:0:72:113:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:investors. 
22:543:47311:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:varying factors.  For instance, in banking and manufacturing, farming areas were associated with 
22:544:47408:28:28:72:541:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher ownership concentration, but in transportation enterprises lower concentration occurred in 
22:545:47506:28:27:72:518:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more prosperous farming regions.  For banks, older firms had lower concentration of shares, 
22:546:47598:27:28:72:533:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:while the opposite was true of railroads.  As one would expect, in all corporations directors and 
22:547:47696:28:27:72:519:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:other officers owned larger fractions of shares, and this was especially true of manufacturing 
22:548:47791:27:28:72:526:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms.  The less advantaged shareholders, such as women investors, owned lower stakes in the 
22:549:47884:28:28:72:478:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:banking and manufacturing enterprises, but they held larger proportions of equity in 
22:550:47969:28:27:72:527:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transportation.  Directors in transportation held higher amounts of shares, but related investors 
22:551:48067:27:28:72:528:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were associated with concentration to an even greater extent.  This result is consistent with the 
22:552:48165:28:27:72:518:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hypothesis that kinship networks encouraged their members to reduce perceived riskiness of 
22:553:48256:27:28:72:519:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investments.  Related investing arguably promoted a democratization of capital mobilization 
22:554:48348:28:28:72:236:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during the early industrial period. 
22:555:48384:28:27:108:520:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The regressions in Table 9 show the determinants of variation in “persistence,” or the 
22:556:48471:27:28:72:524:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:holding of shares in a company for more than five years.  As might be expected, concentrated 
22:557:48564:28:27:72:504:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ownership (a higher fraction of equity held by an investor) was positively associated with 
22:558:48655:27:28:72:512:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:persistence.  Elite officers of the firm, such as the President, were also more likely to retain 
22:559:48752:28:28:72:516:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shares for longer periods, but occupation in general (such as white-collar status, or financial 
22:560:48848:28:27:72:527:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:backgrounds) was not a significant explanatory factory.  Women were more apt to hold shares 
22:561:48940:27:28:72:526:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for a shorter period, which is perhaps consistent with the notion of passive investing.  Perhaps 
22:562:49037:28:27:72:542:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unexpectedly, manufacturing shareholders tended to be longer-term investors, relative to banking 
22:563:49134:27:28:72:493:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or transportation.  The regression results suggest a positive role for related investing, in 
22:564:49227:28:28:72:507:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:explaining persistence of both elite investors with family ties, as well as the persistence of 
22:565:49322:28:0:72:163:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nonelite investors.

23:567:49345:28:28:72:171:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV. CONCLUSION 
23:568:49360:28:27:72:513:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Related investing refers to family ties among the owners of firms, and has been found to be 
23:569:49452:27:28:72:508:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pervasive in most parts of the world.  Research has primarily focused on kinship networks 
23:570:49542:28:27:72:522:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among elite investors such as corporate insiders, ignoring the characteristics of the rest of the 
23:571:49640:27:28:72:514:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:population of shareholders.  From this perspective, related investing in securities markets is 
23:572:49735:28:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:typically held as anomalous and suspect, raising the possibility that insiders are taking advantage 
23:573:49835:28:27:72:496:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of their family relationships to avoid or manipulate governance oversight.  The negative 
23:574:49924:27:28:72:527:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:connotations are highlighted in regions where institutions are opaque and external controls are 
23:575:50020:28:27:72:534:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nonexistent or ineffective; the use of kinship ties might compound the problem of corruption by 
23:576:50116:27:28:72:511:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:circumventing internal controls within the corporation.  In short, related investing has been 
23:577:50210:28:28:72:504:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regarded with caution because it has the potential to serve as a mechanism through which 
23:578:50299:28:27:72:526:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:resources within the firm are redistributed to the elite owners.  Even in studies where personal 
23:579:50396:27:28:72:514:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ties are acknowledged to play a productive role, such as overcoming transactions costs, it is 
23:580:50490:28:27:72:513:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:generally argued that their influence should decline and disappear as markets become more 
23:581:50580:27:28:72:207:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:developed and impersonal.  
23:582:50607:28:28:108:538:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The current project employs a more extensive data set of shareholders and firms than has 
23:583:50696:28:27:72:497:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:previously been available to reexamine the debate about related investing.  The scope of 
23:584:50785:27:28:72:473:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coverage encompasses a period when the economy of Maine was undergoing rapid 
23:585:50862:28:27:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industrialization, and many of its corporations were leaders in the national sphere.  It is generally 
23:586:50964:27:28:72:479:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:agreed that Maine institutions were effective and transparent, and helped to promote 
23:587:51049:28:28:72:527:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:technological change and economic growth.  The results confirm that elite insiders, officers of 
23:588:51145:28:0:72:514:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the firm including treasurers, directors, and its presidents, were typically connected to other 
24:589:51244:0:28:72:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shareholders in the corporation.  These familial networks did not decline over time, instead, they 
24:590:51343:28:28:72:539:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increased as the economy developed.  Moreover, it is striking that, when the analysis is extended 
24:591:51441:28:27:72:535:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to all shareholders in the firm, the same patterns are detected; outsiders were able to overcome a 
24:592:51540:27:28:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lack of experience and information by taking advantage of their own networks.   As such, related 
24:593:51637:28:27:72:522:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investing seems to have been a universal feature of equity markets in the antebellum period.   
24:594:51732:27:28:108:526:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: This leads to the question of why kinship ties existed, not just among insiders, but also 
24:595:51822:28:28:72:536:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among outside shareholders.  At least one implication is that, although insiders might attempt to 
24:596:51920:28:27:72:500:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:use family networks to exploit other shareholders, their ability to tunnel is limited by the 
24:597:52013:27:28:72:527:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coun tervailing power of family networks among outsiders.  Rather than seeking to expropriate 
24:598:52107:28:27:72:541:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their peers, related founders of Maine corporations introduced institutional mechanisms to ensure 
24:599:52205:27:28:72:518:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transparency, disclosure and monitoring of the financial and accounting status of the firm.     
24:600:52301:28:28:72:509:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Ideally, one would wish to determine whether related investing was associated with higher 
24:601:52391:28:27:72:523:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:earnings or profits but, in the absence of the necessary data, a systematic analysis of variation 
24:602:52489:27:28:72:527:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:across such factors as industry, gender, wealth, ownership concentration, and persistence shed 
24:603:52584:28:27:72:284:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:some light on the underlying mechanisms.   
24:604:52627:27:28:108:495:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The variation in the patterns that existed across the banking, manufacturing, and 
24:605:52709:28:28:72:511:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transportation sectors suggests that family networks may have served to attenuate risks and 
24:606:52801:28:27:72:502:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transactions costs, especially for inexperienced investors.  The expansion of the railroads 
24:607:52893:27:28:72:521:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:required and attracted extensive investments in securities markets, that primarily consisted of 
24:608:52989:28:27:72:522:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:small investors who were likely to have been uneducated about financial assets.  Women and 
24:609:53080:27:28:72:524:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:comparatively disadvantaged newcomers with lower stocks of personal and real estate wealth 
24:610:53171:28:28:72:521:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were induced into making contributions to capital mobilization, perhaps because the external 
24:611:53264:28:0:72:516:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:benefits offered by their kinship networks reduced transactions costs.  Investors with family 
25:612:53361:0:28:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:connections, for instance, were significantly more likely to persist in holding shares over a longer 
25:613:53462:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:term.  Finally, the analysis of the effects of related investing on the concentration of ownership in 
25:614:53564:28:27:72:500:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the corporations suggests that this phenomenon was likely associated with a reduction in 
25:615:53653:27:28:72:490:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:perceptions of risk, especially in the context of the mobilization of “venture capital” in 
25:616:53744:28:27:72:534:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing and transportation. This may in part explain why, instead of declining over time, 
25:617:53840:27:28:72:214:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:related investing increased.    
25:618:53872:28:28:108:525:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The analysis here has more general implications for our understanding of the nature of 
25:619:53959:28:27:72:510:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the firm.  Standard approaches tend to be based on a dichotomy between family businesses 
25:620:54048:27:28:72:510:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:where governance might be compromised by personal tastes and affinities; and impersonal 
25:621:54136:28:27:72:524:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corporations that are run by managers whose decisions are independent of the identities of the 
25:622:54231:27:28:72:528:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owners.  Alfred Chandler even contended that the British owed its loss of industrial leadership 
25:623:54327:28:28:72:530:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owing to the prevalence of its style of “personal capitalism” based on family ownership.  Khan 
25:624:54422:28:27:72:484:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2016), however, showed that family firms in France were able to compensate for the 
25:625:54506:27:28:72:536:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:institutional disadvantages that women entrepreneurs confronted.  The results from this study of 
25:626:54603:28:27:72:532:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extensive personal elements in shareholding throughout a successfully industrializing economy 
25:627:54697:27:28:72:542:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instead suggests that the extent of personal ownership in firms lies along a continuum.   Just as in 
25:628:54798:28:28:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:family firms, related ownership in corporations can play a productive role in the democratization 
25:629:54896:28:26:72:432:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and dynamics of capital mobilization during early economic development.
