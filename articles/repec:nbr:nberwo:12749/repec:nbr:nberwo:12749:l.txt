2:24:1120:28:28:306:339:616:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:25:1128:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We study the formation of a ruling coalition in political environments.  Each individual is endowed
2:26:1227:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:with a level of political power.  The ruling coalition consists of a subset of the individuals in the society
2:27:1336:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:and decides the distribution of resources.  A ruling coalition needs to contain enough powerful members
2:28:1439:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:to win against any alternative coalition that may challenge it, and it needs to be self-enforcing, in the
2:29:1544:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:sense that none of its sub-coalitions should be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition.
2:30:1643:14:14:72:539:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:We first present an axiomatic approach that captures these notions and determines a (generically)
2:31:1740:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:unique ruling coalition.  We then construct a simple dynamic game that encompasses these ideas and
2:32:1838:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:prove that the sequentially weakly dominant equilibria (and the Markovian trembling hand perfect
2:33:1934:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:equilibria) of this game coincide with the set of ruling coalitions of the axiomatic approach.  We also
2:34:2037:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:show the equivalence of these notions to the core of a related non-transferable utility cooperative game.
2:35:2142:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:In all cases, the nature of the ruling coalition is determined by the power constraint, which requires
2:36:2244:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:that the ruling coalition be powerful enough, and by the enforcement constraint, which imposes that
2:37:2343:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:no sub-coalition of the ruling coalition that commands a majority is self-enforcing.  The key insight
2:38:2444:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:F:that emerges from this characterization is that the coalition is made self-enforcing precisely by the
2:39:2545:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:F:failure of its winning sub-coalitions to be self-enforcing.  This is most simply illustrated by the following
2:40:2654:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:F:simple finding: with a simple majority rule, while three-person (or larger) coalitions can be self-enforcing,
2:41:2763:14:14:72:540:364:12:Times:12:Times:F:two-person coalitions are generically not self-enforcing.  Therefore, the reasoning in this paper suggests
2:42:2869:14:14:72:540:350:12:Times:12:Times:F:that three-person juntas or councils should be more common than two-person ones.  In addition, we
2:43:2966:14:14:72:540:336:12:Times:12:Times:F:provide conditions under which the grand coalition will be the ruling coalition and conditions under
2:44:3066:14:14:72:540:322:12:Times:12:Times:F:which the most powerful individuals will not be included in the ruling coalition.  We also use this
2:45:3165:14:28:72:316:308:12:Times:12:Times:F:framework to discuss endogenous party formation.

3:63:3508:0:30:72:201:714:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:1Introduction
3:64:3521:30:20:72:539:684:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Consider a society in which each individual possesses some amount of military power (“guns”) and
3:65:3617:20:20:72:539:664:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:can form a “coalition” with other individuals tofight against the remaining individuals. A group
3:66:3713:20:20:72:539:644:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(coalition) that has sufficient power becomes the “ruling coalition”; it determines the allocation of
3:67:3814:20:20:72:540:624:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:resources in the society, e.g., how a pie of size 1 will be distributed. A group with more guns can
3:68:3913:20:20:72:540:604:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:eliminate (win against) a group with less guns. However, once the elimination has taken place, a
3:69:4009:20:19:72:539:584:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:subgroup within the winning group can engage in further rounds of eliminations in order to reduce
3:70:4106:19:20:72:540:565:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the size of the ruling coalition and receive more for each of its members. What types of ruling
3:71:4201:20:20:72:539:545:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions do we expect to form? Will there generally be multiple “equilibrium” or “stable” ruling
3:72:4299:20:20:72:473:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions? Will more powerful individuals necessarily obtain more of the resources?
3:73:4383:20:20:88:539:505:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Consider an alternative scenario in which a group of individuals needs to form a committee to
3:74:4476:20:20:72:540:485:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:reach a decision. A group that has a (power-weighted) majority can impose the selection of a par-
3:75:4573:20:20:72:539:465:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ticular committee, thus potentially influencing the collective choice. However, once the committee
3:76:4671:20:19:72:540:445:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:forms, a subgroup within the committee may sideline some of the members and impose its own
3:77:4761:19:20:72:345:426:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:rule. What types of committees do we expect to emerge?
3:78:4815:20:20:88:539:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The key feature in both of these examples is that the structure and nature of the ruling coalition
3:79:4913:20:20:72:539:386:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:depends not only the power of different groups (coalitions), but also whether, once formed, a
3:80:5006:20:20:71:539:366:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:particular group will be stable, i.e.,self-enforcing. This tension between the power and the stability
3:81:5108:20:20:71:539:346:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of a group is a common feature in many situations where coalitions have to form in order to make
3:82:5204:20:19:71:347:326:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:collective choices or determine the allocation of resources.
3:83:5264:19:20:88:539:307:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:To investigate these questions systematically, we consider a society consisting of afinite number
3:84:5361:20:20:71:539:287:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of individuals, each with an exogenously given level of political power.1A group’s power is the sum
3:85:5460:20:20:72:539:267:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of the power of its members. The society has afixed resource, e.g., a pie of size 1. The distribution
3:86:5561:20:20:72:548:247:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of this resource among the individualsis determined by a (self-enforcing)ruling coalition.For
3:87:5654:20:20:71:539:227:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:concreteness, let us suppose that aruling coalition distributes this resource among its members
3:88:5749:20:20:71:539:207:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:according to their political power. A ruling coalition needs to satisfy two requirements. First, it
3:89:5848:20:19:71:539:187:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:needs to have total power more thanα∈[1/2,1)times the power of all the individuals in society,
3:90:5942:19:20:72:539:168:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:so that it is awinningcoalition. This is captured by thepower constraint. Second, it should have
3:91:6038:20:20:71:539:148:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:no subcoalition that would be willing to secede and become the new ruling coalition, so that it is
3:92:6136:20:20:71:509:128:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:self-enforcing or stable. This second requirement is captured by theenforcement constraint.
3:93:6227:20:16:88:539:108:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:We show that a subcoalition will be self-enforcing if its own winning subcoalitions are not self-
3:94:6324:16:15:84:539:92:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:1Throughout, we will work with a society consisting of individuals. Groups that have solved their internal collective
3:95:6441:15:0:72:512:77:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:action problem and have well-defined preferences can be considered as equivalent to individuals in this game.
4:96:6551:0:20:72:540:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing. Intuitively, any subcoalition that is both winning and self-enforcing will secede from the
4:97:6652:20:19:72:540:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:original coalition and obtain more for its members. Subcoalitions that are not self-enforcing will
4:98:6750:19:20:72:540:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:prefer not to secede because some of their members will realize that they will be left out of the
4:99:6847:20:20:72:402:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ultimate ruling coalition at the next round of secession (elimination).
4:100:6918:20:20:88:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:One of the simple but interesting implications of these interactions is that under majority rule,
4:101:7015:20:20:72:540:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ruling coalitions are generically (in a sense to be made precise below) not two-person coalitions,
4:102:7113:20:32:72:369:595:121:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f2:C:duumvirates, but can be three-person coalitions,triumvirates.2
4:103:7175:32:19:72:539:563:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Example 1Consider two agentsAandBwith powersγA>0andγB>0and assume that the
4:104:7249:19:20:72:544:544:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:decision-making rule requires power-weighted majority (i.e.,α=1/2). IfγA>γB,thenstarting
4:105:7337:20:20:71:539:524:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:with a coalition of agentsAandB,theagentAwill form a majority by himself. Conversely, if
4:106:7425:20:20:71:539:504:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:γA<γB, then agentBwill form a majority. Thus, “generically” (i.e., as long asγA6=γB), one of
4:107:7517:20:20:71:539:484:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the members of the two-person coalition can secede and form a subcoalition that is powerful enough
4:108:7615:20:20:71:539:464:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:within the original coalition. Since each agent will receive a higher share of the scarce resources in a
4:109:7719:20:20:71:539:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalition that consists of only himself than in a two-person coalition, such a coalition, a duumvirate,
4:110:7822:20:19:71:221:424:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is generically not self-enforcing.
4:111:7856:19:20:88:539:405:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Now, consider a coalition consisting of three agents,A,BandCwith powersγA,γBandγC,
4:112:7938:20:20:72:539:385:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and suppose thatγA<γB<γC<γA+γB. Clearly no two-person coalition is self-enforcing.
4:113:8020:20:20:72:539:365:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:The lack of self-enforcing subcoalitions of(A,B,C), in turn, implies that(A,B,C)is itself self-
4:114:8115:20:20:72:539:345:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing.  To see this, suppose, for example, that a subcoalition of(A,B,C),(A,B)considers
4:115:8206:20:20:72:547:325:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:seceding from the original coalition.  They can do so sinceγA+γB>γC.However,weknow
4:116:8288:20:19:71:539:305:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:from the previous paragraph that the subcoalition(A,B)is itself not self-enforcing, since after
4:117:8383:19:20:71:539:286:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:B:this coalition is established, agentBwould secede or “eliminate”A. Anticipating this, agentA
4:118:8475:20:20:71:539:266:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:would not support the subcoalition(A,B). A similar argument applies for all other subcoalitions.
4:119:8571:20:20:71:539:246:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, since agentCis not powerful enough to secede from the original coalition by himself,
4:120:8665:20:20:71:540:226:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the three-person coalition(A,B,C)is self-enforcing.  Consequently, a triumvirate can be self-
4:121:8758:20:20:71:539:206:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing and become the ruling coalition. This example also shows that contrary to approaches
4:122:8852:20:20:71:540:186:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:with unrestricted side-payments (e.g., Riker, 1962), the ruling coalition will not generally be the
4:123:8951:20:19:71:360:166:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:minimal winning coalition (which is(A,B)in this example).
4:124:9008:19:20:88:539:147:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Next, consider a society consisting of four individuals. To illustrate the main ideas, suppose
4:125:9102:20:20:71:539:127:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that we haveγA=3,γB=4,γC=5as well as an additional individual,D,withpowerγD=10.
4:126:9181:20:17:71:539:107:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:D’s power is insufficient to eliminate the coalition(A,B,C)starting from the initial coalition
4:127:9275:17:14:84:539:90:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:2Duumvirate and triumvirate are, respectively, the terms given to two-man and three-man executive bodies in
4:128:9382:14:0:72:132:76:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:Ancient Rome.
5:129:9396:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:(A,B,C,D). Nevertheless,Dis stronger than any two ofA,B,C. This implies that any three-
5:130:9483:20:19:72:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:B:person coalition that includesDwould not be self-enforcing. Anticipating this, any two of(A,B,C)
5:131:9579:19:20:71:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:would resistD’s offer to secede and eliminate the third. However,(A,B,C)is self-enforcing, thus
5:132:9674:20:20:71:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the three agents would be happy to eliminateD. Therefore, in this example, the ruling coalition
5:133:9769:20:20:71:519:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:again consists of three individuals, but interestingly excludes the most powerful individualD.
5:134:9863:20:20:88:540:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:A:The most powerful individual is not always eliminated. Consider the society withγA=2,γB=
5:135:9951:20:20:72:539:595:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:4,γC=7andγD=10. In this case, among the three-person coalitions only(B,C,D)is self-
5:136:10034:20:30:72:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing, thusB,CandDwill eliminate the weakest individual,A, and become the ruling coalition.
5:137:10129:30:20:88:539:545:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:This example highlights the central roles of the power and the enforcement constraints, which
5:138:10222:20:20:72:549:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:are illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 for a society with three members,(A,B,C).The

5:140:10406:20:19:72:539:485:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:normalized to 1 without loss of generality). The shaded area in thefirst panel is the set of all

5:146:10779:20:20:71:539:207:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:other players are eliminated, the subcoalition still remains self-enforcing. The second panel depicts

5:152:11332:11:7:72:361:106:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:and to a(|N|−|X|−1)-dimensional facet containing all other vertices.
5:153:11400:7:15:84:540:99:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:4More generally, forN>3and a proper coalitionX, the enforcement constraint defines a quasi-cone, that is, a
5:154:11507:15:11:72:540:84:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:union of all segments that connect any point from the(|N|−|X|−1)-dimensional facet containing all vertices from

6:156:11720:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:A:Using thisfigure, we can determine the distributionsof powers for which the subcoalition(A,B)
6:157:11813:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:can emerge as the ruling coalition within(A,B,C). First, it needs to be powerful enough, i.e., lie
6:158:11911:19:20:72:540:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in the shaded area in thefirst panel. Second, it needs to be self-enforcing, i.e., lie in the cone of
6:159:12012:20:20:72:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcement in the second panel. Clearly, whenα=1/2, only a segment of the line where the
6:160:12101:20:20:72:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:powers ofAandBare equal can satisfy these constraints, which captures the result in Example
6:161:12192:20:20:72:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:1 that, generically, a two-person coalition cannot become a ruling coalition under majority rule.
6:162:12289:20:20:72:539:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:More generally, a coalitionXcan threaten the stability of the grand coalition only if both the
6:163:12383:20:20:71:320:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:power and the enforcement constraints are satisfied.
6:164:12435:20:19:88:539:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Ourfirst major result is that an axiomatic approach to the determination of the ruling coalition
6:165:12531:19:20:71:539:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:using these two notions, together with two other technical axioms, is sufficient to single out a unique
6:166:12634:20:20:71:539:516:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ruling coalition in generic games. We achieve this by defining a mapping from the set of coalitions
6:167:12733:20:20:71:539:496:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of the society into itself that satisfies the above-mentioned axioms. When applied to the entire
6:168:12829:20:20:71:296:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:society, this mapping gives theruling coalition.
6:169:12877:20:20:88:539:456:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:That this axiomatic approach and the notion of ruling coalition capture important aspects of the
6:170:12973:20:19:71:539:436:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:process of coalition formation in political gamesis reinforced by our analysis of a simple dynamic
6:171:13071:19:20:71:539:417:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:game of coalition formation. In particular, we consider a dynamic game where at each stage a
6:172:13163:20:20:71:539:397:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:subset of the agents forms a coalition and “eliminates” those outside the coalition. The game ends
6:173:13261:20:20:71:539:377:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:when an ultimate ruling coalition, which does not wish to engage in further elimination, emerges.
6:174:13358:20:20:71:539:357:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:This ultimate ruling coalition divides the resources among its members according to their power.
6:175:13454:20:20:71:539:337:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:The important assumptions here are as follows. First, a player who is eliminated at any point
6:176:13547:20:19:71:539:317:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:cannot join future coalitions. This is in line with the motivating examples given above. Second,
6:177:13643:19:20:71:539:298:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:there is no possibility of commitment to the division of the resources once the ruling coalition is
6:178:13742:20:20:71:539:278:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:established. This no-commitment assumption is natural in political games, since it is impossible to
6:179:13841:20:20:71:539:258:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:make commitments or write contracts on future political decisions.5We establish the existence and
6:180:13938:20:20:72:540:238:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:generic uniqueness of sequentially weakly dominant and Markov trembling hand perfect equilibria
6:181:14033:20:20:72:539:218:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of this dynamic game.6We also show that these equilibrium outcomes coincide with the ruling
6:182:14124:20:16:72:295:198:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalition derived from the axiomatic approach.
6:183:14170:16:14:84:540:182:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:5See Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) for a discussion. Browne and Franklin (1973), Browne and Frendreis (1980),
6:184:14278:14:11:72:539:168:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:Schoffield and Laver (1985), and Warwick and Druckman (2001) provide empirical evidence consistent with the notion
6:185:14392:11:11:72:540:157:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:that ruling coalitions share resources according to thepowers of their members. For example, these papersfind a
6:186:14503:11:11:72:539:146:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:linear relationship between parties’ shares of parliamentary seats (a proxy for their political power) and their shares
6:187:14622:11:11:72:539:135:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:of cabinet positions (“their share of the pie”). Ansolabehere et al. (2005)find a similar relationship between cabinet
6:188:14740:11:11:72:540:124:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:positions and voting weights (which are even more closely related to political power in our model) and note that:
6:189:14853:11:11:72:539:113:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:“The relationship is so strong and robust that some researchers call it ‘Gamson’s Law’ (after Gamson, 1961, who was
6:190:14968:11:7:72:236:102:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:thefirst to predict such a relationship).”
6:191:15010:7:15:84:540:95:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:6In fact, we establish the more general result that allagenda-setting games(as defined below) have a sequentially
6:192:15123:15:0:72:396:80:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:weakly dominant equilibrium and a Markov trembling hand perfect equilibrium.
7:193:15200:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we show that the same solution emerges when we model the process of coalition forma-
7:194:15293:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tion as a non-transferable utility cooperative game incorporating the notion that only self-enforcing
7:195:15394:19:20:71:443:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions can implement allocations that give high payoffstotheirmembers.
7:196:15468:20:20:88:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:At some level, it may not be surprising that all these approaches lead to the same result,
7:197:15558:20:20:71:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:since they capture the same salient features of the process of collective decision-making–the power
7:198:15657:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and the enforcement constraints. Nevertheless,the three approaches model these features in very
7:199:15752:20:20:71:497:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:different ways. We thereforefind it reassuring that they all lead to the same conclusions.
7:200:15842:20:31:88:500:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our substantive results relate to the structure of ruling coalitions in this environment:
7:201:15931:31:20:85:539:544:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:1. There always exists a ruling coalition andit can be computed by induction on the number of
7:202:16024:20:29:99:135:524:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:players.
7:203:16032:29:20:85:539:495:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:2. Despite the simplicity of the environment, the ruling coalition can consist of any number of
7:204:16127:20:20:99:539:475:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:players, and may include or exclude the most powerful individuals in the society.  Conse-
7:205:16216:20:29:99:476:455:121:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:A:quently, the equilibrium payoffof an individual is not monotonic in his power.7
7:206:16295:29:19:85:539:426:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:3. Relatedly, the most powerful individual will be excluded from the ruling coalition, unless he
7:207:16391:19:20:99:539:407:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:is powerful enough to win by himself or weak enough so as to be part of smaller self-enforcing
7:208:16485:20:29:99:147:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:coalitions.
7:209:16496:29:20:85:540:358:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:4. Again somewhat paradoxically, an increase inα, i.e., an increase in the degree of superma-
7:210:16589:20:20:99:539:338:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:jority, does not necessarily lead to larger ruling coalitions, because it stabilizes otherwise
7:211:16683:20:20:99:539:318:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:non-self-enforcing subcoalitions, and as a result, destroys larger coalitions that would have
7:212:16776:20:28:99:291:298:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:been self-enforcing for lower values ofα.
7:213:16817:28:20:85:539:270:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:5. Self-enforcing coalitions are generally “fragile.” For example, under majority rule, i.e.,
7:214:16910:20:20:99:539:250:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:A:α=1/2, adding or subtracting one player from a self-enforcing coalition makes it non-
7:215:16995:20:29:99:164:230:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:self-enforcing.
7:216:17010:29:20:85:539:201:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:6. Nevertheless,rulingcoalitions are (generically) continuous in the distribution of power across
7:217:17107:20:20:99:539:181:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:individuals in the sense that a ruling coalition remains so when the powers of the players are
7:218:17201:20:28:99:242:161:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:perturbed by a small amount.
7:219:17229:28:20:85:540:133:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:7. Coalitions of certain sizes are more likely to emerge as the ruling coalition. For example, with
7:220:17328:20:17:99:539:113:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:majority rule, the ruling coalition cannot (generically) consist of two individuals. Moreover,
7:221:17422:17:15:84:539:96:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:7In terms of ourfirst motivating example, this implies that individuals may wish to “give up their guns” voluntarily
7:222:17538:15:0:72:539:81:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:as a “commitment” not to overpower members of certain coalitions and thus be accepted as part of these coalitions.
8:223:17653:0:20:99:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:again under majority rule, coalitions where members have relatively equal powers are self-
8:224:17743:20:31:99:436:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:enforcing only when the coalition’s size is2k−1wherekis an integer.
8:225:17810:31:20:88:539:663:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our paper is related to a number of different literatures. Thefirst is the social choice litera-
8:226:17906:20:20:71:539:643:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ture. The difficulty of determining the social welfare function of a society highlighted by Arrow’s
8:227:18005:20:20:71:540:623:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(im)possibility theorem is related to the fact that the core of the game defined over the allocation of

8:229:18202:20:20:71:539:583:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:on a weaker notion than the core, whereby only “self-enforcing” coalitions are allowed to form. Our
8:230:18301:20:19:71:540:563:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:paper therefore contributes to the collective choice literature by considering a different notion of
8:231:18401:19:20:71:475:544:121:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:aggregating individual preferences and establishes that such aggregation is possible.8
8:232:18487:20:20:88:539:524:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our work is also related to models of bargaining over resources, both generally and in the
8:233:18577:20:20:71:539:504:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:context of political decision-making. In political economy (collective choice) context, two different
8:234:18678:20:20:71:539:484:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:approaches are worth noting. Thefirst is given by the legislative bargaining models (e.g., Baron
8:235:18774:20:20:71:539:464:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and Ferejohn, 1989, Calvert and Dietz, 1996, Jackson and Boaz, 2002), which characterize the
8:236:18866:20:20:71:539:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes of bargaining among a set of players by assuming specific game-forms approximating the
8:237:18961:20:19:71:539:424:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:legislative bargaining process in practice. Our approach differs from this strand of the literature,

8:239:19151:20:20:71:539:385:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Shubik (1954) on power struggles in committees and the paper by Aumann and Kurz (1977), which
8:240:19244:20:20:71:539:365:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:looks at the Shapley value of a bargaining game to determine the distribution of resources in the
8:241:19341:20:20:71:540:345:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:society.9Our approach is different since we focus on the endogenously-emerging ruling coalition
8:242:19436:20:20:72:540:325:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:rather than bargaining among the entire set ofagents in a society or in an exogenously-formed
8:243:19529:20:19:72:125:305:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:committee.
8:244:19539:19:20:88:539:286:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:At a more abstract level, our approach is a contribution to the literature on equilibrium coalition
8:245:19638:20:20:72:540:266:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:formation, which combines elements from both cooperative and noncooperative game theory (e.g.,
8:246:19732:20:20:72:540:246:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Peleg, 1980, Hart and Kurz, 1983, Aumann and Myerson, 1988, Greenberg and Weber, 1993,
8:247:19818:20:20:72:540:226:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Chwe, 1994, Bloch, 1996, Ray and Vohra, 1997, 1999, 2001, Seidmann and Winter, 1998, Konishi
8:248:19910:20:16:72:539:206:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and Ray, 2001, Maskin, 2003).10Themostimportantdifference between our approach and the
8:249:19996:16:15:84:539:190:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:8In this respect, our paper is also related to work on “coalition-proof” Nash equilibrium or rationalizability,
8:250:20107:15:11:72:540:175:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:e.g., Bernheim, Peleg and Whinston (1987), Moldovanu (1992), Ambrus (2006). These papers allow deviations by
8:251:20215:11:11:72:540:164:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:coalitions in non-cooperative games, but imposethat only stable coalitions can form. The main difference is that
8:252:20327:11:11:72:540:153:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:our basic approach is axiomatic or cooperative. We then provide a non-cooperative foundation for our approach,
8:253:20437:11:11:72:539:142:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:but do not explicitly use coalition-proofness as a refinement in the non-cooperative game.  Another difference is
8:254:20550:11:11:72:539:131:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:that coalition-proof Nash equilibria typically fail to exist (though coalitionally rationalizable outcomes do exist, see
8:255:20670:11:11:72:540:120:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:Ambrus, 2006), while we show existence and generic uniqueness of our equilibrium concept in all three approaches
8:256:20782:11:7:72:111:109:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:we adopt.
8:257:20791:7:15:84:539:102:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:9See also the literature on weighted majority cooperative games, which also model situations in which different
8:258:20902:15:7:72:526:87:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:individuals have different “weights” or “powers,” e.g., Isbell (1956), Peleg (1968), Peleg and Rosenmuller (1992).
8:259:21016:7:0:80:540:80:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:10Like some of these papers, our approach can be situated within the “Nash program” since our axiomatic approach
9:260:21129:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:previous literature on coalition formation is that, motivated by political settings, we assume that
9:261:21228:20:19:72:540:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the majority (or supermajority) of the members of the society can impose their will on those
9:262:21320:19:20:72:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:players who are not a part of the majority.11This feature both changes the nature of the game
9:263:21413:20:20:71:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and also introduces “negative externalities” as opposed to the positive externalities and free-rider
9:264:21513:20:20:71:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:problems upon which the previous literature focuses (see, for example, Ray and Vohra, 1999, and
9:265:21608:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Maskin, 2003). A second important difference is that most of these works assume the possibility
9:266:21703:20:20:71:539:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of binding commitments (see again Ray and Vohra, 1997, 1999), while we suppose that players
9:267:21794:20:20:71:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:have no commitment power. In addition, many previous approaches have proposed equilibrium
9:268:21883:20:19:71:539:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:concepts for cooperative games by restricting the set of coalitions that can block an allocation.
9:269:21980:19:20:71:540:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Myerson (1991, ch. 9) and Osborne and Rubinstein(1994, ch. 14) give comprehensive discussions
9:270:22073:20:20:71:539:516:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of many of these approaches. Our paper is also a contribution to this literature, since we propose a
9:271:22173:20:20:71:539:496:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:different axiomatic solution concept. To the best of our knowledge, neither the axiomatic approach
9:272:22271:20:20:71:543:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:nor the specificcooperativegameformnorthedynamicgameweanalyzeinthispaperhavebeen

9:274:22440:20:19:88:539:436:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic political game and
9:275:22536:19:20:71:539:417:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:contains a brief discussion of why it captures certain salient features of political decision-making.
9:276:22637:20:20:71:539:397:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Section 3 provides our axiomatic treatment of this game.  It introduces the concept of ruling
9:277:22730:20:20:71:539:377:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalition and proves its existence and generic uniqueness. Section 4 considers a dynamic game of
9:278:22826:20:20:71:539:357:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalition formation and a number of equilibrium concepts for this type of extensive-form games. It
9:279:22924:20:20:71:539:337:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:then establishes the equivalence between the ruling coalition of Section 3 and the equilibria of this
9:280:23025:20:19:71:539:317:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:extensive-form game. Section 5 introduces the cooperative game and establishes the equivalence
9:281:23119:19:20:71:539:298:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:between the core allocations of this game and the ruling coalitions. Section 6 contains our main
9:282:23215:20:20:71:539:278:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:results on the nature and structure of ruling coalitions in political games. Section 7 considers a
9:283:23313:20:20:71:539:258:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:number of extensions such as endogenous party formation and voluntary redistribution of power
9:284:23406:20:20:71:539:238:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:within a coalition. Section 8 concludes, and the Appendices contain the proofs not provided in the
9:285:23504:20:20:71:507:218:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:text as well as a number of examples to further motivate some of our equilibrium concepts.
9:286:23594:20:11:72:539:198:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:is supported by an explicit extensive form game (Nash,1953). See Serrano (2005) for a recent survey of work on the
9:287:23708:11:7:72:132:187:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:Nash program.
9:288:23721:7:14:80:539:180:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:11This is a distinctive and general feature of political games. In presidential systems, the political contest is winner-
9:289:23842:14:11:72:540:166:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:take-all by design, while in parliamentary systems, parties left out of the governing coalition typically have limited
9:290:23960:11:0:72:360:155:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:say over political decisions. The same is a fortiori true in dictatorships.

10:295:24330:20:20:72:540:624:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:his share of the resource and does not care about how the rest of the resource is distributed. The
10:296:24428:20:20:72:540:604:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:distribution of this scarce resource is the key political/collective decision. This abstract formula-
10:297:24529:20:19:72:540:584:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tion is general enough to nest collective decisions over taxes, transfers, public goods or any other
10:298:24629:19:20:72:164:565:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:collective decisions.
10:299:24650:20:20:88:539:545:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our focus is on how differences in the powers of individuals map into political decisions. We

11:347:27818:20:20:71:540:214:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:introduced so far is that a coalition cannot commit to an arbitrary distribution of resources among
11:348:27917:20:20:71:539:194:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:its members. Instead, the allocation of resources is determined by the payofffunctions{wi(·)}i∈N.
11:349:28014:20:20:72:540:174:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:For example, a coalition consisting of two individuals with powers1and10cannot commit to share

11:351:28203:19:20:72:540:135:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:role in our analysis. We view this as the essence ofpolitical-economic decision-making: political

12:376:29303:31:20:88:539:408:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our main focus is to characterize the properties of this outcome correspondence. We wish to
12:377:29394:20:19:72:539:388:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:understand what types of ruling coalitions will emerge from different games, what the size of the
12:378:29491:19:20:72:540:369:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ruling coalition will be, when it will include the more powerful agents, when it will be large relative
12:379:29594:20:20:72:513:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to the size of the society (i.e., when it will be “dictatorial,” and when it will be “inclusive”).
12:380:29692:20:20:88:539:329:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:We will sometimes impose the following assumption to obtain sharper results (though this
12:381:29780:20:32:72:373:309:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:assumption is not necessary for most of our results; see below).
12:382:29844:32:20:72:539:277:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Assumption 1The power mappingγ∈I∗isgenericin the sense that for anyX,Y∈P(I),

12:384:30006:19:32:71:231:238:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:generic if mappingγ|Nis generic.
12:385:30038:32:20:88:539:206:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Intuitively, this assumption rules out distributions of powers among individuals such that two
12:386:30132:20:20:72:539:186:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:different coalitions have exactly the same total power.  Notice that this assumption is without
12:387:30227:20:20:72:539:166:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:much loss of generality since for any societyNthe set of vectors{γi}i∈N∈R|N|++that fail to satisfy

13:391:30532:0:30:72:233:714:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:3  Axiomatic Analysis
13:392:30553:30:20:72:539:684:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:We begin with an axiomatic analysis. Our approach is to impose some natural restrictions on the
13:393:30648:20:20:72:540:664:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:outcome mappingΦthat capture the salient features related to the formation of ruling coalitions.
13:394:30744:20:20:72:539:644:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In particular, we would like the outcome mapping todetermine the ruling coalitions for an arbitrary
13:395:30843:20:20:72:539:624:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:society. Such a ruling coalition must be winning (according to Definition 1) and self-enforcing, i.e.
13:396:30944:20:20:72:540:604:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:must be able to withstand challenges from its subcoalitions that satisfy the enforcement constraint
13:397:31043:20:19:71:299:584:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(i.e., from subcoalitions that are self-enforcing).
13:398:31094:19:20:88:543:565:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Let usfix an abstract gameΓ(N,γ|N,α), that is, a power mappingγ:I→R++,aparameter
13:399:31174:20:30:71:381:545:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:α∈[1/2,1),andasocietyN∈P(I).Define the correspondence
13:400:31227:30:29:263:347:515:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f8:C:φ:P(I)⇒P(I)
13:401:31238:29:20:72:540:486:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:byφ(N)=Φ(Γ(N,γ|N,α))for anyN∈P(I).Wewilluseφinstead ofΦwhenever this causes
13:402:31313:20:20:71:134:466:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:no confusion.
13:403:31326:20:20:88:539:446:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Fix an abstract gameΓ=(N,γ,α).  Then in the spirit of the power and the enforcement
13:404:31409:20:31:71:303:426:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:constraints, we adopt the following axioms onφ.
13:405:31456:31:30:71:487:395:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Axiom 1(Inclusion)For anyX∈P(N),φ(X)6=∅and ifY∈φ(X)thenY⊂X.

13:407:31559:31:30:71:431:334:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Axiom 3(Enforcement)For anyX∈P(N)andY∈φ(X),Y∈φ(Y).
13:408:31609:30:20:72:539:304:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Axiom 4(Group Rationality)For anyX∈P(N), for anyY∈φ(X)and anyZ⊂Xsuch

13:410:31722:31:19:88:539:253:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Motivated by Axiom 3, we define the notion of a self-enforcing coalition as a coalition that
13:411:31814:19:31:71:433:234:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:“selects itself”. This notion will be used repeatedly in the rest of the paper.

13:413:31945:31:19:88:539:172:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:All four axioms are natural. Axiom 1, inclusion, implies thatφmaps into subcoalitions of the
13:414:32037:19:20:71:540:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalition it operates upon and that it is defined, i.e.,φ(X)6=∅.(Note that this does not rule
13:415:32130:20:20:71:539:133:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:outφ(X)={∅}, which is instead ruled out by Axiom 2.) Intuitively, this axiom implies that
13:416:32219:20:20:71:539:113:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:new players cannot join a coalition, which is the key feature of the political game we study in
13:417:32314:20:20:71:539:93:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:this paper. Axiom 2, the power axiom, requires that the winning coalition lies withinXand has
13:418:32407:20:0:71:539:73:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:sufficient power according to Definition 1. Axiom 3, the enforcement axiom, simply requires that
14:419:32505:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:any coalitionY∈φ(X)(for someX∈P(N)) should be self-enforcing according to Definition 2.
14:420:32592:20:19:72:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Axiom 4 requires that if two coalitionsY,Z⊂Xare winning and self-enforcing and all players in

14:422:32768:20:20:72:540:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:an individual rationality or “group rationality” type axiom: sinceα≥1/2, any two winning self-
14:423:32862:20:20:72:540:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing coalitions intersect, and we merely require players from such intersection to have rational
14:424:32963:20:20:72:540:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:preferences between these two coalitions (recall thatwi(·)is such that playeriprefers a coalition
14:425:33060:20:20:72:243:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:where his relative power is greater).
14:426:33097:20:31:88:408:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The main result of the axiomatic analysis is the following theorem.

14:428:33238:32:20:84:539:512:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:1. There exists a unique mappingφthat satisfies Axioms1—4. Moreover, when Assumption 1
14:429:33324:20:29:99:215:492:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:holds,φis single-valued.
14:430:33348:29:24:84:431:463:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:2. This mappingφmay be obtained by the following inductive procedure:

14:440:33702:32:20:72:539:258:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Proof.We begin with properties of the setM(X)defined in(4)and the mappingφ(X)defined in
14:441:33789:20:20:71:539:238:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:(3)(Step 1). We then prove that this mappingφ(X)satisfies Axioms 1—4 (Step 2). We next prove
14:442:33881:20:20:72:540:218:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that this is the unique mapping satisfying Axioms 1—4 (Step 3). Finally, we establish that when 1
14:443:33978:20:20:72:525:198:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:holds,φis a single valued (Step 4). These four steps together prove both parts of the theorem.
14:444:34072:20:19:88:539:178:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:Step 1:Note that at each step of the induction procedure,M(X)is well-defined becauseZin
14:445:34159:19:20:72:540:159:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:(4)satisfies|Z|<|X|and thusφhas already been defined forZ.Theargminset in(3)is also well
14:446:34247:20:20:72:540:139:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:defined, because it selects the minimum of afinite number of elements (this number is less than
14:447:34342:20:20:72:539:119:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:2|X|;Xis a subset ofN,which isfinite). Non-emptiness follows, since the choice set includesX.
14:448:34435:20:20:71:539:99:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:This implies that this procedure uniquely defines some mappingφ(which is uniquely defined, but
14:449:34529:20:0:71:213:79:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:not necessarily single-valued).
15:450:34562:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:Step 2:Take anyX∈P(I). Axiom 1 is satisfied, because eitherφ(X)={X}(if|X|=1)
15:451:34638:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:or is given by(3),soφ(X)contains only subsets ofXandφ(X)6=∅. Furthermore, in both cases
15:452:34725:19:20:72:459:675:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:φ(X)contains only winning (withinX) coalitions, and thus Axiom 2 is satisfied.
15:453:34803:20:20:88:544:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:To verify that Axiom 3 is satisfied, take anyY∈φ(X).EitherY=XorY∈M(X).Inthe
15:454:34878:20:20:71:392:635:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f2:B:first case,Y∈φ(X)=φ(Y), while in the latter,Y∈φ(Y)by(4).
15:455:34934:20:20:88:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, Axiom 4 holds trivially when|X|=1, since there is only one winning coalition. If
15:456:35023:20:20:71:546:595:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:|X|>1,takeY∈φ(X)andZ⊂X, such thatγZ>αγXandZ∈φ(Z).Byconstructionof
15:457:35088:20:20:72:170:575:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:φ(X),wehavethat

15:461:35124:27:28:72:336:528:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Note also thatZ∈M(X)∪{X}from(4). Then, since

15:464:35187:0:30:338:354:500:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:C:γA,
15:465:35190:30:20:72:386:470:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:we must haveγZ>γY, completing the proof that Axiom 4 holds.
15:466:35249:20:20:88:539:450:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:Step 3:Now let us prove that Axioms1—4define a unique mappingφ. Suppose that there
15:467:35331:20:19:72:544:430:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:are two such mappings:φandφ06=φ. Axioms 1 and 2 immediately imply that if|X|=1,then
15:468:35414:19:20:71:539:411:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:φ(X)=φ0(X)={X}. This is because Axiom 2 implies thatφ(X)6=∅and Axiom 1 implies
15:469:35492:20:20:72:539:391:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:thatφ(X)is non-empty; the same applies toφ0(X).  Therefore, there must existk>1such
15:470:35575:20:20:72:539:371:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that for anyAwith|A|<k,wehaveφ(A)=φ0(A), and there existsX∈P(I),|X|=k,
15:471:35645:20:20:72:546:351:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:such thatφ(X)6=φ0(X). Without loss of generality, supposeY∈φ(X)andY/∈φ0(X).Take
15:472:35724:20:20:72:539:331:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:anyZ∈φ0(X)(suchZexists by Axiom 1 andZ6=Yby hypothesis).  We will now derive a
15:473:35802:20:20:71:270:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:contradiction by showing thatY/∈φ(X).
15:474:35839:20:19:88:540:291:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Wefirst prove thatγZ<γY.IfY=X,thenγZ<γYfollows immediately from the fact
15:475:35911:19:20:71:539:272:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:thatZ6=YandZ⊂X(by Axiom 1). Now, consider the caseY6=X, which implies|Y|<k(since
15:476:35991:20:20:71:539:252:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:Y⊂X). By Axioms 2 and 3,Y∈φ(X)implies thatγY>αγXandY∈φ(Y); however, since
15:477:36064:20:20:71:539:232:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:|Y|<k,wehaveφ(Y)=φ0(Y)(by the hypothesis that for anyAwith|A|<k,φ(A)=φ0(A))
15:478:36139:20:20:72:543:212:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and thusY∈φ0(Y).Next,sinceZ∈φ0(X),γY>αγX,Y∈φ0(Y)andY/∈φ0(X),Axiom4
15:479:36205:20:20:71:176:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:implies thatγZ<γY.
15:480:36223:20:19:88:539:172:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Note also thatZ∈φ0(X)implies (from Axioms 2 and 3) thatγZ>αγXandZ∈φ0(Z).
15:481:36295:19:20:72:540:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, sinceγZ<γY,wehaveZ6=Xand therefore|Z|<k(sinceZ⊂X). This again yields
15:482:36373:20:20:71:544:133:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:Z∈φ(Z)by hypothesis. SinceY∈φ(X),Z∈φ(Z),γZ>αγX,γZ>γY,Axiom4implies
15:483:36439:20:20:72:539:113:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:thatZ∈φ(X).Now,sinceZ∈φ(X),Y∈φ(Y),γY>αγX,γZ<γY, Axiom 4 implies that
15:484:36507:20:20:71:539:93:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:Y/∈φ(X), yielding a contradiction. This completes the proof that Axioms1—4define at most one
15:485:36599:20:0:71:115:73:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:mapping.
16:486:36609:0:20:88:540:714:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:Step 4:Suppose Assumption 1 holds. If|X|=1,thenφ(X)={X}and the conclusion follows.
16:487:36691:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:B:If|X|>1,thenφ(X)is given by(3); since under Assumption 1 there does not existY,Z∈P(N)
16:488:36776:19:20:72:164:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:such thatγY=γZ,
16:489:36791:20:10:281:314:655:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f8:C:argmin
16:490:36797:10:0:269:327:645:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f22:F:A∈M(X)∪{X}
16:491:36807:0:26:329:341:655:121:g_d0_f6:65:g_d0_f9:C:γA
16:492:36809:26:20:72:540:629:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:must be a singleton. Consequently, for any|X|,φ(X)is a singleton andφis single-valued. This
16:493:36900:20:20:72:304:609:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:completes the proof of Step 4 and of Theorem 1.
16:494:36947:20:20:88:539:589:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:At thefirst glance, Axioms1—4may appear relatively mild. Nevertheless, they are strong enough
16:495:37040:20:19:72:539:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to pin down a unique mappingφ.Thisreflects the fact that the requirement of self-enforcement
16:496:37132:19:20:72:289:550:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:places considerable structure on the problem.
16:497:37177:20:20:88:539:530:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Theorem 1 establishes not only thatφis uniquely defined, but also that when Assumption 1
16:498:37265:20:20:72:539:510:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:holds, it is single-valued. In this case, with a slight abuse of notation, we writeφ(X)=Yinstead
16:499:37361:20:20:72:148:490:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ofφ(X)={Y}.
16:500:37372:20:26:88:424:470:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The fact thatφis determined uniquely implies the following corollary.

16:504:37702:20:26:71:319:385:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:Moreover, ifNis self-enforcing, thenφ(N)={N}.
16:505:37747:26:20:72:540:359:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Proof.If|N|=1, this trivially follows from the inductive procedure described in Theorem 1. If
16:506:37840:20:20:72:548:339:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:|N|>1,φ(N)is given by(3). Note that for anyY∈M(N),wehaveγY<γN.Therefore,

16:510:38127:20:20:88:540:260:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:While Theorem 1 proves the existence and uniqueness of a mappingφsatisfying Axioms1—4and

16:512:38312:20:20:72:539:220:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:method of checking whether a particular coalition is self-enforcing.  In particular, the result of
16:513:38410:20:20:72:539:200:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Corollary 1 justifies our geometric representation in the Introduction: a coalition that includes a

16:515:38607:19:20:72:539:161:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:self-enforcing coalitions, we need to depict the power and enforcement constraints of all proper
16:516:38703:20:20:72:137:141:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:subcoalitions.
16:517:38717:20:28:88:506:121:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:To illustrate the results of Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, let us now return to Example 1.
16:518:38804:28:20:88:539:93:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:Example 1 (continued)Again, consider three playersA,BandCand suppose thatα=1/2.
16:519:38883:20:0:72:539:73:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:For anyγA<γB<γC<γA+γB, Assumption 1 is satisfied andφ({A,B,C})={A,B,C}.
17:520:38956:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Indeed, in this case, any two-person coalition is stronger than any single person and no coalitions
17:521:39055:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:containing the same number of members have equal power. Furthermore, under Assumption 1,
17:522:39143:19:20:71:539:675:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f8:C:φ({A,B})6={A,B},φ({A,C})6={A,C}andφ({B,C})6={B,C}.  Therefore,φ({A,B,C})
17:523:39215:20:20:72:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:cannot be a doubleton, since there exists no two-person coalitionXthat can satisfy Axiom 3.
17:524:39306:20:20:72:543:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover,φ({A,B,C})could not be a singleton, since, in view of the fact thatγA+γB>γC,no
17:525:39393:20:20:72:540:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:singleton could satisfy Axiom 2. The only possible value forφ({A,B,C})that does not violate

17:527:39575:20:20:72:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:also see thatφwould not be single valued if Assumption 1 were not satisfied. Suppose, for example,
17:528:39673:20:30:72:436:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:thatγA=γB=γC.Inthiscase,φ({A,B,C})={{A,B},{B,C},{A,C}}.
17:529:39728:30:19:88:539:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our next task is to characterize the mappingφand determine the structure and properties of
17:530:39818:19:20:72:540:506:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ruling coalitions. Before doing this, however, we will present a dynamic game and then a cooperative
17:531:39918:20:34:72:342:486:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:game, which will further justify our axiomatic approach.

17:533:40014:31:20:72:540:421:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we introduce a dynamic game of coalition formation.  We then discuss several

17:535:40200:20:19:71:539:381:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:concepts, when Assumption 1 holds there will exist a unique equilibrium coalition, coinciding with
17:536:40298:19:29:71:314:362:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the ruling coalition defined in the previous section.
17:537:40351:29:27:72:235:333:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:C:4.1  The Basic Game Form
17:538:40375:27:20:72:539:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Consider an abstract gameΓ(N,γ|N,α),thatis,asocietyN∈P(I)consisting of afinite number
17:539:40460:20:20:72:544:286:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of individuals, a distribution of power{γi}i∈N, and an institutional ruleα∈[1/2,1).Wewillnow
17:540:40552:20:20:72:543:266:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:describe a related extensive-form game byˆΓ=ˆΓ(N,γ|N,α). This gameˆΓis different fromΓ,since
17:541:40644:20:19:71:366:246:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:it refers to a particular extensive form game (described next).
17:542:40707:19:20:88:539:227:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Let{wi(·)}i∈Nbe as described in the previous section. Moreover, letε>0be an arbitrarily
17:543:40794:20:20:72:540:207:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:B:small number such that for anyi∈Nand anyX,Y∈P(N),ifwi(X)>wi(Y),thenwi(X)>
17:544:40867:20:20:71:540:187:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:wi(Y)+ε. (Suchε>0exists, sinceNis afinite set.) In particular, for anyX∈P(N)such that
17:545:40952:20:20:71:149:167:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:i∈X,wehave:
17:546:40963:20:25:264:718:147:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:A:wi(X)−w−i>ε.(5)
17:547:40978:25:29:72:375:122:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Then the extensive form of the gameˆΓ(N,γ|N,α)is as follows.
17:548:41038:29:20:85:539:93:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:1. At each stage,j=0,1,..., the game starts with an intermediary coalitions byNj⊂N(with
17:549:41125:20:0:99:144:73:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:A:N0=N).
18:550:41133:0:29:85:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:2. Nature randomly picks agenda setterij,q∈Njforq=1(i.e., a member of the coalitionNj).
18:551:41220:29:28:85:352:685:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:3. Agenda setterij,qproposes a coalitionXj,q∈P(Nj).
18:552:41271:28:20:85:539:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:4. All players inXj,qvote over this proposal; letvj,q(i,X0,q)∈{ ̃y, ̃n}be the vote of player
18:553:41363:20:31:99:488:637:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:A:i∈Xj,q.LetYes{Xj,q}be the subset ofXj,qvoting in favor of this proposal, i.e.,
18:554:41441:31:31:221:420:606:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f6:C:Yes{Xj,q}={i∈Xj,q:vj,q(i,X0,q)= ̃y}.
18:555:41477:31:9:99:137:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Then, if
18:556:41485:9:25:277:293:566:121:g_d0_f19:121:g_d0_f19:C:X

18:562:41509:33:19:99:539:522:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:i.e., ifXj,qis winning withinNj(accordingtoDefinition 1), then we proceed to step5;
18:563:41592:19:29:99:249:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:otherwise we proceed to step6.
18:564:41622:29:20:85:539:474:121:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f9:A:5. IfXj,q=Nj, then we proceed to step7and the game ends. Otherwise players fromNj\Xj,q
18:565:41708:20:20:99:539:454:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:A:are eliminated, players fromXj,qadd−εto their payoff, and the game proceeds to step1
18:566:41792:20:29:99:293:434:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:withNj+1=Xj,q(andjincreases by1).
18:567:41825:29:20:85:539:405:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:6. Ifq<|Nj|, then next agenda setterij,q+1∈Njis randomly picked by nature such that
18:568:41908:20:19:99:539:385:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:A:ij,q+16=ij,rfor1≤r≤q(i.e., it is picked among those who have not made a proposal at
18:569:41991:19:20:99:540:366:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:stagej) and the game proceeds to step3(withqincreased by1). Otherwise, we proceed to
18:570:42075:20:29:99:130:346:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:step7.
18:571:42081:29:20:85:538:317:121:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f9:A:7.Njbecomes the ultimate ruling coalition (URC) of this terminal node, and each playeri∈Nj

18:573:42195:32:20:88:540:265:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f7:A:This game form implies that coalitions that emerge during the game form a sequenceN0⊃

18:582:42585:19:20:72:539:135:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:idea that individuals’ overall utility in the game is related to their sharewiand to the number of
18:583:42683:20:20:71:539:115:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:rounds of elimination in which the individual is involved in (the second term in(6)). The number
18:584:42779:20:0:71:482:95:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of players eliminated equals|N|−|N ̄j|, and there is a total of ̄jrounds of elimination.
19:585:42869:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:With a slight abuse of terminology, we refer tojabove as “the round of elimination.” Without
19:586:42961:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:loss of generality, we assume that this is a game of perfect information, in particular after each
19:587:43059:19:20:71:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:time voting takes place each player’s vote become common knowledge; this is convenient because
19:588:43153:20:20:71:338:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the players would then share the same information sets.
19:589:43208:20:20:88:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The arbitrarily small costεcan be interpreted as a cost of eliminating some of the players
19:590:43298:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:from the coalition or as an organizational cost that individuals have to pay each time a new (even
19:591:43396:20:20:71:540:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:temporary) coalition is formed. Its role for us isto rule out some “unreasonable” equilibria that
19:592:43493:20:20:71:543:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:arise in dynamic voting games. Example 5 in Appendix B illustrates that whenε=0,thereexist
19:593:43583:20:19:71:539:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria in which the outcome may depend on the behavior of players that will be eliminated for
19:594:43680:19:20:71:301:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:sure or on the order of moves chosen by Nature.
19:595:43727:20:20:88:539:516:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Note thatˆΓis afinite game; it ends after no more than|N|(|N|+1)/2iterations because
19:596:43811:20:20:71:539:496:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the size of a coalition as a function of the voting stagejdefines a decreasing sequence bounded
19:597:43906:20:20:71:539:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:from below by0. The coalition that forms after the last elimination is the URC. Consequently,
19:598:43999:20:20:71:540:456:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the extensive-form gameˆΓnecessarily has a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE, see below).
19:599:44093:20:19:71:539:436:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:However, as the next example shows, there may be many SPNEs and some of those are highly
19:600:44181:19:20:71:539:417:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:unintuitive because they involve clear inefficiencies in voting (Appendix B presents a more striking
19:601:44281:20:32:71:337:397:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:example, Example 4, with multiple Markovian SPNEs).
19:602:44332:32:20:71:539:365:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Example 2ConsiderN={A,B,C,D},withγA=3,γB=4,γC=5andγD=10(as in Example
19:603:44401:20:20:72:544:345:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:B:1 above), and suppose thatα=1/2. From Theorem 1, it can be seen thatφ({A,B,C,D})=
19:604:44482:20:20:72:540:325:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:{A,B,C}. As we will show later (Theorem 2), there is a Sequentially Weakly Dominant Equilibrium
19:605:44577:20:19:72:539:305:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(which is also a SPNE) in whichA,B,orCproposes this coalition,A,BandCvote for in favor of
19:606:44666:19:20:72:539:286:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:this coalition, and ifDis thefirst to make a proposal, he proposes{A,B,C,D}which is rejected
19:607:44758:20:20:72:539:266:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:by the rest. However, there exists another equilibrium, where all players make random proposals
19:608:44853:20:20:72:540:246:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and everybody votes against any proposal. This is indeed an equilibrium, because no deviation
19:609:44946:20:20:72:540:226:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:by a single player can lead to acceptance of any proposal.  Consequently, both{A,B,C}and
19:610:45034:20:20:72:540:206:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:{A,B,C,D}can emerge as subgame perfect equilibrium URCs, even though the former is not a
19:611:45122:20:31:72:424:186:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:reasonable outcome, sinceA,B,andChave enough votes to eliminateD.
19:612:45187:31:20:88:539:155:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:In voting games, equilibria like the one involving{A,B,C,D}as the URC in this example are
19:613:45276:20:20:72:540:135:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:typically eliminated by focusing on weakly dominant (or weakly undominated) strategies. However,
19:614:45372:20:20:72:539:115:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:this refinement loses its power in dynamic games, since even unreasonable actions are typically
19:615:45467:20:20:72:539:95:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:undominated because they may give relatively high payoffs when other players choose unreasonable
19:616:45563:20:0:72:172:75:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:actions in the future.
20:617:45587:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Because these standard equilibrium concepts do not give a satisfactory refinement, in the next
20:618:45681:20:19:71:540:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:section, we introduce the concept ofsequentially weakly dominant equilibrium, which combines the
20:619:45777:19:20:71:540:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ideas of backward induction and equilibrium in weakly dominant strategies.13We then demonstrate
20:620:45872:20:30:72:498:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the existence of such equilibria for a broad class of agenda-setting games (defined below).

20:622:46007:26:20:72:539:599:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In this subsection, we introduce the notion ofSequential Weakly Dominant Equilibrium(SWDE)

23:878:53559:20:20:71:539:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:gameˆΓ(N,γ|N,α)and the URC is reached in thefirst stage of elimination (unlessNis itself the
23:879:53651:20:19:71:539:172:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:URC). The existence of a pure strategy SWDE for this class of games is a noteworthy fact by
23:880:53742:19:20:71:539:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:itself, since SWDE is a demanding equilibrium concept and many games will not have such an
23:881:53832:20:20:71:543:133:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium (see, e.g., Theorem 6). Second, the SWDE URC coincides withφ(N),thatis,withthe
23:882:53922:20:20:71:540:113:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ruling coalition ofΓ(N,γ|N,α), which was derived axiomatically in Section 3. This equivalence
23:883:54015:20:20:72:540:93:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:allows us to use the inductive algorithm to determine the URC of the dynamic game. Finally, when
23:884:54111:20:0:72:345:73:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Assumption 1 holds, the URC is the same in all SWDEs.
24:885:54166:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:While the equivalence between pure strategy SWDE and our axiomatic approach is reassur-
24:886:54253:20:19:72:540:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ing, in Appendix A, we introduce the concept of Markov Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium
24:887:54342:19:20:72:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(MTHPE), which is a slight refinement of the standard Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. We
24:888:54434:20:20:72:540:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:then prove that the same results apply with MTHPE as well. In this process, we also establish a
24:889:54529:20:20:72:540:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:number of more general results about the existence and structure of MTHPE in a broad class of
24:890:54622:20:34:72:342:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:agenda-setting games, which are of independent interest.
24:891:54678:34:31:72:246:581:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:5  A Cooperative Game
24:892:54699:31:20:72:540:550:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we present a non-transferableutility cooperative game and establish that the
24:893:54792:20:20:72:540:530:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(strong) core of this game coincides with the ruling coalition derived in Section 3.14This ex-
24:894:54886:20:20:72:540:510:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ercise is useful both because it links our equilibrium concept to those in the cooperative game
24:895:54981:20:19:72:540:490:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:theory literature and also because it provides another justification for our axiomatic approach. It
24:896:55080:19:20:72:540:471:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is noteworthy that while the cooperative game theory approach is related to the axiomatic approach
24:897:55178:20:20:72:539:451:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in Section 3, there are also crucial differences. First, the axiomatic approach involves no strategic
24:898:55279:20:20:71:544:431:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:interactions; in contrast (and similar to our noncooperativeapproachinSection4),theemphasis
24:899:55370:20:20:71:539:411:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:here will be on strategic interactions among players and how there emerges a coalition structure
24:900:55466:20:20:71:539:391:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:implementing a payoffallocation such that no other coalition can implement an alternative feasible
24:901:55564:20:19:71:539:371:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:allocation making all of its members better off. Second, the cooperative approach incorporates the
24:902:55662:19:20:71:393:352:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:dynamic interactions that were also present in the previous section.
24:903:55730:20:31:88:543:332:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:A non-transferable utility cooperative game is represented by ̃ΓN= ̃Γ(N,γ|N,α,vN(·)),where

24:905:55833:31:20:72:540:270:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is a mapping from the set of coalitions to the set of allocations this coalition can enforce. Notice
24:906:55933:20:0:72:318:250:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:B:that the range of the mapping is notR|N|+, butP

24:910:55988:12:20:355:539:250:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:, since typically a given coalition can
24:911:56027:20:19:72:286:230:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforce more than a single vector of utilities.
24:912:56074:19:20:88:540:211:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:We define the mappingvNinductively. To do this, wefirst introduce the concept of strong core
24:913:56166:20:20:71:539:191:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(taking as given the definition of a feasible allocation). We then formally define the set of feasible
24:914:56268:20:20:71:539:171:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:allocations. Throughout this section, we assume, without loss of generality, thatw−i=0for any

24:916:56421:20:20:88:539:131:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:We denote the core allocations for a non-transferable utility game ̃ΓN= ̃Γ(N,γ|N,α,vN(·))by

25:941:57287:34:20:88:539:473:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:This definition states that feasible allocations include those where all individuals receive zero

26:984:58796:20:19:72:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:we should havevN(X)⊂vN(Y). It is straightforward to check that(8)satisfies both requirements.

26:988:59172:20:17:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the players inN\Yfrom “sharing the pie” and making players inYplay the cooperative game
26:989:59259:17:23:72:540:598:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B: ̃Γ(Y,γ|Y,α,vY(·)).  If an allocation is not in the core of this reduced game, then it cannot be
26:990:59355:23:20:71:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:imposed, since coalitionYwould rather choose a different allocation. This feature introduces the
26:991:59451:20:29:71:467:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:dynamic aspect mentioned above in the context of the cooperative game approach.
26:992:59530:29:20:71:539:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Example 3To illustrate how this game works, consider a society consisting of three individuals
26:993:59624:20:19:71:539:506:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:A,B,Cwith powers(γA,γB,γC)=(3,4,5),letα=1/2. Allocation(3/12,4/12,5/12)is a feasible
26:994:59708:19:20:71:539:487:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:allocation; to see that it is in the core we need to check whether any coalition that has a majority
26:995:59808:20:20:71:539:467:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of votes can improve for all its members. Take, for instance, coalition{B,C}; it is winning and
26:996:59903:20:20:72:539:447:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:therefore can implement any feasible allocation. BothBandCwould be better offif they could
26:997:59993:20:20:72:540:427:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:giveAnothing and share the resource between themselves. However, allocation(0,4/9,5/9)is not
26:998:60085:20:0:72:262:407:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f23:B:feasible because the core of the game ̃Γ

26:1004:60266:20:19:72:539:367:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f4:B:is feasible and may be enforced by coalition{B,C}. But, naturally it makes playerBworse off
26:1005:60357:19:20:72:544:348:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:than he would have been with the allocation(3/12,4/12,5/12). Likewisewecanshowthatno

26:1007:60538:20:29:72:362:308:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is easy to verify that no other feasible vector lies in the core.

27:1034:61193:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:This theorem therefore establishes the equivalence between the axiomatic approach in Section
27:1035:61285:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:3, the dynamic game in the previous section, and the cooperative game in this section, even though
27:1036:61383:19:20:71:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:each of these three different approaches models the determination of the ruling coalition in a
27:1037:61477:20:20:71:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:very different manner. The main idea underlying this result is that only self-enforcing and winning
27:1038:61576:20:20:71:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions can implement payoffvectors that are attractive for their own members. In the framework
27:1039:61674:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of non-transferable utility cooperativegames, this is captured by two features:first, only winning
27:1040:61772:20:20:71:539:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions can implement feasible payoffvectors (Definition 8); second, in addition to zero payoffs
27:1041:61871:20:20:71:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and status quo allocation, only payoffvectors that correspond to core allocations for a smaller game
27:1042:61971:20:19:71:539:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:are feasible (Definition 9). These two features introduce the power and enforcement constraints that
27:1043:62071:19:20:71:540:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:were also essential in the axiomatic and the dynamic game approaches. In view of this, thefinding
27:1044:62168:20:20:71:539:516:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that the set of core allocations here correspond to the ruling coalitions is perhaps not surprising,
27:1045:62268:20:34:71:180:496:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:though still reassuring.
27:1046:62292:34:31:72:343:462:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:6  The Structure of Ruling Coalitions
27:1047:62329:31:20:72:540:431:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we present several results on the structure of ruling coalitions. Given the equivalence
27:1048:62433:20:20:72:540:411:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:results in the previous two sections, without loss of generality we focus on ruling coalitions of
27:1049:62530:20:32:72:421:391:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:abstract gamesΓ=Γ(N,γ|N,α). In addition to Assumption 1, consider:
27:1050:62596:32:31:72:504:359:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Assumption 2For noX,Y∈P(I)such thatX⊂Ythe equalityγY=αγXis satisfied.
27:1051:62665:31:20:88:536:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:A:Essentially, Assumption 2 guarantees that a small perturbation of a non-winning coalitionY
27:1052:62755:20:20:72:539:308:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:does not make it winning. Similar to Assumption 1,this assumption fails only in a set of Lebesgue
27:1053:62852:20:20:72:540:288:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:measure 0. Together, Assumptions 1 and 2 simplify the analysis in this section, and we assume
27:1054:62945:20:29:72:529:268:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that they both hold throughout the section, without explicitly stating this in every proposition.

27:1056:63057:27:20:72:540:212:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:We start with the result that the set of self-enforcing coalitions is open (in the standard topology);

28:1074:64275:20:19:71:539:537:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:property (genericity). This ensures thatA(N)is an open set; it is dense because hyperplanes have
28:1075:64371:19:20:71:539:518:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:dimension lower than|N|. The proofs forS(N)andN(N)are by induction. The base follows
28:1076:64455:20:20:71:540:498:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:immediately sinceS(N)=R++andN(N)=∅are open sets. Now suppose that we have proved
28:1077:64535:20:20:71:539:478:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:this result for allk<|N|.  For any distribution of powers{γi}i∈N,Nis self-enforcing if and
28:1078:64625:20:20:72:540:458:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:only if there are no proper winning self-enforcing coalitions withinN. Now take some small (in
28:1079:64719:20:20:72:539:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:sup-metric) perturbation of powers{γ0i}i∈N. If this perturbation is small, then the set of winning
28:1080:64817:20:19:72:539:418:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions is the same, and, by induction, the set of proper self-enforcing coalitions is the same as
28:1081:64918:19:20:72:539:399:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:well. Therefore, the perturbed coalition{γ0i}is self-enforcing if and only if the initial coalition with
28:1082:65022:20:20:71:383:379:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:powers{γi}is self-enforcing; which completes the induction step.
28:1083:65086:20:20:88:540:359:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:(Part 2)Take any connected componentA⊂A(N).BothS(N)∩AandN(N)∩Aare open

28:1085:65246:20:20:71:539:319:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:B:Also,(S(N)∩A)∩(N(N)∩A)=∅and(S(N)∩A)∪(N(N)∩A)=A,which,giventhatA
28:1086:65309:20:19:71:539:299:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is connected, implies that eitherS(N)∩AorN(N)∩Ais empty. Hence,Alies either entirely

28:1088:65436:20:20:88:539:260:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:An immediate corollary of Theorem 4 is that if the distribution of powers in two different

28:1093:65852:30:20:84:546:141:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:1. There existsδ>0such that ifγ0:N→R++lies withinδ-neighborhood ofγ,then

28:1095:65943:28:20:84:545:93:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f8:C:2. There existsδ0>0such that ifα0∈[1/2,1)satisfies|α0−α|<δ0,thenΦ(N,γ,α)=

29:1097:66028:0:20:72:542:714:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f8:C:Proof.We prove this Proposition by induction. IfN=1, it is trivial: for anyγandα,Φ(N,γ,α)=
29:1098:66118:20:19:72:543:694:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:{N}. Now assume that we have proved this result for all societies with|N|<n;takeanysociety
29:1099:66208:19:20:72:543:675:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:Nwith|N|=n. We take advantage of the inductive procedure for determiningΦ(N,γ,α),which
29:1100:66294:20:20:72:540:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is described in Theorem 1. Indeed, since we assume that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold, then the set
29:1101:66388:20:20:72:540:635:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:B:M(N),asdefined by(4),isthesameforΓ(N,γ,α),Γ(N,γ0,α),andΓ(N,γ,α0), provided that
29:1102:66467:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:δis sufficiently small (we use induction to get that self-enforcing coalitions remain self-enforcing
29:1103:66567:20:20:72:545:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:after perturbation). Moreover, ifδis small, thenγX>γYis equivalent toγ0X>γ0Y.Therefore,
29:1104:66654:20:20:72:466:575:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:(3)implies thatΦ(N,γ,α)=Φ(N,γ0,α)=Φ(N,γ,α0). This completes the proof.
29:1105:66724:20:19:88:540:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:In addition, we prove that the mappingφis “robust” in the sense that the inclusion of sufficiently
29:1106:66822:19:32:71:374:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:weak player(s) does not change the ruling coalition in a society.
29:1107:66887:32:20:71:538:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f6:C:Proposition 2Consider a gameΓ=Γ(N∪M,γ|N∪M,α)with arbitrary disjointfinite setsM

29:1109:67030:32:20:72:539:452:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Proof.The proof is by induction. Let|N|=n.Forn=1the result follows straightforwardly.
29:1110:67115:20:20:72:539:432:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Suppose next that the result is true forn.Ifδis small enough, thenφ(N)is winning withinM∪N;
29:1111:67206:20:19:72:538:412:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:B:we also know that it is self-enforcing. Thus we only need to verify that there exists noX⊂N∪M
29:1112:67299:19:20:72:546:393:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:such thatφ(X)=X,i.e.,Xthat is self-enforcing, winning inN∪Mand hasγX<γφ(N).To
29:1113:67376:20:20:72:539:373:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:obtain a contradiction, assume the contrary, i.e. that the minimal winning self-enforcing coalition
29:1114:67475:20:20:72:545:353:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:X∈P(M∪N)does not coincide withφ(N). Consider its part that lies withinN,X∩N.By
29:1115:67553:20:20:72:539:333:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:definition,γN≥γφ(N)>γX≥γX∩N, where the strict inequality follows by hypothesis. This string
29:1116:67644:20:20:71:539:313:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of inequalities implies thatX∩Nis a proper subset ofN, thus must have fewer elements than
29:1117:67733:20:19:71:540:293:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:n. Then, by induction, for small enoughδ,φ(X∩N)=φ(X)=X(sinceXis self-enforcing).
29:1118:67813:19:20:71:539:274:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:However,φ(X∩N)⊂N, and thusX⊂N. Therefore,Xis self-enforcing and winning within
29:1119:67891:20:20:71:539:254:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:N(since it is winning withinM∪N). This implies thatγφ(N)≤γX(sinceφ(N)is the minimal
29:1120:67974:20:20:72:538:234:121:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f9:B:self-enforcing coalition that is winning withinN). But this contradicts the inequalityγφ(N)>γX
29:1121:68068:20:20:72:432:214:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and implies that the hypothesis is true forn+1. This completes the proof.
29:1122:68141:20:20:88:539:194:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Essentially, Proposition 2 says that mappingφis “continuous at zero”, in the sense that adding

29:1126:68518:20:20:71:539:115:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:not have an impact in votings or in resource allocation. Here, we prove that agents (or groups of
29:1127:68615:20:0:71:357:95:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:agents) with sufficiently small power have no impact either.

30:1129:68707:27:20:72:540:687:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:The next question we address is how many players may be included in the ruling coalition. We
30:1130:68799:20:19:72:539:667:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:start with the case of majority rule and then consider supermajority rules. These result implies
30:1131:68895:19:20:72:540:648:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that relatively little can be said about the structure of ruling coalitions without putting some more

32:1217:72672:31:20:72:539:663:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Proof. (Part 1)Let us check that the condition in Part 4 is satisfied. Take anyX⊂Y⊂N.
32:1218:72757:20:20:72:545:643:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Obviously,|X|≷12|Y|⇐⇒|X|≷|Y\X|=⇒γX≷γY\X⇐⇒γX≷12γY.Nowletuscheck
32:1219:72819:20:20:71:539:623:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:thatkm’s in Part 1 and in Part 4 are equal. Indeed,k1=21−1=1and ifkm−1=2m−1−1then
32:1220:72900:20:20:71:532:603:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f2:B:km=2m−1=[2km−1]+1. By induction, we get that Part 1 follows as a special case of Part 4.
32:1221:72988:20:20:88:367:583:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:(Part 2)The statement follows immediately from Part 1.
32:1222:73042:20:19:88:539:563:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:(Part 3)Assume the contrary, i.e., that for someX,Y⊂Nsuch that|X|>|Y|we have

32:1224:73193:20:10:71:215:524:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:not intersect. Mathematically,

32:1318:74235:20:20:72:539:105:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:would have at leastαshare of power if all individuals had equal power, but since this is the
32:1319:74327:20:0:72:539:85:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:strongestkm−1individuals, the inequality will be strict). Therefore, there exists a self-enforcing
33:1320:74427:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:winning coalition, different from the grand coalition. This implies that the grand coalition is not
33:1321:74526:20:19:71:243:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:self-enforcing, completing the proof.
33:1322:74563:19:20:88:408:675:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:(Part 5)This follows immediately from Part 4 and Proposition 4.
33:1323:74626:20:20:88:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Consequently, while it is impossible to make any general claims about the size of coalitions
33:1324:74718:20:20:71:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:without specifying more details about the distribution of power within the society, we are able
33:1325:74813:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to provide a tight characterization of the structure of the ruling coalition when individuals are
33:1326:74910:20:29:71:267:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:relatively similar in terms of their power.

33:1328:74996:27:20:72:540:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Here, we show that while the structure of ruling coalitions is robust to small changes in the dis-
33:1329:75094:20:20:72:539:519:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tribution of power within the society, it may befragile to more sizeable shocks, such as adding or
33:1330:75192:20:19:72:539:499:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:losing a member of the ruling coalition. The next proposition establishes that under simple ma-
33:1331:75287:19:20:72:540:480:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:jority rule, self-enforcing coalitions are fragilein the sense that addition or subtraction of a single
33:1332:75390:20:20:72:539:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:agent from these coalitions or, more generally, a unionof two disjoint self-enforcing coalitions leads
33:1333:75492:20:32:72:225:440:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to a non-self enforcing coalition.
33:1334:75526:32:32:72:458:408:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f5:C:Proposition 6Supposeα=1/2andfix a power mappingγ:I→R++.Then:
33:1335:75586:32:20:84:539:376:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:1. If coalitionsXandYsuch thatX∩Y=∅are both self-enforcing, then coalitionX∪Yis
33:1336:75665:20:28:99:118:356:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:not.
33:1337:75669:28:20:84:539:328:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:2. IfXis a self-enforcing coalition, thenX∪{i}fori/∈XandX\{i}fori∈Xare not
33:1338:75743:20:32:99:165:308:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:self-enforcing.
33:1339:75758:32:20:72:539:276:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Proof. (Part 1)EitherXis stronger thanYor vice versa. The stronger of the two is a winning
33:1340:75848:20:20:72:539:256:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:self-enforcing coalition that is not equal toX∪Y.ThisimpliesthatX∪Yis not the minimal
33:1341:75933:20:20:72:443:236:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:winning self-enforcing coalition, and so it is not the ruling coalition inX∪Y.
33:1342:76011:20:19:88:539:216:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:A:(Part 2)For the case of adding, it follows directly from Part 1, since coalition of one player is
33:1343:76108:19:20:72:539:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:always self-enforcing. For the case of deleting: suppose that it is wrong, and the coalition is self-
33:1344:76209:20:20:72:540:177:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing. Then, by Part 1, adding this person backwill result in an non-self-enforcing coalition.
33:1345:76307:20:29:72:358:157:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:This is a contradiction which completes the proof of Part 2.

33:1347:76416:27:20:72:539:101:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:One might expect that an increase inα–the supermajority requirement–may increase the size
33:1348:76505:20:0:71:539:81:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of the ruling coalition and also turn otherwise non-self-enforcing coalitions into self-enforcing ones
34:1349:76609:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(e.g., coalition(3,4)is not self-enforcing whenα=1/2,but becomes self-enforcing whenα>4/7).
34:1350:76700:20:29:72:277:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Nevertheless, this is generally not the case.
34:1351:76745:29:19:72:540:665:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f5:C:Proposition 7An increase inαmay reduce the size of the ruling coalition. That is, there exists

34:1354:76951:29:20:72:540:597:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:B:Proof.The following example is sufficient to establish this result: coalition(3,4,5)is self-enforcing
34:1355:77052:20:20:71:539:577:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:whenα=1/2,but is not self-enforcing when4/7<α<7/12,because(3,4)is now a self-enforcing
34:1356:77138:20:20:71:194:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and winning subcoalition.
34:1357:77163:20:20:88:539:537:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Intuitively, higherαturns certain coalitions that were otherwise non-self-enforcing into self-
34:1358:77257:20:19:72:540:517:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing coalitions as expected, but this implies that larger coalitions are now less likely to be
34:1359:77356:19:20:72:539:498:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:self-enforcing and less likely to emerge as the ruling coalition. This, in turn, makes larger coalitions
34:1360:77460:20:20:72:540:478:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:more stable. This proposition therefore establishes that greater power or “agreement” requirements
34:1361:77558:20:20:72:474:458:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in the form of supermajority rules do not necessarily lead to larger ruling coalitions.
34:1362:77645:20:20:88:539:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The next proposition establishes the complementary result that an increase in the power of an
34:1363:77738:20:20:72:539:418:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:individual can remove him out of the ruling coalition. To state this result, let us use the notation

34:1373:78393:20:19:88:539:201:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Proposition 8 shows that being more powerful may be a disadvantage, even for the most powerful
34:1374:78487:19:20:71:539:182:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:player. This raises the question of when the most powerful player will be part of the ruling coalition.
34:1375:78590:20:29:71:313:162:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:This question is addressed in the next proposition.

35:1400:79317:26:20:72:539:599:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In this subsection, we illustrate the structure of equilibrium ruling coalitions more explicitly for the

35:1415:80210:20:20:88:540:400:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 2 shows the evolution of the set of self-enforcing coalitions asαchanges from1/2(simple

35:1420:80667:20:20:72:540:301:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:demonstrates that the set of self-enforcing coalitions, while remaining a union of afinite number of
35:1421:80767:20:20:72:540:281:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:convex sets, may have non-convex connected components. Interestingly, the “central coalitions”,
35:1422:80862:20:20:72:539:261:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:i.e. those close to(1/3,1/3,1/3), which were self-enforcing whenα=1/2,cease to be self-enforcing
35:1423:80958:20:19:72:539:241:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:whenαincreases. The reason is that withα>1/2,there is a range of2-person self-enforcing
35:1424:81045:19:20:72:539:222:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions; the fact that they are self-enforcing makes3-person coalitions containing them non-

35:1426:81237:20:20:72:539:182:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalitions coalition set becomes a union of afinite number of convex connected components (namely,
35:1427:81335:20:0:72:403:162:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of three trapezoids). Whenα=2/3,the trapezoids become triangles.

36:1432:81598:20:20:72:539:488:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:demonstrates that the self-enforcing coalition set is non-monotonic inα: the coalitions close to

36:1434:81790:19:20:72:539:449:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:B:and eventually grows to cover all points whenαapproaches1,but for allαsuch that2/3<α<1,
36:1435:81877:20:20:72:540:429:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:it is a joint of four triangles as shown in the third panel. Obviously, points in the “middle” set
36:1436:81975:20:20:72:539:409:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of self-enforcing coalitions are more stable than other self-enforcing coalitions: even if there is a
36:1437:82076:20:34:72:484:389:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:random shock that eliminates some players, the remainder is a self-enforcing coalition.
36:1438:82163:34:31:72:188:355:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:7Extensions
36:1439:82174:31:20:72:539:324:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we discuss two extensions of our basic framework. First, we show how this framework
36:1440:82274:20:20:72:540:304:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:can be applied for thinking about endogenous party formation, and second we show how reallocation
36:1441:82371:20:19:72:539:284:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of power within a group can be beneficial for all group members (which is a form of “giving up the
36:1442:82469:19:30:72:224:265:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:guns” mentioned in footnote 7).
36:1443:82500:30:27:72:200:235:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:C:7.1  Party Formation
36:1444:82520:27:19:72:539:208:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:If there were no enforcement constraints, theminimal winning coalitionwould always emerge as
36:1445:82612:19:20:72:539:189:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the ruling coalition.15However, we have seen that the ultimate ruling coalition is not necessarily
36:1446:82710:20:20:71:539:169:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the minimal winning coalition. This is because the minimal winning coalition might not be self-
36:1447:82805:20:20:71:539:149:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enforcing (e.g., as is coalition(3,4)in(3,4,5)), and thus cannot form a ruling coalition. What
36:1448:82899:20:20:71:539:129:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:prevents the formation of this coalition is the fact that its members do not to trust each other. If
36:1449:82999:20:16:71:539:109:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:somehow they could enter into binding agreements, the minimum winning coalition could emerge
36:1450:83091:16:14:80:539:93:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:15X∈P(N)is a minimal winning coalition withinNifγX>αγNandγX≤γZfor anyZ∈P(N)such that

37:1452:83184:0:20:72:540:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:as the ultimate willing coalition. In this subsection, we think of party formation as a way of forming
37:1453:83286:20:19:72:540:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:binding agreements among a subset of agents. In particular, we allow some of the players to form
37:1454:83382:19:20:71:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:permanent alliances, effectively merging into a single member with combined power. Another way
37:1455:83476:20:20:71:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is to allow members of a coalition freely transfer (shares of) their power to each other to make the
37:1456:83576:20:20:71:379:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:coalition self-enforcing, which is explored in the next subsection.
37:1457:83643:20:20:88:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:More specifically, consider the party-formation gameˆΓ0, which is identical to the gameˆΓin
37:1458:83734:20:20:72:539:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Section 4, except that there is now afirst stage beforeˆΓis played, in which a subset of agents can
37:1459:83833:20:20:72:540:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:form a binding coalition, a “party,” and this party plays the game as a single agent. The result
37:1460:83929:20:19:72:539:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of this party-formation game will be that the minimal winning coalition will form a party and will
37:1461:84027:19:28:72:231:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:guarantee power for its members.
37:1462:84059:28:20:72:539:508:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f5:C:Proposition 10Suppose Assumption 1 holds and letXbe the minimal winning coalition, i.e.,

37:1467:84336:27:20:72:540:386:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:We have seen that individuals can be made worse offby having more power. This naturally raises
37:1468:84430:20:20:72:539:366:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the question of whether individuals would like to relinquish their power (for example, give up their

37:1470:84628:20:20:72:539:326:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:under the assumption thatα=1/2. Our main result is that any minimal winning coalitionXcan
37:1471:84717:20:19:72:539:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:redistribute power in such a way that it becomes self-enforcing, and each member ofXis better
37:1472:84810:19:20:72:350:287:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:offthan he would have been without power redistribution.
37:1473:84866:20:20:88:539:267:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f8:A:The next result demonstrates that when the size of the minimal winning coalition exceeds2

39:1633:88057:30:20:72:539:272:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:The central question of political economy ishow collective choices are made among a group of
39:1634:88149:20:20:72:539:252:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:individuals with conflicting preferences (and potentially different “powers”). We study this question
39:1635:88250:20:20:72:540:232:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in the context of a game of endogenous coalition formation. We assume that each individual is
39:1636:88343:20:20:72:544:212:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:endowed with a level of political power, which may be derived from his or her specificskillsor
39:1637:88437:20:20:71:540:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:access to resources (guns, money etc.). The ruling coalition consists of a subset of the individuals
39:1638:88537:20:19:71:539:172:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in the society and decides the distribution of resources. The main innovation of our approach is
39:1639:88633:19:20:71:539:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that we also require ruling coalitions to beself-enforcing, in the sense that none of the subcoalitions
39:1640:88736:20:20:71:477:133:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of this ruling coalition should be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition.
39:1641:88822:20:20:88:539:113:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Wefirst model these issues using an axiomatic approach based on four axioms. The two im-
39:1642:88910:20:20:71:539:93:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:portant axioms are that the ruling coalition should be powerful enough (thepower constraint)
39:1643:89002:20:0:71:539:73:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and that the ruling coalition should be self-enforcing (theenforcement constraint). We prove that
40:1644:89101:0:20:72:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:there exists a unique mapping, which is generically single-valued, that satisfies these axioms. This
40:1645:89201:20:19:71:448:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:provides an axiomatic way of characterizing the ruling coalitions for any game.
40:1646:89280:19:20:88:540:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:We support this notion by showing that the result of our axiomatic analysis also follows from
40:1647:89373:20:20:72:540:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the “reasonable equilibria” of a dynamic game of coalition formation and also as the unique core
40:1648:89469:20:20:72:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:allocation of a related non-transferable cooperative game.  In particular, we construct a simple
40:1649:89565:20:20:72:540:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:dynamic game that captures the same notions that aruling coalition should have a certain amount
40:1650:89660:20:20:71:539:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of power and should be self-enforcing (stable). As with other dynamic voting games, this game
40:1651:89753:20:20:71:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f5:B:possesses many subgame perfect equilibria. We propose the notion ofsequentially weakly dominant
40:1652:89848:20:19:71:539:555:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5:C:equilibriumas an equilibrium concept for this and related games (which referred to asagenda-
40:1653:89940:19:20:72:539:536:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f2:B:setting games). We prove that agenda-setting games always have sequentially weakly dominant
40:1654:90031:20:20:72:539:516:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria and Markov trembling and perfect equilibria.  Moreover, in our dynamic game, both
40:1655:90123:20:20:71:348:496:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:concepts generically yield a unique equilibrium allocation.
40:1656:90182:20:20:88:539:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:After establishing these results on the existenceof equilibria and ruling coalitions in related
40:1657:90277:20:20:71:539:456:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:axiomatic, noncooperative and cooperative games, we present a series of results on the structure of
40:1658:90376:20:31:71:383:436:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ruling coalitions. In particular,we establish the following results:
40:1659:90444:31:20:88:539:405:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:A:•Despite the simplicity of the environment, the ruling coalition can be of any size relative to the
40:1660:90543:20:20:99:539:385:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:society, and may include or exclude more powerful individuals in the society. Consequently,
40:1661:90634:20:29:99:428:365:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:the equilibrium payoffof an individual is not monotone in his power.
40:1662:90702:29:20:88:539:336:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:A:•Self-enforcing coalitions are generally “fragile,” especiallyunder majority rule. For example,
40:1663:90797:20:20:99:539:316:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:under majority rule, adding or subtracting one player from a self-enforcing coalition makes
40:1664:90888:20:19:99:539:296:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:it non-self-enforcing. Despite this type of fragility of self-enforcing coalitions, we also show
40:1665:90984:19:20:99:539:277:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:that the ruling coalition is “continuous,” in the sense that two games where the powers of the
40:1666:91078:20:29:99:401:257:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:players are sufficiently close will have the same ruling coalition.
40:1667:91145:29:20:88:539:228:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:A:•Somewhat paradoxically, an increase inα–that is an increase in the degree of supermajority
40:1668:91236:20:20:99:539:208:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:necessary to make decisions–does not necessarily lead to larger ruling coalitions. Also, the
40:1669:91328:20:20:99:540:188:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:most powerful individual will be often excluded from the ruling coalition, unless he is powerful
40:1670:91424:20:28:99:539:168:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:enough to win by himself or weak enough so as to be part of smaller self-enforcing coalitions.
40:1671:91518:28:20:88:540:140:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f2:A:•Coalitions of certain sizes are more likely to emerge as the ruling coalition. For example, with
40:1672:91615:20:20:99:539:120:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:majority rule, i.e.,α=1/2, the ruling coalition cannot (generically) consist of two individuals.
40:1673:91711:20:20:99:540:100:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Moreover, again whenα=1/2,coalitions where members have roughly the same power exist
40:1674:91795:20:0:99:389:80:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:only when the coalition’s size is2k−1wherekis an integer.
41:1675:91854:0:20:88:539:714:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:There are a number of natural areas for future study. A similar approach blending axiomatic
41:1676:91945:20:19:71:539:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:foundations and dynamic games can be adopted to analyze the structure of ruling coalitions in
41:1677:92038:19:20:71:539:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:a more general class of political games, where there are multiple resources to be distributed (or
41:1678:92135:20:20:71:539:655:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:multiple policies over which individuals disagree). Our results on general agenda-setting games
41:1679:92230:20:20:71:539:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that the approach here might be extended to this more general setting. Another interesting
41:1680:92328:20:20:71:539:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:area for future research would be to investigate what types of coalitions will form when there is some
41:1681:92430:20:20:71:539:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:randomness in the environment, for example, if the powers or preferences of different individuals
41:1682:92527:20:20:71:539:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:may change by a small amount after the coalition is formed. Such an approach would allow us to
41:1683:92621:20:19:71:539:555:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:determine the extent to which a coalition is “robust” and also to quantify what “price” the coalition
41:1684:92722:19:20:71:539:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is willing to pay for robustness by including individuals that may not be necessary for obtaining a
41:1685:92821:20:0:71:114:516:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:majority.

42:1754:94082:23:12:88:539:391:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Note that MTHPE is defined directly in the agent-strategic form in order to avoid standard problems
42:1755:94181:12:12:72:539:379:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:that arise when trembling hand perfection is defined on the strategic form (e.g., Selten, 1975, Osborne and

42:1762:94816:12:12:71:539:296:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:in this class of games, every MTHPE is an SWDE, so anSWDE exists. Nevertheless, these two equilibrium
42:1763:94917:12:12:71:539:284:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:concepts do not always coincide. First, a MTHPE always exists, while SWDE may not. Second, there may
42:1764:95017:12:12:71:378:272:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:exist SWDEs that are not MTHPE (see Theorem 6 and Appendix B).
42:1765:95079:12:12:88:539:260:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Let usfirst define general agenda-setting games, which include most voting games as a special case, and

42:1774:95736:15:11:72:539:106:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:MTHPE. A truly perfect equilibrium requires strategies fromσto be best responses to all fully mixed profiles in some

43:1782:96488:24:11:88:539:650:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:This definition states that any game in which one of the agents makes a proposal and others vote in

43:1787:96943:24:18:71:493:579:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f5:F:Theorem 61. Anyfinite extensive-form game has a MTHPE (possibly in mixed strategies).
43:1788:97028:18:18:85:417:561:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:F:2. Any agenda-setting game has a MTHPE and a SWDE in pure strategies.

43:1791:97196:18:24:85:393:507:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:F:5. There exist agenda-setting games where a SWDE is not a MTHPE.
43:1792:97260:24:12:71:539:483:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:F:Proof. (Part 1)Consider a perturbed game where each playeri∈Nis confined to play each action

43:1794:97447:12:12:71:540:459:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:actions in each stage.  By the standardfixed point theorem argument, this perturbed game has a Nash
43:1795:97546:12:12:71:539:447:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:equilibrium; moreover, thefixed point theorem applies if we restrict our attention to Markovian strategies
43:1796:97652:12:0:71:385:435:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:only.  Therefore, the perturbed game has a Markov Perfect Equilibria

43:1819:97954:12:12:71:249:397:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:in Markovian strategies, i.e. an MTHPE.
43:1820:97993:12:12:88:539:385:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:F:(Part 2)Let us prove that an agenda-setting game has a MTHPE in pure strategies, then the result for
43:1821:98093:12:12:71:540:373:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:SWDE will immediately follow from Part 3. We do this by induction on the number of stages. The base is
43:1822:98195:12:12:71:540:361:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:trivial; indeed, consider a one-shotagenda-setting game. If this stage is one-player move, then, evidently, the
43:1823:98306:12:12:71:539:349:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:action which maximizes his utility constitutes a pure strategy MTHPE, since it is Markovian and trembling-
43:1824:98412:12:12:71:539:337:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:hand perfect. If the single stage is voting, then each playeriweakly prefers one of the outcomes to another.
43:1825:98520:12:12:71:416:325:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:It is trivial to check that voting for aweakly preferred outcome is an MTHPE.
43:1826:98597:12:12:88:539:313:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Now proceed with the induction step.  Suppose that we have proved the existence of pure strategy

43:1833:99284:12:11:71:540:229:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:isomorphic, thenσnj1=σnj2for anyn.Now,considerplayeriatfirst stage. For anyn,thereisjnsuch that

43:1838:99795:12:12:72:539:170:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:are isomorphic, take the same MTHPE), and we can similarly construct two sequences of strategy profiles

43:1842:100199:12:12:72:539:122:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:for infinite number ofm’s. Now consider two subsequences of sequencesσ1y,σ2y,...andσ1n,σ2n,...which

44:1857:101632:12:12:72:123:583:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:is a SWDE.
44:1858:101642:12:12:88:539:571:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Now consider the other situation where thefirst stage is a voting stage. Consider a profileσ0consisting of

44:1868:102658:12:12:88:539:451:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Now take any playeriwho participates in voting. Ifu+i>u−i, then he votes for the proposal in this

45:1903:105254:12:12:88:540:587:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Using the fact thatσ∗is MTHPE, it is easy to see that strategies fromσXare Markovian, it is also

45:1910:105958:12:12:71:539:504:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:straightforward to check that any deviation is not profitable at the stage where proposals are made (mainly

45:1923:107054:12:12:72:237:326:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:that even ifε=0,σ∗forms a SWDE.

52:2392:125776:12:20:72:413:466:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:For the configuration of votes whereiis pivotal, his vote of ̃ygives him utility

52:2398:126182:12:12:71:539:362:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f8:F:that at theqth voting stage,icannot vote ̃ywith a positive probability in SWDEσ∗.Sincei∈Y\φ(Y)
52:2399:126276:12:12:72:539:350:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:was arbitrary, this yields a contradiction and implies thatYwithγφ(Y)≤αγNcannot emerge as the URC
52:2400:126373:12:12:71:539:338:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:after any historyh. This yields a contradiction and establishes the intermediate result. Consequently, any

52:2403:126645:12:12:88:540:302:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:The next step is to prove that ifM=φ(N)is proposed (before any elimination), thenMwill necessarily

52:2405:126835:12:12:72:539:278:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:positive probability (and who may be pivotal for some distribution of votes) at historyh. For the equilibrium
52:2406:126944:12:20:72:350:266:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f4:F:distribution of other player’s votes, the vote of ̃nyields a payoff

52:2408:127029:20:12:72:539:226:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:for playeri. This inequality follows because eitherMis not the URC, and from the previous paragraph, the
52:2409:127133:12:12:72:151:214:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:URCZmust have

52:2411:127158:17:12:71:540:185:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:and thus yielding lower payoffto playerithanwi(M)−εI{M6=N}−εkh, or becauseMis the URC but will
52:2412:127252:12:12:72:539:173:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:will be reached with more than one round of elimination. Since ̃nis chosen with a positive probability as
52:2413:127357:12:12:72:539:161:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:part of SWDEσ∗,voting ̃ymust yield no more thanudi, and therefore, even ifivoted ̃y,Mwould not have
52:2414:127456:12:12:71:301:149:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:been reached after at most one round of elimination.
52:2415:127508:12:12:88:539:137:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f6:F:Suppose next thatiswitches to voting ̃y, but there is some other playeri0∈Mwho also casts vote ̃n
52:2416:127605:12:20:71:421:125:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:with a positive probability. With a similar reasoning, voting ̃nyields a payoffof

52:2418:127706:20:12:72:540:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:to playeri0. Again since voting ̃ntoMfori0∈Min SWDEσ∗must be no worse than voting ̃y. This implies
52:2419:127804:12:0:72:539:73:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:that even ifi0were to switch to ̃y,Mwill still have a positive chance of not being reached, or reached after
53:2420:127914:0:12:72:543:714:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:more than one round of elimination. Now proceeding in the same manner through all the players inM,we
53:2421:128014:12:12:72:539:702:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:can conclude that, sinceσ∗is a SWDE, even if alli∈Mvote ̃y,Mshould not be reached after no more than
53:2422:128114:12:12:72:540:690:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:one round of elimination with probability1. This last observation yields a contradiction, however, because
53:2423:128220:12:12:72:539:678:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of the following facts: (i)Mis a winning coalition, so if alli0∈Mvote ̃yto the proposal ofM,Mwill
53:2424:128317:12:12:72:540:666:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:emerge as the URC after at most one round of elimination with probability 1; (ii) whenMis reached after

53:2427:128491:22:12:71:545:611:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:implying that voting ̃nto the proposal ofMcould not be part of any SWDEσ∗.Consequently,wehave
53:2428:128584:12:12:72:539:599:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:established that whenM=φ(N)is proposed atj=0(before any elimination), thenMwill be the URC
53:2429:128674:12:12:71:195:587:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:with probability 1 underσ∗.
53:2430:128701:12:12:88:539:575:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:An identical argument applies for any stagej≥0,wherealli∈Mhave not been eliminated. Therefore,
53:2431:128795:12:12:71:539:563:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:wheneverM=φ(N)is proposed,Mwill be the URC with probability 1, and there cannot be any other

53:2433:128891:12:12:88:540:539:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:To complete the proof, it remains to show thatMwill be offered with probability 1 before any elimination
53:2434:128995:12:12:72:539:527:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:has occurred (i.e., atj=0). Suppose that atj=0Nature has picked playeri∈Mas the proposer. It is
53:2435:129090:12:12:71:540:515:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:straightforward to see that in this caseMwill emerge as the URC after at most one round of elimination.
53:2436:129193:12:12:71:539:503:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Suppose not. Since we know from the previous paragraph that onceMis proposed, it will be accepted
53:2437:129290:12:12:71:544:491:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:with probability 1 after at most one round of elimination, giving payoffwi(M)−εI{M6=N}to playeri,it

53:2439:129487:12:12:72:539:467:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:expectation. However, sinceMwill be the URC with probability 1 underσ∗and it is not reached in one
53:2440:129585:12:12:72:539:455:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:round of elimination, when the proposalχiis accepted, it must be that the payoffto playerimust take a
53:2441:129686:12:12:71:539:443:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:value less than or equal towi(M)−εI{M6=N}−ε<wi(M)−εI{M6=N}. Therefore,χi6=M(not proposing

53:2443:129864:12:12:71:539:419:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:by Nature atj=0, the proposal ofMwill be made and will be accepted with probability 1. Now suppose
53:2444:129962:12:12:71:538:407:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f6:F:that Nature picksi0,q/∈Mas the proposer before anyi∈M. Note that at stagej=0,suchi0,q/∈M
53:2445:130050:12:12:71:539:395:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:can be picked as the proposer at most|N|−|M|times. Thus, after at most|N|−|M|votes against the
53:2446:130144:12:11:71:540:383:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:proposals, somei0∈Mwill be picked as the proposer. Then the same argument as above establishes that
53:2447:130243:11:12:71:544:372:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:in any SWDEσ∗alli∈Mmust vote ̃nwith probability 1 to the proposal by anyi0,q/∈M.Thisfollows
53:2448:130334:12:12:72:539:360:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:since voting ̃ywill lead to some payoffudi<wi(M)−εI{M6=N}fori∈M. knowing that ultimately Nature

53:2451:130614:12:12:71:539:324:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f2:F:i∈M. Therefore, in any SWDEσ∗, all proposals byi0,q/∈Mat stagej=0are rejected with probability
