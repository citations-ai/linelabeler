2:30:1457:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:Using a new dataset constructed from nonprofit tax-returns, this paper explores how vouchers and
2:31:1553:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:other large-scale programs subsidizing private school attendance have affected the fiscal outcomes
2:32:1651:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of private schools and the affordability of a private education. We find that subsidy programs created
2:33:1753:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:a large transfer of public funding to private schools, suggesting that every dollar of funding increased
2:34:1857:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:revenue by a dollar or more. Turning to the incidence of subsidies and the impact of subsidies on
2:35:1954:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:enrollment, our findings depend on the type of program introduced, with programs restricting eligibility
2:36:2058:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:to certain groups of students creating relatively large enrollment gains and small price increases compared
2:37:2165:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:to unrestricted programs. We calculate elasticities of demand and supply for private schools, and discuss

3:51:2498:0:30:72:161:710:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:Introduction
3:52:2510:30:20:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The United States is currently undergoing a revolution in the subsidization of private education, with dozens
3:53:2619:20:20:72:540:660:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of states considering or recently enacting large-scale laws that use public resources to promote attendance
3:54:2726:20:20:72:540:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at private elementary and secondary schools.  Currently, over a million U.S. families participate in such
3:55:2831:20:20:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:programs and recent legislation in several states will push this number higher in coming years (Friedman
3:56:2935:20:20:72:154:600:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Foundation, 2013).
3:57:2953:20:20:86:539:580:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:But the proliferation of these programs across the country should not be taken as evidence that observers
3:58:3058:20:20:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:agree on how they work. Several elements of subsidy programs remain highly controversial. In particular,
3:59:3162:20:20:72:540:540:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:arguments often focus on thefinancialimplications of these policies.  On the one hand, these programs
3:60:3263:20:20:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are sometimes depicted as providing resources to disadvantaged families (Governor Mitch Daniels, 2011;
3:61:3365:20:20:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Governor Jan Brewer, 2012) or to wealthy families whose children would attend private school in any event
3:62:3470:20:19:72:540:480:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(Reese, 2009; People for the American Way, 2003). But families are not the only potential beneficiaries of
3:63:3576:19:20:72:540:461:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private-school subsidies; some observers emphasize that these subsidies represent a new and unprecedented
3:64:3681:20:20:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:source of financial support for schools themselves (Crothers, 2014). The validity of these descriptions depends
3:65:3792:20:20:72:540:421:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:upon how these programs impact the cost and prevalence of private education, and whether subsidy funding
3:66:3896:20:20:72:236:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ultimately goes to families or schools.
3:67:3935:20:20:86:539:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Prior research offers little evidence regarding these outcomes.  Of course, there is a large literature
3:68:4038:20:20:72:540:361:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:exploring the impact of voucher programs on economically important activities; Figlio (2009), Hoxby (2003),
3:69:4145:20:20:72:540:341:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and the Center on Education Policy (2011) provide useful background on research here. But most of this prior
3:70:4253:20:20:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:work considers outcomes such as student achievement, Tiebout sorting, and public-school performance. Using
3:71:4359:20:20:72:540:301:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sophisticated theoretical models, some studies predict how vouchers might impact private school enrollment
3:72:4465:20:20:72:540:281:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or tuition (Epple and Romano, 1998; Ferreyra, 2007; and Nechyba, 2000) but the empirical validity of these
3:73:4571:20:20:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:studies is unproven. Evidence for how subsidies affect private school finances, or evidence on the incidence
3:74:4679:20:20:72:514:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of school subsidies generally, is difficult to find. The goal of this paper is to contribute such evidence.
3:75:4786:20:20:86:539:221:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A key challenge in doing so is finding data on private-school finances. For this, we turn to a largely-
3:76:4889:20:19:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unnoticed source of data: nonprofit tax returns. Using a dataset of IRS Form 990 returns made available by
3:77:4995:19:20:72:540:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the National Center for Charitable Statistics, we construct a panel dataset with detailed financial informa-
3:78:5103:20:20:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tion for thousands of private schools each year. Our sample covers about 20% of all private school enrollment
3:79:5212:20:20:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the country. While some important groups of private schools, such as Catholic schools, are not included
3:80:5318:20:20:72:540:122:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the sample, we provide several pieces of evidence which give us optimism that estimates from this sample
3:81:5425:20:20:72:261:102:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:could be informative for all private schools.
3:82:5470:20:0:86:539:82:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We first investigate whether school revenue increases when a policy to subsidize private schooling is
4:83:5572:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:implemented. We focus on large-scale statewide subsidy programs. These programs are notable for their
4:84:5673:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:extraordinary (and ongoing) proliferation, and their large size suggests that they could have important effects
4:85:5784:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on school enrollment and finances even at the state level, unlike the smaller-scale voucher programs that
4:86:5889:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have been the focus of past work.  Our data cover the years 1991 to 2009; there are several states that
4:87:5992:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enacted large-scale programs to subsidize private-school attendance that we use in our baseline estimates.
4:88:6098:20:20:72:375:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We discuss these programs and their enactment in more detail below.
4:89:6165:20:20:86:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We find robust evidence that school subsidies raise revenue for the private schools in our sample and that
4:90:6271:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the magnitude of this effect is large; even conservative extrapolations to all private schools indicate that a
4:91:6381:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dollar of subsidy funding raises private school revenue by a dollar or more. However, we find that the impact
4:92:6490:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:depends crucially on the type of program enacted. Several programs we study place important restrictions
4:93:6594:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on which students in a state can qualify for the subsidy (e.g., the programs are means-tested). We call these
4:94:6703:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:restricted programs. In contrast, unrestricted programs explicitly or in practice allow families to receive
4:95:6810:20:20:72:504:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies for expenditures on their own children and are not means tested nor otherwise restricted.
4:96:6909:20:19:86:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We find evidence of private school enrollment growth following the establishment of a restricted program,
4:97:7014:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:but not for unrestricted programs. We further find increases in per-student revenue (specifically, per-student
4:98:7124:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program service revenue, a proxy for tuition) in response to unrestricted programs, but not for restricted
4:99:7230:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:programs. Thus both types of program raise school revenue, but in very different ways. For unrestricted
4:100:7333:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:programs we cannot reject that the incidence of the subsidy falls entirely on schools while for other laws we
4:101:7442:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cannot reject that it falls entirely on families. These results are consistent with several depictions of private
4:102:7555:20:20:72:208:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:education, as we discuss below.
4:103:7586:20:20:86:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we construct a simple estimate of the price elasticity of demand for private schooling and a
4:104:7687:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:very simple estimate of the deadweight loss created for each dollar of public revenue spent on private-school
4:105:7796:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidization. Our results suggest a price elasticity of -0.52; this is slightly larger in absolute value than
4:106:7906:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the baseline estimate in Dynarski, Gruber, and Li (2009), although one could argue that the population
4:107:8008:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:they study (families with siblings already in private school) would be less price sensitive than the population
4:108:8119:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:affected by publicly-funded subsidies that we consider here. Our simple estimate of deadweight loss is 3
4:109:8223:20:20:72:402:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cents per dollar spent; we know of no comparable estimate for this number.
4:110:8297:20:19:86:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the school subsidy laws used
4:111:8400:19:0:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:here. Section 3 discusses the data, section 4 the specifications, section 5 the results, and section 6 concludes.
5:112:8514:0:30:72:239:710:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.  School Subsidy Laws
5:113:8537:30:20:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The main estimates in this paper focus on what we refer to as “school subsidy laws.” By this, we mean
5:114:8638:20:20:72:540:660:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:laws that use government funds to subsidize private school tuition. This includes both traditional vouchers
5:115:8745:20:20:72:540:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and related tax-credit based subsidy laws; while technically distinct from traditional school vouchers, tuition
5:116:8856:20:20:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tax credits serve the same purpose and work in a very similar way. A typical voucher program consists
5:117:8957:20:20:72:540:600:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of a government agency distributing money, which has been collected through taxation, to the families of
5:118:9061:20:20:72:540:580:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:students on the condition that the money will be spent on private schooling. In a typical tax credit program,
5:119:9170:20:20:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the government reduces the tax liability, often dollar for dollar up to some limit, of a taxpayer that has
5:120:9276:20:20:72:540:540:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:provided funding to support students’ private schooling. In both cases, states dedicate public resources to
5:121:9383:20:20:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private school attendance for select students. The similarities between vouchers and tuition tax credits have
5:122:9492:20:20:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:led some to refer to these tax credits as “neovouchers” (Welner, 2008), or sometimes simply as “vouchers”
5:123:9597:20:19:72:540:480:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., Caputo, 2013). We will refer to these laws as subsidies and, when using the term vouchers hereafter,
5:124:9704:19:20:72:540:461:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we will endeavor to clarify whether the term refers to subsidies generally or strictly to traditional voucher
5:125:9813:20:20:72:338:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:programs that use vouchers per se as a financing mechanism.
5:126:9872:20:20:86:539:421:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Our focus will be on several large statewide laws that affected reasonably large groups of students between
5:127:9979:20:20:72:540:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:1991 and 2009. With the exception of Chan (2006), who looks at the effect of a tax-credit law in Ontario on
5:128:10086:20:20:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:public school performance, and Rinz (2015), which explores how these laws affect student/teacher ratios and
5:129:10193:20:20:72:539:361:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:other educational inputs for students of different races, we know of no economic research on these laws.1The
5:130:10301:20:20:72:540:341:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:discussion here draws on discussions in Welner (2008), the Friedman Foundation (2013), Schaeffer (2009),
5:131:10405:20:20:72:520:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and a report compiled by the Research Department of the Minnesota House of Representatives (2011).
5:132:10503:20:20:86:539:301:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Tax-credit subsidy laws for private school tuition fall into two areas: credits for individuals and credits
5:133:10610:20:20:72:540:281:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for corporations. Corporate tax credit programs provide an income-tax credit for corporate donations to a
5:134:10715:20:20:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school tuition organization, or STO, which then uses the donated funds to award scholarships to children
5:135:10819:20:20:72:539:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:attending private schools.2There are three states which enacted corporate tax credits of this kind during
5:136:10924:20:20:72:540:221:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the period of study here: Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania. These programs use credits, not deductions,
5:137:11029:20:19:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:so that the financial incentive created by the program can be quite large even if the state income tax rate is
5:138:11139:19:20:72:540:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:small. For example, in Florida during the time of this study the corporate income tax rate was 5.5%, but
5:139:11243:20:20:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Florida’s tax credit program awards a credit dollar-for-dollar with respect to donations to STOs. A program
5:140:11350:20:15:72:539:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in Florida that used a taxdeductionfor corporate donations would thus lower the opportunity cost of a
5:141:11451:15:12:83:539:127:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:1Some state-government reports consider the financial effect of these laws onpublicschool funding. That is not the focus of
5:142:11574:12:10:72:540:115:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:this paper, although it is certainly an important topic. Studies considering issues related to public finance and public education
5:143:11704:10:7:72:304:105:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:include Murray, Evans, and Schwab (1998) and Fischel (2006).
5:144:11764:7:12:83:540:98:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:2In recent years the tax base for some corporate credits has been expanded; for example in 2009 (beyond the period of study
5:145:11887:12:0:72:459:86:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:here) Arizona and Florida both expanded corporate tax credit programs to the insurance premiums tax.
6:146:11988:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dollar given to STOs down from one dollar to 95 cents, but the taxcreditprogram lowers the cost of this
6:147:12091:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:donation from one dollar to zero. Indeed, with dollar-for-dollar credits the actual marginal income tax rate
6:148:12199:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is irrelevant. This extreme reimbursement rate creates a program that could in practice operate similarly
6:149:12304:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to a traditional voucher program, but the circuitous design of the program (having the subsidy delivered
6:150:12408:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by way of a corporately-supported STO, rather than by the government directly) is attractive from a legal
6:151:12513:20:20:72:437:610:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:standpoint. We discuss the legal challenges to these subsidy programs more below.3
6:152:12595:20:20:86:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Individual income tax credit programs may either award a credit for donations made to STOs, or for a
6:153:12695:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:household’s own spending on private school tuition and other private school expenses. There are three states
6:154:12803:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with programs of this kind during the period of our study: Arizona, Iowa, and Illinois. Even though many
6:155:12907:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:state’s individual income tax rates are relatively low (compared to federal rates), these programs create large
6:156:13018:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:financial subsidies since they use credits rather than deductions. But most individual credits are different
6:157:13126:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from other subsidy programs in that they both (a) allow individuals to claim credits for private school tuition
6:158:13237:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for their own children and (b) are not restricted to certain types of students, such as low income students,
6:159:13345:20:19:72:413:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:students with special educational needs, or students initially in public schools.
6:160:13426:19:20:86:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 1 provides information on the laws used in the main part of this study (we discuss several other
6:161:13528:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:laws momentarily).  There are eight laws that are the focus here: an individual and corporate credit in
6:162:13631:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Arizona, a voucher program and corporate credit in Florida, an individual credit in Illinois, two individual
6:163:13739:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:credits in Iowa (one restricted, one not), and a corporate credit in Pennsylvania.45As the table suggests,
6:164:13845:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:several programs are not means tested, and have relatively weak restrictions on student use. Appendix A
6:165:13948:20:20:72:348:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:provides some additional information on each state’s programs.
6:166:14010:20:20:86:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 1 shows total spending each year from 1991 to 1999 on the programs listed in Table 1 (in year 2012
6:167:14115:20:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dollars). Here, “spending” refers to (a) credits claimed for individual- and corporate-income tax programs
6:168:14221:15:13:83:540:276:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:3The Florida credit is capped at 75% of corporate taxes due. Arizona’s corporate income tax rate during the period of its
6:169:14342:13:9:72:540:263:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:corporate tax credit here was 6.968%; its program also awarded credits dollar-for-dollar. Pennsylvania’s program awarded a
6:170:14464:9:9:72:540:254:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:credit based on either 75% or 90% of a donation depending on whether the donation was a one time or repeated contribution;
6:171:14586:9:10:72:540:245:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the fact that the credit is less than one-for-one means that the tax rate affects the cost of the donation. Pennsylvania’s corporate
6:172:14718:10:9:72:540:235:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:income tax rate during the period of study here was 9.99%. As of 2015, about 2,300 companies receive this Pennsylvania credit
6:173:14843:9:10:72:540:226:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:(see page D9 of Wolf, 2015) (this credit is capped at $300,000 a year during our period of study). Appendix A has more details
6:174:14969:10:7:72:124:216:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:on these laws.
6:175:14983:7:12:83:540:209:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:4There was a second voucher program in Florida that coincided with the McKay program, the A+ Accountability and
6:176:15094:12:9:72:540:197:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:School Choice Program. This program allowed students at public schools which had been awarded a grade of “F” in two of
6:177:15212:9:10:72:540:188:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the prior 4 years to receive a voucher. Economists have studied the impact of this program on public school behavior; see
6:178:15333:10:9:72:540:178:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Chakrabarti (2013) for a discussion. While the A+ program had the potential to influence public school behavior in interesting
6:179:15459:9:10:72:540:169:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:and important ways, the number of actual vouchers awarded under the program was much more limited than either of the
6:180:15575:10:9:72:540:159:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:programs in Table 1 (partly because of court rulings) and the program was ruled unconstitutional in 2006. In a typical year
6:181:15698:9:10:72:540:150:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:only a few hundred students used the program to attend private schools (Forster, 2008). Given that the program’s enrollment
6:182:15821:10:9:72:540:140:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:prior to 2001 (the year the corporate credit began) was even more limited (only two schools qualified for vouchers in the first
6:183:15948:9:10:72:540:131:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:possible year, 1999; and no schools did so in the second year) the baseline specifications below would be unchanged even if A+
6:184:16074:10:9:72:87:121:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:vouchers had become much more widespread in later years than they actually did (Greene, 2001).5
6:185:16169:9:10:87:540:112:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:In 2009, “Lexie’s Law” established a corporate tax credit in Arizona to fund STO scholarships specifically for students with
6:186:16293:10:9:72:540:102:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:disabilities. However, since corporate-tax-credit-financed STO scholarships with student eligibility restrictions already existed
6:187:16422:9:9:72:540:93:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:in Arizona and the size of this program was relatively small (in 2010 only about 100 students participated according to the
6:188:16545:9:10:72:540:84:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Friedman Foundation, 2013), we treat Lexie’s Law as part of Arizona’s pre-existing restricted corporate tax credit program
6:189:16667:10:0:72:191:74:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:rather than as a separate entity.
7:190:16701:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and (b) traditional voucher spending under the McKay program. The figure shows that at the turn of the
7:191:16803:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:century there was a surge in school subsidies, with total funding reaching nearly half a billion dollars—a
7:192:16909:20:20:72:476:670:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:reasonably large amount given that these programs focus only on a select group of children.6
7:193:17001:20:20:86:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 2 shows the number of individuals assisted by these laws. To count the number of individuals,
7:194:17101:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the figure sums three things: first, the number of scholarships awarded in each state and year by STOs
7:195:17203:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that qualify for tax-credit status; second, the number of traditional vouchers paid out; and third, the total
7:196:17312:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:number of individual tax returns claiming a tax credit under a school-subsidy program. This figure may
7:197:17414:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not exactly represent the number of students in school-subsidy policies, as the number of taxpayers claiming
7:198:17522:20:20:72:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:individual credits could differ from the number of students benefiting from the tax-exempted expenditures.7
7:199:17629:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:But the figure nonetheless clearly shows striking growth over the past two decades in participation in these
7:200:17737:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:programs, with over half a million individuals each year in the more recent years. The jump from 1999 to
7:201:17841:20:20:72:534:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2000 reflects the expansion of several programs but is primarily driven by the Illinois program’s adoption.
7:202:17948:20:20:86:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:While Figures 1 and 2 show that the programs in Table 1 were large in terms of funding and scope, there
7:203:18051:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:were several other more limited programs enacted during the time period of available data here, particularly
7:204:18159:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:towards the end of the sample. Rhode Island introduced a corporate credit for donations to STOs in 2007,
7:205:18263:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where a dollar of donations resulted in a 75 cent credit (or a 90 cent credit if donations are made in two
7:206:18369:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consecutive years). But, aside from the fact that the program was adopted nearly at the end of the period
7:207:18474:20:20:72:398:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of study here, total eligible credits was capped at only $1 million annually.
7:208:18551:20:20:86:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:State voucher programs were also introduced in DC, Georgia, Ohio, and Utah.8The District of Columbia
7:209:18651:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Opportunity Scholarship program was launched in 2004 and provided vouchers for K-12 students who qualify
7:210:18755:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for free and reduced-price lunches, although the program had a “relatively small annual budget” (Friedman
7:211:18860:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Foundation, 2013). The Georgia Special Needs Scholarship program, enacted in 2007, allows any student
7:212:18961:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with a disability who was previously enrolled in public school to obtain a voucher to attend private school,
7:213:19069:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:although the program’s participation was relatively low—about a thousand students annually—for the period
7:214:19174:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:studied here. The Ohio Autism Scholarship Program, enacted in 2003, and later the Educational Choice
7:215:19274:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Scholarship Program in 2006, both provide vouchers to students across the state. The former program is
7:216:19376:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:limited only to students diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and registered in the public school
7:217:19479:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:special education system; participation in this program was relatively low during the period of study here.
7:218:19586:19:15:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The Educational Choice program provides vouchers to students who attend poorly-performing local public

7:220:19758:10:12:83:540:127:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:7The relevant individual-credit programs here limit credits to expenditures on dependents, so that very high discrepancies
7:221:19880:12:9:72:540:115:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:between credits claimed and students is unlikely. If multiple dependents benefit from a single taxpayer’s credit then the figure
7:222:20008:9:7:72:335:106:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:would underestimate the number of students assisted by these policies.
7:223:20078:7:12:83:540:99:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:8A voucher program was also considered in Colorado before being invalidated by a court ruling. Colorado has subsequently
7:224:20198:12:0:72:391:87:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:introduced a pilot voucher program in 2011, but this is after the period of study here.
8:225:20286:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools (or who attend a charter school but who would be assigned to such a school otherwise). Although
8:226:20389:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:participation was relatively small in the early years of the program (and the period of study used here), it
8:227:20497:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:has since become a large program with annual expenditures of nearly $60 million (Alliance for School Choice,
8:228:20605:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2012). As these programs were more limited in scope or student availability during the years covered by the
8:229:20712:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data below, we will exclude these programs. Many states have also passed related laws following the period
8:230:20818:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of analysis used here, including Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
8:231:20924:20:20:72:230:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Oklahoma, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
8:232:20958:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The set of laws we study thus represents a fraction of the current set of laws. However, our laws have
8:233:21060:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:features in common with many subsequent programs.  For example, the corporate tax credit programs
8:234:21157:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that we use appear to be good models for subsequently enacted programs that use tax credits to direct
8:235:21258:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:donations to third-party scholarship granting organizations, particularly with regard to means testing. Each
8:236:21366:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of these programs used here are means-tested; of the ten STO-style programs enacted since 2006, eight are
8:237:21471:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:means-tested. Moreover, many later voucher programs have important similarities with Florida’s McKay
8:238:21571:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:voucher program. Of the 17 subsequent voucher programs we know of that were enacted after the McKay
8:239:21670:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program, nine are targeted at students with disabilities. Of those nine, six also have prior public school
8:240:21776:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment requirements that apply in at least some cases, so that McKay-style voucher programs account
8:241:21879:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for the majority of both voucher programs and programs for students with disabilities enacted after the
8:242:21982:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cutoff for inclusion in our analysis. Student eligibility for the individual tax credit programs we include, on
8:243:22093:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the other hand, is unrestricted. The only subsequent programs with completely unrestricted eligibility are
8:244:22199:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies provided via reductions in individual income tax.9This of course does not necessarily mean that
8:245:22304:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our results will be informative for all future law changes. But it is noteworthy that, while we use a limited
8:246:22413:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:number of laws, they contain features relevant to many subsequent laws, and we will (as discussed below)
8:247:22517:20:20:72:360:271:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:use subsequent adopters for robustness purposes in our analysis.10
8:248:22583:20:20:86:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:One might naturally wonder about the circumstances behind these states adopting large school subsidy
8:249:22683:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:laws before other states. As Table 1 suggests, the policies passed by states here include several relatively large
8:250:22797:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:states but feature states from across different parts of the country; the laws were signed both by democratic
8:251:22906:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and republican governors. Moreover, while five states are included, the number of states seriously pursuing or
8:252:23016:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsequently enacting similar school subsidy programs is much larger; Huerta and d’Entremont (2007) count
8:253:23121:19:15:71:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at least 40 states considering tax credit programs along the lines of the programs used here.11Further, several
8:254:23232:15:13:83:540:137:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:9There are subsequent programs of this type in three states: Indiana, Louisiana, and Wisconsin. One program, enacted in
8:255:23351:13:9:72:540:124:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Alabama in 2013, operates through the individual tax code and includes a student eligibility restriction. The program provides
8:256:23477:9:7:72:385:115:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:a refundable tax credit to parents who transfer children out of failing public schools.
8:257:23564:7:12:79:540:108:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:10The continued commonality in shared characteristics also suggests that, even if a fuller set of subsequent laws were available,
8:258:23693:12:7:72:453:96:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:parsimonious specifications would likely still be needed for estimations exploring heterogeneous effects.
8:259:23798:7:12:79:540:89:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:11Although they do not figure in our analysis, state charter school programs were also becoming widespread during and after
8:260:23921:12:0:72:540:77:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:our analysis period; all five states with tax credits we use in our main specifications also have charter school programs. With
9:261:24049:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:states have had attempted passage of programs blocked by court ruling or referenda, including California,
9:262:24154:20:20:72:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Vermont, and Washington.12These recent adopters can be exploited to create
9:263:24257:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a more refined control-group for estimation below—that is, if estimates using “late” adopters as a control
9:264:24363:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:group yield highly different estimates than estimates using all non-Table-1 states as a control group, it
9:265:24468:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would raise concerns that there are strong differences in private school markets that are related to (eventual)
9:266:24579:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school-subsidy adoption. Similar estimates regardless of the control group used would lessen this concern.
9:267:24685:20:20:72:171:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We explore this below.
9:268:24707:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:But while the large number of states eventually undertaking school subsidy programs can allow some
9:269:24805:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:investigation into the selectivity of states listed Table 1, one might wonder what determined the timing of
9:270:24912:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:law passage in different states. In some cases the timing stems in part from political events.13But the
9:271:25015:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prominent force in the timing of these laws was perhaps judicial. School subsidy programs face important
9:272:25119:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:legal hurdles, with a foremost obstacle being the historical presence of Blaine Amendments in several state
9:273:25226:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:constitutions. In 1875, James Blaine, a congressional representative in Maine, proposed an amendment to
9:274:25329:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the constitution to preclude grants or appropriations to sectarian institutions or organizations.14While the
9:275:25437:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:amendment was not adopted (falling four votes short of adoption in the Senate), 37 states subsequently
9:276:25539:20:20:72:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:adopted “Blaine Amendments” to their constitutions.15The movement to adopt these amendments was
9:277:25634:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:often associated with anti-Catholic sentiment (Huerta and d’Entremont, 2007). Further, 29 states include a
9:278:25740:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:constitutional clause to prohibit the state from forcing residents to support any ministry (as states sometimes
9:279:25851:20:20:72:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:did in Colonial times). Only three states have neither a Blaine Amendment nor a compelled support clause.16
9:280:25958:20:20:86:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Blaine Amendments and anti-support clauses have historical roots that far precede the modern school-
9:281:26058:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:choice movement; to quote Duncan (2003), “the social and religious contexts in which the State Blaines
9:282:26160:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:operate today are far different from those of their origins.” But they have proven to be somewhat unpre-
9:283:26264:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dictable determinants of the legality of school-subsidy policies today. Court decisions over the validity of
9:284:26372:20:17:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these policies have varied. In Illinois, two separate cases on the legality of the state’s tax-credit program
9:285:26481:17:10:72:540:234:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the exception of Iowa, each state’s charter program preceded its tax credit by at least three years. Given the differential timing
9:286:26611:10:9:72:540:224:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:of charter expansion, these programs should not drive the effects we report here; if anything, the availability of these alternative
9:287:26743:9:7:72:513:215:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:public-school programs would mitigate any effects of private-school subsidies on private school revenue and enrollment.
9:288:26862:7:12:79:540:208:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:12Additionally, in May 2013, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced a bill to establish a federal tax credit that would be
9:289:26983:12:7:72:245:196:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:available to both individuals and corporations.
9:290:27030:7:12:79:540:189:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:13For example, Florida’s programs coincided with Jeb Bush’s election in 1998 after he narrowly lost his electoral bid in 1994,
9:291:27156:12:10:72:540:177:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:and the corporate tax credit in Arizona was made law by governor Janet Napolitano in a compromise with the state legislature
9:292:27280:10:9:72:540:167:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:during state budget negotiations after she had vetoed four such bills earlier (Welner, 2008). Tom Ridge signed Pennsylvania’s
9:293:27405:9:10:72:540:158:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:law after four failed attempts to get vouchers through the legislature (Averett and Wilkerson, 2001), although Adams (2002)
9:294:27528:10:9:72:86:148:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:refers the adoption of Pennsylvania’s credit as “quiet” and “little noticed.”14
9:295:27607:9:10:87:540:139:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:During his career, Blaine also served as Secretary of State, Speaker of the House, a Republican Presidential nominee, and
9:296:27728:10:9:72:86:129:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:a member of the Senate.15
9:297:27753:9:10:87:540:120:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:The wording of Blaine’s proposed amendment was, “No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or
9:298:27873:10:9:72:540:110:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived
9:299:28002:9:9:72:540:101:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor
9:300:28129:9:7:72:443:92:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.”
9:301:28228:7:0:79:469:85:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:16The three states are Louisiana, North Carolina, and, unexpectedly, James Blaine’s own state of Maine.
10:302:28332:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:yielded six separate decisions before the legality of the program was recognized (Huerta and d’Entremont,
10:303:28437:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2007). When Arizona enacted the first tax-credit school-subsidy program the legislature was in fact uncertain
10:304:28546:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the program’s legality (Werner, 2008), although the legality was ultimate affirmed in the State Supreme
10:305:28652:20:20:72:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Court ruling ofKotterman V. Killianin 1999. But state-constitutional clauses on religion have provided
10:306:28754:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:limitations on school subsidies, as discussed in chapter 5 in Werner (2008). In some states where it appears
10:307:28862:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that Blaine Amendment language may preclude subsidies, there have been attempts to alter the language of
10:308:28966:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the law.17Thus, the process for enacting subsidies can involve legislative and judicial deliberation, creating
10:309:29076:20:20:72:348:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:uncertainty on the timing of enactment within adopting states.
10:310:29138:20:20:86:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The decision of governments and courts to revisit legal provisions that have “slumbered in state con-
10:311:29239:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:stitutions for over a century” (Duncan, 2003) may in part coincide with other efforts to reform public
10:312:29341:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:education. This appears to be true in several of the states listed in Table 1. In particular, the establishment
10:313:29452:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of Florida’s McKay program coincided with an increase in public school funding for school construction
10:314:29554:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and maintenance, and Pennsylvania’s tax-credit program coincided with a program to support educational
10:315:29656:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:improvement organizations that provide innovative public school programs. However, if these coincidental
10:316:29760:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:laws made public schooling more attractive, they presumably workedagainstthe efficacy of laws intending
10:317:29863:20:20:72:309:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to facilitate student’s matriculation to private schools.
10:318:29920:20:20:86:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Another concern is simply one of reverse causation—growth in private school revenue may allow for
10:319:30017:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private schools to devote lobbying resources towards school subsidies, so increases in private school revenue
10:320:30126:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lead to greater school subsidies, not the other way around. Although such a coincidental timing pattern
10:321:30229:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:might be unlikely given the discussion above, we can address these concerns in the empirical part of the
10:322:30333:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:paper by including a number of controls for a state’s socioeconomic circumstances and the population of
10:323:30436:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school-aged children. Additionally, we discuss empirical tests of this concern below. Before turning to the
10:324:30543:20:44:72:350:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:empirical methodology, however, we next discuss the data used.

10:327:30721:20:20:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data we use come from the Core Financial Files produced by the National Center for Charitable Statistics
10:328:30825:20:20:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(NCCS). These files contain information collected from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 and Form
10:329:30928:20:20:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:990-EZ for 501(c)(3) public charities with at least $25,000 in receipts. Although these organizations are “non
10:330:31038:20:20:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:profit”, they must file tax returns containing detailed financial information. As mentioned in the last section,
10:331:31150:20:13:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:several states changed their laws in limited ways or very late in our sample (Ohio after 2003; Utah after 2005;
10:332:31261:13:12:79:540:84:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:17For example, in 2013 North Dakota considered a bill (HC3037) to alter the state’s constitution to make it easier to permit
10:333:31385:12:0:72:208:72:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:state support of sectarian education.
11:334:31423:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Georgia and Rhode Island after 2007; and Louisiana after 2008); we omit these state/year observations. The
11:335:31529:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:primary financial variable we use is program service revenue, which is revenue earned from activities that
11:336:31635:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:form the basis of an organization’s exemption from tax. Tuition charged by a private school is a canonical
11:337:31741:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:example, although some other revenue, such as from the sale of school supplies, would also be included in the
11:338:31850:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:figure we use. Using a figure that includes all program service revenue, rather than just tuition, is sensible
11:339:31960:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as schools may potentially attempt to obtain school-subsidy rents by raising both tuition and other student
11:340:32067:20:20:72:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:fees.18It also reflects true revenue, as opposed to estimating revenue based on “sticker” tuition prices.19
11:341:32174:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Our NCCS data use tax returns covering fiscal years from 1991 to 2009. We know of no other large-scale
11:342:32276:20:20:71:453:550:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:annual dataset that provides this type of financial information for US private schools.20
11:343:32365:20:20:86:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:This nonprofit tax-return data includes information for all nonprofits filing such returns, not just schools.
11:344:32474:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:To identify private schools in the tax return data, we match the tax return data to information in the Private
11:345:32584:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:School Universe Survey (PSS). Conducted biennially by the National Center for Education Statistics, the
11:346:32687:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:PSS is intended to be a census of private schools in the United States, but it does not include any financial
11:347:32796:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:information about schools. We match the two datasets using information on school name and address. As
11:348:32897:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:discussed in the appendix, school names and addresses are only available in the PSS beginning in 2005/06
11:349:33001:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:but are available for all years in the NCCS data. This allows us to match any school in the PSS from 2005
11:350:33106:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:onwards, and then “follow” that school back in time. However, this procedure will miss schools that existed
11:351:33213:20:20:71:501:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:during the period of our sample (e.g., the 1990s) and exited the sample before the 2005/2006 PSS.
11:352:33310:20:20:86:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:There are several steps we can take to address this fact. First, we explored the degree of “churn” in
11:353:33411:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our data to see if there is strong attrition as the sample goes back into the 1990s. Fortunately, this is not
11:354:33520:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the case, as over 70 percent of the observations in our matched sample can be followed back to 1995 and
11:355:33623:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:over half can be followed back to 1991. Next, we address this concern by identifying schools in the NCCS
11:356:33727:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:using additional information on charities’ tax returns. NCCS data include a charity’s National Taxonomy of
11:357:33833:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Exempt Entities (NTEE) Classification System code, which describes an organization’s primary purpose. We
11:358:33937:20:15:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:identify charities that classify themselves using codes B20 (elementary and secondary schools), B24 (primary
11:359:34045:15:12:79:540:216:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:18Other examples of program service revenue would include admissions fees charged by a museum, or conference registration
11:360:34166:12:7:72:293:204:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:fees charged by the ASSA for attending its annual meeting.
11:361:34224:7:12:79:540:197:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:19One may wonder how financial aid awarded by a school relates to reported program service revenue. There may be several
11:362:34344:12:9:72:540:185:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:ways that in practice private schools adjust program service revenue when awarding financial aid; it appears to us that reporting
11:363:34473:9:10:72:540:176:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:financial aid as reduced program service revenue is a much more common practice among schools than other possible alternatives.
11:364:34600:10:9:72:540:166:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:The vast majority of private schools (on the order of 95%) report providing financial aid. While the dataset in this paper does
11:365:34727:9:10:72:540:157:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:not provide information on expenditures comparable to the information available on revenue, we obtained a set of fuller 990
11:366:34850:10:9:72:540:147:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:forms for some of our sample via Morningstar, and in these cases positive grant expenditures are reported on Form 990 for
11:367:34971:9:10:72:540:138:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:only about 30% of school-years. If schools in our sample make financial aid available at the same rate as schools at large do,
11:368:35097:10:9:72:540:128:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:then most are reporting it as reduced program service revenue. In that case, decreases in aid in response to subsidies will be
11:369:35223:9:7:72:502:119:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:captured by as an increase in program service revenue (and revenue per student, all else equal) in the results below.
11:370:35340:7:12:79:540:112:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:20There are several concepts of “year” that are relevant here. As discussed in the appendix, the NCCS uses several notions
11:371:35462:12:10:72:540:100:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:of year when compiling the data; our use of the term reflects the fiscal year for which a charity files its tax return. The PSS
11:372:35589:10:9:72:540:90:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:timing is to October of a given year; we thus match NCCS and PSS data together based on the October in which the relevant
11:373:35710:9:9:72:540:81:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:fiscal year falls. Since most fiscal years are either calendar years or July-to-June fiscal years, this matching procedure should
11:374:35839:9:0:72:466:72:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:work well. We discuss a few additional issues with handling the timing of school subsidy laws more below.
12:375:35946:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and elementary schools), and B25 (secondary and high schools). The benefit of identifying schools in this
12:376:36051:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:way is that it avoids the bias towards schools that are open towards the end of the sample period.21Below,
12:377:36157:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we show results using the PSS matched schools and then present estimates where additional NCCS-identified
12:378:36262:20:20:72:523:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools are added. The estimates are quite similar, suggesting that our matching procedure works well.
12:379:36364:20:20:86:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The populations of schools in the PSS and NCCS datasets are potentially different; most notably, some
12:380:36465:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:religiously affiliated private schools—particularly Catholic Schools—are not required to file tax returns and
12:381:36574:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:almost never voluntarily do so.  Our sample essentially excludes Catholic schools.  Our matched sample
12:382:36676:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contains in an average year about 3,200 schools with about 800,000 students; or about one out of every nine
12:383:36783:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private schools and one out of every five private-school students in a typical year. Appendix Table 1 shows
12:384:36890:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our success rate in matching schools between the tax data and the PSS and shows that our sample consists
12:385:36994:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of schools that are larger and less likely to be religious than the average private school. However, the PSS
12:386:37102:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data contain information on religious affiliation, and about half of all schools in the sample report that they
12:387:37213:20:20:72:532:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are religiously affiliated. Appendix Table 2, and its accompanying text, gives a state-by-state breakdown.
12:388:37319:20:19:86:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Nonetheless, one might wonder how the results for our sample of schools might extend to other schools.
12:389:37421:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We will attempt to be careful in drawing strong conclusions for all schools from the results below. But we
12:390:37527:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:note that several of our results would be noteworthy even if they pertained to our sample alone. Further,
12:391:37632:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:there are several facts that give us optimism that our results might serve at least as a rough guide for the
12:392:37740:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:effects of subsidies on other schools. First, we can construct the ratio of students enrolled in schools filing a
12:393:37853:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:form 990 to all private-school students; if this ratio changes in response to the passage of a school subsidy, it
12:394:37966:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:might raise a concern that schools using subsidies concurrently decide to file. Estimating such a regression
12:395:38074:20:20:72:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:using the baseline specification below suggests that the fraction of filing schools doesnotchange when
12:396:38176:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies are introduced; the estimated impact of a subsidy on the fraction of students in filing schools is
12:397:38284:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:small, statistically insignificant, and produces a confidence interval ruling out a modest increase (or decrease)
12:398:38397:20:20:72:232:251:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:in the relative size of filing schools.22
12:399:38438:20:20:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Second, we can explore trends in teacher and enrollment populations in our sample and in the PSS overall;
12:400:38543:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:evidence of strongly divergent trends would also raise a concern about the generalizability of our sample.
12:401:38649:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 3 shows trends over time in average enrollment (Panel A) and in average number of teachers (Panel
12:402:38753:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:B). Clearly the schools in our sample are larger and have more teachers. But the two panels show that in
12:403:38857:19:15:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:both samples there is a slight decline in enrollment over the period of study and that the number of teachers
12:404:38966:15:13:79:540:137:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:21One might ask why we do not simply construct the sample using NTEE codes, dispensing with the PSS entirely. First,
12:405:39082:13:9:72:540:124:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:some schools may not be identified under these codes, as discussed in the appendix. Second, some schools identified in this
12:406:39205:9:9:72:540:115:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:fashion cannot be matched to PSS data, so we cannot calculate revenue-per-student (the tax return information does not give
12:407:39328:9:7:72:352:106:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the number of students in a school), which we use in some estimates below.
12:408:39402:7:12:79:540:99:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:22Using a specification matching column 5 of Table 6 below, where the dependent variable is the fraction of students in
12:409:39521:12:10:72:540:87:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:filing schools (mean of 0.199, standard deviation of 0.10), the coefficient on the School Subsidy Laws variable is 0.0044 and the
12:410:39650:10:0:72:440:77:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:state-clustered standard error is 0.0036, producing a 95% confidence interval from -0.0029 to 0.012.
13:411:39752:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is reasonably flat. The trends in these characteristics for schools in our sample seem reasonably comparable
13:412:39860:20:20:72:252:690:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:to the trends for all schools in the PSS.23
13:413:39903:20:20:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Third, for the year 2007, we obtained from Arizona school-by-school information on the amount of tax-
13:414:40004:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:credit-eligible scholarships claimed; using this information, we can explore whether the schools in our sample
13:415:40114:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:receive disproportionate amounts of subsidies. Evidence of this might affect the perceived generalizability of
13:416:40224:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our results. In this particular state and year, the schools in our sample received about 18% of all tax-credit
13:417:40334:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:scholarships. We have 60 AZ schools in our sample this year while the PSS lists 334, so that the fraction
13:418:40439:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of schools in our sample (60/334 = 0.1796) matches the fraction of school subsidy funds captured by our
13:419:40542:20:20:72:150:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sample quite well.
13:420:40560:20:20:86:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, while we do not have financial information in the PSS, we do have enrollment, and below we
13:421:40659:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:can compare the estimated effect of enrollment for our sample to the effect for all schools. The precision
13:422:40765:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the results (for both samples) can vary based on the construction of our standard errors, but fortunately
13:423:40873:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates are qualitatively similar and suggest that the change in enrollment seen in our sample reflects
13:424:40982:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the change in enrollment for other private schools. We can also use this enrollment-based comparison to
13:425:41085:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mediate our out-of-sample predictions for our financial results and below we do so. We will also use tuition
13:426:41193:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:information in the Schools and Staffing Survey to adjust these predictions; doing so suggests that our tax
13:427:41299:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sample has reasonable predictive content for other private schools. In sum then, our sample includes only a
13:428:41406:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of private schools and these schools differ in certain observable ways from the typical private school.
13:429:41518:20:20:72:497:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:But we are optimistic that the results below may be informative for other private schools as well.
13:430:41616:20:20:86:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:After constructing our tax-return sample, we then drop several types of observations. First, we drop
13:431:41716:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a small number observations with multiple matches between the PSS and NCCS. We also exclude a few
13:432:41813:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools that report being located in different states in different years, including any that fail to report a
13:433:41922:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:state in any year. We also drop tax returns for schools in outlying US territories, which we cannot match to
13:434:42030:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment records, since the PSS does not cover these territories. We exclude observations that report zero
13:435:42138:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or negative program service revenue or do not report program service revenue on their tax returns. Lastly,
13:436:42244:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and perhaps most notably, the NCCS guidelines themselves note that the tax return dataset sometimes lists
13:437:42349:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:very large revenue values; we drop observations where revenue per student figures are extremely high; over
13:438:42455:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:$100,000. This amounts to about 4 percent of the sample. It is possible that a legitimate private school has
13:439:42563:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per-student revenue of over $100,000 but we expect that most of these observations are erroneous, or may
13:440:42667:20:15:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reflect the returns of parent organizations, such as a hospital or university, that offer education or daycare
13:441:42777:15:12:79:540:117:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:23Since the tax sample is less likely to be religiously affiliated, one might wonder if there are divergent trends in the share of
13:442:42907:12:10:72:540:105:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the samples made up by religious schools. Appendix Figure 2 shows that from the mid 1990s on the two samples show similar
13:443:43028:10:9:72:540:95:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:trends (although again different levels) in the share of schools that are Catholic, religious-but-not-Catholic, or not religiously
13:444:43158:9:0:72:106:86:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:affiliated.
14:445:43171:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to children. Below we discuss estimates where this $100,000 cutoff is altered; the coefficients from samples
14:446:43279:20:45:72:424:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with different cutoffs are typically qualitatively similar to the baseline estimates.
14:447:43364:45:30:72:181:645:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.  Specification
14:448:43381:30:20:72:540:615:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This section describes the specification we use for our baseline estimates. We first aggregate our sample to
14:449:43489:20:37:72:228:595:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the state/year level.24We estimate:

14:451:43556:36:20:72:540:522:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where, for the baseline specification,ysyis total private-school revenue in statesin yearyin year 2012
14:452:43658:20:20:72:540:502:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dollars, index is an index for school subsidy laws (described below), X is a matrix of regressors, including
14:453:43766:20:20:72:540:482:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:controls for state median income, the state unemployment rate, the population density, the fraction of a
14:454:43870:20:20:72:540:462:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:state’s residents that are non-citizens, the fraction born abroad, the total population, the population of
14:455:43976:20:20:72:540:442:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:white children ages 6-17, and the population of nonwhite children ages 6-17. These variables are taken from
14:456:44083:20:20:72:540:422:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the Bureau of Labor Statics, the Census, and the American Community Survey; see the appendix for details.
14:457:44188:20:20:72:540:402:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The termθsrepresents a set of state dummies,θyrepresents a set of year dummies, andTsyrepresents a set
14:458:44290:20:20:72:540:382:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of state-specific time trends and their coefficients; both linear and quadratic trends will be used. The term
14:459:44399:20:19:72:122:362:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f3:B:εsyis noise.
14:460:44411:19:20:86:539:343:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The index used in the baseline specification simply equals the number of different types of school subsidy
14:461:44517:20:20:72:540:323:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:laws present in a state: restrictive individual income-tax credits, unrestricted individual credits, corporate
14:462:44627:20:20:72:540:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:income tax credits (all are restricted), or traditional vouchers (all are restricted). The index takes on values
14:463:44739:20:20:72:540:283:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:zero (no school subsidy), one (one school subsidy program) or two (two types of school subsidy program, true
14:464:44847:20:20:72:540:263:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in Florida after 2001, Arizona after 2006, and Iowa after 2006). However, estimates will also be presented
14:465:44953:20:20:72:332:243:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:allowing different types of program to have different effects.
14:466:45015:20:20:86:539:223:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:This specification will allow us to capture effects of subsidies both on intensive margins (existing schools
14:467:45123:20:20:72:540:203:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:realizing changed outcomes) and extensive margins (the number of schools in communities changing) that
14:468:45225:20:20:72:540:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would be missed by (e.g.) school-level regressions with school fixed effects. Also, the policy variation we
14:469:45332:20:20:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:focus on is at the state/year level. Further, this specification will motivate the additional results below based
14:470:45445:20:20:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on school-level regressions, regressions on the number of schools, and extensive-versus-intensive effects, and
14:471:45555:20:14:72:540:123:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this specification also facilitates our discussion of elasticities and welfare effects. But an obvious caveat to
14:472:45667:14:13:79:540:109:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:24As discussed in the appendix, the number of fiscal year 1998 NCCS returns is quite small, apparently because of a regulatory
14:473:45793:13:9:72:540:96:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:change in the dissemination of IRS 990 forms that year. After aggregating the data, we linearly impute revenue figures for fiscal
14:474:45922:9:0:72:110:87:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:year 1998.
15:475:45934:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this specification is that our programs vary by size, so that the coefficients must be interpreted with this
15:476:46042:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:variation in program size in mind. We also report results using logged outcome variables below; the use of
15:477:46148:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:logs helps to mitigate any effects of variety in program size. Fortunately, the results from logged regressions
15:478:46259:20:20:72:348:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are similar to the baseline results using the above specification.
15:479:46325:20:20:86:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In constructing the index, it can be unclear whether a law enacted in a certain year would first have
15:480:46426:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:an impact in the current school year or instead would impact subsequent school years. For our baseline
15:481:46528:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:regressions, we create our index based on the year a school subsidy program was enacted, but, to account for
15:482:46636:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the uncertainty in the timing of donations following enactment, include a dummy variable that equals unity
15:483:46742:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the year a state enacts a school-subsidy law (and zero all other years). There are a few exceptions to the
15:484:46848:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:basic rule of coding a law based on year of enactment. First, Iowa’s first law was enacted in 1987—before
15:485:46953:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our sample begins—but was expanded in 1996 and again in 1998. State administrative data show a large
15:486:47053:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the program after the 1998 reform; we consequently code Iowa’s index as going from zero to one
15:487:47159:20:20:72:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in 1998.25Next, Arizona’s individual credit was enacted in 1997, but donations were not eligible for a credit
15:488:47268:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:until 1998, and use of the program was limited until 1999 (Arizona Department of Revenue, 2008). We code
15:489:47372:19:20:72:193:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Arizona’s first year as 1998.
15:490:47401:20:20:86:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, while the McKay voucher program began in 1999, it was initially a pilot program; the program
15:491:47502:20:20:72:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:saw a rapid expansion in 2001.26We thus code both Florida programs beginning in 2001. Altering the
15:492:47600:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:timing of these laws to their earlier enactments, or simply dropping the year of enactment and the year
15:493:47703:20:20:71:507:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:following enactment from the regressions for all states, yields similar estimates to those shown here.
15:494:47805:20:20:86:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The specification above can be interpreted as a “difference-in-difference” style estimate. States adopting
15:495:47911:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school subsidy laws are allowed to differ from other states, and can even have different trends over time given
15:496:48022:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our trend controls. The specifications also account for changing economic and demographic trends across
15:497:48125:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:states and over time. However, the number of treatment states (five) is relatively small. As Conley and
15:498:48228:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Taber (2011) note, inference with difference-in-difference style estimates using a small number of treatment
15:499:48336:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:groups can be problematic, as estimates can be subject to a finite-sample-bias. They propose an inference
15:500:48441:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:technique to account for the small number of treatment groups in the estimation. In the results that follow,
15:501:48549:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we both report conventional state-clustered standard errors, as well as 95-percent confidence intervals, using
15:502:48659:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:an approach based off of Conley and Taber’s method. We discuss the method in the appendix but provide
15:503:48760:19:37:71:416:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a synopsis here. First, we estimate, using OLS on the full sample, the equation
15:504:48839:37:16:232:378:115:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f10:C:ysy=βXsy+θs+θy+ Tsy+εsy
15:505:48862:16:9:79:540:99:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:25Program expenditures tripled from 1997 to 1998, going from $3 million to $9 million (Iowa Department of Revenue, 2012).
15:506:48983:9:12:79:540:90:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:26Enrollment grew from 970 students in 00/01 to 5,013 in the 01/02 school year (Florida Office of Independent Education &
15:507:49104:12:0:72:159:78:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Parental Choice, 2006).
16:508:49129:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where the index coefficient has been removed, and create residuals  ̃εsy. We next assign the treatment states’
16:509:49239:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:index values to the control states, where the assignment is done at the state level (e.g., the index values
16:510:49346:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for all years in Arizona are assigned to Alabama). After the five true state-index profiles have randomly
16:511:49451:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:been assigned to five new states, we regress the new-states’ residuals  ̃εsyon the state-index profiles, state
16:512:49561:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and year dummies, and record the coefficient. We run 5,000 such regressions to estimate a distribution of
16:513:49666:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients that “should” be zero, but may be nonzero or non-symmetric due to finite sample bias. Using the
16:514:49774:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:null-hypothesis that the true coefficient value for the actual-law-change regression is zero, we can “invert”
16:515:49883:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this distribution to construct a 95-percent confidence interval that takes the finite sample bias into account.
16:516:49994:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The confidence intervals produced by this approach are often similar to those suggested by the standard
16:517:50097:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:errors. But, particularly when the number of treatment states in a specification is very small (e.g., three),
16:518:50206:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the Conley-Taber approach can produce much less precise results. This may partly reflect limited statistical
16:519:50314:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:power of their test–in Table 3 of their paper they report Monte Carlo results where, for a very small number
16:520:50422:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of law changes, the power of their test (the ability of their test to reject a null that is false) is poor, with a
16:521:50536:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:genuinely false null rejected (at the 5% level) only 30 percent of the time with two law changes. We explored
16:522:50645:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:several asymptotically equivalent ways of constructing Conley-Taber style confidence intervals and here we
16:523:50751:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:report theleastprecise; other Conley-Taber-based approaches (see the appendix) provided greater precision.
16:524:50857:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Fortunately, many of the key results below are similarly precise either using standard errors or the alternate
16:525:50967:20:20:71:176:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:CT confidence intervals.
16:526:50991:20:20:86:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 provides selected means for variables of interest.  The first row, total revenue, reflects total
16:527:51095:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program service revenue added up for all schools in a given state and year; the mean of this variable in
16:528:51199:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the first column of the table is the mean of aggregated total revenue, averaged over all states and years.
16:529:51305:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The typical observation in our sample thus records a little over $200 million in private school revenue. The
16:530:51413:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:means given in column 2 are for the 62 state/year combinations where school subsidies were greater than
16:531:51516:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:zero. Total revenue is somewhat smaller in observations with unrestricted programs, as shown in the last
16:532:51620:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:column. The second row, total enrollment, refers to total enrollment in our matched sample. The third
16:533:51721:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:row is unweighted revenue per student, suggesting per student revenue of about $10,000 across our sample.
16:534:51826:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The typical school has about 238 students, reflecting (as in Figure 3) that tax-sample schools are slightly
16:535:51933:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:larger than the average private school overall.  “Spending on School Subsidies” is constructed as before,
16:536:52038:19:20:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reflecting vouchers, individual credits and corporate credits. The final row is subsidies per “user” where user
16:537:52149:20:20:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is constructed as in Figure 2. As noted earlier, unrestricted programs are smaller than the average subsidy
16:538:52256:20:20:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program; Table 2 shows that they are about half the size of the average program. We will keep this in mind
16:539:52362:20:0:71:232:92:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:when discussing the estimates below.
17:540:52400:0:34:72:161:710:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.  Estimates
17:541:52413:34:26:72:208:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5A. Baseline Estimates
17:542:52435:26:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Before turning to regression estimates, Figure 4 shows the basic result by plotting out total revenue before
17:543:52543:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and after a state first imposes a school subsidy law. We calculate average private-school revenue in year
17:544:52648:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2012 dollars in our treatment states four years before a school law changed, three years before, and so on,
17:545:52755:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:up to four years after. Of course, in theory it is possible that the revenue effect will be zero. But the figure
17:546:52867:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:shows a clear and persistent jump in total revenue following the law change. Accounting for the pre-existing
17:547:52975:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:upward trend before the law change, the size of this jump appears to be about $30 million to $40 million in
17:548:53082:20:19:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:magnitude. We interpret a jump of this size below. It is also noteworthy that there is an absence of any clear
17:549:53192:19:20:72:528:511:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:jump up or down in the year prior to the laws’ enactment (although we can test for this more formally).
17:550:53295:20:20:86:539:491:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 shows baseline regression results. The dependent variable is total program service revenue, in
17:551:53397:20:20:72:540:471:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:$1000s, for all schools in a state/year. Coefficients for the school-policy index are shown in each column,
17:552:53504:20:20:72:540:451:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:below that is the state-clustered standard error and below that the 95% confidence interval as adapted
17:553:53606:20:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from Conley and Taber (2011). The first column shows that, when an additional school subsidy policy is
17:554:53708:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:introduced (increasing the index’s value by 1), total program service revenue in our sample increases by
17:555:53812:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:about $25 million. This is about 10 percent of average revenue (slightly more for all observations, slightly
17:556:53920:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:less for those with a subsidy) as shown in Table 2. Typical school-subsidy spending is about $60 million
17:557:54024:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:annually; the estimates indicate that–within our sample alone–this spending raises revenue substantially.
17:558:54129:20:20:72:404:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We take up the extension of these effects to all private schools momentarily.
17:559:54206:20:20:86:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The rest of the table explores this result under other specifications. Column 2 removes the right-hand-side
17:560:54313:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:controls, but this does not alter the estimates. In column 3, we include only the sample of states that currently
17:561:54426:20:20:72:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:have school-subsidy laws, that had them prior to our sample, or that adopted them after our sample ends.27
17:562:54532:20:19:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:If the policy changes we are studying are from a highly selected group, then this alteration of our control
17:563:54639:19:20:71:539:232:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:group could lead to different estimates. Fortunately, this is not the case, and comparing the states that
17:564:54744:20:20:71:539:212:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:made the policy changes we use here to those that adopted similar policies just a few years later does not
17:565:54850:20:20:71:539:192:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:change the estimates. The next column adds quadratic (rather than just linear) state-specific trends, but the
17:566:54959:20:20:71:539:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimate is not sensitive to this change.28Column 5 adds in schools identified using the NTEE Classification
17:567:55067:20:15:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:System code, rather than just crosswalking schools between the PSS and the NCCS datasets. This raises
17:568:55168:15:12:79:540:137:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:27At the suggestion of a referee, we also redid the baseline estimate using only states with court-blocked programs (mentioned
17:569:55294:12:10:72:540:125:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:in the text in Section 2) as a control. These estimates are often similar to the estimates here, but feature a much smaller sample
17:570:55424:10:9:72:86:115:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:and are (unsurprisingly) sometimes less precise.28
17:571:55474:9:10:87:540:106:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:It is possible to obtain results similar to ours without the use of time trends, but these results can be sensitive to changes
17:572:55600:10:9:72:540:96:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:in the specification and can be less precise. Typically, however, results based on variation closer to our law cutoffs (e.g., results
17:573:55733:9:10:72:540:87:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:without trends that limit the sample to years near the law changes, omitting the influence of secular trends in the data far
17:574:55857:10:0:72:358:77:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:before or after the law changes) produce results closer to the main estimates.
18:575:55937:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the number of individual school/year observations in the sample from about 61,000 to about 78,000. If the
18:576:56042:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimates change significantly here, it might raise concerns over the sample selection process of matching PSS
18:577:56152:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and NCCS data. In fact, in this case the result is somewhat larger in magnitude.29Overall, Table 3 indicates
18:578:56260:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that the average subsidy program raised revenue by about $30 million, a number roughly comparable to the
18:579:56364:20:20:72:175:630:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:jump shown Figure 4.30
18:580:56386:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix Table 3 presents an additional robustness check of this result; the first column in that appendix
18:581:56492:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:table repeats the baseline estimate in Table 1 but adds in five “lead” dummies that equal zero (e.g.) one
18:582:56597:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:year before a school-subsidy law is enacted and zero all other years. The table shows there is no evidence of
18:583:56706:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pre-existing trends in revenue, revenue per student, or total students in states that passed a school subsidy
18:584:56815:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:law, suggesting that the results here are not driven by reverse-causation or by some other unobservable driver
18:585:56925:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in these states. The last three columns add post-enactment lags as well. Looking at these coefficients, there
18:586:57034:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:does not appear to be a clear pattern (at least within the first few years) of program growth across outcomes,
18:587:57144:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:although the diminishing (in absolute value) post-lag coefficients for enrollment in the last column suggest
18:588:57252:20:19:72:323:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that enrollment effects may increase somewhat over time.
18:589:57308:19:20:86:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 4 presents an alternate test of this possibility. As mentioned above, the tax returns include NTEE
18:590:57412:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:codes which identify an organization’s primary purpose. In Table 4 we estimate regressions on total revenue
18:591:57519:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for a variety of nonprofits that we do not expect to respond to school subsidies.  As mentioned in the
18:592:57621:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:appendix, many schools in the PSS may not be designated as schools by the NTEE. Using our data matched
18:593:57723:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to the PSS, we counted the number of PSS schools within each NTEE code, and in Table 4 report results
18:594:57824:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for the six NTEE categories with few (less than 30, although alternate cutoffs give similar results) matches
18:595:57932:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the PSS. These regressions use the baseline estimations shown in column 1 of Table 3. Revenues are
18:596:58033:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:again in 1000s of 2012 dollars and as before groups with zero or negative revenues are excluded along with
18:597:58139:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:organizations with revenue above the 99th percentile in each code. Ifalltypes of nonprofit organizations,
18:598:58244:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:such as zoos and aquariums or voter registration groups, saw a surge in revenue that coincided with school
18:599:58350:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy laws, this would raise a concern that the increase we identify might be driven by some coincidental
18:600:58457:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:growth in nonprofits generally. But the findings in Table 4 indicate that this is not the case. The estimates
18:601:58566:20:20:72:393:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are all close to zero and, with the exception of public safety, insignificant.
18:602:58644:20:19:86:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 explores the effect of school subsidies across different types of program. In particular, we explore
18:603:58752:19:15:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whether programs that restrict what students may use the subsidies differ from unrestricted programs. Table
18:604:58859:15:13:79:540:137:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:29As mentioned earlier, using different revenue-per-student cutoffs provide similar estimates for the results in Table 3. For
18:605:58984:13:9:72:540:124:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:example, using the full sample regardless of per-student revenue yields a baseline estimate for total revenue of 43,779 [std err
18:606:59112:9:9:72:540:115:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:= 28,586]. In contrast, limiting the sample to schools that have less than $25,000 in revenue per student yields total revenue
18:607:59238:9:7:72:178:106:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:coefficient of 43,867 [17,456].
18:608:59269:7:12:79:540:99:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:30Redoing column 1 with logged revenue, the coefficient of interest becomes 0.083 [se = 0.38], suggesting an effect close to
18:609:59393:12:0:72:191:87:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the that in the levels regression.
19:610:59429:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:5 thus adds to the regressions in Table 3 an additional variable that is simply a dummy which equals unity
19:611:59535:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:if a state had an unrestricted subsidy program in effect. The first row of the table thus reflects the states
19:612:59644:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with corporate credit laws, along with one traditional voucher law (the McKay voucher in Florida). The
19:613:59746:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unrestricted dummy will indicate how unrestricted laws differ, and the sum of these two coefficients will
19:614:59851:20:20:72:398:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:show the absolute (rather than the relative) effect of the unrestricted laws.
19:615:59928:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The first column, which repeats the baseline regression in Table 3 with the new dummy variable added,
19:616:60029:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that the increase in school revenue is smaller for unrestricted programs than for restricted programs.
19:617:60140:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:However, as noted in Table 2, unrestricted programs are also typically smaller (about half of the size) in
19:618:60246:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:terms of dollars spent, and later specifications in Table 5 suggest that the impact of unrestricted programs
19:619:60354:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is about half the size of the other programs, indicating that the dollar-for-dollar impact of these programs
19:620:60462:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may be comparable. Further, while the standard errors on the unrestricted coefficients suggest a significant
19:621:60570:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:difference in several specifications, the confidence intervals are less precise. The imprecision may in part
19:622:60678:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reflect power problems for the CT method when the number of treatment groups is very small, as noted
19:623:60778:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:earlier. In any case, Table 5 suggests that the dollar-for-dollar effect of unrestricted subsidies may be similar
19:624:60891:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to or perhaps smaller than other school subsidy programs. As in Table 3, the results are qualitatively similar
19:625:61001:20:20:72:222:411:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:across a variety of specifications.31
19:626:61038:20:20:86:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Looking at revenue per student will allow us to see whether schools’ increased revenue is derived by
19:627:61138:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increasing enrollment, or by raising tuition & other fees, or both.32Table 6 presents results on the incidence
19:628:61248:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of school subsidies by exploring how subsidies affect per-student revenue, both for all schools in the sample
19:629:61357:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:combined and by type of law. Since these regressions, unlike those in Tables 3, 4, and 5, are per-student, they
19:630:61468:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are weighted by number of students. (Unweighted estimates are similar.) The baseline estimate is statistically
19:631:61578:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant. Its point estimate suggests that schools increase per-student revenue (e.g., by raising tuition)
19:632:61689:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by a little over $250 when a new school subsidy program is introduced. Perhaps the closest estimate to this
19:633:61796:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the literature is in Angrist, Bettinger, Bloom, King, and Kremer (2002), who find that winning a lottery
19:634:61903:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in Bogot ́a for a voucher worth $190 raised average private-school tuition and fees by $52, so that every dollar
19:635:62015:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of voucher funding raised tuition and fees by about 25 cents, close to what the point estimate here suggests.
19:636:62124:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We note, however, that their research design compares voucher-lottery winners and losers. This approach,
19:637:62228:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:while excellent for the focus of their paper, could miss market changes in response to vouchers affecting all
19:638:62337:19:15:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:students, so that comparability of the estimates is ex ante unclear. The estimate here should be interpreted
19:639:62445:15:13:79:540:137:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:31When using logged expenditures, the baseline index coefficient becomes 0.076 [0.37] and the unrestricted dummy becomes
19:640:62565:13:9:72:540:124:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:0.028 [0.136]. This suggests similar proportional effects between the types of programs (perhaps slightly larger for unrestricted)
19:641:62695:9:7:72:475:115:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:which would fit with the results in Table 5 given that the revenue bases for the two types of programs differ.
19:642:62805:7:12:79:540:108:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:32If schools price discriminate, than increases in actual tuition paid might occur even if the sticker price remains unchanged;
19:643:62932:12:9:72:540:96:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:this is an advantage of our measure. If schools respond to subsidies by cutting actual prices to some students, or increasing
19:644:63057:9:0:72:352:87:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:prices for others, our measure will capture the net effect of these behaviors.
20:645:63137:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as reflecting changes in price from several channels, including: schools price discriminating against voucher
20:646:63246:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:students, schools raising tuition and fees generally, marginal students entering the private market choosing
20:647:63354:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools with different prices than the average private-school student, and infra-marginal students choosing
20:648:63461:20:20:72:209:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:more expensive private schools.
20:649:63492:20:20:86:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The next column separates out unrestricted laws, and here the point estimates are different: the coefficient
20:650:63600:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that unrestricted laws see an increase in per-student revenue relative to other laws. While the CT
20:651:63707:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:confidence interval is large, the standard error for the unrestricted coefficient indicates the differential impact
20:652:63822:20:20:72:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of these laws is statistically significant.33Further, a Wald test of the hypothesis that the sum of the two
20:653:63929:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients is zero is rejected at the one percent level, suggesting that unrestricted laws raise prices absolutely
20:654:64045:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(and not just relatively). The implied increase in per student revenue in response to an unrestricted program
20:655:64154:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is over $1000 per student and reasonably close to our estimate of subsidy-funding-per-user noted at the end
20:656:64261:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the prior section. Thus we cannot reject the hypothesis that the incidence of the subsidy falls entirely
20:657:64368:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on families for the restricted laws, but wecanreject full incidence on families for unrestricted laws, where
20:658:64476:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates are compatible with schools capturing the entire subsidy. The data are compatible with the
20:659:64580:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incidence of subsidies falling entirely on schools for one type of law and entirely on families for another type
20:660:64692:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of law. The following columns consider similar robustness tests as before (the table omits results adding
20:661:64797:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:NCCS-identified schools to the sample as student counts are unavailable for these schools and the number
20:662:64901:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of students is now used in the dependent variable). In column 4, a Wald test again rejects that the sum of
20:663:65007:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the coefficients is zero and the combined coefficients, while slightly smaller than before, are still reasonably
20:664:65119:20:20:72:267:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:close to the overall subsidy-per-user average.
20:665:65165:20:20:86:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Together, Tables 5 and 6 suggest potentially similar dollar-for-dollar effects of subsidies on revenue across
20:666:65274:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:different programs but potentially different dollar-per-student effects, indicating that the laws have different
20:667:65386:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:effects on enrollment. Table 7 shows results with total enrollment in private schools in a state and year as
20:668:65494:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the dependent variable; these results confirm the findings in Tables 5 and 6. In column 2, the corporate
20:669:65598:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:credit programs and McKay voucher see an increase in student enrollment of about 2,000 students. The
20:670:65698:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:average statewide private school enrollment for observations with a restricted subsidy is a little over 20,000,
20:671:65809:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:so the coefficient indicates a reasonably large increase of about 10% in enrollment which is clearly statistically
20:672:65923:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:significant. This effect is smaller than the simulated prediction of a roughly one-third increase in enrollment
20:673:66034:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from a $1000 voucher in Ferreyra (2007), although her modeling of the voucher is different from here and she
20:674:66142:20:20:72:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:assumes full mobility of households.34Further, the results for the unrestricted laws are strikingly different;
20:675:66252:20:15:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates indicate that these laws saw zero enrollment growth and standard errors indicate that this
20:676:66356:15:12:79:540:97:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:33The logged revenue-per-student result is similar, with the index coefficient at 0.008 (se = 0.032) and the unrestricted dummy
20:677:66483:12:7:72:172:85:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:coefficient at 0.089 (0.038).
20:678:66512:7:0:79:244:78:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:34See the first row in Table 5A of her paper.
21:679:66559:0:20:72:456:710:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:difference is statistically significant.35Using quadratic trends produces similar results.36
21:680:66651:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The last two columns of Table 7 report estimates using total enrollment from the Private School Universe
21:681:66755:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Survey as the dependent variable. The sample size is smaller as the PSS is only biennial. The specification is
21:682:66865:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the same as in columns 1 and 2 except that the year-of-enactment dummy is also set to 1 for the year following
21:683:66975:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enactment. The coefficient on restricted programs is a little over 3 times as large in the PSS sample.37While
21:684:67084:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the standard errors are larger, the CT confidence intervals again suggest an increase for school subsidy laws.
21:685:67194:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The coefficients suggest that our tax sample may have slightly larger increases in enrollment than would
21:686:67298:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be the case if the sample were perfectly representative, although the precision of the estimates certainly
21:687:67404:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would allow for the tax sample to be representative. Moreover, the estimates in the last two columns are
21:688:67508:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:qualitatively similar to the results using the tax return data, with restricted subsidies increasing enrollment
21:689:67619:20:20:72:256:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:much more clearly than unrestricted ones.
21:690:67660:20:20:86:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, the above estimates suggest that school-subsidy laws have reasonably large effects on private
21:691:67765:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school revenue. However, we find evidence that the mechanisms by which revenue increases are different
21:692:67867:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:across types of laws; in particular we find that unrestricted laws lead to higher per-student revenue with
21:693:67973:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:little evidence of any change in student enrollment.  In the appendix (Figures 3, 4, and 5) we provide
21:694:68075:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:simple state-by-state graphical evidence of these results.  The figures show moving averages of revenue,
21:695:68179:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:revenue-per-student, and enrollment before and after a state first adopts a subsidy. The data show revenue
21:696:68285:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:jumps for all states (except perhaps Iowa); the jumps for restricted subsidies are more visually compelling
21:697:68392:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(although again their revenue bases and programs are on average relatively larger). Similarly, the unrestricted
21:698:68503:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:states see clear enrollment jumps, while the overall revenue-per-student results are (unsurprisingly) more
21:699:68609:20:20:72:479:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mixed. A simple visual inspection across the states fits well with the estimations shown here.
21:700:68703:20:20:86:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Why do the effects of these laws differ? There are a few possible explanations. First, it may be that
21:701:68804:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private schools enjoy a greater degree of market power for students they have already enrolled who then
21:702:68907:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:qualify for an unrestricted subsidy. Importantly, unrestricted laws allow families to target funding towards
21:703:69015:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:children already in private schools, including their own children, while other laws place restrictions on
21:704:69120:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:student eligibility based on income, disability, or a student’s prior enrollment. For the case of unrestricted
21:705:69230:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:laws, schools with relatively high market power can thus raise their tuition or other fees to capture the rent
21:706:69340:20:14:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:created by the subsidy. In contrast, the market may be more competitive for disabled students in public
21:707:69443:14:13:79:540:157:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:35The Tables 6 and 7 estimates are typically similar when including only schools with per-student revenue below $25,000 or
21:708:69565:13:9:72:540:144:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:when including all schools. The only notable difference is that, when using only schools with less than $25,000 per student
21:709:69688:9:10:72:540:135:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:revenue in the sample, both restricted and unrestricted subsidies lead to higher revenue-per-student, with the coefficient in
21:710:69813:10:9:72:540:125:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:column 1 in Table 6 becoming 0.65 [0.20]. But the results in the second column of Table 7, that there is a positive enrollment
21:711:69939:9:7:72:399:116:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:effect for restricted programs and no such effect for unrestricted, is found in all samples.
21:712:70031:7:12:79:540:109:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:36Again, estimates using logs are qualitatively similar; using logged enrollment here produces an index coefficient of 0.079
21:713:70155:12:7:72:274:97:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:(0.30) and an unrestricted coefficient of -0.092 (0.073).
21:714:70212:7:12:79:540:90:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:37While small, the unrestricted effect (the difference 5516 - 5477 in column 6 versus 1951 - 1944 in column 2) is a little over
21:715:70339:12:0:72:171:78:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:5 times larger for the PSS.
22:716:70368:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school or low income students in public school who subsequently become interested in attending private
22:717:70470:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school after qualifying for a restricted scholarship. If the marginal cost of adding one of these students is
22:718:70579:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:low, it is possible that schools may compete for these latter students by increasing enrollment with minimal
22:719:70687:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:changes in tuition or other student fees. A difference in market power could thus reconcile the estimates
22:720:70792:20:20:72:93:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:here.
22:721:70797:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A second, non-exclusive, explanation is based on information. If schools want to cream skim potential
22:722:70898:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:entrants, the nature of this skimming might vary between the different laws.  When restricted subsidies
22:723:71001:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are provided, e.g., via STO organizations, schools may partner with these organizations to identify and
22:724:71104:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:vet attractive students. With unrestricted subsidies provided via individual credits, this screening device is
22:725:71214:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unavailable. If schools are faced with an increase in demand following an unrestricted subsidies’ implementa-
22:726:71323:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tion, and if (for example) family income is positively related to the unobservable characteristics that schools
22:727:71434:20:37:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:want to select on, then schools may subsequently be able to raise tuition to improve their screening process.
22:728:71543:37:26:72:327:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5B. Intensive and Extensive Margin Effects
22:729:71585:26:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The above specifications use aggregate data from all schools to capture effects from existing schools realizing
22:730:71696:20:20:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:different outcomes along with the composition of schools changing over time. In Table 8, we examine the
22:731:71799:20:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:importance of these different channels. The first three columns of panel A limit the aggregated sample to
22:732:71904:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:“long term” schools that are observed in the tax data at least 15 years. We see that about half of the revenue
22:733:72014:20:20:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:growth found for all schools in Table 3 is realized by these long term schools, with about half or slightly
22:734:72121:20:20:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:less of all enrollment growth accruing to these schools. Thus these schools, which make up about half of the
22:735:72229:20:20:72:540:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sample, see roughly proportional-to-market-share revenue and enrollment increases. Subsidies thus increase
22:736:72335:20:20:72:540:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment and revenue from “long-standing” schools as well as relatively younger schools. Panel B shows
22:737:72439:20:20:72:365:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that, as expected, these effects are stronger for restricted subsidies.
22:738:72510:20:20:86:539:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The last three columns in each panel run school-level regressions including school fixed effects so that
22:739:72614:20:19:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these estimates will thus be identified from “intensive-margin” variation within schools over time. (Results
22:740:72722:19:20:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:without fixed effects, which would confound intensive-margin effects with other effects, are smaller and less
22:741:72831:20:20:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:precise). Column 4 in panel A suggests that revenue increases by about $59,000 for the typical school when
22:742:72937:20:20:72:540:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a subsidy is introduced. There are about 110 schools in the typical state/year with a subsidy, so the revenue
22:743:73046:20:20:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase from changes within schools over time is about $6.5 million (59×110 = 6,490). This is notably
22:744:73148:20:20:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:smaller than the amount seen in the baseline estimates of even column 1 of Table 8–the revenue growth
22:745:73249:20:20:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:B:realized by long-term schools alone is larger than that suggested by within-school revenue growth forall
22:746:73353:20:0:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools. We return to this observation momentarily. Before doing so, we note that in column 5 of panel B
23:747:73459:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the revenue-per-student effects for unrestricted programs are smaller and less significant than before. This
23:748:73567:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that at least some of the driver for the increases in revenue-per-student is that students choose to
23:749:73676:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:attend more expensive schools than before (rather than schools raising revenue per student while enrollment
23:750:73783:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is static as a static-enrollment story would lead to larger estimates in panel B). Looking lastly at enrollment,
23:751:73895:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the story is much the same as with revenue, with relatively small within-school estimates. This suggests that
23:752:74004:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:extensive margin effects–changes in the number of schools–play an important role in changing revenue and
23:753:74108:20:20:72:165:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment outcomes.
23:754:74128:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 9 considers this by estimating regressions on the number of schools in a state/year observation. The
23:755:74234:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:first two columns, using all schools, suggest about 10 new schools for restricted programs and no growth for
23:756:74342:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unrestricted. Table 2 indicates that the typical school in a subsidy state has about $2.5 million in revenue.
23:757:74451:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:If the marginal school driving the estimates in Table 9 has revenue close to the average, than revenue
23:758:74553:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:growth from the extensive margin would be about $25 million. Adding the $6.5 million intensive margin
23:759:74654:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:effect from the Table 8 estimates would produce revenue gains similar, and slightly larger, than the revenue
23:760:74762:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:effects estimated earlier (although the difference could be reconciled, for instance, if marginal schools had
23:761:74871:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lower-than-average revenue). The estimates thus suggest that revenue increases both from extensive margin
23:762:74976:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:changes (changes in the number of schools) and intensive margin (within-school) revenue growth, with the
23:763:75080:20:20:72:202:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:former being quite important.
23:764:75109:20:20:86:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Interestingly, the next two columns of Table 9 suggest that this is in part driven by survival of long term
23:765:75216:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools (rather than just younger schools). The number of long-term schools increases with subsidies. Again
23:766:75323:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:using a $2.5 million average revenue-per-school, and supposing that the aggregate $6.5 million within-school
23:767:75431:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimate from Table 8 applies to this sample of schools, the implied revenue effect on long term schools would
23:768:75541:20:20:72:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be 4×2.5 = $10 million on the extensive margin and $6.5 million on the intensive, for a total revenue effect
23:769:75649:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of about $16.5 million, which is close to the implied effect in the first column of Table 8 earlier. In other
23:770:75758:20:20:72:536:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:words, the discrepancy in revenue results in Table 8 can be resolved by appealing to the extensive margin.
23:771:75864:20:20:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Total school size can also be estimated for all schools in the PSS, not just those in the tax sample. The
23:772:75969:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:last two columns of Table 9 report results on the total number of schools each state/year in the PSS. As
23:773:76073:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mentioned earlier our sample consists of about 1/9thof all schools, so that one might expect PSS coefficients
23:774:76182:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:about nine times as large. The coefficients suggest an effect about seven times as large, although again the
23:775:76290:19:20:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:precision of the estimates (which as before varies across inference methods) would allow the tax sample to
23:776:76396:20:20:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be fully representative. In the next section, we use both the tax sample and the full PSS sample to make

24:803:77717:20:20:71:539:394:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:since our estimates earlier provide the total change in revenue-per-student for all students, our use of the

25:854:79730:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for dollar effects for all private schools using the above revenue formula and a variety of assumptions for
25:855:79837:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f3:B:δP. We focus on the effects of all schools since the dollar-for-dollar effects appear to be roughly comparable
25:856:79947:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:across types of programs. The first row shows the change in revenue using the above formula (with block
25:857:80050:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bootstrapped Conley-Taber-based 95% confidence intervals; their construction is described in the appendix),
25:858:80157:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the second row shows the assumed change in revenue per student, and the bottom two rows estimate the
25:859:80257:20:20:71:472:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity of supply and the effect on private school revenue for each dollar of funding spent.
25:860:80352:20:19:86:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The first column reports estimates under the assumption that price (that is, revenue per student) does
25:861:80454:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not change when subsidies are introduced; here any revenue increase comes from a quantity increase alone.
25:862:80559:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Column 2 assumes that the effect on per student revenue for all schools is half of the effect we estimate for
25:863:80668:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the tax sample. Column 3 assumes that the incidence of subsidies in our sample matches the incidence in
25:864:80771:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:all schools. Column 4 assumes that the incidence for other schools is twice the incidence in our sample, and
25:865:80879:20:20:71:283:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the last column assumes full incidence,δPδsub= 1.
25:866:80928:20:20:86:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Regardless of the assumption on how school subsidization affects revenue per student, we find that
25:867:81026:20:20:71:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies lead to large increases in revenue, withallestimates suggesting that funding raises revenue on
25:868:81130:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:close to a dollar-for-dollar basis or more. (Figure 5 shows how a greater-than-dollar-for-dollar effect is quite
25:869:81242:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:possible, as the rectangleABPDPScould easily be smaller than the area covered by the change in revenue.)
25:870:81346:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:A naive calculation of incidence could be made by simply multiplying our tax-sample revenue estimate 24,311
25:871:81453:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by 5, implying a dollar for dollar effect of 5×24,311/57,420 = 2.12; which is comparable to several of the
25:872:81559:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:numbers in the table. Overall, Table 10 suggests that subsidies have large impacts on school revenue for
25:873:81663:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:all private schools, and that the results from our tax sample provide a reasonable first-order guide for all
25:874:81771:20:37:71:512:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools even if the incidence of schools out of our sample diverges widely from what we observe here.

25:876:81920:26:20:71:539:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:One could also use our estimates to calculate the deadweight loss of school subsidy programs. As a very simple
25:877:82030:20:0:71:539:88:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:starting point, one could simply estimate a traditional “deadweight loss triangle” created by the subsidy,
26:878:82138:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where the base of the triangle would reflect the increase in student enrollment as a school subsidy program
26:879:82245:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is enacted, and the height of the triangle would be “per-student” spending on an average school subsidy
26:880:82348:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program. We could then divide the area of the triangle by the total spent on the average subsidy program,
26:881:82453:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:creating a “deadweight-loss-per-dollar spent estimate.”  (The calculation of the triangle is illustrated in
26:882:82560:20:20:72:115:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 5.)
26:883:82570:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Such a calculation of course involves several assumptions, including that the market structure would
26:884:82670:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:facilitate such a deadweight loss calculation and that our estimates can be extrapolated to private schools
26:885:82777:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not in the sample. The latter assumption is implicitly made here when we calculate the height of the triangle
26:886:82886:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as statewide subsidy spending over the statewide number of students assisted. (The revenue estimates in
26:887:82989:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Table 10 suggest that our results seem representative on some margins, and we can use our PSS enrollment
26:888:83093:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimates for this calculation.)  A more rigorous depiction of the market structure would have to take a
26:889:83197:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:strong stand on the objective function of private schools, which is beyond the scope of this paper. Here
26:890:83301:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we take all the laws together for our calculation, although one could consider differing effects. Our simple
26:891:83409:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:calculation also ignores any change in deadweight loss from any “spillover” benefits from greater private
26:892:83514:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:education. The calculation also is static and ignores dynamic effects of the laws. Further, the calculation
26:893:83621:20:20:72:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ignores any distortions in thepubliceducation sector and any changes to these distortions that subsidies
26:894:83725:20:20:71:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:create.38If subsidies lessen distortions stemming from the non-competitive public education sector, or
26:895:83827:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:improve educational outcomes generally in other ways, then the calculation here may be too pessimistic.
26:896:83930:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:These benefits of subsidies may also increase over time, so that dynamic considerations could again lead
26:897:84034:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:us to overstate deadweight loss here. On the other hand, if long-term enrollment gains from subsidies are
26:898:84139:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:larger than the estimates here (as households become more mobile over time), this will mechanically increase
26:899:84247:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimated deadweight loss (the triangle would get bigger), although even a much larger enrollment response
26:900:84353:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., twice as large as estimated here) would still lead to a relatively small deadweight loss calculation. Our
26:901:84465:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimate would also of course be larger by considering the distortionary effects of taxation (as taxes are raised
26:902:84578:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to pay for the subsidies), but, as noted below, the canonical estimates of this distortion are also relatively
26:903:84688:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:small. Given these caveats, we think presenting a deadweight loss estimate is worthwhile for motivating
26:904:84791:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:future work, for adding context to our estimates, and as a starting baseline, but we suggest the estimate be
26:905:84899:20:19:71:165:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:interpreted with care.
26:906:84921:19:20:86:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Using the PSS estimate which treats all laws the same in Table 7 to calculate deadweight loss in this way
26:907:85026:20:20:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:yields a deadweight loss per dollar spent of $0.03, with a 95% confidence interval (calculated using the delta
26:908:85136:20:16:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:method) of -0.04 to 0.11. We know of no similar calculation to put this into perspective, although we might
26:909:85243:16:12:79:540:96:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:38For a discussion of cross-market deadweight loss effects, as well as a discussion of deadweight loss calculation more generally,
26:910:85373:12:0:72:135:84:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:see Hines (1999).
27:911:85392:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:note that the canonical deadweight loss estimates of income taxation in Harberger (1964) for high-income
27:912:85496:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:families are similar. The fact that we estimate an (arguably) modest deadweight loss is not surprising, given
27:913:85605:20:20:72:301:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that the estimate on student enrollment is not large.
27:914:85658:20:20:86:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:One could also use the coefficients here to construct an estimated elasticity of demand for private school.
27:915:85765:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Such an elasticity might best be interpreted as applying to marginal students responding to a subsidy
27:916:85866:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program, and again will be based on the assumption that the relevant estimated price changes from our
27:917:85967:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sample can extend to the population of private schools.  For this estimate we can take the increase in
27:918:86069:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment from the PSS estimate in Table 7 for the change in quantity. The change in price is generated from
27:919:86178:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the baseline per-student-revenue estimate in Table 6 minus average per-student subsidy funding for states
27:920:86283:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with a school subsidy law. Dividing the change in quantity by the change in price, and then multiplying by
27:921:86389:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the ratio of average price over average enrollment yields an elasticity of -0.52, with a 95% confidence interval
27:922:86501:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of -1.1 to 0.07.39This is slightly larger in absolute value than the baseline elasticity of -0.19 in Dynarski,
27:923:86611:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Gruber, and Li (2009). However, as their elasticity might reflect the price responses of families with siblings
27:924:86722:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:already in private school, one might interpret our estimate as not surprising if families with siblings in private
27:925:86836:19:45:72:406:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school are less price sensitive than marginal families responding to subsidies.
27:926:86915:45:30:72:149:386:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:Conclusion
27:927:86925:30:20:72:540:356:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This paper investigates how private school subsidies impact private school finances.  Despite the current
27:928:87030:20:20:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:explosion of state-instituted subsidy programs, we know of no work that discusses the impacts of large
27:929:87132:20:20:72:540:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy programs on private schools, or that explores the incidence of school subsidies, or that calculates
27:930:87239:20:20:72:516:296:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities or traditional welfare effects in the context of large-scale school-choice-based subsidization.
27:931:87347:20:20:86:539:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We find that school subsidy programs raise school revenues, and that the effects are dollar for dollar
27:932:87449:20:20:72:540:256:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or larger.  There is evidence that different types of programs impact schools differently.  In particular,
27:933:87555:20:20:72:540:236:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unrestricted and restricted subsidies appear to increase revenue in different ways, with the latter raising
27:934:87662:20:20:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:revenue through increases in student enrollment while the former raise revenue through increases in per-pupil
27:935:87771:20:20:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expenditures.  As we note above, these results may suggest that schools view the market for students
27:936:87871:20:19:72:540:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:currently attending public schools as more competitive than is the market for students already enrolled in
27:937:87977:19:20:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private school. Alternately, these results might suggest that private schools cream skim students, and that
27:938:88084:20:20:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the STOs and other organizations involved in providing restricted subsidies allow schools to cream skim
27:939:88187:20:15:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:students in a way that other subsidy programs do not. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the
27:940:88292:15:12:79:540:102:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:39The elasticity estimate uses coefficients from two different regressions; we estimate them together using Seemingly Unrelated
27:941:88419:12:10:72:540:90:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Regression and use the resulting variance-covariance matrix for estimating the variance of the elasticity when applying the delta
27:942:88548:10:0:72:102:80:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:method.
28:943:88557:0:20:72:417:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:deadweight loss of school subsidies overall may be reasonably moderate in size.
28:944:88636:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:There are several caveats to our findings. First, as noted above, even in cases where our results suggest
28:945:88741:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:B:no change in enrollment in the face of school subsidization, this does not necessarily mean that thecompo-
28:946:88847:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f3:B:sitionof students stayed the same after subsidies were introduced. Even if total enrollment is unchanged it
28:947:88954:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:could be that school subsidies allow newly marginal students to “crowd out” other students who are either
28:948:89059:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:screened out, or unwilling to pay the higher tuition (or both) following the policy reform. For example,
28:949:89163:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidization may have led nontraditional (e.g., minority) students towards private education. Rinz (2015)
28:950:89269:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gives a rigorous investigation of this possibility, and considers how large voucher programs may have changed
28:951:89378:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:student/teacher ratios and other educational inputs for students of different races. Next, while our laws have
28:952:89488:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:commonalities with many very-recently-enacted laws, the overall impact of these new laws will only be known
28:953:89595:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with certainty in the future. Additionally, the simulation-based work noted in the introduction often assumes
28:954:89704:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fully mobile households; if household mobility is greater over a long period of time, then the findings here
28:955:89812:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may underestimate the long-term impacts of subsidies. Extending our results to more recent programs as
28:956:89914:20:0:72:369:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:they grow in the future represents an excellent area for future work.

33:1070:98567:20:20:86:539:585:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In 1997, Arizona offered a tax credit to individual taxpayers for donations made to STOs. The credit was
33:1071:98671:20:20:72:540:565:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:initially equal to the amount of the donation made and capped at $500. STOs are required to spend at least
33:1072:98777:20:20:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:90% of the money they receive on scholarships and may not limit scholarship recipients to only one school.
33:1073:98883:20:20:72:540:525:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Some details of Arizona’s credit have changed over time. Married and unmarried taxpayers were initially
33:1074:98986:20:20:72:540:505:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:eligible for the same $500 credit, but over time, the limit for married taxpayers has gradually increased to
33:1075:99094:20:20:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:$1,000. Since the program’s inception, donors have been prohibited from requiring that their gifts be used
33:1076:99200:20:19:72:540:465:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to fund a scholarship for any of their dependents. However, there is evidence that in fact many parents did
33:1077:99307:19:20:72:540:446:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ensure that their contributions resulted in scholarship support for their children, either by “suggesting” their
33:1078:99419:20:20:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:child as a recipient or by (e.g.) making a quid-pro-quo agreement with another family where each family
33:1079:99522:20:20:72:540:406:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would designate a gift towards the other family’s child (Reese, 2009; Bland, 2000).  In response to such
33:1080:99626:20:20:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:behavior Arizona later (after the period of this study) prohibited donors from designating their gifts for any
33:1081:99736:20:20:72:153:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:particular student.
33:1082:99755:20:20:86:539:346:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Through 2009, Arizona’s individual tax credit was claimed by an average of just over 55,000 taxpayers
33:1083:99856:20:20:72:540:326:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per year, with each donating an average of $700 to STOs (2012 dollars).  Over the same period, STOs
33:1084:99955:20:20:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:awarded an average of 19,000 scholarships annually, with the average scholarship being worth nearly $1,700
33:1085:100061:20:20:72:539:286:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(2012 dollars).40Neither the scholarships nor the tax credits that generate the funding that supports them
33:1086:100167:20:20:72:540:266:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are means tested, and individual scholarship award amounts are not limited by law. Some students may
33:1087:100267:20:20:72:540:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:receive scholarships from multiple STOs. STOs may use any criteria in awarding scholarships, but must
33:1088:100368:20:20:72:540:226:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consider financial need. Details of that consideration are not specified, however, and this seems to amount
33:1089:100475:20:20:72:540:206:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to a requirement to collect information on income from scholarship applicants. Scholarship applicants face
33:1090:100581:20:20:72:540:186:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:no eligibility requirements, and schools receiving scholarship students are required only to abide by a limited
33:1091:100692:20:19:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:set of non-discrimination rules. Schools with scholarship students are not prohibited from discriminating on
33:1092:100800:19:20:72:160:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the basis of religion.
33:1093:100822:20:20:86:539:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Arizona’s corporate tax credit, which was launched in 2006, is somewhat more restrictive on certain
33:1094:100921:20:15:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dimensions than its individual credit. Although there is no per taxpayer limit on the credit, there is an

34:1097:101200:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are awarded dollar-for-dollar to corporate taxpayers on a first-come, first-served basis until the aggregate
34:1098:101308:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:limit is reach. Over our period of study, the aggregate limit ranged from $10 million to $17 million annually
34:1099:101417:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(though the cap was not reached each year). Taxpayers may not designate their contributions for use by
34:1100:101519:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:particular students.  STOs must spend at least 90% of revenue they receive through the corporate tax
34:1101:101619:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:credit on scholarships for children with family incomes below 185% of the federal free or reduced price lunch
34:1102:101728:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program cutoff. In order to receive a scholarship, students must have been enrolled in a public school the
34:1103:101834:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:previous year, be just starting school, or have previously received a scholarship. Scholarships were capped
34:1104:101941:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at $4,200 - $4,500 for grades K-8 and $5,500 - $5,800 for grades 9-12 during our period of study. Very few
34:1105:102047:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:scholarships were awarded in the program’s first year, but from 2007-2009, Arizona’s corporate tax credit
34:1106:102152:20:20:72:484:510:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:financed over 2,800 scholarships per year worth an average of $2,500 annually (2012 dollars).41

34:1108:102254:20:20:86:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In 2001, Florida established a tax credit for corporate tax payers that made donations to organizations
34:1109:102357:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:similar to Arizona’s STOs. The credit is limited to 75 percent of a taxpayer’s liability, although taxpayers
34:1110:102465:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:can carry forward unused claims for up to three years. Credits are awarded dollar for dollar with donations,
34:1111:102573:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:excluding the amount by which donations may affect federal tax liability. As Table 1 shows, scholarships
34:1112:102677:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:awarded by STOs under this program are restricted to low income students. The maximum scholarship
34:1113:102774:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:awarded ranged from $3,500 in 2002 up to $3,950 in 2009. Over that period, donations funded scholarships
34:1114:102878:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for 18,000 students per year on average. STOs award new scholarships on a first-come, first-served basis;
34:1115:102983:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:priority is given to scholarships being renewed. STOs may not reserve scholarships for use at particular
34:1116:103087:20:20:72:508:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private schools or award scholarships to the children of owner/operators of STOs or private schools.
34:1117:103187:20:20:86:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:To be eligible to receive a scholarship, students must be eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches
34:1118:103294:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and have been enrolled in a public school the year before, have received a scholarship from an STO the year

34:1120:103510:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are also eligible for scholarships, as are students currently or recently placed in foster care. Scholarships may
34:1121:103623:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be renewed as long as the student’s family income remains below 230% of the federal poverty level (below
34:1122:103727:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:200% FPL before 2008). Between 200% and 230% FPL, the value of the scholarship is reduced. Students
34:1123:103826:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may not receive multiple scholarships. STOs may also award scholarships to cover the cost of transportation
34:1124:103933:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to a public school outside a student’s home district, but the share of students receiving this type of support
34:1125:104043:20:20:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is small (Hoxby and Murarka, 2007). Taxpayers may not designate specific children to benefit from their
34:1126:104146:20:20:72:172:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contributions to STOs.
34:1127:104168:20:15:86:539:92:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Florida’s corporate tax credit program was preceded by the establishment of the McKay Voucher program

35:1129:104334:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in 1999. This voucher program provides fairly generous voucher payments to students with disabilities (as
35:1130:104439:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:defined in Table 1). The maximum possible payment equals the lesser of (a) the amount the student would

35:1138:105285:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in 1999, participation in the program was quite limited in its first two years (the program in 1999 was in

35:1140:105492:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per year, with per student spending averaging nearly $7,300 (2012 dollars) over that period.42Although
35:1141:105594:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:students in the program have the option of attending a different public school, these figures pertain only to

37:1202:111022:20:20:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:files contain financial information collected from Internal Revenue Service Form 990 and Form 990-EZ for

37:1204:111237:19:20:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:such as Catholic schools, are not required to file Form 990 or Form 990-EZ and are not included in these

37:1206:111348:20:20:86:539:466:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:There are two notions of “year” to consider in the Core Files. The first is the fiscal year reported on a tax
37:1207:111457:20:20:71:539:446:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:return; this is the notion of a year that is most relevant for our study. The second is the “circa year,” which
37:1208:111568:20:20:71:539:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:refers to the year that a particular set of tax returns was assembled by the NCCS for inclusion in the Core
37:1209:111675:20:20:71:539:406:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data files. The NCCS creates its “circa year” data files at the beginning of each year by collecting financial
37:1210:111785:20:20:71:540:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:information from the most recent available tax return for each organization.49We combine these files for

37:1212:111996:20:20:72:540:346:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:collected. This may not be the same as the fiscal year since, when the NCCS collects its data and assembles
37:1213:112103:20:20:72:540:326:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a “circa year” dataset, the most recent available tax record for a nonprofit may not be from the most recent
37:1214:112211:20:20:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fiscal year, and an organization may thus have the same fiscal year record appear in multiple circa years.
37:1215:112317:20:20:72:540:286:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In these cases, we keep the record from the most recent circa year and drop older records of the duplicated
37:1216:112424:20:20:72:540:266:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fiscal year. We match the tax-return data to other datasets using the fiscal year reported on the tax return,
37:1217:112533:20:20:72:187:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rather than the circa year.
37:1218:112560:20:19:86:539:226:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Our primary financial variable of interest is “program service revenue.”  Reported in Part VIII, line

37:1220:112766:20:20:72:539:187:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by charging for the provision of its tax-exempt service.50Private school tuition is a canonical example of
37:1221:112872:20:15:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:program service revenue, but this variable could also include revenue derived from other sources, such as the

37:1223:113062:10:12:79:540:142:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:48Although the information on these forms is collected for tax compliance purposes, researchers have concluded that error
37:1224:113183:12:7:72:372:130:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:rates are suitably low for use in academic research. See Pollak and Pettit (1998).
37:1225:113265:7:12:79:540:123:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:49More specifically, a circa year file will include all the returns received by the IRS in a certain calendar year as well as returns

38:1243:114982:20:20:72:540:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data and the 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2009-10 rounds of the PSS, we match names and addresses to create
38:1244:115082:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a crosswalk between the two datasets that links an organization’s Employer Identification Number (EIN),

38:1251:115763:20:20:72:540:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:generates a small number of cases in which we match a single EIN to multiple PINs or vice versa.  We

38:1258:116409:20:20:71:539:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to attend preschool. This approach also does not identify any organizations that function as schools but are
38:1259:116517:20:15:71:539:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:identified using other codes. A Christian high school, for example might be identified by NTEE code X20,
38:1260:116621:15:12:79:540:113:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:51One could imagine cases in which one identifier or the other might change for legitimate reasons (e.g. a school could come
38:1261:116745:12:10:72:540:101:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:under new management, or it could reincorporate itself as a tax entity, leading a single PIN to match, appropriately, to multiple
38:1262:116874:10:9:72:540:91:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:EINs, or a single non-profit organization operates multiple schools, leading a single EIN to match to multiple PINs). However,
38:1263:117000:9:10:72:540:82:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the EIN in the NCCS data and the PIN in the PSS are generally intended to be permanent identifiers, so in most cases they
38:1264:117121:10:0:72:179:72:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:should not change over time.
39:1265:117151:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a code used for organizations related to Christianity, instead of B25. Similarly, a school for developmentally
39:1266:117261:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:disabled children might be classified using code P82 (developmentally disabled centers) rather than one of
39:1267:117367:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the codes we consider. Since organizations are only classified using one NTEE code, we are unable to identify
39:1268:117476:20:37:72:311:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:any schools that are not classified primarily as schools.

39:1270:117579:26:20:72:540:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The PSS and NCCS data are collected with very different goals, and so there are important differences
39:1271:117680:20:20:72:540:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between the types of schools found in each sample. The PSS is intended to include all schools that offer
39:1272:117784:20:20:72:540:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:classroom instruction in at least one grade from kindergarten through twelfth grade and are not supported
39:1273:117889:20:20:72:540:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by public money. There are no enrollment, revenue, or religious affiliation requirements for inclusion in the
39:1274:117998:20:20:72:482:507:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:PSS. Since charter schools are supported by public money, they are not covered by the PSS.52
39:1275:118090:20:20:86:539:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The NCCS data describe non-profit organizations generally and only incidentally include schools. More-
39:1276:118192:20:20:71:539:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:over, since filing requirements are designed to apply generally, broad categories of schools are likely to be
39:1277:118301:20:20:71:539:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:under-represented in the NCCS data. Most notably, many religious organizations are not required to pay
39:1278:118403:20:20:71:539:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:taxes, file tax returns, or even register with the IRS. Many religious organizations also operate private schools.
39:1279:118517:20:20:71:539:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Schools operated by religious organizations, therefore, are less likely to be included in the NCCS data than
39:1280:118625:20:20:71:539:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:they are to be included in the PSS, which surveys schools of all religious affiliations. The NCCS data may
39:1281:118731:20:20:71:539:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:also miss small schools with very low levels of revenue, since organizations with gross receipts under $25,000
39:1282:118841:20:20:71:539:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:during our analysis period were not required to file Form 990 or Form 990-EZ. The vast majority of schools
39:1283:118947:20:19:71:539:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are likely exceed this threshold, but a small, kindergarten-terminal school, for example, could conceivably
39:1284:119054:19:20:71:539:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fall below the revenue cutoff for inclusion in the NCCS data while still appearing in the PSS, since it offers
39:1285:119164:20:20:71:129:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:kindergarten.
39:1286:119177:20:20:86:539:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:These differences between the PSS and NCCS data also imply that the set of schools we are able to
39:1287:119274:20:20:71:539:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:match to a tax record will differ from the set of schools we are not able to match. Across all years, matched
39:1288:119383:20:20:71:539:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools have higher enrollment (both including and excluding preschool) and employ more teachers than
39:1289:119484:20:20:71:539:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unmatched schools. A substantially smaller share of matched schools are affiliated with the Catholic church,
39:1290:119592:20:20:71:539:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and a substantially larger share are nonsectarian. Matched schools have slightly lower rates of affiliation
39:1291:119699:20:20:71:539:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with religions other than Catholicism. Appendix Figure 2 plots the share of matched and unmatched schools
39:1292:119804:20:20:71:539:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that are religious (Catholic or not) or non religious. (Trends for total enrollment and total teachers are given
39:1293:119916:20:20:71:539:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in Figure 3 in the main text.) Although the levels differ, trends are similar across the two groups. These
39:1294:120022:20:20:71:539:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pictures look roughly the same if we produce them using all years of PSS data for schools in our crosswalk
39:1295:120128:20:14:71:362:88:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:instead of just those years in which we match them to tax records.
39:1296:120194:14:0:79:506:74:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:52Charter schools are included in the Common Core of Data, the survey of public schools conducted by the NCES.

40:1298:120407:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:samples.  As one would expect based on the procedure used to create our crosswalk, the crosswalk and
40:1299:120507:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matched samples include a larger share of total schools and total students in more recent years, with the
40:1300:120612:20:37:72:473:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matched sample including more than 20% of all students in 2005 and reaching 25% in 2009.

40:1302:120750:27:20:72:540:586:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Failures to match PSS records with tax data are generally due to the absence of a school’s return from
40:1303:120852:20:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the tax data or the limited nature of the information available for identifying matches. Tax returns may
40:1304:120956:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be unavailable for a variety of reasons. Although Catholic schools probably constitute the most significant
40:1305:121063:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:group generally exempt from the requirement to file Form 990 for religious reasons, other religious schools
40:1306:121170:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may qualify for the exemption as well. In each year of the PSS, at least two thirds (and up to 84%) of schools
40:1307:121280:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:report having a religious orientation or purpose, and at least half of those religious schools are non-Catholic.
40:1308:121392:20:20:72:540:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Religious exemption from the requirement to file Form 990 requires a school to be affiliated with a church or
40:1309:121501:20:20:72:540:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:religious order, so religiously oriented schools without such an affiliation can and do appear in our tax data,
40:1310:121612:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:but there is clearly substantial scope for schools not to appear in the tax data due to religious exemption
40:1311:121719:20:20:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from the filing requirement. A school’s return could also fail to appear in the tax data if it typically has
40:1312:121827:20:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gross receipts under $25,000, if it is operated by an organization that files taxes under a section of the
40:1313:121933:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Internal Revenue Code other than 501(c)(3), or if it is negligent in its responsibility to file, though taken
40:1314:122042:20:20:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:individually each of these are likely less important factors than the religious exemption. The limited nature
40:1315:122151:20:20:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the information available for identifying matches likely also leads to failures to match records from the
40:1316:122259:20:20:72:540:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:PSS to the tax data. Our matches are based on school names and addresses. At the time we matched these
40:1317:122361:20:20:72:540:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:records, school names were only available in the PSS in three years, and school addresses were available
40:1318:122465:20:20:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in only two.  Although we processed and checked the data thoroughly to identify matches, the inherent
40:1319:122566:20:20:72:540:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:variability in how different people write information like this on forms may have lead to some failures to
40:1320:122672:20:19:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:match. Even in some cases in which a school’s name and address are recorded correctly, we are unable to
40:1321:122775:19:20:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:match it to a tax record if the organization that operates it (and files its tax return) does not share its name
40:1322:122887:20:20:72:119:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or address.
40:1323:122898:20:20:86:539:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix Table 2 gives information on our matching success across states for different types of school.
40:1324:123001:20:20:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The first column is the average number of private schools observed in a round of the PSS in a state. The
40:1325:123105:20:20:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:next column, “crosswalked” observations, gives the average number of schools in a round of the PSS that we
40:1326:123211:20:20:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are able to match to the tax data in any year (i.e. the number of schools from our PSS-tax data crosswalk
40:1327:123316:20:0:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that appear in the PSS in an average year). The “cross walk %” column reports column 2 over column 1:
41:1328:123419:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the average percent of schools in a wave of the PSS that we observe in our tax data. Focusing on this percent
41:1329:123528:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:column, most match rates are around 20% to 25%; the worst is Wisconsin, and the best is Vermont. Our
41:1330:123628:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment states appear fairly close to other states, with Pennsylvania the lowest. Looking at the middle set
41:1331:123737:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of columns, our success in matching Catholic schools is (unsurprisingly) poor, with a success rate of 5 to 10
41:1332:123846:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:percent for most states. Again, the treatment states’ matching rates are not remarkably different, although
41:1333:123953:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Pennsylvania is again the least matched. The matching rate for other religious schools is higher, but still
41:1334:124060:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:somewhat small, with typically about the same match rate as for the overall sample. Among the treatment
41:1335:124163:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:states, Pennsylvania is lowest while Iowa is somewhat higher than most observations (a 36% matching rate
41:1336:124267:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:versus a 20-25% rate for most observations), but this notwithstanding, the overall collection of treatment
41:1337:124373:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:states is again similar to the controls in matching success. Lastly, for nonsectarian schools, the matching
41:1338:124480:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rate is somewhat higher, about 40%, while the treatment states are slightly lower than the average with
41:1339:124583:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:most having match rates around 30%. Overall, as expected we do a better job (but still far from perfect)
41:1340:124687:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matching nonsectarian schools than religious schools, and our treatment states have matching rates that
41:1341:124790:20:37:72:344:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:appear reasonably close to what is seen for the overall sample.

41:1343:124892:26:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The task of matching each school’s financial information to its enrollment information for the appropriate
41:1344:124998:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:year is complicated by the fact that many schools use fiscal years that differ from their academic years. The
41:1345:125107:20:20:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:PSS asks administrators to report enrollment at the beginning of October, and schools often require students
41:1346:125215:20:20:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to have paid tuition at the beginning of the school year. It is important, therefore, to make sure that the
41:1347:125322:20:20:72:477:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tax records we match to each enrollment record includes the beginning of the academic year.
41:1348:125413:20:20:86:539:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We address this issue by assigning an academic year to each NCCS observation based on the calendar
41:1349:125511:20:20:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:year in which the October of its fiscal year falls. For example, suppose we observe a tax record for a school
41:1350:125620:20:20:72:540:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with a July 1, 2003 – June 30, 2004 fiscal year. The October of this school’s fiscal year is in 2003, so we
41:1351:125727:20:19:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:assign this tax record to the 2003-04 academic year. If this school used a January 1, 2003 – December 31,
41:1352:125832:19:20:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2003 fiscal year, this tax record would still be assigned to the 2003-04 academic year, because its fiscal year
41:1353:125943:20:20:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contains October 2003. However, if the school instead used a November 1, 2003 – October 31, 2004 fiscal
41:1354:126046:20:20:72:376:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:year, this tax record would be assigned to the 2004-05 academic year.
41:1355:126115:20:20:86:539:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:For the schools in our data, the most commonly used fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30, with
41:1356:126217:20:20:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:over 60% of tax records in each circa year following this calendar. This means that financial and enrollment

42:1363:126805:26:20:72:540:606:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Our control variables come from a variety of sources.  We use median incomes reported by the Census

42:1365:127008:20:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:population densities, we obtain the land area of each state from the Census Bureau’s Statistical Abstracts of
42:1366:127117:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the United States, 2002 edition. Population and the fraction who are noncitizens, born abroad, and in various
42:1367:127226:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:age-race/ethnicity groups are calculated using data obtained from IPUMS for the 1990 and 2000 censuses,
42:1368:127329:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as well as the American Community Survey from 2001-2009.  We linearly interpolate to produce values
42:1369:127428:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the shares of residents who are noncitizens and born abroad for 1991-1999. For the age-race/ethnicity
42:1370:127532:20:20:72:540:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covariates, we produce values for 1991-1999 by assigning individuals in the 2000 census to the appropriate

42:1373:127772:26:20:72:540:383:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:For schools with matched financial and enrollment records, we construct a measure that approximates tuition
42:1374:127879:20:20:72:540:363:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by dividing total program service revenue by total enrollment. While we believe this to be the best available
42:1375:127988:20:20:72:540:343:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:method of estimating tuition, it does produce some figures that are implausibly large, reaching into the
42:1376:128092:20:20:72:540:323:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars. To some extent, seemingly high estimates of tuition arise
42:1377:128201:20:20:72:540:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from the fact that program service revenue includes income from both tuition and other sources, but this
42:1378:128305:20:19:72:540:283:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cannot explain tuition estimates of seven figures or more. High tuition estimates could also be a product of
42:1379:128413:19:20:72:540:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matches between a school’s enrollment record and the tax return of a parent organization that also receives
42:1380:128520:20:20:72:540:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:substantial revenue from other sources. For example, a university could operate a kindergarten-terminal
42:1381:128623:20:20:72:540:224:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:preschool for the children of its staff. If the enrollment record of that preschool matched to the university’s
42:1382:128734:20:20:72:540:204:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tax return, our measure of that preschool’s tuition could easily reach tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.
42:1383:128845:20:15:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, high tuition estimates could simply be a result of outliers in the data. The NCCS data documentation
42:1384:128954:15:12:79:540:169:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:53Beginning in June 1999, IRS regulations required all 501(c) organizations except private foundations to provide copies of
42:1385:129077:12:10:72:540:157:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:their tax forms to anyone who requested them. If this disclosure requirement caused some schools with fiscal years ending in
42:1386:129201:10:9:72:540:147:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:June 1999 (corresponding to the 1998-99 academic year) to file their tax returns late that year (that is, after NCCS collected its
42:1387:129331:9:10:72:540:138:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Core data at the beginning of 2000) before returning to filing on schedule in subsequent years (before the beginning of 2001),
42:1388:129457:10:9:72:540:128:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the NCCS data collection procedure could have missed these records. The most recent available tax record for these schools
42:1389:129579:9:10:72:540:119:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:at the beginning of 2000 would have corresponded to the 1997-98 academic year, and the most recent available record in 2001
42:1390:129702:10:9:72:540:109:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:would have corresponded to the 1999-2000 academic year, missing 1998-99. Since NCCS does not update a given circa year

42:1392:129949:9:0:72:145:91:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:late in this manner.
43:1393:129971:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:repeatedly notes (and suggest correcting for) the presence of outliers. We address excessively high tuition

43:1395:130176:20:20:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We apply several other restrictions to produce our school-level analysis sample. In both the tax data and
43:1396:130281:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the PSS, we exclude schools that report being located in different states in different years, including any
43:1397:130388:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that fail to report a state in any year. We also drop tax returns for schools in outlying US territories, which
43:1398:130499:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we cannot match to enrollment records, since the PSS does not cover these territories. Finally, we exclude
43:1399:130605:20:45:72:428:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schools that report zero or negative program service revenue on their tax returns.

44:1469:132577:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:five new states on the state-index profiles, state and year dummies, and record the coefficient. The inclusion
44:1470:132687:20:20:72:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the state and year dummies means the estimate is done on ̃djt, rather than the within-group difference of
44:1471:132795:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f3:B:d, although these should be asymptotically equivalent (see equation A2 and related discussion in Conley and
44:1472:132902:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Taber’s appendix). Our approach using ̃djtis conservative and produceslargerconfidence intervals than the
44:1473:133007:20:20:72:533:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:within-group-difference approach. We run 5,000 such regressions to estimate a distribution of coefficients.
44:1474:133114:20:20:86:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Using these 5,000 coefficients we can construct apvalue by calculating, if ˆα>0 (ˆα<0 ),p= 2×f,

44:1477:133424:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:percent confidence interval. We can subtract the 2.5 percentile value of this distribution from ˆαto generate
44:1478:133533:20:20:72:261:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the upper bound of the confidence interval.
44:1479:133576:20:20:86:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Our estimatorˆΓ(w) reflects the above representation ofˆΓ(w) except that, rather than estimate the full
44:1480:133679:20:19:72:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution ofˆΓ(w), we randomly assign the treatment variable and conduct 5,000 draws for each confidence
44:1481:133786:19:20:72:446:431:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:interval. We are thus drawing 5,000 values ofˆΓ(w) rather than the full distribution.55
