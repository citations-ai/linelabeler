2:35:1948:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:36:1956:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We re-examine the links between changes in housing wealth, financial wealth, and consumer spending.
2:37:2055:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We extend a panel of U.S. states observed quarterly during the seventeen-year period, 1982 through
2:38:2153:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1999, to the thirty-seven year period, 1975 through 2012Q2. Using techniques reported previously,
2:39:2250:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:we impute the aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial assets, and measures
2:40:2350:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of aggregate consumption for each of the geographic units over time. We estimate regression models
2:41:2448:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in levels, first differences and in error-correction form, relating per capita consumption to per capita
2:42:2552:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:income and wealth. We find a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon
2:43:2653:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:household consumption. This effect is consistently larger than the effect of stock market wealth upon
2:44:2754:14:28:72:137:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:consumption.
2:45:2766:28:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In our earlier version of this paper we found that households increase their spending when house prices
2:46:2869:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rise, but we found no significant decrease in consumption when house prices fall.  The results presented
2:47:2973:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:here with the extended data now show that declines in house prices stimulate large and significant
2:48:3071:14:28:72:232:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:decreases in household spending.
2:49:3103:28:14:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The elasticities implied by this work are large. An increase in real housing wealth comparable to the
2:50:3204:14:14:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rise between 2001 and 2005 would, over the four years, push up household spending by a total of about
2:51:3305:14:14:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.3%.  A decrease in real housing wealth comparable to the crash which took place between 2005
2:52:3399:14:42:72:291:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:and 2009 would lead to a drop of about 3.5%.

3:70:3718:0:26:90:168:685:144:Times:144:Times:I. Introduction 
3:71:3733:26:27:126:529:659:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  winter  of  2000-2001,  we  made  presentations  at  several  professional  
3:72:3818:27:28:90:525:632:144:Times:144:Times:meetings in which we sought to link household consumption expenditures to incomes and 
3:73:3904:28:28:90:525:604:144:Times:144:Times:wealth, by relying on aggregate panel data on U.S. states and fourteen different countries. 
3:74:3996:28:27:90:525:576:144:Times:144:Times:A formal paper was ultimately presented at the Summer Institute of the National Bureau 
3:75:4083:27:28:90:528:549:144:Times:144:Times:of  Economic  Research  (NBER)  in  July  of  2001,  and  it  was  circulated  as  an  NBER  
3:76:4176:28:27:90:247:521:144:Times:144:Times:working paper (#8606) that fall. 
3:77:4209:27:28:126:529:494:144:Times:144:Times:That  research  attempted  to  measure  average  consumption,  income,  housing  
3:78:4290:28:28:90:526:466:144:Times:144:Times:wealth,  and  stock  market  wealth  over  time  for  U.S.  states  and  foreign  countries.  The  
3:79:4389:28:27:90:527:438:144:Times:144:Times:statistical  relationship  between  consumption,  income  and  wealth  was  estimated  using  
3:80:4483:27:28:90:528:411:144:Times:144:Times:standard  multivariate  techniques,  and  we  interpreted  the  coefficients  of  the  wealth  
3:81:4578:28:27:90:529:383:144:Times:144:Times:variables  as  indicating  the  strength  of  the  association  between  these  two  kinds  of  
3:82:4674:27:28:90:318:356:144:Times:144:Times:household wealth and household consumption. 
3:83:4718:28:27:126:526:328:144:Times:144:Times:Our  statistical  results  suggested that there were significant  “wealth  effects”  upon  
3:84:4809:27:28:90:525:301:144:Times:144:Times:consumption  associated  with  both  types  of  wealth,  housing  wealth  and  financial  wealth,  
3:85:4908:28:28:90:526:273:144:Times:144:Times:but  that  the  stimulatory  effects  of  housing  wealth  substantially  exceeded  the  effects  of  
3:86:5010:28:27:90:526:245:144:Times:144:Times:financial  wealth.  This  result  persisted  for  a  variety  of  specifications  for  both  panels  of  
3:87:5115:27:28:90:166:218:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate data. 
3:88:5131:28:27:126:529:190:144:Times:144:Times:These   results   received   some   notice   in   the   popular   media,1 in some part, 
3:89:5219:27:28:89:525:163:144:Times:144:Times:presumably, reflecting concurrent trends in the macro economy. In due course, the paper, 
3:90:5308:28:14:89:529:135:144:Times:144:Times:“Comparing  Wealth  Effects:  The  Stock  Market  versus  the  Housing  Market,”  was

3:92:5448:7:16:90:525:114:42:Times:100:Times:1 This work was the subject of the “Economics Focus” column in the Economist (November 8, 2001) and 
3:93:5548:16:0:89:348:98:100:Times:100:Times:formed the basis for a subsequent cover story (March 30, 2002). 
4:94:5614:0:28:90:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:published,  in  Advances  in  Macroeconomics  in  2005.  Contemporaneously,  the  data  were  
4:95:5708:28:27:90:525:675:144:Times:144:Times:made available online, and they were used by John Muellbauer (2008) in his well-known 
4:96:5794:27:28:90:512:648:144:Times:144:Times:paper presented at the Federal Reserve Conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming in 2007. 
4:97:5878:28:27:126:527:620:144:Times:144:Times:When  our  paper  was  originally  presented,  it  relied  upon  the  most  recent  data  
4:98:5968:27:28:90:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:available.  The  paper  was  first  presented  in  January  2000,  and  it  relied  upon  data  from  
4:99:6070:28:28:90:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:1982  through  the  second  quarter  of  1999.  By  the  time  the  research  was  published,  five  
4:100:6171:28:27:89:525:537:144:Times:144:Times:years had elapsed, and by the time of the disastrous meltdown in mortgage markets, more 
4:101:6259:27:28:89:234:510:144:Times:144:Times:than seven years had elapsed. 
4:102:6289:28:27:125:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  update  the  empirical  analysis  using  data  through  
4:103:6384:27:28:89:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:2012,  and  thus  to  incorporate  the  past  decade  of  unusual  volatility  in  housing  wealth,  
4:104:6485:28:28:89:527:427:144:Times:144:Times:stock  market  wealth,  and  personal  consumption.  The  update  more  than  doubles  the  
4:105:6577:28:27:89:526:399:144:Times:144:Times:number  of  observations  from  under  3500  (68  quarters  and  51  states  including  D.C.)  to  
4:106:6676:27:28:89:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:over  7600  (150  quarters  and  51  states).    As  before,  we  present  a  variety  of  econometric  
4:107:6780:28:27:89:525:344:144:Times:144:Times:models linking consumption to income, housing wealth, and stock market wealth. As in 
4:108:6865:27:28:89:525:317:144:Times:144:Times:our previous analysis, we make no effort to “deduce” a structural model reflecting these 
4:109:6954:28:27:89:524:289:144:Times:144:Times:relationships, preferring again to observe the robustness of these relationships to plausible 
4:110:7048:27:28:90:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:specifications of the association.  An earlier version of this paper updates the research to 
4:111:7141:28:28:90:450:234:144:Times:144:Times:2009 and was distributed as NBER Working Paper 16848 in March, 2011. 
4:112:7210:28:27:126:527:206:144:Times:144:Times:In  attempting  to  update  our  previous  analysis,  it  was  immediately  apparent  that  
4:113:7302:27:28:90:527:179:144:Times:144:Times:comparable  data  from  the  panel  of  OECD  countries  previously  analyzed  could  not  be  
4:114:7397:28:27:90:521:151:144:Times:144:Times:obtained. Hence, this analysis is confined to quarterly data on U.S. states, 1975:1-2012:2. 
4:115:7489:27:28:125:529:124:144:Times:144:Times:The   principal   results   and   interpretations   in   our   previous   work   are   largely   
4:116:7586:28:0:89:526:96:144:Times:144:Times:unchanged,  but  the  estimated  magnitudes  are  larger  and  in  some  cases  more  important  
5:117:7685:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:statistically. When the more recent volatile period is included in the analysis, we find that 
5:118:7779:28:27:90:525:675:144:Times:144:Times:the relationship between housing market wealth and consumption is a good bit stronger, 
5:119:7866:27:28:90:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:relative  to  the  link  between  stock  market  wealth  and  consumption.  This  key  finding  is  
5:120:7966:28:27:90:525:620:144:Times:144:Times:robust  to  a  variety  of  reasonable  specifications.  One  set  of  previous  findings  does  not 
5:121:8066:27:28:90:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:seem to hold up. In our earlier work, we noted an asymmetry in the association between 
5:122:8153:28:28:90:529:565:144:Times:144:Times:housing  market  wealth  and  consumption.  When  housing  market  wealth  increased,  
5:123:8240:28:27:90:526:537:144:Times:144:Times:household consumption increased. But when housing market wealth declined, household 
5:124:8324:27:28:90:527:510:144:Times:144:Times:consumption  declined  only  marginally.  This  asymmetry  is  absent  or  reversed  in  the  
5:125:8418:28:27:90:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:longer panel.  The data now include substantially more variation in asset prices, notably 
5:126:8508:27:28:90:527:455:144:Times:144:Times:periods  of  declining  house  prices  and  declining  stock  market  indices,  and  show  that  
5:127:8605:28:28:90:427:427:144:Times:144:Times:declining house prices do lead to a lower level of consumer spending. 
5:128:8675:28:27:126:526:399:144:Times:144:Times:In Section II below we review the conceptual and measurement issues addressed 
5:129:8753:27:28:90:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  original  research  paper,  and  we  discuss  our  efforts  to  extend  the  time  series  for  
5:130:8858:28:27:90:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.  We  also  describe  recent  trends  in  housing  wealth,  stock  market  wealth,  and  
5:131:8956:27:28:90:210:317:144:Times:144:Times:household consumption. 
5:132:8979:28:27:126:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:Section III extends the econometric models which relate consumption to housing 
5:133:9058:27:28:90:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:wealth and stock market wealth. Section IV presents our conclusions briefly and reflects 
5:134:9147:28:46:90:194:234:144:Times:144:Times:on their significance. 
5:135:9170:46:25:90:278:188:144:Times:144:Times:II. Wealth Effects and Consumption 
5:136:9204:25:28:126:527:163:144:Times:144:Times:It  has  been  widely  observed  that  changes  in  the  values  of  financial  assets  are  
5:137:9297:28:28:90:525:135:144:Times:144:Times:associated  with  changes  in  national  consumption.  In  regression  models  relating  changes  
5:138:9395:28:0:90:526:107:144:Times:144:Times:in  log  consumption  to  changes  in  log  stock  market  wealth,  the  estimated  relationship  is  
6:139:9499:0:28:90:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:generally  positive  and  statistically  significant.  Under  a  standard  interpretation  of  these  
6:140:9601:28:27:90:522:675:144:Times:144:Times:results, from a suitably specified regression, the coefficient measures the “wealth effect” -
6:141:9694:27:28:90:474:648:144:Times:144:Times:- the causal effect of exogenous changes in wealth upon consumption behavior. 
6:142:9772:28:27:126:525:620:144:Times:144:Times:There is every reason to expect that changes in housing wealth exert effects upon 
6:143:9854:27:28:90:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:household behavior that are quite analogous to those found for financial wealth. Yet until 
6:144:9945:28:28:90:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:our  work  a  decade  ago,  there  was  virtually  no  comparative  research  on  this  issue.  As  is  
6:145:10049:28:27:90:526:537:144:Times:144:Times:evident  from  the  events  of  the  past  half  decade,  the  housing  wealth  effect  may  have  
6:146:10148:27:28:90:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:become especially important, as institutional innovations (for example, second mortgages 
6:147:10237:28:27:90:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:in the form of secured lines of credit, and option-ARM first-mortgage contracts) made it 
6:148:10326:27:28:90:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:as  simple  to  extract  cash  from  housing  equity  as  it  was  to  sell  shares  or  to  borrow  on  
6:149:10431:28:28:90:130:427:144:Times:144:Times:margin. 
6:150:10439:28:27:126:525:399:144:Times:144:Times:Our  previous  paper  summarizes  the  extensive  theoretical  and  empirical  rationale  
6:151:10529:27:28:90:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:for  wealth  effects,  and  we  do  not  repeat  this  summary  here.  However,  two  arguments  
6:152:10626:28:27:90:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:have  recurred  and  should  be  acknowledged.  The  first,  a  general  point,  was  made  by  
6:153:10722:27:28:90:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:Glaeser  in  his  comments  on  Case  (2000).  The  claim  is  essentially  that,  since  a  house  is  
6:154:10826:28:27:89:524:289:144:Times:144:Times:both an asset and a necessary part of outlays, when the value of a house increases there is 
6:155:10918:27:28:89:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:little or no welfare gain.2 Glaeser’s comments were in part motivated by a comment made 
6:156:11006:28:28:89:525:234:144:Times:144:Times:in a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (November 2, 1999) in which 
6:157:11089:28:16:89:525:206:144:Times:144:Times:he  stated  that  “The  permanent  increase  in  spending  out  of  housing  wealth  is  somewhat  
6:158:11188:16:7:234:237:190:100:Helvetica:100:Helvetica:                                                      
6:159:11241:7:16:90:525:183:42:Times:100:Times:2  Glaeser  reminds  us  of  the  result  from  elementary  price  theory  that  if  a  rational  individual  has  already  
6:160:11365:16:12:90:526:167:100:Times:100:Times:purchased  the  desired  housing  (so  that  the  endowment  point  equals  the  consumption  point)  then  price  
6:161:11480:12:11:90:524:155:100:Times:100:Times:changes in either direction are utility improving. (The household can always continue to consume the same 
6:162:11586:11:12:90:525:144:100:Times:100:Times:bundle that it did before the change, but the price change has opened up new opportunities.) But we cannot 
6:163:11693:12:11:90:525:132:100:Times:100:Times:infer, when comparing general equilibria, that any price change is unambiguously welfare improving -- not 
6:164:11799:11:12:90:525:121:100:Times:100:Times:without  understanding  the  exogenous  shocks  that  produced  the  change.    A  transcript  of  the  debate  can  be  
6:165:11920:12:11:90:525:109:100:Times:100:Times:found in the discussion following the paper by Karl Case (2000).  A fuller discussion of the complex issues 
6:166:12028:11:0:90:407:98:100:Times:100:Times:surrounding housing wealth effects can be found in our previous paper (2005). 
7:167:12108:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:higher, perhaps in the neighborhood of five percent.” A decade ago, Glaeser found these 
7:168:12196:28:27:90:360:675:144:Times:144:Times:remarks “inscrutable, unsupported and hard to accept.”  
7:169:12252:27:28:126:529:648:144:Times:144:Times:But  Glaeser’s  theory  is  belied  by  the   public’s   widespread   impression   that   
7:170:12342:28:27:90:528:620:144:Times:144:Times:increased  home  prices  make  them  very  much  better  off.  Part  of  the  reason  may  be  
7:171:12437:27:28:90:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:psychological, due to the salience of home price increases and myopic failure to consider 
7:172:12527:28:28:90:527:565:144:Times:144:Times:that  there  cannot  be  such  an  advantage  if  most  other  households  have  experienced  the  
7:173:12626:28:27:90:525:537:144:Times:144:Times:same price increases. This is exacerbated by the fact that homes are the collateral behind 
7:174:12717:27:28:90:176:510:144:Times:144:Times:mortgage loans.   
7:175:12735:28:27:126:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:A  second  way  to  approach  the  topic  of  consumer  spending  out  of  home  price  
7:176:12823:27:28:90:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:appreciation  is  to  simply  look  at  the  cash  flows.    Greenspan  and  Kennedy  (2007),  in  an  
7:177:12926:28:28:90:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:extensive  data  collection  exercise,  produced  careful  estimates  of  all  the  free  cash  and  
7:178:13027:28:27:90:522:399:144:Times:144:Times:credit  extracted  from  the  housing  stock  since  1990.  During  the  housing  boom  of  2001-
7:179:13124:27:28:90:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:2005,  an  average  of  just  under  $700  billion  of  equity  was  extracted  each  year by  home  
7:180:13224:28:27:89:363:344:144:Times:144:Times:equity loans, cash-out refinance, and second mortgages.  
7:181:13281:27:28:125:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:Table  1  reports  the  total  value  of  the  housing  stock  every  five  years  since  1980  
7:182:13377:28:27:89:525:289:144:Times:144:Times:according  to  the  Flow  of  Funds  Accounts  maintained  by  the  Federal  Reserve.    Between  
7:183:13475:27:28:89:524:262:144:Times:144:Times:2001 and 2005, the value of real estate directly owned by the household sector increased 
7:184:13564:28:28:89:525:234:144:Times:144:Times:by roughly $10 trillion, of which half was appreciation of land and half was the value of 
7:185:13654:28:27:90:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:new  structures  (see  Case  2006).    On  the  way  down,  real  estate  holdings  of  households  
7:186:13754:27:28:90:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:lost  over  $6  trillion.    Given  the  magnitude  of  these  flows  and  the  general  failure  at  the  
7:187:13861:28:27:90:525:151:144:Times:144:Times:time to recognize them as part of a credit bubble, it is hard to imagine that the buildup in 
7:188:13954:27:28:90:482:124:144:Times:144:Times:home equity when and where it occurred did not encourage aggregate spending.

8:214:14519:25:28:125:525:387:144:Times:144:Times:We use regional (state level) data to identify the wealth effect to exploit the fact 
8:215:14604:28:28:89:526:359:144:Times:144:Times:that  home  prices  have  evolved  very  differently  in  different  parts  of  the  country.  This  
8:216:14705:28:27:89:527:331:144:Times:144:Times:arises  largely  from  differences  in  the  elasticity  of  land  supply,  the  performance  of  
8:217:14803:27:28:89:390:304:144:Times:144:Times:regional economies, and the changing demographics of states. 
8:218:14864:28:27:125:525:276:144:Times:144:Times:The expanded data set described below adds information on the years 1975-1981 
8:219:14942:27:28:89:526:249:144:Times:144:Times:and  2000-2012.  These  periods  include  the  two  most  serious  recessions  since  the  Great  
8:220:15040:28:28:89:525:221:144:Times:144:Times:Depression. The time period also spans the longest expansion in U.S. history, 1991-2001. 
8:221:15129:28:27:89:525:193:144:Times:144:Times:In fact, as reported in Figure 1, between 1983 and 2000 there were only two quarters of 
8:222:15217:27:28:89:239:166:144:Times:144:Times:negative growth, both in 1990.

9:228:15336:28:27:90:525:312:144:Times:144:Times:housing market that had almost never experienced price declines, at least not since 1975. 
9:229:15426:27:28:90:525:285:144:Times:144:Times:The behavior of home prices since 1975 is chronicled in detail in Case (2008) and Case 
9:230:15513:28:27:89:390:257:144:Times:144:Times:and Quigley (2008, 2010). Here we review a few salient facts. 
9:231:15575:27:28:125:526:230:144:Times:144:Times:Figures  2  and  3  report  two  national  measures  of  house  prices.  The  S&P  Case  
9:232:15664:28:28:89:526:202:144:Times:144:Times:Shiller  composite-10  index  shows  only  a  minor  drop  during  the  recession  of  1990-91  
9:233:15760:28:27:90:525:174:144:Times:144:Times:while the FHFA index never declines at all between 1975 and 2007. Beginning in the late 
9:234:15848:27:28:89:526:147:144:Times:144:Times:1990s,  prices  begin  to  rise  at  an  increasing  rate.  House  price  increases,  fed  by  inertia,  
9:235:15953:28:27:90:527:119:144:Times:144:Times:easy  money  and  optimism,  accelerated  during  the  recession  of  2001  even  as  the  stock  
9:236:16051:27:0:90:528:92:144:Times:144:Times:market  was  in  decline.  The  recession  of  2001  followed  closely  on  the  heels  of  the

16:378:21037:34:26:90:207:340:144:Times:144:Times:A. Housing Wealth 
16:379:21054:26:27:126:528:314:144:Times:144:Times:Estimates  of  housing  market  wealth  were  constructed  from  repeat  sales  price  
16:380:21141:27:28:90:527:287:144:Times:144:Times:indexes  applied  to  the  base  values  reported  in  the  2000  Census  of  Population  and  
16:381:21236:28:27:89:527:259:144:Times:144:Times:Housing by  state.  Weighted  repeat  sales  (WRS)  indexes  (see  Case  and  Shiller,  1987,  
16:382:21331:27:28:90:525:232:144:Times:144:Times:1989) published by Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss are now available for this entire period for 
16:383:21421:28:28:90:138:204:144:Times:144:Times:all states. 
16:384:21433:28:28:126:518:176:144:Times:144:Times:Equation (1) indicates the construction of the panel on aggregate housing wealth: 
16:385:21515:28:29:126:336:148:144:Times:144:Times:(1)   VitRitNitIitVio           where,           
16:386:21565:29:28:126:464:119:144:Times:144:Times:Vit = aggregate value of owner occupied housing in state i in quarter t, 
16:387:21638:28:0:126:353:91:144:Times:144:Times:Rit = homeownership rate in state i in quarter t, 
17:388:21691:0:28:126:363:703:144:Times:144:Times:Nit = number of households in state i in quarter t, 
17:389:21743:28:27:126:416:675:144:Times:144:Times:Iit = weighted repeat sales price index, for state i in quarter t 
17:390:21808:27:28:162:259:648:144:Times:144:Times:(Ii1 = 1, for 2000:I), 
17:391:21831:28:27:126:397:620:144:Times:144:Times:Vio = mean home price for state i in the base year, 2000. 
17:392:21889:27:28:126:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:Our  previous  paper  describes  in  detail  the  construction  of  the  aggregate  housing  
17:393:21982:28:28:90:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:market wealth variable, using data from the Current Population Survey and the 1990 and 
17:394:22069:28:33:89:291:537:144:Times:144:Times:2000 Census of Population and Housing. 
17:395:22108:33:26:90:372:504:144:Times:144:Times:B. Retail Sales as a Proxy for Consumption Spending 
17:396:22159:26:28:126:530:478:144:Times:144:Times:Unfortunately,   there   are   no   direct   measures   of   consumption   spending   by   
17:397:22250:28:27:90:526:450:144:Times:144:Times:households  recorded  at  the  state  level.  However,  a  consistent  panel  of  retail  sales  has  
17:398:22352:27:28:90:526:423:144:Times:144:Times:been  constructed  by  Moody’s  Economy.com  (Formerly  Regional  Financial  Associates,  
17:399:22442:28:27:90:529:395:144:Times:144:Times:RFA.  See  Zandi,  1997).  Retail  sales  account  for  roughly  half  of  total  consumer  
17:400:22534:27:28:90:526:368:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures.  The  RFA  estimates  were  constructed  from  county  level  sales  tax  data,  the  
17:401:22634:28:27:90:525:340:144:Times:144:Times:Census  of  Retail  Trade  published  by  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  and  the  Census  Bureau’s  
17:402:22732:27:28:89:525:313:144:Times:144:Times:monthly  national  retail  sales  estimates.  For  states  with  no  retail  sales  tax  or  where  data  
17:403:22838:28:28:90:528:285:144:Times:144:Times:were  insufficient  to  support  imputations,  RFA  based  its  estimates  on  the  historical  
17:404:22934:28:27:90:526:257:144:Times:144:Times:relationship  between  retail  sales  and  retail  employment.  Data  on  retail  employment  by  
17:405:23032:27:28:90:525:230:144:Times:144:Times:state are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regression estimates relating sales 
17:406:23125:28:27:90:525:202:144:Times:144:Times:to  employment  were  benchmarked  to  the  Census  of  Retail  Trade,  available  at  five-year  
17:407:23223:27:28:90:462:175:144:Times:144:Times:intervals. Estimates for all states were within five percent of the benchmarks. 
17:408:23303:28:28:126:526:147:144:Times:144:Times:Retail  sales  can  be  expected  to  differ  systematically  from  consumption  spending  
17:409:23394:28:27:90:527:119:144:Times:144:Times:for  several  reasons.  Clearly,  in  states  with  relatively  large  tourist  industries,  recorded  
17:410:23497:27:0:90:526:92:144:Times:144:Times:retail sales per resident are high. Nevada, for example, with 26 percent of its labor force 
18:411:23592:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:employed in tourism, recorded the highest level of retail sales per capita though much of 
18:412:23682:28:27:90:144:675:144:Times:144:Times:the period. 
18:413:23694:27:28:126:530:648:144:Times:144:Times:To   the   extent   that   these   systematic   differences   between   retail   sales   and   
18:414:23789:28:27:90:529:620:144:Times:144:Times:consumption  are  state-specific,  they  can  be  accounted  for  directly  in  multivariate  
18:415:23883:27:28:90:524:593:144:Times:144:Times:statistical analysis. Data on retail sales, house values, and stock market valuation, by state 
18:416:23978:28:28:90:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:and quarter, were expressed per capita in real terms using the Current Population Survey 
18:417:24066:28:33:90:198:537:144:Times:144:Times:and the GDP deflator. 
18:418:24088:33:26:90:213:504:144:Times:144:Times:C. Financial Wealth 
18:419:24107:26:28:126:525:478:144:Times:144:Times:Estimates of aggregate financial wealth were obtained quarterly from the Federal 
18:420:24188:28:27:89:525:450:144:Times:144:Times:Reserve  Flow  of  Funds  (FOF)  accounts.  From  the  FOF  accounts,  we  computed  the  sum  
18:421:24283:27:28:89:526:423:144:Times:144:Times:of  corporate  equities,  pension  fund  reserves,  and  mutual  funds  held  by  the  household  
18:422:24381:28:27:90:125:395:144:Times:144:Times:sector. 
18:423:24389:27:28:126:524:368:144:Times:144:Times:To distribute household financial assets geographically, we exploit the correlation 
18:424:24473:28:27:90:525:340:144:Times:144:Times:between  holdings  of  mutual  funds  and  other  financial  assets.  We  obtained  mutual  fund  
18:425:24571:27:28:90:524:313:144:Times:144:Times:holdings by state from the Investment Company Institute (ICI). The ICI data are available 
18:426:24661:28:28:90:526:285:144:Times:144:Times:for  the  years  1986,  1987,  1989,  1991  and  1993.  In  this  paper,  we  added  data  on  years  
18:427:24763:28:27:90:525:257:144:Times:144:Times:2008 and 2009. For the years from 1993 to 2009, we interpolated the share of holdings in 
18:428:24852:27:28:90:525:230:144:Times:144:Times:each state, linearly, mapping the 1993 figures to the 2008 figures so that each summed to 
18:429:24942:28:27:90:528:202:144:Times:144:Times:one.  We  assumed  that  for  1978  through  1986:IV,  the  distribution  was  the  same  as  
18:430:25036:27:28:90:525:175:144:Times:144:Times:recorded in 1986 and that the weights for 2010, 11, and 12  were the same as they were in 
18:431:25126:28:28:90:120:147:144:Times:144:Times:2009. 
18:432:25132:28:27:126:525:119:144:Times:144:Times:We made considerable efforts to check these series against other data, as there are 
18:433:25216:27:0:90:528:92:144:Times:144:Times:few  alternative  sources.  The  Survey  of  Consumer  Finances  (SCF)  produces  regular  
19:434:25310:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:estimates  of  household  wealth,  including  stock  market  wealth,  from  a  stratified  random  
19:435:25409:28:27:90:525:675:144:Times:144:Times:sample of top wealth holders. Survey data are available for 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998 and 
19:436:25496:27:28:90:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:2001, and national aggregate data are published for those years. The staff at the Board of 
19:437:25587:28:27:90:529:620:144:Times:144:Times:Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  (Fed)  maintain  that  this  survey  information  is  
19:438:25679:27:28:90:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:insufficient  to  estimate  stock  market  wealth  at  the  level  of  individual  states.  However,  
19:439:25781:28:28:90:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:Andreas  Lehnert  of  the  Fed  arranged  for  special  tabulations  to  be  made  available  to  us,  
19:440:25884:28:27:90:525:537:144:Times:144:Times:aggregating micro data on stock market wealth to the level of census region for each year 
19:441:25974:27:28:90:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:of the SCF survey. These data can be compared to the ICI data available for 1986, 1987, 
19:442:26062:28:27:90:405:482:144:Times:144:Times:1989, 1991 and 1993, also aggregated to the nine census regions. 
19:443:26127:27:28:126:525:455:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  one  year  common  to  the  two  bodies  of  data,  1989,  the  simple  correlation  
19:444:26221:28:28:90:525:427:144:Times:144:Times:between  the  two  series  is  0.934;  the  correlations  are  also  quite  high  among  the  data  for  
19:445:26326:28:27:90:525:399:144:Times:144:Times:other years which do not match. The t-ratios associated with these correlations are large, 
19:446:26417:27:34:90:490:372:144:Times:144:Times:but of course, the sample sizes are small. (This is discussed in our previous paper.) 
19:447:26503:34:25:90:211:338:144:Times:144:Times:D. Personal Income 
19:448:26521:25:26:126:487:313:144:Times:144:Times:To control for income, we simply used the Bureau of Economic Analysis’  
19:449:26593:26:26:90:339:287:144:Times:144:Times:Personal Income (as reported by Moodys .com).      
19:450:26644:26:28:126:523:261:144:Times:144:Times:Figures 8 through 10 present the raw data for several states after conversion to per 
19:451:26729:28:27:90:514:233:144:Times:144:Times:capita terms and deflation using the CPI. The left-hand scale is income, housing wealth, 
19:452:26818:27:28:90:520:206:144:Times:144:Times:and financial wealth per capita in 1983 dollars. The right hand scale measures retail sales 
19:453:26910:28:0:90:168:178:144:Times:144:Times:in 1983 dollars.

21:506:27713:27:28:126:526:320:144:Times:144:Times:Tables  3  through  7  report  various  econometric  specifications  of  the  relationship  
21:507:27805:28:27:90:525:292:144:Times:144:Times:between income, wealth, and consumption for U.S. states. All specifications include fixed 
21:508:27895:27:28:90:525:265:144:Times:144:Times:effects  (i.e.,  a  set  of  dummy  variables  for  each  state).  These  models  formed  the  core  of  
21:509:28000:28:28:90:526:237:144:Times:144:Times:our  original  analysis.  Model  I  is  the  basic  specification  representing  the  effects  of  both  
21:510:28105:28:27:90:529:209:144:Times:144:Times:housing   and   stock   market   wealth   upon   consumption.   We   also   include   two   other   
21:511:28205:27:28:90:529:182:144:Times:144:Times:specifications,  to  explore  further  the  nature  of  estimated  wealth  effects  and  their  
21:512:28301:28:27:90:525:154:144:Times:144:Times:robustness. Model II for each specification also includes state-specific time trends. Model 
21:513:28393:27:28:90:509:127:144:Times:144:Times:III includes year-specific fixed effects as well as seasonal (i.e., quarterly) fixed effects.

22:543:28875:28:28:126:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:Note that, when interpreting the estimated coefficients for wealth in Model III, the 
22:544:28960:28:27:90:526:349:144:Times:144:Times:effects of an overall change in stock market wealth on consumption are controlled for in 
22:545:29049:27:28:90:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:the  regressions.  Thus,  in  Model  IIII  the  estimated  wealth  coefficients  reflect  only  
22:546:29145:28:27:90:329:294:144:Times:144:Times:interregional differences in the growth of wealth. 
22:547:29196:27:28:126:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 presents basic relationships between per capita consumption, income, and 
22:548:29277:28:28:90:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:the  two  measures  of  wealth.  As  the  table  indicates,  in  the  simplest  formulation,  the  
22:549:29376:28:27:90:525:211:144:Times:144:Times:estimated effect of housing market wealth on consumption is significant and large. In the 
22:550:29466:27:28:90:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:ordinary least squares regressions, the estimated elasticity is between 0.044 and 0.18. In 
22:551:29557:28:27:90:527:156:144:Times:144:Times:contrast,  the  estimated  effects  of  financial  wealth  upon  consumption  are  a  good  bit  
22:552:29654:27:28:89:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:smaller. In the simpler OLS model, the estimate ranges between 0.028 and 0.075. These 
22:553:29740:28:0:89:426:101:144:Times:144:Times:magnitudes are similar to the elasticities reported in our earlier paper. 
23:554:29817:0:28:126:528:703:144:Times:144:Times:When  the  model  is  extended  to  allow  for  first-order  serial  correlation,  the  
23:555:29905:28:27:89:525:675:144:Times:144:Times:estimated elasticities for income and for stock market wealth are generally smaller.3 But 
23:556:29995:27:28:89:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:the  estimated  elasticities  for  housing  market wealth are between 0.065 and 0.068, larger 
23:557:30089:28:27:89:497:620:144:Times:144:Times:than the same coefficient in our earlier work and much more significant statistically. 
23:558:30176:27:28:125:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:The table also reports the t-ratio for the hypothesis that the difference between the 
23:559:30262:28:28:89:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient  estimates  measuring  housing  and  financial  market  effects  is  zero.  A  formal  
23:560:30361:28:27:89:526:537:144:Times:144:Times:test  of  the  hypothesis  that  the  coefficient  on  housing  market  wealth  is  equal  to  that  of  
23:561:30466:27:28:89:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:stock market wealth (against the alternative hypothesis that the two coefficients differ) is 
23:562:30559:28:27:89:524:482:144:Times:144:Times:presented, as well as a test of the hypothesis that the coefficient on housing market wealth 
23:563:30652:27:28:89:525:455:144:Times:144:Times:exceeds  the  coefficient  on  financial  wealth.  The  evidence  suggests  that  housing  market  
23:564:30751:28:28:89:524:427:144:Times:144:Times:wealth has a more important effect on consumption than does financial wealth. This is the 
23:565:30841:28:27:89:528:399:144:Times:144:Times:same  qualitative  result  reported  and  discussed  in  our  earlier  work,  but  the  statistical  
23:566:30942:27:28:89:498:372:144:Times:144:Times:significance of the comparison is much larger with the richer panel of data on states. 
23:567:31029:28:27:125:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:Table  4  presents  results  with  all  variables  expressed  as  first  differences.  In  the  
23:568:31125:27:28:89:524:317:144:Times:144:Times:ordinary least squares formulation, the coefficient on housing market wealth is significant 
23:569:31217:28:27:89:527:289:144:Times:144:Times:in  all  specifications  and  is  two  to  three  times  as  large  as  the  coefficient  on  financial  
23:570:31322:27:28:89:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:wealth. Consumption changes are significantly dependent on changes in income and both 
23:571:31408:28:28:89:524:234:144:Times:144:Times:forms of wealth, housing wealth and stock market wealth. Table 4 also presents the same 
23:572:31496:28:27:89:522:206:144:Times:144:Times:first-difference equation when all three models are estimated using a simple instrumental-
23:573:31586:27:28:89:527:179:144:Times:144:Times:variables  approach,  relying  upon  lags  in  income  and  wealth  as  instruments  for  current  
23:574:31685:28:42:89:525:151:144:Times:144:Times:income and wealth. In these regressions, the elasticity of spending to changes in housing

23:576:31828:7:0:90:511:102:42:Times:100:Times:3 These models rely on sequential estimation using the Prais-Winsten estimator with independent panels. 
24:577:31935:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:wealth is estimated to be quite large (0.16).  Surprisingly the coefficient or stock market 
24:578:32027:28:281:89:225:675:144:Times:144:Times:wealth has a negative sign.4

24:580:32055:25:27:126:526:369:144:Times:144:Times:Table 5 presents the model in first differences including the lagged (log) ratio of 
24:581:32139:27:28:90:525:342:144:Times:144:Times:consumption to income. This is the error-correction model (ECM) often employed in the 
24:582:32225:28:27:90:530:314:144:Times:144:Times:presence   of   unit   roots.5   The   model   represents   a   co-integrated   relation   between   
24:583:32326:27:28:90:526:287:144:Times:144:Times:consumption and income, where income includes that derived from the stock market and 
24:584:32411:28:28:89:526:259:144:Times:144:Times:housing.  Note  that  the  lagged  ratio  of  consumption  to  income  has  a  coefficient  that  is  
24:585:32513:28:27:89:525:231:144:Times:144:Times:negative and significant in all regressions. Thus, transitory shocks, arising from changes 
24:586:32604:27:28:89:524:204:144:Times:144:Times:in other variables in the model or the error term in the regression, will have an immediate 
24:587:32696:28:27:89:526:176:144:Times:144:Times:effect  on  consumption  but  will  eventually  be  offset,  unless  the  shocks  are  ultimately  
24:588:32795:27:14:89:530:149:144:Times:144:Times:confirmed   by   income   changes.   Again,   the   results   support   the   highly   significant   
24:589:32896:14:7:234:237:135:100:Helvetica:100:Helvetica:                                                      
24:590:32949:7:13:90:442:128:42:Times:100:Times:4 This result persists when alternative lags are used as the instruments in the regression. 
24:591:33041:13:17:90:525:115:64:Times:100:Times:5  Note  that  our  previous  paper  investigated  a  variety  of  tests  for  unit  roots,  but  no  evidence  of  unit  roots  
24:592:33170:17:0:90:155:98:100:Times:100:Times:was uncovered. 
25:593:33188:0:28:90:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:immediate  effect  of  housing  market  wealth  upon  consumption;  the  effect  is  especially  
25:594:33285:28:418:90:285:675:144:Times:144:Times:large relative to that of financial wealth.

25:596:33329:25:27:126:528:232:144:Times:144:Times:In  Table  6,  we  introduce  a  lagged  stock  market  response  within  the  ECM  
25:597:33413:27:28:90:526:205:144:Times:144:Times:framework. There are certainly reasons to expect some time lags: household inattention, 
25:598:33501:28:27:90:525:177:144:Times:144:Times:evaluation of household finances only at periodic intervals (such as annual tax reporting 
25:599:33591:27:28:90:527:150:144:Times:144:Times:times),  adjustment  costs  to  changing  consumption,  and  habit  formation.  Some  of  these  
25:600:33688:28:28:90:525:122:144:Times:144:Times:reasons are confirmed by survey data on individual consumers’ decisions. Kennickell and 
25:601:33776:28:0:90:524:94:144:Times:144:Times:Starr-McCluer (1997) found that households have only imperfect knowledge of their own 
26:602:33865:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:financial wealth, and Buck and Pence (2008) report that a great many homeowners do not 
26:603:33952:28:27:90:529:675:144:Times:144:Times:know  the  basic  terms  of  their  mortgages.  Dynan  and  Maki  (2001)  have  presented  
26:604:34043:27:28:90:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:evidence using household data that the stock market wealth effect, to the extent that it is 
26:605:34135:28:27:90:530:620:144:Times:144:Times:measurable,   operates   as   a   lagged   adjustment   process.   We   amend   our   preferred   
26:606:34233:27:28:90:528:593:144:Times:144:Times:specification  to  add  a  lagged  term  in  the  regressions.  We  do  not  include  lags  on  
26:607:34329:28:28:90:524:565:144:Times:144:Times:household  housing  wealth,  given  the  strong  serial  correlation  of  home  price  changes.6

26:609:34528:27:28:89:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:variable,  are  qualitatively  similar  to  those  reported  in  Table  5.  The  estimated  effect  of  
26:610:34632:28:361:89:303:482:144:Times:144:Times:housing wealth is also quite similar (0.069).

26:613:34731:7:0:90:409:102:42:Times:100:Times:6 This is the same specification that is reported in Table 5 of our original paper. 
27:614:34818:0:28:126:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:In our earlier paper, we also investigated the importance of simple demographics 
27:615:34899:28:27:90:524:675:144:Times:144:Times:– the age distribution of the state populations – since theory implies that the wealth effect 
27:616:34993:27:28:90:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:should  be  different  at  different  phases  of  the  life  cycle.  We  relied  upon  estimates  of  the  
27:617:35100:28:27:90:525:620:144:Times:144:Times:age distribution produced annually by the CPS since 1982. We computed the fraction of 
27:618:35186:27:28:90:527:593:144:Times:144:Times:the  population  aged  sixty  or  above  by  state  and  year  and  interpolated  to  quarters.  We  
27:619:35287:28:28:90:527:565:144:Times:144:Times:added  interaction  terms  to  the  regressions  reported  in  Table  6,  in  an  effort  to  estimate  
27:620:35391:28:27:90:526:537:144:Times:144:Times:how  the  wealth  effect  is  affected  by  age.  The  estimated  age-interaction-effect  variables  
27:621:35492:27:28:90:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:were not statistically significant, and regressions extending these non-results are omitted

27:623:35590:27:28:126:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:Due to changes in savings and tax institutions, we anticipate that the importance 
27:624:35672:28:28:90:525:427:144:Times:144:Times:of the housing wealth effect may have changed over time. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 
27:625:35756:28:27:90:526:399:144:Times:144:Times:(TRA86)  greatly  advantaged  the  use  of  housing  equity  for  consumption  (by  eliminating  
27:626:35853:27:28:89:525:372:144:Times:144:Times:the tax deductibility of all other interest payments for consumer credit). Passage of the act 
27:627:35947:28:27:90:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:greatly  encouraged  financial  institutions  to  establish  lines  of  credit  secured  by  home  
27:628:36046:27:28:90:527:317:144:Times:144:Times:equity,  beginning  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1986.  Even  if  homeowners  did  not  plan  to  
27:629:36145:28:27:90:528:289:144:Times:144:Times:access  their  home  equity  for  consumption,  their  knowledge  of  the  possibility  may  
27:630:36238:27:28:90:528:262:144:Times:144:Times:diminish  the  precautionary  saving  motive,  a  motive  which  has  been  shown  to  be  an  
27:631:36333:28:28:90:499:234:144:Times:144:Times:important determinant of consumption expenditures (Kennickell and Lusardi, 2004). 
27:632:36415:28:27:126:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:Table  7  presents  variants  of  our  preferred  statistical  models,  the  first  differences  
27:633:36512:27:33:90:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:and  the  ECM  models,  for  the  panel  of  U.S.  states.  In  these  regressions,  we  distinguish  
27:634:36614:33:8:234:237:146:100:Helvetica:100:Helvetica:                                                      
27:635:36667:8:17:90:525:138:64:Times:100:Times:7 The state data do not exhibit enough variation in age distribution, even over this longer sample period, to 
27:636:36777:17:12:90:527:121:100:Times:100:Times:support  estimates  of  the  interaction  of  the  wealth  effect  with  age.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  
27:637:36895:12:11:90:525:109:100:Times:100:Times:Campbell and Cocco (2004), using data on individual households, did find evidence that the housing wealth 
27:638:37001:11:0:90:240:98:100:Times:100:Times:effect is higher for older households. 
28:639:37043:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:between the potential effects of housing wealth on consumption before and after the last 
28:640:37132:28:27:90:525:675:144:Times:144:Times:quarter of 1986. In each of the six specifications, the estimated effects of housing market 
28:641:37224:27:28:90:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:wealth upon consumption are substantially larger after the passage of TRA86. The point 
28:642:37311:28:27:90:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:estimates are substantially larger (elasticity of .118) after the change in the tax law, and 
28:643:37404:27:326:90:342:593:144:Times:144:Times:these differences are highly significant statistically.  
28:644:37461:326:25:534:537:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
28:645:37461:25:27:126:526:242:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, some evidence suggests that housing consumers may react differently to 
28:646:37541:27:28:90:526:215:144:Times:144:Times:perceived increases in housing values as compared to perceived declines in asset values. 
28:647:37630:28:27:90:529:187:144:Times:144:Times:Genesove  and  Mayer  (2001)  have  shown  that  home  sellers  behave  differently,  as  
28:648:37720:27:28:90:526:160:144:Times:144:Times:suggested  by  Kahneman  and  Tversky’s  prospect  theory,  in  reaction  to  declines  in  home  
28:649:37818:28:28:90:526:132:144:Times:144:Times:prices,  than  in  reaction  to  increases.  Apparently  the  painful  regret  due  to  loss  of  home  
28:650:37922:28:0:90:527:104:144:Times:144:Times:value  has  different  psychological  consequences  than  does  the  pleasant  elation  due  to  
29:651:38022:0:28:90:524:703:144:Times:144:Times:increase in home value, which frees up new opportunities to consume home equity. Table 
29:652:38109:28:27:90:530:675:144:Times:144:Times:8   provides   additional   evidence,   using   the   same   preferred   models.   (This   is   the   
29:653:38211:27:328:90:423:648:144:Times:144:Times:specification we reported in Appendix Table 3 of the original paper.) 
29:654:38281:328:25:529:532:320:144:Times:144:Times: 
29:655:38281:25:28:125:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:For  each  of  the  six  regressions,  the  results  indicate  that  increases  in  housing  
29:656:38374:28:27:89:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:market wealth have positive effects upon household consumption, but declines in housing 
29:657:38462:27:28:89:527:240:144:Times:144:Times:market  wealth  have  negative  and  somewhat  larger  effects  upon  consumption.  These  
29:658:38553:28:28:89:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:results were not found in our original analysis based on data through 1999.   The housing 
29:659:38643:28:27:89:525:184:144:Times:144:Times:wealth elasticity in a falling market is estimated to be about 0.10 and in a rising market 
29:660:38734:27:28:89:152:157:144:Times:144:Times:about 0.032. 
29:661:38747:28:27:125:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix  Table  1  compares  the  effects  upon  consumption  of  both increases  and  
29:662:38835:27:0:89:526:102:144:Times:144:Times:decreases  in  housing  market  and  stock  market  wealth  simultaneously.  In  each  of  the  six  
30:663:38939:0:28:90:528:703:144:Times:144:Times:models  reported  in  the  table,  the  effect  of  increases  in  housing  market  wealth  upon  
30:664:39037:28:27:90:525:675:144:Times:144:Times:consumption is positive and significant; the effect of decreases in housing market wealth 
30:665:39127:27:380:90:387:648:144:Times:144:Times:upon consumption is negative and is also significantly larger. 
30:666:39190:380:25:529:532:268:144:Times:144:Times: 
30:667:39190:25:28:125:525:243:144:Times:144:Times:The statistical models also report a relationship between increases in stock market 
30:668:39274:28:28:89:525:215:144:Times:144:Times:wealth and increases in consumption, and a larger relationship between decreases in stock 
30:669:39364:28:27:89:310:187:144:Times:144:Times:market wealth and decreases in consumption. 
30:670:39408:27:28:125:526:160:144:Times:144:Times:As  emphasized  in  our  original  paper,  there  is  always  room  for  skepticism  about  
30:671:39500:28:27:89:527:132:144:Times:144:Times:the  estimation  and  interpretation  of  simple  macroeconomic  structural  relations  such  as  
30:672:39598:27:0:89:527:105:144:Times:144:Times:those  presented  here.  (See,  for  example,  Cooley  and  Leroy,  1981,  or  Leamer,  1983.)  
31:673:39697:0:28:90:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:Underlying our analysis is an assumption that it is useful to think of causality as running 
31:674:39789:28:27:90:529:675:144:Times:144:Times:from  wealth  components  to  consumption,  and  not  that,  for  example,  the  two  are  
31:675:39880:27:28:90:528:648:144:Times:144:Times:determined  by  some  third  variable,  such  as  general  confidence  in  the  economy.  We  
31:676:39974:28:27:90:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:believe even more strongly that these new results demonstrate that it is useful to think of 
31:677:40066:27:28:90:529:593:144:Times:144:Times:consumption  as  determined  in  accordance  with  the  models  we  have  presented.  In  
31:678:40156:28:28:90:528:565:144:Times:144:Times:consulting  this  evidence,  recall  that  our  measure  of  housing  wealth  excludes  wealth  
31:679:40252:28:27:89:527:537:144:Times:144:Times:changes  due  to  changes  in  the  size  or  quality  of  homes,  changes  that  are  likely  to  be  
31:680:40355:27:28:89:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:correlated  with  consumption  changes  merely  because  housing  services  are  a  component  
31:681:40450:28:27:89:524:482:144:Times:144:Times:of consumption. We have alluded elsewhere to others’ evidence using data on individuals 
31:682:40538:27:28:89:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:that  the  reaction  of  consumption  to  stock  market  increases  is  stronger  for  stockholders  
31:683:40639:28:28:89:529:427:144:Times:144:Times:than   for   non-stockholders   (Mankiw   and   Zeldes,   1991),   and   that   the   reaction   of   
31:684:40741:28:27:89:525:399:144:Times:144:Times:consumption to housing price increases is stronger for homeowners than for renters. This 
31:685:40830:27:28:89:527:372:144:Times:144:Times:lends  additional  credibility  to  our  structural  models  when  compared  to  a  model  that  
31:686:40927:28:45:89:482:344:144:Times:144:Times:postulates that general confidence determines both consumption and asset prices. 
31:687:41008:45:26:89:164:299:144:Times:144:Times:V. Conclusion 
31:688:41021:26:28:125:528:273:144:Times:144:Times:The  importance  of  housing  market  wealth  and  financial  wealth  in  affecting  
31:689:41106:28:27:89:528:245:144:Times:144:Times:consumption  is  an  empirical  matter.  We  have  examined  this  wealth  effect  with  a  
31:690:41198:27:28:89:525:218:144:Times:144:Times:reasonably long panel of cross-sectional time-series data, one that is more comprehensive 
31:691:41288:28:27:89:492:190:144:Times:144:Times:than any applied before, and with a number of different econometric specifications. 
31:692:41372:27:28:125:526:163:144:Times:144:Times:The  numerical  results  vary  somewhat  with  different  econometric  specifications,  
31:693:41460:28:28:89:525:135:144:Times:144:Times:and  so  any  numerical  conclusion  must  be  tentative.  We  find  at  best  weak  evidence  of  a  
31:694:41562:28:0:89:527:107:144:Times:144:Times:link  between  stock  market  wealth  and  consumption.  In  contrast,  we  do  find  strong  
32:695:41659:0:28:90:530:703:144:Times:144:Times:evidence   that   variations   in   housing   market   wealth   have   important   effects   upon   
32:696:41759:28:27:90:528:675:144:Times:144:Times:consumption.  This  evidence  arises  consistently  using  thirty-one  year  panels  of  U.S.  
32:697:41854:27:28:90:426:648:144:Times:144:Times:states, and this finding is robust to differences in model specification. 
32:698:41928:28:27:126:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:As for the magnitude of the effects, consider a few of the most recent changes in 
32:699:42010:27:28:90:528:593:144:Times:144:Times:housing  wealth.  The  decline  in  housing  wealth  from  2005-2009  was  roughly  thirty  
32:700:42102:28:28:90:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:percent (somewhat more in real terms). Estimates of the elasticity of consumer spending 
32:701:42190:28:27:90:526:537:144:Times:144:Times:range  from  0.03  to  0.18,  but  those  that  are  estimated  with  separate  coefficients  for  up  
32:702:42293:27:28:90:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:markets  and  down  markets  are  consistently  about  0.10  in  down  markets.      That  figure  
32:703:42392:28:27:90:527:482:144:Times:144:Times:implies  that  a  decline  of  thirty-five  percent  in  housing  wealth  would  lower  consumer  
32:704:42490:27:28:90:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:spending  by  3.5  percent.  Consumption  is  about  $10  trillion,  and  that,  in  turn,  implies  a  
32:705:42594:28:28:90:525:427:144:Times:144:Times:decline in consumption of about $350 billion annually.  To put those figures into context, 
32:706:42685:28:27:89:526:399:144:Times:144:Times:consider  the  effects  of  the  decline  in  housing  production  from  2.3  million  units  to  600  
32:707:42788:27:28:89:524:372:144:Times:144:Times:thousand, at $150,000 each. This implies reduced spending on residential capital of about 
32:708:42878:28:27:89:525:344:144:Times:144:Times:$255  billion.  Either  has  a  large  impact  on  the  economy;  together  they  have  a  very  large  
32:709:42982:27:28:89:128:317:144:Times:144:Times:impact. 
32:710:42990:28:27:125:525:289:144:Times:144:Times:These  calculations  should  not  imply  a  false  precision  in  the  interpretation  of  our  
32:711:43086:27:28:89:527:262:144:Times:144:Times:econometric  models.  Nevertheless,  they  do  reinforce  our  conclusion  that  changes  in  
32:712:43180:28:28:89:527:234:144:Times:144:Times:housing  values  continue  to  exert  a  larger  and  more  important  impact  upon  household  
32:713:43276:28:0:89:348:206:144:Times:144:Times:consumption than do changes in stock market values.
