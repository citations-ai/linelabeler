2:29:1536:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:A:ABSTRACT
2:30:1544:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:Current practice largely follows restrictive approaches to market risk measurement, such as historical
2:31:1646:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:simulation or RiskMetrics. In contrast, we propose flexible methods that exploit recent developments
2:32:1746:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:in financial econometrics and are likely to produce more accurate risk assessments, treating both portfolio-level
2:33:1859:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:and asset-level analysis.  Asset-level analysis is particularly challenging because the demands of real-world
2:34:1968:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:risk management in financial institutions – in particular, real-time risk tracking in very high-dimensional
2:35:2075:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:situations – impose strict limits on model complexity.  Hence we stress powerful yet parsimonious
2:36:2172:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:models that are easily estimated.  In addition, we emphasize the need for deeper understanding of the
2:37:2273:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:links between market risk and  macroeconomic fundamentals, focusing primarily on links among equity
2:38:2372:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:return volatilities, real growth, and real growth volatilities.  Throughout, we strive not only to deepen
2:39:2477:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:our scientific understanding of market risk, but also cross-fertilize the academic and practitioner communities,
2:40:2589:14:42:72:502:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:promoting improved market risk measurement technologies that draw on the best of both.

5:115:6963:0:30:91:227:685:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
5:116:6978:30:18:91:519:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Financial risk management is a huge field with diverse and evolving components, as
5:117:7060:18:18:91:519:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidenced by both its historical development (e.g., Diebold (2012)) and current best
5:118:7144:18:18:91:519:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:practice (e.g., Stulz (2002)).  One such component – probablythekey component –
5:119:7223:18:18:91:519:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is riskmeasurement, in particular the measurement of financial asset return volatil-
5:120:7307:18:18:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ities and correlations (henceforth “volatilities”).  Crucially,  asset-return volatilities
5:121:7397:18:18:91:519:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are time-varying, with persistent dynamics.  This is true across assets, asset classes,
5:122:7484:18:18:91:519:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time periods,  and countries,  as vividly brought to the fore during numerous crisis
5:123:7568:18:18:91:519:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:events,  most  recently  and  prominently  the  2007-2008  financial  crisis  and  its  long-
5:124:7661:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lasting aftermath.  The field of financial econometrics devotes considerable attention
5:125:7747:18:18:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  time-varying  volatility  and  associated  tools  for  its  measurement,  modeling  and
5:126:7838:18:17:91:519:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecasting.  In this chapter we suggest practical applications of the new “volatility
5:127:7924:17:18:91:519:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:econometrics” to the measurement and management of market risk, stressing parsi-
5:128:8004:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:monious models that are easily estimated.  Our ultimate goal is to stimulate dialog
5:129:8087:18:18:91:519:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the academic and practitioner communities, advancing best-practice market
5:130:8168:18:39:91:518:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk measurement and management technologies by drawing upon the best of both.
5:131:8246:39:26:91:283:365:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1.1  Six Emergent Themes
5:132:8270:26:18:91:519:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Six key themes emerge, and we highlight them here.  We treat some of them directly
5:133:8352:18:18:91:519:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in explicitly-focused sections, while we treat others indirectly, touching upon them
5:134:8436:18:18:91:431:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in various places throughout the chapter, and from various angles.
5:135:8502:18:17:109:520:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first theme concerns aggregation level.  We consider both portfolio-level (ag-
5:136:8584:17:18:91:519:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gregated, “top-down”) and asset-level (disaggregated, “bottom-up”) modeling, em-
5:137:8664:18:18:91:519:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:phasizing the related distinction between risk measurement and risk management.
5:138:8743:18:18:91:519:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Risk measurement generally requires only a portfolio-level model, whereas risk man-
5:139:8826:18:18:91:287:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:agement requires an asset-level model.
5:140:8864:18:18:109:520:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  second  theme  concerns  the  frequency  of  data  observations.   We  consider
5:141:8948:18:18:91:519:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both low-frequency and high-frequency data, and the associated issue of parametric
5:142:9030:18:18:91:519:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vs.   nonparametric  volatility  measurement.   We  treat  all  cases,  but  we  emphasize
5:143:9120:18:0:91:519:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the appeal of volatility measurement using nonparametric methods used with high-
6:144:9201:0:18:91:449:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequency data, followed by modeling that is intentionally parametric.
6:145:9271:18:18:109:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  third  theme  concerns  modeling  and  monitoring  entire  time-varying  condi-
6:146:9355:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional densities rather than just conditional volatilities.  We argue that a full condi-
6:147:9443:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional density perspective is necessary for thorough risk assessment, and that best-
6:148:9527:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:practice risk management should move – and indeedismoving – in that direction.
6:149:9605:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We discuss methods for constructing, evaluating and combining full conditional den-
6:150:9688:18:18:91:160:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sity forecasts.
6:151:9703:18:18:109:520:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The fourth theme concerns dimensionality reduction in multivariate “vast data”
6:152:9781:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:environments, a crucial issue in asset-level analysis.  We devote considerable atten-
6:153:9866:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion to frameworks that facilitate tractable modeling of the very high-dimensional
6:154:9948:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covariance matrices of practical relevance.  Shrinkage methods and factor structure
6:155:10031:18:18:91:302:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(and their interface) feature prominently.
6:156:10073:18:18:109:520:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The fifth theme concerns the links between market risk and macroeconomic funda-
6:157:10152:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentals.  Recent work is starting to uncover the links between asset-market volatility
6:158:10238:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and macroeconomic fundamentals.  We discuss those links, focusing in particular on
6:159:10320:18:18:91:494:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:links among equity return volatilities, real growth, and real growth volatilities.
6:160:10402:18:18:109:520:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The sixth theme, the desirability of conditional as opposed to unconditional risk
6:161:10483:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measurement,  is so important that we dedicate the following subsection to an ex-
6:162:10564:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tended  discussion  of  the  topic.   We  argue  throughout  the  chapter  that,  for  most
6:163:10655:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial risk management purposes,  the conditional perspective is distinctly more
6:164:10738:18:39:91:303:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relevant for monitoring daily market risk.
6:165:10780:39:26:91:318:287:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1.2  Conditional Risk Measures
6:166:10810:26:18:91:519:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our  emphasis  on  conditional  risk  measurement  is  perhaps  surprising,  given  that
6:167:10898:18:18:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many popular approaches adopt an unconditional perspective.  However,  consider,
6:168:10978:18:38:91:453:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for example, the canonical Value-at-Risk (V aR) quantile risk measure,
6:169:11048:38:0:145:319:187:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:p=PrT(rT+1≤−V aRpT+1|T)  =

6:171:11086:27:0:335:350:176:8:g_d0_f9:8:g_d0_f9:?:−∞
6:172:11088:0:0:390:520:187:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:fT(rT+1)drT+1,(1)
7:173:11106:0:18:91:518:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:wherefT(rT+1)  denotes  the  density  of  future  returnsrT+1conditionalon  time-T
7:174:11188:18:18:91:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information.  As the formal definition makes clear,V aRis distinctly a conditional
7:175:11270:18:18:91:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measure.  Nonetheless, banks often rely onV aRfrom “historical simulation” (HS-
7:176:11349:18:18:91:520:631:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:V aR).  The HS-V aRsimply approximates theV aRas the 100pthpercentile or the
7:177:11425:18:18:91:520:613:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:Tpthorder statistic of a set ofThistorical pseudo portfolio returns constructed using
7:178:11510:18:18:91:354:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:historical asset prices but today’s portfolio weights.
7:179:11564:18:18:109:520:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Pritsker (2006) discusses several serious problems with historical simulation.  Per-
7:180:11648:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:haps  most  importantly,  it  does  not  properly  incorporate  conditionality,  effectively
7:181:11740:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:replacing the conditional return distribution in equation (1) with its unconditional
7:182:11824:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:counterpart.   This  deficiency  of  the  conventional  HS  approach  is  forcefully  high-
7:183:11915:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lighted by banks’ proprietary P/L as reported in Berkowitz and O’Brien (2002) and
7:184:11996:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  clustering  in  time  of  the  correspondingV aRviolations,  reflecting  a  failure  by
7:185:12088:18:18:91:520:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the banks to properly account for persistent changes in market volatility.1The only
7:186:12171:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:source of dynamics in HS-V aRis the evolving window used to construct historical
7:187:12251:17:18:91:441:434:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:pseudo portfolio returns, which is of minor consequence in practice.2
7:188:12320:18:18:109:520:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 1 directly illustrates this hidden danger of HS. We plot on the left axis
7:189:12400:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the cumulative daily loss (cumulative negative return) on an S&P500 portfolio, and
7:190:12482:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the right axis the 1% HS-V aRcalculated using a 500 day moving window, for a
7:191:12561:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample period encompassing the recent financial crisis (July 1, 2008 - December 31,
7:192:12644:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2009).  Notice that HS-V aRreacts only slowly to the dramatically increased risk in
7:193:12727:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  fall  of  2008.   Perhaps  even  more  strikingly,  HS-V aRreacts  very  slowly  to  the
7:194:12820:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decreased  risk  following  the  market  trough  in  March  2009,  remaining  at  its  peak
7:195:12911:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through  the  end  of  2009.   This  happens  because  the  early-sample  extreme  events
7:196:13000:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that caused the increase in HS-V aRremain in the late-sample 500-day estimation

7:198:13086:18:18:109:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More generally, the sluggishness of HS-V aRdynamics implies that traders who
7:199:13162:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:base  their  positions  on  HS  will  reduce  their  exposure  too  slowly  when  volatility
7:200:13254:18:17:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases, and then increase exposure too slowly when volatility subsequently begins

8:226:14040:18:18:109:520:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  sluggish  reaction  to  current  market  conditions  is  only  one  shortcoming  of
8:227:14128:18:18:91:520:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HS-V aR.  Another is the lack of a properly-defined conditional model, which implies
8:228:14212:18:18:91:520:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that it does not allow for the construction of a term structure ofV aR.  Calculating a

8:231:14458:18:18:91:519:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the square root of 10,  but this extrapolation is typically not valid unless daily
8:232:14543:18:18:91:407:250:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:returns are iid and normally distributed, which they are not.3

8:235:14768:18:18:91:520:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model and then calculate the nominal 1% HS-V aRon these returns using a moving

9:253:15656:18:18:91:520:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:true daily coverage of the nominal 1% HS-V aRcan be calculated using the return
9:254:15735:18:18:91:519:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generating  model.   Figure  2  shows  the  conditional  coverage  probability  of  the  1%

9:256:15905:18:18:91:519:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of 1% can have a true conditional probability as high as 10%, even though
9:257:15990:18:18:91:519:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the unconditional coverage is correctly calibrated at 1%.  On any given day the risk
9:258:16074:18:18:91:519:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:manager thinks that there is a 1% chance of getting a return worse than the HS-V aR,
9:259:16158:18:17:91:520:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but in actuality there may as much as a 10% chance of exceeding theV aR.  Figure 2
9:260:16240:17:18:91:519:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highlights the potential benefit of conditional density modeling:  The HS-V aRmay

9:262:16408:18:18:91:519:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at any given time (i.e., conditionally).  A conditional density model will generate a
9:263:16493:18:18:91:520:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamicV aRthat  attempts  to  keep  the  conditional  coverage  rate  at  1%  on  any
9:264:16579:18:18:91:142:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given day.
9:265:16589:18:18:109:520:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The above discussion also hints at a problem with theV aRrisk measure itself.
9:266:16666:18:18:91:519:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It does not say anything about how large the expected loss will be on days when
9:267:16745:18:0:91:519:166:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:V aRis exceeded.  Other risk measures, such as Expected Shortfall (ES), attempt to
10:268:16828:0:35:91:282:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remedy that defect.  We defineESas

10:273:16894:35:18:91:520:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because it integrates over the left tail,ESis sensitive to the shape of theentireleft

10:275:17063:18:18:91:519:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate, the magnitude of the loss across all relevant scenarios matters.  Thus, even if
10:276:17148:18:18:91:520:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theV aRmight be correctly calibrated at, say, the 5% level, this does not ensure that
10:277:17233:18:18:91:519:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 5% ES is also correct.  Conversely, even if the 5%ESis estimated with precision,
10:278:17317:18:18:91:520:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this  does  not  imply  that  the  5%V aRis  valid.   Only  if  the  return  distribution  is
10:279:17410:18:18:91:519:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characterized appropriately throughout the entire tail region can we guarantee that
10:280:17493:18:18:91:377:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the different risk measures all provide accurate answers.
10:281:17550:18:17:109:519:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our main point of critique still applies, however. Any risk measure, whetherV aR,
10:282:17631:17:18:91:520:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:ES,  or  anything  else,  that  neglects  conditionality,  will  inevitably  miss  important
10:283:17723:18:18:91:519:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aspects of the dynamic evolution of risk.  In the conditional analyses of subsequent
10:284:17807:18:39:91:508:418:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:sections, we focus mostly on conditionalV aR, but we also treat conditionalES.5
10:285:17886:39:26:91:269:379:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1.3  Plan of the Chapter
10:286:17910:26:18:91:519:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We proceed systematically in several steps.  In section 2 we consider portfolio level
10:287:17995:18:18:91:519:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis, directly modeling conditional portfolio volatility using exponential smooth-
10:288:18081:18:18:91:519:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing and GARCH models, along with more recent “realized volatility” procedures that
10:289:18163:18:18:91:456:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effectively incorporate the information in high-frequency intraday data.
10:290:18235:18:18:109:520:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In section 3 we consider asset level analysis, modeling asset conditional covariance
10:291:18319:18:18:91:519:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrices, again using GARCH and realized volatility techniques.  The relevant cross-
10:292:18403:18:17:91:519:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sectional dimension is often huge, so we devote special attention to dimensionality-
10:293:18487:17:16:91:190:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduction methods.
10:294:18505:16:16:105:520:212:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:4In contrast toV aR, the expected shortfall is acoherentrisk measure in the sense of Artzner
10:295:18597:16:11:91:519:196:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:et al. (1999) as demonstrated by, e.g., F ̈ollmer and Schied (2002).  Among other things, this ensures
10:296:18699:11:9:91:426:185:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:that it captures the beneficial effects of portfolio diversification, unlikeV aR.
10:297:18780:9:15:105:519:176:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:5ESis  increasingly  used  in  financial  institutions,  but  it  has  not  been  incorporated  into  the
10:298:18885:15:12:91:520:161:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:international regulatory framework for risk control, likely because it is harder thanV aRto estimate
10:299:18985:12:0:91:175:149:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:reliably in practice.
11:300:19007:0:18:109:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  section  4  we  consider  links  between  return  volatilities  and  macroeconomic
11:301:19093:18:18:91:488:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fundamentals, with special attention to interactions across the business cycle.
11:302:19172:18:46:109:239:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We conclude in section 5.

11:304:19241:29:18:91:519:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The portfolio risk measurements that we discuss in this section require only a univari-
11:305:19328:18:18:91:519:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ate portfolio-level model.  In contrast,  active portfolio risk management,  including
11:306:19414:18:18:91:519:538:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:V aRminimization  and  sensitivity  analysis,  as  well  as  system-wide  risk  measure-
11:307:19502:18:18:91:500:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ments, all require a multivariate model, as we discuss subsequently in section 3.
11:308:19583:18:18:109:520:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  practice,  portfolio  level  analysis  is  often  done  via  historical  simulation,  as
11:309:19675:18:18:91:519:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:detailed  above.   We  argue,  however,  that  there  is  no  reason  why  one  cannot  esti-
11:310:19768:18:18:91:519:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mate a parsimonious dynamic model for portfolio level returns.  If interest centers
11:311:19851:18:18:91:519:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the distribution of the portfolio returns,  then this distribution can be modeled
11:312:19935:18:18:91:519:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly  rather  than  via  aggregation  based  on  a  larger,  and  almost  inevitably  less

11:332:20801:18:18:91:519:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing models, factor models or some ad hoc considerations.  The current assets without

11:334:20980:15:0:91:519:156:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:used.  When log returns are used the portfolio return is only approximately linear in asset returns.
12:335:21081:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:historical prices can, for example, be matched to “similar” assets by capitalization,
12:336:21166:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industry, leverage, and duration.  Historical pseudo asset prices and returns can then
12:337:21252:18:18:91:429:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be constructed using the historical prices on the substitute assets.

12:340:21476:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and more recent realized volatility based procedures.  Notwithstanding a number of

12:342:21640:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and commonly-used quantitative risk measure.  The main techniques that we discuss
12:343:21721:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are, however, easily adapted to allow for the calculation of other portfolio-level risk
12:344:21808:18:39:91:389:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measures, and we will briefly discuss how to do so as well.

12:348:22014:18:18:91:519:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a serious concern.  Several procedures are available for remedying this deficiency.
12:349:22100:18:18:91:519:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chief among these are RiskMetrics (RM) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional

12:355:22535:18:18:91:519:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a very tight parametric specification by incorporating conditionality via univariate

12:359:22884:16:12:91:519:199:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:to report more conservativeV aR’s; see, e.g., the results in Berkowitz and O’Brien (2002), Perignon

12:362:23178:12:0:91:454:163:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:discuss below may readily be used to achieve any desired, more conservative,V aR.

13:366:23471:33:33:226:520:616:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:σ2t=λσ2t−1+  (1−λ)r2w,t−1,(4)
13:367:23500:33:18:91:520:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where the variance forecast for daytis constructed at the end of dayt−1 using the
13:368:23581:18:18:91:520:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:square of the return observed at the end of dayt−1 as well as the variance on day
13:369:23662:18:18:91:520:547:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:t−1.  In practice this recursion can be initialized by setting the initialσ20equal to the
13:370:23751:18:18:91:519:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unconditional sample variance, say ˆσ2.  Note that repeated substitution in (4) yields
13:371:23837:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an expression for the current smoothed value as an exponentially weighted moving

13:379:23988:26:18:91:308:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence the name “exponential smoothing.”
13:380:24027:18:33:109:390:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the RM framework,V aRis then simply obtained as

13:383:24182:18:18:91:519:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributions and quantiles could be used in place of the normal – and sometimes are –
13:384:24268:18:18:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the assumption of conditional normality remains dominant.  Similarly, the smoothing
13:385:24351:18:18:91:520:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameterλmay in principle be calibrated to best fit the specific historical returns at
13:386:24438:18:18:91:519:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand although, following RM, it is typically fixed at a preset value of 0.94 with daily
13:387:24525:18:15:105:519:198:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:8Empirically more realistic long-memory hyperbolic decay structures, similar to the long-memory
13:388:24620:15:12:91:519:183:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:type GARCH models briefly discussed below, have also been explored by RM more recently; see,
13:389:24712:12:12:91:519:171:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:e.g., Zumbach (2006).  However, following standard practice we will continue to refer to exponential
13:390:24812:12:0:91:263:159:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:smoothing simply as the RM approach.
14:391:24849:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns.  Altogether, the implicit assumption of zero mean returns, a fixed smoothing
14:392:24934:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameter, and conditional normality therefore implies that no parameters and/or
14:393:25014:18:18:91:270:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributions need to be estimated.
14:394:25049:18:18:109:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Extending the approach to longer return horizons,  the conditional variance for
14:395:25128:18:33:91:225:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thek-day return in RM is

14:397:25209:33:18:91:519:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence the RM model can be thought of as a random walk model in variance, insofar
14:398:25289:18:18:91:519:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the variance scales with the return horizon.  More precisely, exponential smoothing
14:399:25375:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is optimal if and only if squared returns follow a “random walk plus noise” model – a
14:400:25460:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“local level” model in the terminology of Harvey (1989) – in which case the minimum
14:401:25543:17:18:91:438:476:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:MSE forecast at any horizon is simply the current smoothed value.9
14:402:25609:18:18:109:520:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Unfortunately, however, the historical record of volatility across numerous asset
14:403:25690:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:classes suggest that volatilities are unlikely to follow random walks, and hence that
14:404:25775:18:18:91:519:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the flat forecast function associated with exponential smoothing is inappropriate for
14:405:25860:18:18:91:519:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility.  In particular, the lack of mean-reversion in the RM variance calculations
14:406:25946:18:18:91:519:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that the term structure of volatility is always flat,  which violates both in-
14:407:26032:18:18:91:519:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tuition  and  historical  experience.   Suppose,  for  example,  that  current  volatility  is
14:408:26126:18:18:91:519:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high by historical standards, as was the case during the height of the financial crisis
14:409:26213:18:18:91:519:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  earlier  part  of  the  sample  in  Figures  1  and  2.   The  RM  model  will  then
14:410:26307:18:18:91:519:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simply extrapolate the high current volatility across all future horizons.  By contrast,
14:411:26395:18:18:91:519:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an empirically more realistic mean-reverting volatility model would correctly predict
14:412:26480:18:18:91:477:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the high volatility observed during the crisis would eventually subside.
14:413:26557:18:17:109:520:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  dangers  of  simply  scaling  the  daily  variance  by  the  horizonk,  as  done  in
14:414:26646:17:18:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(6),  are  discussed  further  in  Diebold  et  al.  (1998a).   Of  course,  the  one-day  RM
14:415:26739:18:18:91:519:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility  does  adjust  much  more  quickly  to  changing  market  conditions  than  the
14:416:26829:18:18:91:519:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HS  approach,  but  the  flat  volatility  term  structure  is  unrealistic  and,  when  taken
14:417:26923:18:18:91:519:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literally, RM does not appear to be a prudent approach to volatility modeling and
14:418:27004:18:18:91:519:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measurement.  Furthermore, it is only valid as a volatility filter and not as a data
14:419:27088:18:0:105:240:153:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:A:9See Nerlove and Wage (1964).

15:421:27207:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models, which allow for much richer terms structures of volatility and which can be
15:422:27290:18:35:91:358:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:used to simulate the return process forward in time.

15:425:27452:18:32:91:225:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio returns, we write

15:427:27532:33:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For  simplicity  we  will  henceforth  assume  a  zero  conditional  mean,μt≡0.   This
15:428:27618:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly parallels the RM approach, and it is a common assumption in risk manage-
15:429:27699:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment when short (e.g., daily or weekly) return horizons are considered.  It is readily
15:430:27785:18:18:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:justified by the fact that the magnitude of the daily volatility (conditional standard
15:431:27871:18:18:91:520:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deviation)σteasily dominates that ofμtfor most portfolios of practical interest.  This
15:432:27957:18:18:91:519:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is also indirectly manifest by the fact that,  in practice,  accurate estimation of the
15:433:28044:18:18:91:519:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mean is typically much more difficult than accurate estimation of volatility.  Still,

15:436:28293:17:18:109:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The key object of interest is the conditional standard deviation,σt.  If it depends

15:438:28466:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:follows a GARCH process.  Numerous competing parameterizations forσthave been

15:442:28792:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duced by Bollerslev (1986) remains by far the most commonly used formulation in
15:443:28871:18:33:91:335:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:practice.  The GARCH(1,1) model is defined by
15:444:28916:33:32:229:520:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:σ2t=ω+αr2w,t−1+β σ2t−1.(8)
15:445:28942:32:0:91:519:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Extensions to higher order GARCH models are straightforward but usually unnec-
16:446:29022:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:essary empirically,  so we concentrate on the GARCH(1,1) throughout most of the
16:447:29101:18:18:91:507:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:chapter, while discussing some important generalizations in the following section.
16:448:29183:18:18:109:531:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Perhaps surprisingly, GARCH is closely-related to exponential smoothing of squared
16:449:29265:18:39:91:314:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns.  Repeated substitution in (8) yields
16:450:29310:39:0:224:252:592:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:σ2t=

16:457:29335:41:18:91:524:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so the GARCH(1,1) process implies that current volatility is an exponentially weighted
16:458:29421:18:18:91:519:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:moving average of past squared returns.  Hence GARCH(1,1) volatility measurement
16:459:29501:18:18:91:299:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is related to RM volatility measurement.
16:460:29541:18:18:109:520:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There  are,  however,  crucial  differences  between  GARCH  and  RM.  First,  the
16:461:29623:18:18:91:519:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH  parameters,  and  hence  ultimately  the  GARCH  volatility,  are  estimated
16:462:29706:18:18:91:519:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using rigorous statistical methods that facilitate probabilistic inference.  By contrast,
16:463:29795:18:18:91:519:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the parameters used in exponential smoothing are set in an ad hoc fashion.  More

16:478:30133:18:18:91:519:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, the assumption of conditional normality underlying the (quasi-) likelihood
16:479:30216:18:18:91:519:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function in (9) is merely a matter of convenience.  If the conditional return distri-
16:480:30301:18:18:91:519:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bution  is  non-normal,  the  resulting  quasi  MLE  generally  still  produces  consistent
16:481:30392:18:18:91:519:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and asymptotically normal, albeit not fully efficient, parameter estimates, see, e.g.,
16:482:30478:18:18:91:519:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1992).  The log-likelihood optimization in (9) can only be
16:483:30563:18:17:91:519:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:done numerically.  However, GARCH models are parsimonious and specified directly
16:484:30643:17:18:91:519:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in terms of univariate portfolio returns, so that only a single numerical optimization

16:487:30831:15:0:91:519:154:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:using standard software such as Excel, as discussed by Christoffersen (2003).  For further discussion

17:489:31013:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment, the covariance stationary GARCH(1,1) process has dynamics that eventually
17:490:31092:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:produce reversion in volatility to a constant long-run value.  This enables interesting
17:491:31179:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  realistic  forecasts  and  contrasts  sharply  with  the  RM  exponential  smoothing
17:492:31268:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach in which, as discussed earlier, the term structure of volatility is forced to
17:493:31354:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be flat.  To see the mean reversion that GARCH enables, rewrite the GARCH(1,1)
17:494:31432:18:18:91:169:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model in (8) as
17:495:31447:18:26:196:520:559:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:σ2t=  (1−α−β)σ2+αr2w,t−1+β σ2t−1,(10)
17:496:31484:26:18:91:520:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereσ2≡ω/(1−α−β) denotes the long-run, or unconditional daily variance, or
17:497:31559:18:33:91:167:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equivalently as
17:498:31574:33:32:183:520:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(σ2t−σ2)  =α(r2w,t−1−σ2) +β(σ2t−1−σ2).(11)
17:499:31616:32:18:91:519:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence the forecasted deviation of the conditional variance from the long-run vari-
17:500:31698:18:18:91:519:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ance is a weighted average of the deviation of the current conditional variance from
17:501:31782:18:18:91:519:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  long-run  variance,  and  the  deviation  of  the  squared  return  from  the  long-run
17:502:31874:18:18:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance.  RM’s exponential smoothing creates a parallel weighted average, with the
17:503:31957:18:18:91:520:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:key difference that exponential smoothing imposesα+β= 1,  whereas covariance
17:504:32033:18:33:91:519:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stationary GARCH(1,1) imposesα+β <1.  Finally, we can rearrange (11) to write
17:505:32110:33:33:168:520:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(σ2t−σ2)  =  (α+β) (σ2t−1−σ2) +ασ2t−1(z2t−1−1),(12)
17:506:32161:33:17:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where  the  last  term  on  the  right  has  zero  mean.   Hence,  the  mean  reversion  of
17:507:32252:17:18:91:520:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the conditional variance (or lack thereof) is governed by (α+β).  So long as (α+
17:508:32332:18:18:91:519:259:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:β)<1,  which  must  hold  for  the  covariance  stationary  GARCH(1,1)  processes  of
17:509:32417:18:18:91:519:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical  relevance,  the  conditional  variance  is  mean-reverting,  with  the  speed  of
17:510:32509:18:18:91:279:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mean reversion governed by (α+β).

18:532:33603:18:18:91:519:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to RM because it moves from ad hoc exponential smoothing to rigorous yet
18:533:33684:18:18:91:519:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple likelihood-based probabilistic modeling, and because it allows for the mean

18:535:33853:18:18:91:519:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crucially, the basic GARCH(1,1) model is readily extended in a variety of important
18:536:33936:18:35:91:379:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and empirically-useful directions, to which we now turn.

18:538:34034:25:18:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:One important generalization of the basic GARCH(1,1) model involves the enrich-

18:540:34193:18:18:91:520:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:withp≥1,q≥1.   Indeed,  Engle  and  Lee  (1999)  show  that  the  GARCH(2,2)  is

19:547:34596:33:18:91:519:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Of course, this “component GARCH” model is a very special version of a component
19:548:34676:18:18:91:519:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model, and one may argue that it is not a component model at all, but rather just
19:549:34757:18:18:91:224:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a restricted GARCH(2,2).
19:550:34781:18:18:109:520:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More  general  component  modeling  is  easily  undertaken,  however,  allowing  for
19:551:34865:18:18:91:519:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:additive superposition of independent autoregressive-type components, as in Gallant
19:552:34948:18:18:91:519:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et  al.  (1999),  Alizadeh  et  al.  (2002)  and  Christoffersen  et  al.  (2008),  all  of  whom
19:553:35045:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find  evidence  of  component  structure  in  volatility.   Under  appropriate  conditions,
19:554:35136:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such structures may be shown to approximate very strong dependence, i.e.  “long-
19:555:35216:17:18:91:519:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:memory,”  in  which  shocks  to  the  conditional  variance  decay  at  a  slow  hyperbolic

19:558:35436:18:18:109:520:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Exact  long-memory  behavior can  also easily  be  incorporated into  the GARCH

19:560:35601:18:18:91:519:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial assets  and/or  portfolios;  see,  e.g.,  Bollerslev and  Mikkelsen  (1999).11As
19:561:35691:18:18:91:519:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed further below, properly incorporating these types of long-memory depen-
19:562:35772:18:18:91:519:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dencies generally also results in more accurate volatility forecasts over long horizons.
19:563:35860:18:18:109:520:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To take a second example of the extensibility of GARCH models, note that all
19:564:35936:18:18:91:519:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the models considered so far, including the RM filter, imply symmetric response
19:565:36018:18:18:91:519:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to positive and negative return shocks.  However, equity markets, and particularly
19:566:36100:18:18:91:519:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equity indexes, often seem to display a strong asymmetry, whereby a negative return
19:567:36183:18:17:91:519:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:boosts  volatility  by  more  than  a  positive  return  of  the  same  absolute  magnitude.
19:568:36275:17:18:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  standard  GARCH  model  is  readily  extended  to  capture  this  effect  by  simply
19:569:36364:18:18:91:519:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including  a  separate  term  for  the  past  negative  return  shocks,  as  in  the  so-called

19:573:36745:12:0:91:192:167:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:basic RM filter remain.
20:574:36770:0:33:91:399:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:threshold-GARCH model proposed by Glosten et al. (1993),

20:576:36875:33:18:91:520:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereI(·) denotes the indicator function.  For well diversified equity portfoliosγis

20:578:37056:18:18:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asymmetry in the volatility appears to  have increased over time and  the estimate
20:579:37138:18:18:91:519:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the conventionalαARCH coefficient in equation (17) is often insignificant with
20:580:37220:18:18:91:519:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recent data, so that the dynamics appear to be driven exclusively by the negative
20:581:37301:18:18:91:127:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shocks.
20:582:37308:18:18:109:520:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Other popular asymmetric GARCH models include the EGARCH model of Nel-
20:583:37378:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:son (1991), in which the logarithmic conditional variance is a function of the “raw”
20:584:37462:17:18:91:519:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and absolute standardized return shocks, and the NGARCH model of Engle and Ng
20:585:37539:18:33:91:281:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1993).  In the NGARCH(1,1) model,

20:587:37609:33:18:91:471:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where asymmetric response in the conventional direction occurs forγ >0.
20:588:37680:18:18:109:520:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  parallel  to  the  RM-V aRdefined  in  equation  (5),  a  GARCH-based  one-day
20:589:37762:18:18:91:520:356:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:V aRmay correspondingly be calculated by simply multiplying the one-day volatility

20:593:37964:25:18:91:520:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This GARCH-V aR, of course, implicitly assumes that the returns are conditionally
20:594:38045:18:18:91:519:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:normally distributed. This is a much better approximation than assuming the returns
20:595:38128:18:18:91:519:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are unconditionally normally distributed,  and it is entirely consistent with the fat
20:596:38213:18:18:91:405:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tails routinely observed in unconditional return distributions.
20:597:38276:18:18:109:520:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As  noted  earlier,  however,  standardized  innovationsztfrom  GARCH  models

21:635:39964:18:0:91:520:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than RM-V aR(andV aRs based on symmetric GARCH models) in falling markets.

22:648:40882:18:18:91:519:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that higher frequency data should be very useful in the construction of more accurate

22:653:41317:18:18:91:519:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:see, e.g., Andersen and Bollerslev (1997) and Andersen et al. (1999).  Fortunately,
22:654:41400:18:18:91:519:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extensive research efforts over the past decade have shown how the rich information
22:655:41483:18:18:91:519:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inherent in the now readily available high-frequency data may be effectively harnessed
22:656:41569:18:18:91:378:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through the use of so-called realized volatility measures.
22:657:41627:18:18:109:520:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To formally define the realized volatility concepts, imagine that the instantaneous
22:658:41710:18:18:91:519:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns, or logarithmic price increments, evolve continuously through time according
22:659:41794:18:32:91:272:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the stochastic volatility diffusion
22:660:41832:32:33:226:520:211:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:dp(t)  =μ(t)dt+σ(t)dW(t),(20)
22:661:41861:33:0:91:519:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereμ(t)  andσ(t)  denote the instantaneous drift and volatility, respectively, and
23:662:41947:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:W(t)  is a standard Brownian motion.12This directly parallels the general discrete-
23:663:42030:18:18:91:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time return representation in equation (7), withrw,t≡p(t)−p(t−1) and the unit
23:664:42107:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time interval normalized to a day.  Just as the conditional mean in equation (7) can
23:665:42191:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be  safely  set  to  zero,  so  too  can  the  drift  term  in  equation  (20).   Hence,  in  what
23:666:42289:18:18:91:213:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:follows, we setμ(t) = 0.
23:667:42313:18:18:109:523:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Following Andersen and Bollerslev (1998b), Andersen et al. (2001b) and Barndorff-
23:668:42394:18:18:91:520:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Nielsen and Shephard (2002), the realized variation (RV) on daytbased on returns
23:669:42474:18:41:91:380:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the ∆ intra-day frequency is then formally defined by

23:677:42572:42:17:91:520:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wherept−1+j∆≡p(t−1 +j∆) denotes the intraday log-price at the end of thejth
23:678:42647:17:18:91:520:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interval  on  dayt,  andN(∆)≡1/∆.   For  example,N(∆)  =  288  for  5-minute
23:679:42723:18:18:91:520:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns in a 24-hour market, corresponding to ∆ = 5/(24·60)≈0.00347, while 5-
23:680:42800:18:18:91:519:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:minute returns in a market that is open for six-and-half hours per day, like the U.S.
23:681:42885:18:18:91:520:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equity markets, would correspond toN(∆) = 78 and ∆ = 5/(6.5·60)≈0.01282.The
23:682:42960:18:18:91:519:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expression in equation (21) looks exactly like a sample variance for the high-frequency
23:683:43047:18:18:91:520:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns, except that we do not divide the sum by the number of observations,N(∆),
23:684:43128:18:18:91:391:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the returns are not centered around the sample mean.
23:685:43184:18:18:109:520:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Assume  for  the  time  being  that  the  prices  defined  by  the  process  in  equation
23:686:43273:18:18:91:519:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(20) are continuously observable.  In this case, letting ∆ go to zero, corresponding
23:687:43357:18:18:91:520:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to progressively finer sampled returns, theRVestimator approaches the integrated
23:688:43437:18:18:91:519:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance  of  the  underlying  continuous-time  stochastic  volatility  process  on  dayt,
23:689:43527:18:15:101:519:261:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:12The notion of a continuously evolving around-the-clock price process is,  of course,  fictitious.
23:690:43626:15:12:91:519:246:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:Most financial markets are only open for part of the day, and prices are not continuously updated and
23:691:43727:12:12:91:519:234:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:sometimes jump.  The specific procedures discussed below have all been adapted to accommodate
23:692:43820:12:12:91:519:222:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:these features and other types of market microstructure frictions, or “noise,” in the actually observed
23:693:43923:12:0:91:186:210:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:high-frequency prices.

24:699:43990:29:18:91:519:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence,  in  contrast  to  the  RM-  and  GARCH-based  volatility  estimates  discussed
24:700:44076:18:18:91:520:616:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:above, thetrueex-post volatility for the day effectively becomes observable.  And it
24:701:44160:18:18:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does so in an entirely model-free fashion regardless of the underlying process that
24:702:44243:18:18:91:210:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:actually describesσ(t).
24:703:44266:18:17:109:520:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In practice, of course, prices are not available on a continuous basis.  However,
24:704:44347:17:18:91:520:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  prices  for  many  assets  recorded,  say,  every  minute,  a  dailyRVcould  easily
24:705:44436:18:18:91:519:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be  computed  from  one-minute  squared  returns.   Still,  returns  at  the  one-minute
24:706:44524:18:18:91:519:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequency  are  likely  affected  by  various  market  microstructure  frictions,  ornoise,
24:707:44615:18:18:91:520:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arising from bid-ask bounces, a discrete price grid, and the like.14Of course, even
24:708:44698:18:18:91:519:473:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  one-minute  price  observations  on  hand,  we  may  decide  to  construct  the  RV
24:709:44787:18:18:91:519:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measures from five-minute returns, as these coarser sampled data are less susceptible
24:710:44872:18:18:91:519:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to contamination from market frictions.  Clearly, this involves a loss of information
24:711:44957:18:18:91:519:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the majority of the recorded prices are ignored.  Expressed differently, it is feasible
24:712:45047:18:18:91:519:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to construct five different sets of (overlapping) 5-minute intraday return sequences
24:713:45131:18:18:91:519:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the given data, but in computing the regular five-minute based RV measure we
24:714:45212:18:18:91:406:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exploit only one of these series – a theme we return to below.
24:715:45274:18:18:109:520:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  optimal  choice  of  high-frequency  grid  over  which  to  measure  the  returns
24:716:45360:18:17:91:519:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obviously depends on the specific market conditions.  The “volatility signature plot”
24:717:45445:17:18:91:519:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of Andersen et al. (2000b) is useful for guiding this selection.  It often indicates the
24:718:45533:18:18:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adequacy of 5-minute sampling across a variety of assets and markets, as originally
24:719:45616:18:18:91:519:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advocated by Andersen and Bollerslev (1998a).15Meanwhile, as many markets have
24:720:45694:18:18:91:519:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:become  increasingly  more  liquid  it  would  seem  reasonable  to  resort  to  even  finer
24:721:45786:18:18:91:519:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sampling intervals with more recent data although, as noted below, the gains from
24:722:45867:18:20:91:519:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:doing so in terms of the accuracy of realized volatility based forecast appear to be
24:723:45951:20:7:101:410:202:7:g_d0_f14:7:g_d0_f14:?:13More precisely, ∆−1/2(RVt(∆)−IVt)→N(0,2IQt), whereIQt≡∫1

24:726:46029:15:9:91:502:187:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:convergence is stable in law; for a full theoretical treatment, see, e.g., Andersen et al. (2010a).
24:727:46128:9:15:101:519:178:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:14Brownlees and Gallo (2006) contain a useful discussion of the relevant effects and some of the
24:728:46224:15:8:91:339:163:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:practical issues involved in high-frequency data cleaning.

25:731:46359:18:18:109:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One way to exploit all the high-frequency returns, even if the RV measure is based
25:732:46441:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on returns sampled at a lower frequency, is to compute alternative RV estimator using
25:733:46526:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  different  offset  relative  to  the  first  return  of  the  trading  day,  and  then  combine
25:734:46624:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them.  For example, if one-minute returns are given, one may construct a new RV
25:735:46703:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimator using an equal-weighted average of the five alternative regular five-minute
25:736:46788:18:18:91:520:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:RV estimators available each day.  We will denote this estimatorAvgRVbelow.  The
25:737:46868:18:18:91:520:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:upshot  is  that  theAvgRVestimator  based  on  five-minute  returns  is  much  more
25:738:46952:18:18:91:502:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:robust to microstructure noise than the singleRVbased on one-minute returns.
25:739:47028:18:18:109:520:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In markets that are not open 24 hours per day, the change from the closing price
25:740:47108:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on dayt−1 to the opening price on daytshould also be accounted for.  This can
25:741:47185:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be done by simply scaling up the trading day RV by the proportion corresponding
25:742:47264:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the missing over-night variation, or any of the other more complicated methods
25:743:47345:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advocated in Hansen and Lunde (2005).  As is the case for the daily GARCH mod-
25:744:47423:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:els discussed above, corrections may also be made for the fact that days following
25:745:47505:18:18:91:508:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weekends and holidays tend to have proportionally higher than average volatility.
25:746:47586:18:18:109:520:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Several other realized volatility estimators have been developed to guard against
25:747:47667:18:18:91:520:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the influences of market microstructure frictions.  In contrast to the simpleRVt(∆)
25:748:47750:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimator, which formally deteriorates as the length of the sampling interval ∆ ap-

25:750:47917:18:18:91:520:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically  designed  to  be  consistent  forIVtas  ∆→0,  even  in  the  presence  of  mar-
25:751:48004:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ket microstructure noise.  Especially prominent are the realized kernel estimator of
25:752:48088:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2008), the pre-averaging estimator of Jacod et al. (2009),
25:753:48172:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the two-scale estimator of A ̈ıt-Sahalia et al. (2011).  These alternative estimators
25:754:48261:18:18:91:519:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are generally more complicated to implement than theAvgRVestimator, requiring
25:755:48338:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the choice of additional tuning parameters, smoothing kernels, and appropriate block
25:756:48422:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sizes.  Importantly, the results in Andersen et al. (2011a) show that, when used for
25:757:48506:18:17:91:520:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility  forecasting,  the  simple-to-implementAvgRVestimator  performs  on  par

26:778:49388:46:18:109:519:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate, we plot in Figure 4 the square root of dailyAvgRVs (in annualized

26:783:49820:18:18:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:untenable from a risk management perspective.  The dramatic rise in the volatility in

27:806:50711:12:12:91:519:435:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:The bottom panel plots the quantiles of the natural logarithm of daily realized volatility against

27:811:51076:18:18:109:520:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Time series plots such as that of Figure 4, of course, begin to inform us about
27:812:51155:18:18:91:519:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aspects of the dynamics of realized volatility.  We will shortly explore those dynamics
27:813:51242:18:18:91:519:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in greater detail.  But first we briefly highlight an important empirical aspect of the
27:814:51329:18:18:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributionof  realized  volatility,  which  has  been  documented  in  many  contexts:
27:815:51417:18:18:91:519:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:realized volatility is highly right-skewed, whereas the natural logarithm of realized
27:816:51502:18:17:91:519:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility  is  much  closer  to  Gaussian.   In  Figure  5  we  report  two  QQ  (Quantile-
27:817:51594:17:18:91:519:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Quantile)  plots  of  different  volatility  transforms  against  the  normal  distribution.
27:818:51686:18:18:91:520:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The top panel shows the QQ plot for dailyAvgRVin standard deviation form, while
27:819:51765:18:18:91:520:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  bottom  panel  shows  the  QQ-plot  for  dailyAvgRVin  logarithmic  form.   The
27:820:51849:18:18:91:519:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:right tail in the top panel is obviously much fatter than for a normal distribution,
27:821:51933:18:0:91:519:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereas the right tail in the bottom panel conforms more closely to normality.  This
28:822:52019:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approximate  log-normality  of  realized  volatility  is  often  usefully  exploited,  even  if
28:823:52114:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it provides only a rough approximation, based on empirical observation rather than
28:824:52196:18:35:91:211:649:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:theoretical derivation.18

28:826:52267:26:18:91:519:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Although dailyRVis ultimately only an estimate of the underlying true integrated
28:827:52347:18:18:91:519:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance, it is potentially highly accurate and thus presents an intriguing opportunity.
28:828:52435:18:17:91:520:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:By treating the dailyRVs, or any of the other high-frequency based RV measures, as
28:829:52517:17:18:91:519:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:direct ex-post observations of the true daily integrated variances, the RV approach
28:830:52600:18:18:91:519:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:permits the construction of ex-ante volatility forecasts using standard ARMA time
28:831:52681:18:18:91:519:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series tools.  Moreover, recognizing the fact that the measures are not perfect, certain
28:832:52769:18:18:91:519:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:kinds of measurement errors can easily be incorporated into this framework.  The
28:833:52849:18:18:91:519:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:upshot is that if the frequency of interest is daily, then using sufficiently high-quality
28:834:52939:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intra-day  price  data  enables  the  risk  manager  to  treat  volatility  as  effectively  ob-
28:835:53035:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:served.  This is fundamentally different from the RM filter and GARCH style models
28:836:53117:18:18:91:519:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed  above,  in  which  the  daily  variances  are  inferred  from  past  daily  returns
28:837:53211:18:18:91:389:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditionalon the specific structure of the filter or model.
28:838:53271:18:18:109:520:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To further help motivate such an approach, we plot in Figure 6 the autocorrelation
28:839:53353:18:18:91:520:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function  (ACF)  of  dailyAvgRVand  daily  returns.   The  horizontal  lines  in  each
28:840:53439:18:18:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plot  show  the  Bartlett  two-standard-deviation  bands  around  zero.   The  ACFs  are
28:841:53527:18:17:91:519:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strikingly different; the realized variance ACF is always positive, highly statistically
28:842:53615:17:18:91:519:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant, and very slowly decaying, whereas the daily return ACF is insignificantly
28:843:53701:18:18:91:519:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different  from  zero.   The  exceptionally  slow  decay  of  the  realized  variance  ACF
28:844:53791:18:18:91:519:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests  long-memory  dynamics,  in  turn  implying  that  equity  market  volatility  is
28:845:53881:18:18:91:519:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highly forecastable. This long-memory property of RV is found across numerous asset
28:846:53964:18:18:91:519:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:classes; see, for example, Andersen et al. (2001b) for evidence on foreign exchange
28:847:54047:18:18:91:519:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates  and  Andersen  et  al.  (2001a)  for  comparable  results  pertaining  to  individual
28:848:54139:18:18:91:263:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equities and equity-index returns.
28:849:54173:18:15:101:519:176:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:18Indeed, as noted by Forsberg and Bollerslev (2002), among others, RV cannot formally be log-
28:850:54267:15:12:91:519:161:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:normally distributed across all return horizons, because the log-normal distribution is not closed

29:874:55057:18:18:91:520:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dependencies.   LetRVtdenote  any  of  the  high-frequency-based  realized  volatility
29:875:55143:18:18:91:519:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measures introduced above.  As an example,  one could specify a simple first-order
29:876:55225:18:33:91:348:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:autoregressive model for the daily volatility series,
29:877:55278:33:33:231:520:234:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:RVt=β0+β1RVt−1+νt.(23)
29:878:55300:33:17:91:520:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This, and any higher order AR models forRVt, can easily be estimated by a standard
29:879:55382:17:18:91:215:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:OLS regression package.
29:880:55405:18:18:109:519:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One could go farther and endowintegratedvariance with AR(1) dynamics, and
29:881:55478:18:0:91:520:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recognize thatRVtcontains some measurement error since in real empirical work the
30:882:55561:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underlying sampling cannot pass all the way to continuous time.  ThenRVtwould
30:883:55638:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equal an AR(1) process plus a measurement error, which yields an ARMA(1,1) model
30:884:55718:18:33:91:229:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if the two are independent,
30:885:55745:33:33:205:406:616:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:RVt=β0+β1RVt−1+α1νt−1+νt.
30:886:55770:33:18:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Estimation of this model formally requires use of non-linear optimization techniques,
30:887:55855:18:18:91:421:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but it is still very easy to do using standard statistical packages.
30:888:55923:18:18:109:520:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although  the  simple  short-memory  AR(1)  model  above  may  be  adequate  for
30:889:56003:18:18:91:520:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:short-horizon risk forecasts, the autocorrelation function forAvgRVshown in Fig-
30:890:56083:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ure 6 clearly suggests that when looking at longer, say monthly, forecast horizons,
30:891:56166:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more accurate forecasts may be obtained by using richer dynamic models that better
30:892:56248:17:18:91:519:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capture the long-range dependence associated with slowly-decaying autocorrelations.
30:893:56331:18:18:91:520:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Unfortunately, however, when|β1|<1 the AR(1) process has short memory, in the
30:894:56408:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sense that its autocorrelations decay exponentially quickly.  On the other hand, when
30:895:56493:18:18:91:520:422:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:β1= 1 the process becomes a random walk (1−L)RVt=β0+νt, and has such strong
30:896:56568:18:18:91:519:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:memory that covariance stationarity and mean reversion are both lost.  A useful mid-
30:897:56652:18:33:91:427:386:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:dle ground may be obtain by allowing for fractional integration,19

30:899:56738:33:18:91:519:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This long-memory model is mean reverting if 0< d <1 and covariance stationary
30:900:56815:18:17:91:520:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if  0< d <1/2.   Fractional  integration  contrasts  to  the  extremely  strong  integer
30:901:56903:17:18:91:519:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:integration  associated  with  the  random  walk  (d=  1)  or  the  covariance-stationary
30:902:56992:18:18:91:520:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:AR(1) case (d= 0).  Crucially, it allows for long-memory dynamics in the sense that
30:903:57075:18:18:91:500:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:autocorrelations decay only hyperbolically, akin to the pattern seen in Figure 6.
30:904:57156:18:18:109:520:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Long-memory models can, however, be somewhat cumbersome to estimate and
30:905:57227:18:18:91:519:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implement.  Instead, a simpler approach may be pursued by directly exploiting longer
30:906:57311:18:18:91:520:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:run realized volatility regressors.  Specifically, lettingRVt−4:tandRVt−21:tdenote the

30:909:57597:12:0:91:219:149:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:GARCH (FIGARCH) model.

31:911:57705:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responding daily volatilities.  Many researchers,  including Andersen et al. (2007a),
31:912:57790:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have found that the so-called heterogenous autoregressive, or HAR-RV, model, orig-
31:913:57872:18:33:91:264:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inally introduced by Corsi (2009),
31:914:57906:33:33:152:520:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:RVt=β0+β1RVt−1+β2RVt−5:t−1+β3RVt−21:t−1+νt,(25)
31:915:57953:33:18:91:519:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provides  a  very  good  fit  for  most  volatility  series.   As  shown  in  Corsi  (2009),  the
31:916:58050:18:18:91:519:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HAR  model  may  be  viewed  as  an  approximate  long-memory  model.   In  contrast
31:917:58134:18:18:91:519:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  exact  long-memory  model  above,  however,  the  HAR  model  can  easily  be
31:918:58220:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated  by  OLS.  Even  closer  approximations  to  exact  long-memory  dependence
31:919:58305:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can  be  obtained  by  including  coarser,  say  quarterly,  lagged  realized  volatilities  on
31:920:58400:17:18:91:519:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the right-hand side of the equation.  A leverage effect, along the lines of the GJR-
31:921:58484:18:18:91:519:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH model discussed above, can also easily be incorporated into the HAR-RV
31:922:58560:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modeling framework by including on the right-hand-side additional volatility terms
31:923:58642:18:18:91:508:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interacted with dummies indicating the sign ofrt−1, as in Corsi and Reno (2010).
31:924:58722:18:33:109:479:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The HAR regressions can, of course, also be written in logarithmic form

31:926:58852:33:18:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The log specification conveniently induces approximate normality, as demonstrated
31:927:58933:18:18:91:519:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Figure 5 above.  It also ensures positivity of volatility fits and forecasts, by expo-

31:934:59352:20:16:101:519:185:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:20Note  however  that  forecasts  ofRVt+1obtained  by  exponentiating  forecasts  of  logRVt+1are
31:935:59449:16:12:91:519:169:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:generally biased, due to the nonlinearity of the exp(·) transformation.  Although we will not pursue
31:936:59549:12:12:91:519:157:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:it  here,  one  could  perform  a  bias  correction,  which  would  depend  on  the  possibly  time-varying
31:937:59656:12:0:91:481:145:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:variance ofνt.  A similar problem applies to the EGARCH model briefly discussed above.

32:956:60164:47:18:91:520:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2003a) use this observation to construct RV-basedV aRs with properties superior to
32:957:60247:18:18:91:515:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH-V aR.  We will discuss this approach in more detail in section 2.3.2 below.
32:958:60328:18:18:109:520:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate, we show in Figure 7 the GARCH-V aRfrom Figure 3 together with
32:959:60404:18:18:91:520:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the HAR-RV-V aRbased on equation (27) constructed using the simple linear HAR-
32:960:60482:18:18:91:520:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:RV specification in (25). The figure shows that HAR-RV-V aRreaches its peak before
32:961:60564:18:18:91:520:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH-V aR.  Equally important, the HAR-RV-V aRdrops back to a more normal
32:962:60638:18:18:91:519:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level sooner than the GARCH-V aRafter the trough in the market on March 2009.
32:963:60715:18:18:91:519:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Intuitively, by using the more accurate RV measure of current volatility the model
32:964:60797:18:17:91:519:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is able to more quickly adjust to the changing market conditions and overall level of
32:965:60882:17:18:91:519:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market risk.  Of course, the commonly employed RM-V aRin Figure 3 is even slower
32:966:60962:18:18:91:520:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to adjust than the GARCH-V aR, and the HS-V aRin Figure 1 adjusts so slowly that
32:967:61042:18:18:91:397:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it remains at its maximum sample value at the end of 2009.
32:968:61100:18:18:109:520:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As discussed above,V aRand other risk measures are often computed for a two-
32:969:61176:18:0:91:519:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:week horizon.  The risk manager is therefore interested in a 10-day volatility forecast.
33:970:61266:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Another advantage of the RV based approach, and the HAR-RV model in particular,
33:971:61345:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that it can easily be adapted to deliver the required multi-period variance forecasts.
33:972:61434:18:33:91:371:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically, consider the modified HAR-RV regression,

34:1021:64093:40:18:91:520:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where  ∆pt−1+j∆≡pt−1+j∆−pt−1+(j−1)∆.   The  idea  behind  the  bipower  variation
34:1022:64174:18:18:91:519:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimator is intuitively simple. When ∆ goes to zero the probability of jumps arriving

34:1024:64341:18:18:91:520:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the non-jump returns.  The product|∆pt−1+j∆||∆pt−1+(j+1)∆|will therefore vanish
34:1025:64420:18:18:91:520:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asymptotically.   Consequently,BPVt(∆)  will  converge  to  the  integrated  variance
34:1026:64505:18:18:91:519:205:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f7:F:IVt,  as  opposed  toQVt,  for  ∆  approaching  zero,  even  in  the  presence  of  jumps.22
34:1027:64597:18:17:91:519:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast,  the key terms in the realized variance estimator,  namely the intraday

35:1032:65002:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:B:continuous price variation.  TheRVt(∆) estimator therefore always converges toQVt

35:1059:66108:18:18:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimator.  When ∆ goes to zero, the probability of jumps arriving in two adjacent
35:1060:66190:18:18:91:519:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time-intervals of length ∆ goes to zero, so the minimum is unaffected by jumps.  The
35:1061:66274:18:18:91:519:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:main difference is that the jump is now fully neutralized,  even at a given discrete
35:1062:66358:18:18:91:519:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sampling  frequency,  in  the  sense  that  the  jump  size  has  no  direct  impact  on  the
35:1063:66451:18:18:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimator.  Hence the finite sample distortion of the MinRV estimator is significantly
35:1064:66537:18:18:91:519:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less than that of BPV estimator.23By this same reasoning, a related jump-robust

36:1088:68132:18:18:91:519:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically feasible decomposition of the total daily variation into the part associated with
36:1089:68220:18:17:91:519:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the “small”, or continuous, price moves, and the part associated with the “large,”
36:1090:68302:17:18:91:519:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and generally more difficult to hedge, price moves, or jumps.  Even if the risk man-
36:1091:68386:18:18:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ager is not interested in this separation per se, this decomposition can still be very
36:1092:68472:18:18:91:492:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:useful for the construction of improvedV aRs and other related risk measures.
36:1093:68549:18:18:109:520:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In particular, it is often the case that the variation associated with jumps tends
36:1094:68631:18:18:91:519:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be much more erratic and less predictable than the variation associated with the
36:1095:68714:18:18:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuous price component.  As such, the simple HAR-RV type forecasting models
36:1096:68793:18:18:91:519:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed  above  may  be  improved  by  allowing  for  different  dynamics  for  the  two
36:1097:68883:18:18:91:519:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different sources of daily variation.  Such an approach was first pursued by Andersen
36:1098:68968:18:31:91:372:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al. (2007a), who found that the HAR-RV-CJ model,

36:1102:69099:41:0:91:519:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indeed produces even better RV forecasts than the HAR-RV model in equation (25),
37:1103:69181:0:18:91:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  implicitly  restricts  theαiandβicoefficients  in  equation  (32)  to  be  identi-
37:1104:69270:18:18:91:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cal.  Instead, by allowing for “αeffects” and “βeffects” in the HAR-RV-CJ model,
37:1105:69350:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we capture the fact that the variation associated with jumps is less persistent and
37:1106:69433:18:18:91:306:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predictable than the continuous variation.
37:1107:69475:18:18:109:520:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Further refinements allowing for leverage effects and/or other asymmetries and
37:1108:69553:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-linearities could easily be incorporated into the same HAR-RV modeling frame-
37:1109:69634:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:work by including additional explanatory variables on the right-hand-side.  But the

37:1111:69795:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fectively  incorporating  the  empirically  most  relevant  dynamic  dependencies  of  the
37:1112:69885:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intraday  price  data  into  the  daily  and  longer-run  volatility  forecasts  of  practical

37:1114:69988:34:26:91:300:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.2.3  Combining GARCH and RV
37:1115:70017:26:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:So  far  we  have  presented  GARCH  and  RV  based  procedures  as  two  distinct  ap-
37:1116:70104:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proaches.  There are, however, good reasons to combine the two.  The ability of RV
37:1117:70186:18:18:91:519:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to rapidly deliver precise information regarding the current level of volatility along
37:1118:70272:18:18:91:519:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the ability of GARCH to appropriately smooth noisy volatility proxies make
37:1119:70351:18:18:91:519:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such a combination appealing.  Another advantage of combined models is the ability
37:1120:70433:18:18:91:519:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to integrate the RV process naturally within a complete characterization of the return
37:1121:70519:18:18:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution, thus allowing the RV dynamics to become a natural and direct deter-
37:1122:70600:18:17:91:520:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:minant of the time-variation in risk measures such asV aRand expected shortfall.
37:1123:70680:17:18:91:451:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The following section will elaborate on those features of the approach.
37:1124:70751:18:18:109:520:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The simplest way of cobining GARCH and RV is to include the RV measure as
37:1125:70824:18:33:91:516:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an additional explanatory variable on the right-hand-side of the GARCH equation,
37:1126:70904:33:33:200:520:233:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:σ2t=ω+αr2w,t−1+β σ2t−1+γ RVt−1.(33)
37:1127:70939:33:18:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is often referred to as a GARCH-X model.24Estimating this model typically re-

37:1129:71128:15:12:91:519:167:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:Finance Association meeting in Sun Valley, Idaho, was among the first to empirically explore this
37:1130:71225:12:12:91:519:155:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:idea.  Related analysis appears in Engle (2002b).  Lu (2005) provides another early comprehensive
37:1131:71322:12:0:91:280:143:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:empirical study of GARCH-X type models.
38:1132:71363:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sults in a statistically insignificantα(ARCH) coefficient, so that the model effectively
38:1133:71451:18:18:91:143:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces to
38:1134:71461:18:26:228:520:649:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:σ2t=ω+β σ2t−1+γ RVt−1.(34)
38:1135:71487:26:18:91:519:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Intuitively, the high-frequency-based RV measure affords a superior estimate of the
38:1136:71570:18:18:91:519:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:true ex-post daily variation compared to the daily (de-meaned) squared returns, in

38:1138:71737:18:18:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such, whenever high-frequency based RV measures are available, it is always a good
38:1139:71819:18:18:91:519:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:idea to use the GARCH-X model instead of the conventional GARCH(1,1) model
38:1140:71893:18:18:91:311:533:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:based solely on daily return observations.25
38:1141:71937:18:18:109:520:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The GARCH-X model defined by equations (7) and (33) or (34) directly provides
38:1142:72014:18:18:91:520:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one-day volatility forecasts.  The calculation of longer-run k-day forecastsσ2t+k|tne-

38:1144:72184:18:18:91:519:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hoc fashion by simply augmenting the GARCH-X model with any one of the HAR-RV
38:1145:72261:18:18:91:519:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:type models discussed in the previous sections.  The so-called Realized GARCH class
38:1146:72344:18:17:91:519:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of models developed by Hansen et al. (2010a) provides a more systematic approach
38:1147:72424:17:18:91:206:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for doing exactly that.
38:1148:72447:18:18:109:520:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As an example, consider the specific Realized GARCH model defined by equation
38:1149:72524:18:33:91:129:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(7) and

38:1156:72930:16:12:91:519:215:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:estimates  in  conventional  daily  GARCH  models  may  be  improved  through  the  use  of  intraday
38:1157:73031:12:8:91:255:203:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:RV-based measures in the estimation.
38:1158:73067:8:16:101:519:195:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:26A closely related class of two-shock Realized GARCH models, in which the return volatility is a
38:1159:73164:16:11:91:519:179:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:weighted average of the GARCH and RV volatilities, has recently been proposed by Christoffersen
38:1160:73259:11:12:91:519:168:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:et  al.  (2011b).   Their  affine  formulation  has  the  advantage  that  option  valuation  can  be  done
38:1161:73366:12:12:91:519:156:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:via  Fourier  inversion  of  the  conditional  characteristic  function.   Non-affine  approaches  to  option
38:1162:73475:12:0:91:466:144:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:valuation using RV have also been pursued by Corsi et al. (2011) and Stentoft (2008).
39:1163:73562:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model implies an ARMA representation for the realized volatility, but other HAR-
39:1164:73642:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:RV type structures could, of course, be used instead.  Note also that unlike regular
39:1165:73726:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH, the Realized GARCH model has two separate innovations.  However, be-

39:1171:74177:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:daily absolute returns, daily high-low ranges, RVs, IVs, or option implied volatilities)

39:1173:74357:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:natural to use this same framework to extend the GARCH-X model to allow for the

39:1182:74933:18:18:91:519:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models  have  the  advantage  that  they  adapt  to  new  information  and  market  con-
39:1183:75021:18:18:91:519:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ditions much more quickly than the regular daily GARCH models.  In contrast to

39:1191:75684:18:16:101:519:174:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:27This approach has also been used by Brownlees and Gallo (2011) to compare different volatility
39:1192:75780:16:0:91:287:158:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:measures and their uses in risk management.
40:1193:75825:0:18:91:430:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the current volatility is exceptionally high by historical standards.
40:1194:75894:18:18:109:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Risk managers, of course, typically care not only about the dynamics of volatility
40:1195:75976:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but also more generally about the dynamics of the entire conditional distribution of
40:1196:76060:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio returns.  Movement in conditional variance is a key driver of movement in
40:1197:76143:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the conditional distribution, but only in the unlikely case of conditional normality is
40:1198:76230:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it the entire story.  Hence we next discuss how GARCH and realized variance may
40:1199:76309:18:39:91:390:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be used in broader modeling of entire return distributions.
40:1200:76368:39:26:91:348:538:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.3  Modeling Return Distributions
40:1201:76402:26:18:91:519:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We have emphasized – and continue to emphasize – the potentially seriously mislead-
40:1202:76485:18:18:91:519:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing nature of unconditional risk analyses.  Here we stress the similarly potentially
40:1203:76569:18:17:91:520:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seriously misleading nature ofGaussianrisk analyses.  There are four cases to con-
40:1204:76651:17:18:91:519:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sider,  corresponding  to  the  reliance  on  unconditional/conditional  information  and
40:1205:76740:18:18:91:338:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the use of Gaussian/non-Gaussian distributions.
40:1206:76787:18:18:109:520:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Risk  measurement  in  an  unconditional  Gaussian  framework  would  be  doubly
40:1207:76867:18:18:91:519:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defective, first because of the deficiencies of the unconditional perspective, and second
40:1208:76956:18:18:91:519:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because financial returns are simply not unconditionally Gaussian, as has been well-
40:1209:77040:18:18:91:519:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:known at least since the classic contributions of Mandelbrot (1963) and Fama (1965).
40:1210:77124:18:18:91:519:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For that reason, even crude approaches like historical HS-VaR, although maintaining
40:1211:77207:18:18:91:519:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an unconditional perspective, dispense with normality by building an approximation
40:1212:77289:18:18:91:439:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the unconditional distribution from historically-observed returns.
40:1213:77358:18:18:109:520:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 8 serves to illustrate the strong unconditional non-normality in returns,
40:1214:77438:18:18:91:519:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as it displays a QQ plot for daily S&P500 returns from January 2, 1990 to December
40:1215:77520:18:18:91:519:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:31,  2010.   That  is,  it  plots  quantiles  of  the  standardized  returns  against  quantiles
40:1216:77616:18:18:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the standard normal distribution.  If the returns were unconditionally normally
40:1217:77698:18:17:91:519:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributed, the points would fall along the 45-degree line.  Clearly, the daily returns
40:1218:77786:17:18:91:240:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are not normally distributed.
40:1219:77815:18:18:109:520:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Now  consider  the  conditional  case.   Note  that  in  specifying  the  general  condi-

40:1221:77987:18:0:91:519:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of returns.  That is, we made no assumptions as to the distribution of returns stan-

41:1235:78463:18:18:91:519:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But in converting objects like GARCH conditional variances into GARCH-VaR, for
41:1236:78541:18:18:91:520:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, wedidinvoke conditional normality.  At least four points are worth making.
41:1237:78624:18:18:109:520:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First,  conditional  normalitycanbe,  and  sometimes  is,  an  acceptable  assump-
41:1238:78706:18:18:91:519:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion.   Conditional  normality  does  not  imply  unconditional  normality,  and  indeed
41:1239:78794:18:18:91:519:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility dynamics “fatten” the tails of unconditional distributions relative to their
41:1240:78881:18:18:91:519:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional  counterparts,  so  that  conditionally-Gaussian  models  sometimes  match
41:1241:78967:18:18:91:519:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the unconditional fat tails present in the data.  Put differently, distributions of re-
41:1242:79054:18:18:91:519:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turns standardized by their conditional volatilities can be approximately Gaussian,
41:1243:79137:18:17:91:381:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even if returns are clearly unconditionally non-Gaussian.
41:1244:79194:17:18:109:520:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, conditional normality is notnecessarilyan acceptable assumption. Some-
41:1245:79272:18:18:91:520:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:times, for example, the unconditional distribution of returns might besofat-tailed
41:1246:79354:18:18:91:519:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the volatility model cannot fatten conditionally-Gaussian tails enough to match
41:1247:79438:18:0:91:309:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the unconditional distribution successfully.
42:1248:79484:0:18:109:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, beyond fat unconditional tails, there may beotherunconditional distribu-
42:1249:79563:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional features, such as skewness, that couldneverbe captured under any symmetric
42:1250:79644:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional  density  assumption  such  as  Gaussian,  independent  of  the  conditional
42:1251:79732:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance model used.  Matching the unconditional density in general requires flexible
42:1252:79817:18:18:91:393:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional varianceandconditional density specifications.
42:1253:79875:18:18:109:520:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Fourth,  our  goal  in  flexibly  specifying  the  conditional  density  is  not  merely  to
42:1254:79967:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:replicate the unconditional density successfully.  Rather, for risk measurement and
42:1255:80050:18:18:91:520:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:management  purposes  the  conditional  density  isthe objectof  direct  and  intrinsic
42:1256:80137:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest.   That  is,  best-practice  risk  measurement  and  management  often  requires
42:1257:80226:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an  estimate  of  the  entire  conditional  distribution  of  returns,  not  just  insufficient
42:1258:80321:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistics  like  its  conditional  variance,  conditional  VaR,  or  conditionally  expected
42:1259:80414:18:18:91:473:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shortfall.  Hence we need a flexibile specification of the conditional density.
42:1260:80493:18:18:109:520:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Empirical analyses typically find that, although standardization by GARCH and
42:1261:80570:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:related volatilities promotes normality, the standardized returns remain non-normal.
42:1262:80654:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The nature of the non-normality of standardized returns, moreover, varies system-
42:1263:80735:18:18:91:519:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:atically across asset classes.  For example, standardized returns from mature foreign
42:1264:80820:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exchange markets are typically symmetric but leptokurtic, while standardized returns
42:1265:80904:18:18:91:343:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on aggregate equity indexes are typically skewed.
42:1266:80953:18:18:109:520:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate we show in Figure 9 a Gaussian QQ plot for S&P500 returns stan-
42:1267:81030:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dardized by the time-varying volatilities from the asymmetric NGARCH(1,1) model
42:1268:81109:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previously used in calculating the VaRs in Figure 3.  The QQ plot reveals that the
42:1269:81191:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:NGARCH-standardized returns conform more closely to normality than do the raw
42:1270:81268:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns of Figure 8.  It also reveals, however, that the left tail of the return distri-
42:1271:81356:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bution remains far from Gaussian.  In particular, there are too many large negative
42:1272:81439:18:18:91:519:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns relative to what one would expect if the standardized returns were Gaussian.
42:1273:81523:18:18:109:520:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As theV aRitself refers to a specific quantile, this QQ plot in effect provides an
42:1274:81605:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assessment of the normal NGARCH-basedV aRs defined in equation (19) across all
42:1275:81683:18:17:91:520:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possible  coverage  rates,p.   In  particular,  judging  by  the  coherence  of  the  positive
42:1276:81777:17:18:91:520:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quantiles, the figure suggests that the normal-NGARCH-V aRapproach works rea-
42:1277:81854:18:18:91:519:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sonably well at moderate coverage rates for a well diversified portfolio representing
42:1278:81939:18:0:91:519:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a short position on the market index.  On the other hand, for a diversified portfolio

43:1296:82463:47:18:91:519:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is long the market index, the approach only works if the desired coverage rate
43:1297:82546:18:18:91:519:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is relatively large, say in excess of about 15% or a value of around negative one in
43:1298:82630:18:18:91:519:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the figure.  Moving further into the tail, the normal approximation deteriorates quite
43:1299:82716:18:18:91:520:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:badly,  rendering the corresponding normal-basedV aRs unreliable.  Of course,  the

44:1329:84154:18:18:109:520:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:It is worth stressing that the QQ plots in Figures 9 and 10 rely on theidentical

44:1333:84482:18:18:91:519:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns has long been seen as a key stylized fact in market risk management; see, e.g.,
44:1334:84569:18:18:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Christoffersen (2003).  Thus, identifying a volatility measure that produces approxi-
44:1335:84654:18:18:91:519:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mately normally distributed standardized returns is both surprising and noteworthy.
44:1336:84737:18:17:91:519:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Of course, the realized volatility used in the standardization in Figure 10 is based
44:1337:84821:17:18:91:520:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on high-frequency data over thesamedaily time interval as the return,  while the

45:1341:85132:0:18:109:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Against  this  background  on  the  very  different  distributional  properties  of  un-
45:1342:85220:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standardized, GARCH-standardized and RV-standardized returns, in this section we
45:1343:85300:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discuss how to use the different standardizations and resulting distributions to con-
45:1344:85385:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:struct accurate predictive return distributions.  An important part of that discussion,
45:1345:85472:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particularly in the GARCH-standardized case, involves specification of empirically-
45:1346:85555:18:35:91:403:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:realistic (i.e., non-Gaussian) conditional return distributions.

45:1348:85651:25:18:91:519:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The GARCH dynamic directly delivers one-day ahead volatility forecasts.  In order
45:1349:85732:18:18:91:519:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to complete the daily predictive return distribution, one simply needs to postulate a
45:1350:85817:18:18:91:520:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution for theztreturn shock in equation (7).  Although the normal assumption
45:1351:85900:18:18:91:519:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may work well in certain cases, as Figure 9 makes clear, it often underestimates large
45:1352:85986:18:18:91:519:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downside risks.  As such, it is important to consider alternatives that allow for fat
45:1353:86071:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tails and/or asymmetries in the conditional distribution.  Specifically, in the case of
45:1354:86158:18:33:91:466:427:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:V aRwe are looking for ways to more accurately assess the cut-offκ−1pin

45:1356:86253:33:17:91:520:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instead of simply relying on Φ−1pfrom the standard normal distribution.29Of course,
45:1357:86336:17:18:91:520:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:doing this for all values ofp∈[0,1] essentially amounts to mapping out the entire
45:1358:86417:18:18:91:250:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional return distribution.
45:1359:86449:18:18:109:520:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Perhaps the most obvious approach is to look for a parametric distribution that is
45:1360:86531:18:18:91:520:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more flexible than the normal.  One example is the (standardized) Student-tdistribu-
45:1361:86615:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion, which relies on only one additional degrees-of-freedom parameter in generating
45:1362:86699:18:18:91:519:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:symmetric fat tails.  Such an approach was first pursued by Bollerslev (1987), who
45:1363:86781:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:showed how the likelihood function for the normal-GARCH model in equation (9)
45:1364:86858:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  readily  extended  to  the  GARCH-t  case,  thus  allowing  for  the  estimation  of  the
45:1365:86951:18:18:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:degrees-of-freedom parameter (along with the other GARCH parameters) that best
45:1366:87029:18:16:101:519:182:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:29The 1996 amendment to the 1988 Basel Accord somewhat arbitrarily recommends the use of a
45:1367:87119:16:12:91:520:166:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:multiplicative factor of at least−3.0 in the construction of a 1%V aR, relative to the Φ−10.01=−2.33
45:1368:87219:12:0:91:484:154:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:implied by the standard normal distribution; see also the discussion in Chan et al. (2007).
46:1369:87312:0:18:91:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:describes the return distribution,  and in turn the requisiteκ−1pfor calculating the
46:1370:87396:18:18:91:206:667:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:V aRin equation (38).
46:1371:87417:18:18:109:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This approach works reasonably well when the conditional return distribution is
46:1372:87496:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:close to symmetric.  However, as illustrated by the QQ plots discussed above, equity
46:1373:87580:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portfolios are often severely left skewed.  The Generalized Error Distribution (GED),
46:1374:87665:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first employed in this context by Nelson (1991), explicitly allows for asymmetries, as
46:1375:87751:18:18:91:520:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do some of the different generalizations of the Student-tdistribution suggested by
46:1376:87833:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hansen (1994) and Fernandez and Steel (1998), among others.  Alternatively, follow-
46:1377:87916:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing Engle and Gonzalez-Rivera (1991) the whole density forztmay be approximated
46:1378:87995:18:18:91:331:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using more flexible semiparametric procedures.
46:1379:88041:18:18:109:520:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Rather  than  postulating  a  particular  parametric  density,  one  can  also  simply
46:1380:88127:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approximate the quantiles of non-normal distributions via Cornish-Fisher type ex-

46:1385:88486:18:18:109:520:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Meanwhile,  a  common  problem  with  most  GARCH  models,  regardless  of  the
46:1386:88565:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation distribution, is that the specific distribution is not preserved under tem-
46:1387:88651:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:poral aggregation; see, e.g., the discussion in Drost and Nijman (1993) and Meddahi
46:1388:88734:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  Renault  (2004).   For  example,  even  if  the  standardized  daily  returns  from  a
46:1389:88825:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH(1,1) model were normal, the implied weekly returns would not be.  In turn,
46:1390:88905:18:18:91:520:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this implies that the term structure ofV aRs is not closed under temporal aggrega-
46:1391:88987:18:18:91:520:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion either.  Instead, the multi-periodV aRs need to be computed via Monte Carlo
46:1392:89067:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simulations or other numerical methods,  as exemplified by Guidolin and Timmer-
46:1393:89146:18:18:91:520:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mann  (2006).31This  also  means  that  the  Cornish-Fisher  and  related  approxima-

47:1409:90409:25:18:91:519:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  basic  idea  underlying  the  construction  of  RV-based  predictive  return  distri-
47:1410:90499:18:18:91:519:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:butions is to treat the time series of RVs as stochastic.  Hence,  in contrast to the
47:1411:90584:18:18:91:519:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH-based procedures, which seek to describe the predictive distribution through
47:1412:90666:18:18:91:519:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an appropriately specified univariate distribution for the standardized returns, the
47:1413:90750:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:RV-based procedures necessitate, at a minimum, a bivariate random distribution for
47:1414:90832:18:18:91:295:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the returnsandthe realized volatilities.
47:1415:90872:18:18:109:520:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This relatively new approach to risk measurement was first suggested by Ander-
47:1416:90950:18:18:91:519:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sen et al. (2003a).  The approach is directly motivated by the empirical regularities
47:1417:91035:18:18:91:519:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pertaining to the RV measures highlighted above.  First, as discussed in section 2.2,
47:1418:91120:18:18:91:519:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple  time  series  models  for  the  realized  volatilities,  like  the  HAR-RV  specifica-
47:1419:91214:18:18:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion, generally result in more accurate volatility forecasts than do the conventional
47:1420:91299:18:17:91:519:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GARCH models  based on daily  data only.32Second,  as shown in  section  2.3,  the
47:1421:91381:17:18:91:519:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributions  of  daily  returns  standardized  by  the  same-day  RVs  typically  appear
47:1422:91471:18:18:91:519:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:close to Gaussian.  Taken together, this suggests a mixture-of-distributions type ap-

47:1424:91639:18:18:91:374:248:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:distribution forRVT+1serves as the mixture variable.33
47:1425:91693:18:20:109:519:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:A:Specifically,  assuming  that  the  standardized  return  is  normal,rT+1/RV1/2T+1∼
47:1426:91776:20:15:101:519:210:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:32This empirical regularity may also be justified through more formal theoretical arguments, as to
47:1427:91874:15:12:91:519:195:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:why the simple reduced form RV-based procedures often work better than structural model-based

47:1429:92063:9:15:101:519:174:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:33There is a long history, dating back to Clark (1973), of using mixture-of-distributions to describe
47:1430:92164:15:12:91:519:159:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:the unconditional distribution of returns. What is fundamentally different in the RV-based approach
47:1431:92263:12:0:91:392:147:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:is to treat the mixing variable as directly observable and predictable.
48:1432:92336:0:18:91:520:685:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:N(0,1), and that the distribution of the timeT+ 1 realized volatility conditional on

48:1457:92969:18:18:91:519:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extended in several directions.  For instance, as noted above, when modeling large
48:1458:93051:18:18:91:519:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equity portfolios, asymmetries, or “leverage effcts,” are often statistically significant.
48:1459:93141:18:18:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Also, in their actual empirical implementation Andersen et al. (2003a) use a long-

48:1461:93301:18:18:91:519:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:makes  little  difference  for  the  maximum  ten-days  forecast  horizons  considered  in
48:1462:93391:18:17:91:519:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their analysis, but it could be important to do so in the calculation of longer run, say
48:1463:93479:17:18:91:520:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quarterly (∼66 days ahead) or annual (∼252 days ahead), distributional forecasts.
48:1464:93560:18:18:109:519:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  mixture  distribution  described  above  treatsσ`,tas  constant.   However,  it
48:1465:93644:18:18:91:519:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is natural to think about the volatility-of-volatility as being time varying with its
48:1466:93729:18:18:91:519:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:own  GARCH  dynamics.   Such  an  approach  has  been  pursued  empirically  by  Ma-
48:1467:93813:18:18:91:519:253:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:B:heu  and  McCurdy  (2011),  who  report  that  allowing  for  temporal  variation  inσ`,t
48:1468:93902:18:18:91:519:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not actually result in materially different predictive return distributions.  Go-
48:1469:93988:18:18:91:519:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing  one  step  further,  Bollerslev  et  al.  (2009a)  develop  a  joint  conditional  density
48:1470:94083:18:18:91:519:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model  for  the  returns,  the  “smooth”  volatility,  and  the  variation  due  to  jumps
48:1471:94173:18:15:101:519:181:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:34Although it is not possible to express the density function in closed form, it is easy to calculate
48:1472:94274:15:12:91:519:166:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:numerically by repeated simulations from a normal distribution with a random variance drawn from
48:1473:94370:12:0:91:368:154:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:a log-normal distribution with the requisite mean and variance.

49:1475:94523:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns is therefore obtained through a more complicated normal mixture involving
49:1476:94604:18:18:91:438:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two separate mixing variables, but the basic idea remains the same.
49:1477:94671:18:18:109:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This continues to be an active area of research, and it is too early to say which of

49:1479:94841:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively  simple  RV-based  procedures  described  above  almost  invariably  generate
49:1480:94929:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more  accurate  predictive  return  distributions  than  the  traditional  GARCH-based

49:1485:95300:18:18:91:519:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecasts.  The procedures discussed in the previous section,  of course,  also utilize

49:1487:95472:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:B:generally do not provide a direct link between the GARCH conditional varianceσt

50:1528:97529:26:18:91:519:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In the discussion above,  we have often pointed to the use of numerical simulation
50:1529:97611:18:18:91:519:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:techniques as a way to calculate quantiles or distributions that are not available in
50:1530:97696:18:18:91:519:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closed form. These techniques differ in terms of their underlying assumptions ranging
50:1531:97781:18:18:91:356:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from fully parametric to essentially non-parametric.

50:1534:97996:17:0:91:519:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns to build up the required distribution.  At the portfolio level this is easy to
51:1535:98084:0:33:91:419:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do.  First calculate the standardized pseudo portfolio returns as,

51:1537:98186:33:18:91:519:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using  one  of  the  variance  models  discussed  above.   Then,  in  order  to  calculate  a

51:1539:98361:18:33:91:356:583:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:combined with the volatility forecast to construct,36

51:1541:98444:32:18:91:519:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This same idea could also be used to numerically calculate theV aRfor parametric

51:1545:98726:18:18:91:519:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straightforward.  It requires simulating future paths from the volatility model using

51:1549:99074:18:18:91:342:374:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:details concerning its practical implementation.37
51:1550:99124:18:18:109:520:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The FHS methodology was originally developed in a GARCH setting.  However,
51:1551:99198:18:18:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for some of the RV-based procedures discussed above, one would naturally use RV

51:1553:99373:18:32:91:323:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standardized returns should be sampled from

52:1567:99935:18:18:91:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dures, one might need to perform a bootstrap from the supposedlyi.i.d.bivariate

52:1570:100110:26:18:91:519:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The different parametric and non-parametric procedures discussed above for charac-

52:1572:100278:17:18:91:520:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:procedures, are designed to work well for center of the distribution andV aRs with
52:1573:100360:18:18:91:519:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively  large  coverage  rates,  say  in  excess  of  5%.   In  many  situations,  however,
52:1574:100455:18:18:91:519:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one is primarily interested in the tails of the distributions and the risks associated
52:1575:100541:18:18:91:519:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with extremely large price changes.  Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides a formal
52:1576:100622:18:18:91:519:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistical  framework  for  meaningfully  estimating  the  tails  based  on  extrapolating
52:1577:100713:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the available observations.  McNeil et al. (2005) provides an excellent survey
52:1578:100796:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of these techniques and their application in quantitative risk management, and we
52:1579:100877:18:18:91:519:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:merely highlight some of the key ideas here; early important work in this area also
52:1580:100960:18:18:91:475:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include Diebold et al. (1998b), Longin (2000) and McNeil and Frey (2000).
52:1581:101033:18:18:109:519:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Standard EVT is based on the assumption ofi.i.d.observations.  This may be a
52:1582:101109:18:18:91:519:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:good approximation for many applications in actuarial science, but financial returns
52:1583:101193:18:18:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  large  absolute  price  changes,  in  particular,  are  obviously  noti.i.d.through
52:1584:101281:18:17:91:519:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time.  However, in parallel to the FHS approach discussed immediately above, EVT
52:1585:101361:17:18:91:519:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may easily be combined with dynamic volatility models by applying the EVT-based
52:1586:101440:18:18:91:520:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approximations to the estimated return shocks ˆzw,t=rw,t/ˆσtrather than the returns
52:1587:101523:18:18:91:519:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:themselves.   Since  the  return  shocks  are  much  closer  to  beingi.i.d.than  are  the
52:1588:101613:18:18:91:519:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns, this makes the application of EVT much more reasonable.  Having estimated
52:1589:101695:18:18:91:519:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the tails for ˆzw,t, these are easily transformed to tails or extreme quatiles of the raw
52:1590:101784:18:18:91:226:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns by scaling with ˆσt.
52:1591:101812:18:18:109:520:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:EVT has the advantage that each tail of the distribution can be modeled sepa-
52:1592:101889:18:18:91:519:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rately.  But it has the limitation that it only describes the tails of the distribution
52:1593:101976:18:0:91:519:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and not the entire distribution.  It is therefore not possible to simulate data from an
53:1594:102065:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:EVT distribution unless further assumptions are made.  One way to proceed is to use
53:1595:102148:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:EVT in the tails combined with FHS for characterizing the center of the distribution.
53:1596:102233:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Assume for example that EVT captures well the 2% most extreme positive shocks
53:1597:102310:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  3%  most  extreme  negative  shocks.   Return  shocks  can  then  be  simulated
53:1598:102399:18:18:91:520:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by first drawing a trinomial variable that comes up{−1,0,+1}with probabilities
53:1599:102477:18:18:91:520:595:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:{.03,.95,.02}.   When  the  trinomial  comes  up  0  then  a  shock  is  drawn  randomly
53:1600:102565:18:18:91:520:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(with replacement) from the sample of ˆzw,twith the left 3% and right 2% extremes
53:1601:102646:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:removed.  When the trinomial comes up−1 then a shock is drawn from the left-tail
53:1602:102726:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:EVT distribution.  Similarly,  a draw is made from the right-tail EVT distribution
53:1603:102808:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when the trinomial comes up +1.  This same idea may also be used in “stress testing”
53:1604:102892:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the portfolio, by increasing the probabilities assigned to the tails, in turn generating
53:1605:102980:18:18:91:493:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a disproportionate number of draws from the extreme part of the distribution.

53:1607:103139:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:naturally thought of as “jumps.” The discussion in section 2.2.2 above outlines several
53:1608:103226:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ways for disentangling the jumps on an ex-post basis with the help of high-frequency
53:1609:103310:18:18:91:519:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intraday data. Following the recent work of Bollerslev and Todorov (2011b), the high-
53:1610:103395:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequency filtered jumps may in turn be used in the estimation of the corresponding
53:1611:103478:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jump  tail  distribution  and  the  probability  of  observing  an  extreme  price  change.
53:1612:103569:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Work long these lines is still in its infancy.  However, we conjecture that in parallel

53:1615:103822:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be available through the proper use of the high-frequency data for more accurately

53:1618:104015:30:18:91:519:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our discussion up until now has focused on dynamic volatility models for univariate

60:1833:118235:18:18:91:519:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for all of the correlations, the time-varying correlations are assumed to be the same
60:1834:118320:18:18:91:519:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across all pairs of assets.  Hence the name dynamic equicorrelation, or DECO, model.
60:1835:118404:18:18:91:519:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The assumption of identical correlations, of course, is only applicable when modeling
60:1836:118489:18:18:91:520:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar types of assets, such as, e.g., a large cross-section of stock returns.46Following

60:1839:118722:8:15:101:519:171:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:46If this assumption is valid, imposing identical correlations will also generally enhance estimation

62:1901:121259:18:18:91:519:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions involving only a few assets.  More elaborate DCC models, including asymmetric
62:1902:121342:18:18:91:519:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formulations (e.g., Cappiello et al. (2006)) and regime switching type representations
62:1903:121428:18:18:91:519:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., Pelletier (2006)), have been proposed to allow for more nuanced modeling when

63:1914:122281:18:18:109:520:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Market risk management systems for portfolios of thousands of assets often work
63:1915:122360:18:18:91:519:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from a set of smaller, say 30, observed base assets believed to be the key drivers of
63:1916:122445:18:18:91:519:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the underlying risks.  The accuracy of the resulting risk management system, in turn,
63:1917:122530:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depends on the distributional assumptions for the base assets and the mapping from
63:1918:122612:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the base assets to the full set of assets.  The specific choice of base assets depends
63:1919:122698:18:18:91:519:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:importantly on the portfolio at hand but may, for example, consist of equity market
63:1920:122781:18:18:91:519:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indices, FX rates, benchmark interest rates, and so on, believed to capture the main
63:1921:122865:18:18:91:519:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sources  of  uncertainty.   These  base  assets  will  typically  also  be  among  the  most
63:1922:122957:18:18:91:519:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:liquid assets in the market.  Such an approach is, of course, easier to contemplate for
63:1923:123044:18:18:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a relatively specialized application with readily identifiable risk factors, such as a U.S.

63:1932:123647:18:0:91:519:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than usual for traditional factor models employed in finance, but the basic idea is to
64:1933:123735:0:18:91:414:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:keep their number much lower than the total number of assets.

64:1942:124341:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  an  ad  hoc  fashion,  by  matching  a  security  without  a  factor  loading  to  another
64:1943:124435:17:18:91:519:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:similar security with a well-defined loading.  Importantly, however, bothB0andB
64:1944:124514:18:18:91:234:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are assumed to be constant.
64:1945:124541:18:18:109:520:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Now, combining the distributional assumptions in (50) with the basic factor struc-
64:1946:124623:18:33:91:462:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ture in (51), the resulting covariance matrix forRtmay be expressed as,
64:1947:124694:33:33:242:520:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Ωt=B′ΩF,tB+  Ων,t,(52)
64:1948:124716:33:18:91:520:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where Ων,tdenotes theN×Ncovariance matrix forνt.  Since Ωtand Ων,tare both of
64:1949:124793:18:18:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same dimension, this expression does not directly translate into any simplification
64:1950:124880:18:18:91:520:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the estimation of the covariance matrix for the full set ofNreturns.  However,
64:1951:124961:18:17:91:519:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assuming that the idiosyncratic risks are uncorrelated across assets and that their
64:1952:125044:17:33:91:383:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variances are constant, the expression for Ωtsimplifies to
64:1953:125102:33:33:244:520:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Ωt=B′ΩF,tB+Dν,(53)
64:1954:125120:33:18:91:519:219:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:B:whereDν= Ων,tis a time-invariant diagonal matrix.  Moreover, the elements inDν
64:1955:125198:18:18:91:519:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are readily estimated from the variances of the residuals in the factor model (51).
64:1956:125281:18:18:91:519:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This, of course, still leaves ΩF,tto be determined.  But, by keepingNFmoderately
64:1957:125361:18:18:91:519:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low,  ΩF,tis  much  easier  to  estimate  than  Ωt.   In  fact,  in  addition  to  any  of  the
64:1958:125456:18:0:91:519:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:techniques discussed in this section, some of the more advanced multivariate GARCH
65:1959:125540:0:18:91:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:procedures alluded to above could be applied for estimating ΩF,twhen the number
65:1960:125619:18:18:91:330:667:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:of base assets, orNF, is kept sufficiently low.49
65:1961:125668:18:18:109:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:A:Although convenient from a modeling perspective, the key assumption that Ων,t
65:1962:125745:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is diagonal and constant over time often appears at odds with the data.  Just as vari-
65:1963:125831:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ances (and covariances) of raw returns are clearly time-varying, so are the variances

65:1965:126002:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets,  as  encapsulated  in  the  factor  loadings,  are  also  likely  to  change  over  time,

65:1968:126262:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high-frequency intraday data, it is often feasible to alleviate these drawbacks and, as
65:1969:126349:18:39:91:453:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we shall see below, factor structures are often invoked in such settings.

65:1971:126465:25:18:91:519:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus far our discussion has focused on models tailored toward capturing the dynam-

65:1974:126719:18:18:91:519:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion is useful for the estimation of daily variances, it should be equally, if not more,
65:1975:126807:18:18:91:351:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:useful for the estimation of daily asset covariances.

65:1983:127374:18:19:91:519:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much loss of generality, we assume thatM(t) = 0, although non-zero drifts, as rel-
65:1984:127456:19:15:101:519:177:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:49This basic idea was pioneered by Diebold and Nerlove (1989) in their construction of a multi-

66:1989:127891:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independent, i.e., no redundant asset is included in the basic set of returns, implying

66:2010:128968:18:18:91:520:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:upshot is that, as before, variancesandcovariances no longer have to be extracted

66:2014:129298:17:18:91:507:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we may apply standard time series techniques for their modeling and forecasting.
66:2015:129378:18:18:109:520:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Of  course,  the  idealized frictionless  setting motivating the  recipe forRCovtin

67:2020:129814:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation (55), and its limit in equation (56), provide only an approximate description
67:2021:129900:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of reality.  For instance, as discussed in section 2.2, trades are not consummated con-
67:2022:129987:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tinuously, imposing a strict upper bound on the highest possible sampling frequency.
67:2023:130071:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This presents important new implementation challenges compared to the univariate
67:2024:130151:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, especially if the number of assets is large and the trading intensities of some
67:2025:130236:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets are relatively low.  In particular, while some of the techniques discussed earlier
67:2026:130325:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be adapted for consistently estimating the individual elements of the covariance
67:2027:130409:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrix in the presence of market microstructure noise, none of these generally guar-
67:2028:130493:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:antee that the estimated covariance matrix is positive definite (pd), or even positive
67:2029:130579:18:18:91:189:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:semi-definite (psd).
67:2030:130599:18:18:109:520:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Along  these  lines,  Andersen  et  al.  (2003a)  first  noted  that  the  simple  realized
67:2031:130690:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covariance matrix in (55) will be pd by construction, as long as the asset returns are
67:2032:130776:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:linearly independent and the trading (or quoting) activity is sufficiently high.  The
67:2033:130861:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specific requirement is that price updates are available for the full cross-section of
67:2034:130947:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets over small enough time increments, ∆, to ensure that the number of intraday
67:2035:131029:18:18:91:520:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observations,N(∆)  =  1/∆,  exceeds the number of assets,N.  For example,  if we
67:2036:131109:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample individual U.S. stocks every five minutes across the official trading day, the
67:2037:131194:18:18:91:447:380:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:RCovtmatrix is trivially singular if the number of stocks exceeds 78.
67:2038:131263:18:18:109:520:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For a set of very actively traded securities, the above conditions may not appear
67:2039:131344:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unduly restrictive.  After all, many assets trade multiple times each minute on aver-
67:2040:131429:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age, often generating thousands of new trade prices per day.  Unfortunately, this is
67:2041:131513:18:18:91:520:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deceptive.  The key point is thatallassets must have traded within each sampling
67:2042:131593:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interval.  If not, this will generally result in a downward bias in the covariance esti-
67:2043:131681:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mates due to the presence of zero returns induced purely by the absence of trades

67:2045:131845:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characterization in Epps (1979).  Since many assets periodically experience a trading
67:2046:131930:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lull,  there  will  often  be  extended  periods  of  no-trading  for  some  of  the  assets,  so
67:2047:132027:18:17:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that this can be a major concern.  Hence, when using the basic realized covariance
67:2048:132109:17:18:91:519:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrix estimator in equation (55), it is critical to sample fairly sparsely to alleviate
67:2049:132197:18:18:91:520:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this bias.52Of course,  this then restricts the size of the cross-section that can be
67:2050:132282:18:0:101:519:147:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:52It  is  generally  also  advantageous  to  follow  the  subsampling  strategy  previously  outlined  in
68:2051:132389:0:18:91:235:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyzed quite dramatically.
68:2052:132417:18:18:109:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More  generally,  the  price  synchronicity  requirement  implies  that  the  realized
68:2053:132503:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covariance  matrix  cannot  be  estimated  consistently  unless  the  sampling  scheme  is
68:2054:132593:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adapted to the trading intensity of the least active asset at any given time.  This idea
68:2055:132681:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is encapsulated in the “refresh time” sampling procedure advocated by Barndorff-
68:2056:132761:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Nielsen et al. (2011) as part of their multivariate realized kernel approach to covari-
68:2057:132848:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ance  matrix  estimation.   The  kernel  consists  of  the  inclusion  of  a  suitably  chosen
68:2058:132942:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weight function for the lead and lag returns in the computation of the covariance
68:2059:133023:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrix.  This ensures consistency in the presence of general classes of microstructure
68:2060:133109:18:18:91:500:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:noise, while also guaranteeing that the estimate of the covariance matrix is psd.
68:2061:133190:18:18:109:520:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Direct application of this approach is eminently feasible for a limited number of
68:2062:133271:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:actively  traded  assets.   However,  when  the  number  of  assets  is  large,  refresh  time
68:2063:133365:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sampling results in a dramatic loss of data as intermediary prices for active assets
68:2064:133449:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are discarded until the last asset trades.  For example, Hautsch et al. (2011) assess
68:2065:133534:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that, with realistic intra-stock differences in trade arrival rates, more than 90% of
68:2066:133619:18:18:91:519:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the data are discarded for a system of twenty actively traded assets,  and the pro-
68:2067:133702:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portion continues to rise as the cross-section of assets increases.  This implies that,
68:2068:133789:18:18:91:520:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forNrising, the effective sampling frequency, 1/∆, drops quite dramatically, in turn
68:2069:133873:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rendering it difficult to satisfy the positive definiteness bound.  Equally problematic
68:2070:133960:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the loss in estimation precision as each pairwise covariance term is computed from
68:2071:134045:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fewer and fewer intraday observations, ultimately producing a poorly estimated over-
68:2072:134129:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all covariance matrix with many zeros among the eigenvalues.  In sum, this strategy
68:2073:134212:18:18:91:306:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fails for very large cross-sections of assets.
68:2074:134258:18:18:109:520:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Two main approaches have hitherto been proposed in the literature to accom-
68:2075:134333:18:18:91:519:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modate large cross-sections, while avoiding dramatic Epps style biases.  One avenue
68:2076:134416:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is to initially ignore the requirement of positive definiteness and apply the refresh
68:2077:134501:18:21:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sampling scheme on smaller blocks of assets, thus mitigating the problems associated

68:2079:134685:12:12:91:519:185:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:sampling at the given frequency at different offsets relative to the opening trade, and then average
68:2080:134785:12:12:91:519:173:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:the resulting covariance measures across the subsamples.  For example, by initiating sampling at
68:2081:134881:12:12:91:519:161:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:each of the first five-minute marks during the trading day, one could secure five distinct five-minute
68:2082:134983:12:0:91:210:149:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:return series for each asset.
69:2083:135014:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the loss of data,  and then to apply a regularization procedure to restore the
69:2084:135097:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:psd property.  The second approach is to exploit covariance matrix factor structure
69:2085:135180:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to reduce the effective dimension of the problem, thereby allowing for more reliable
69:2086:135264:18:35:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates from a given set of intraday observations.  We now discuss these techniques.

69:2088:135400:26:18:91:520:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The simplest method for converting a “vast”N×Npositive semi-definite covariance

69:2091:135656:18:18:91:520:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to combineRCovt(∆) with anN×Nshrinkage target matrix, Υt, which is posi-
69:2092:135728:18:18:91:519:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tive definite and well-conditioned.  Ideally, the target should also provide a sensible
69:2093:135815:18:30:91:455:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:benchmark covariance matrix to minimize the resulting bias.  Formally,

69:2095:135917:36:18:91:520:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where the weight assigned to the realized covariance matrix satisfies 0< κ <1, so
69:2096:135998:18:18:91:519:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the shrinkage estimator is a convex linear combination of a positive semi-definite and
69:2097:136084:18:18:91:409:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a positive definite matrix, implying it will be positive definite.
69:2098:136150:18:17:109:520:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As an extraordinarily simple illustration of this basic principle, in a setting with
69:2099:136234:17:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:daily  data  and  time-varying  covariance  matrices,  Ledoit  and  Wolf  (2004)  propose
69:2100:136323:18:18:91:520:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shrinkage towards the identity matrix, i.e., Υt=I, with the weight,κ, determined
69:2101:136403:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimally according to an asymptotic quadratic loss function.  While this will reduce
69:2102:136488:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the variance, it may, of course, induce a rather severe bias, as asset returns generally
69:2103:136576:18:18:91:200:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are highly correlated.
69:2104:136598:18:18:109:520:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To counteract this bias,  Ledoit and Wolf (2003) suggest shrinkage towards the
69:2105:136676:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covariance structure implied by a simple one-factor market model.  Specifically, fol-

70:2113:137072:18:18:91:498:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all of these parameters are easy to estimate from simple time series regressions.
70:2114:137153:18:18:109:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast to Υt=I, this procedure allows for non-trivial positive return cor-
70:2115:137232:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relation across assets, thus providing a more suitable shrinkage target for covariance
70:2116:137318:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimation.  However, it assumes that the relevant second order return moments are
70:2117:137400:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time-invariant, so that a long time series of daily returns can be used for estimating
70:2118:137486:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:b, along with the other parameters.  This is counter to the spirit of high-frequency
70:2119:137570:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:return based estimation, where we seek to determine the time variation in the co-
70:2120:137651:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance matrix and,  as an implication,  the fluctuations in systematic market risk

70:2122:137822:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance matrix, estimated without bias but with poor precision, and the shrinkage
70:2123:137904:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:target, which may be strongly biased but is estimated with better precision, naturally
70:2124:137990:18:17:91:430:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggest alternative approaches that better balance the two effects.
70:2125:138057:17:18:109:520:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this regard, Hautsch et al. (2011) have recently suggested breaking the covari-

70:2127:138223:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thus minimizing the loss of data from refresh time sampling when using the multi-

70:2138:139097:15:12:91:519:203:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:mentioned previously, there are recent attempts to adapt similar procedures to the high-frequency

70:2140:139202:8:16:101:519:183:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:54This approach is motivated by random matrix theory; see, e.g., Mehta (1990) for an introduc-

71:2164:140611:18:17:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using only the corresponding bivariate realized kernel estimator.  This minimizes the
71:2165:140696:17:18:91:519:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:loss of information due to refresh time sampling, while permitting an optimal choice

71:2167:140867:18:18:91:519:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obtained by assembling all the elements into a “composite realized kernel” covariance
71:2168:140952:18:18:91:519:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimator.  This heightens the quality of the estimate for each individual term, but it
71:2169:141039:18:18:91:519:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sacrifices the coherence of the overall matrix by not imposing the pd (or psd) prop-
71:2170:141123:18:18:91:519:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:erty beyond the bivariate systems.  Since the resulting composite covariance matrix
71:2171:141206:18:18:91:519:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:typically will be “far” from pd, it requires a more substantial transformation of the
71:2172:141291:18:0:91:519:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entries in the covariance matrix to obtain a pd matrix than is the case for the RnB

72:2181:141991:36:18:91:520:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where ̃Λtdenotes thek×kdiagonal matrix containing the upper leftk×ksub-matrix
72:2182:142068:18:17:91:520:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ofˆΛt, while ̃Ptdenotes theN×kmatrix containing the firstkcolumns of eigenvectors

72:2184:142226:18:18:91:520:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is of rankkand thus not strictly positive definite.  It is also not a proper correlation
72:2185:142314:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrix, as it generally fails to have unit entries along the diagonal.  Nonetheless, it

72:2205:143329:9:15:101:519:179:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:57Notice that for any square matrixA, the operationA−diag(A) leaves the off-diagonal entries

74:2256:147302:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data  was  first  pursued  empirically  by  Bollerslev  and  Zhang  (2003)  and  Andersen
74:2257:147391:18:18:91:510:308:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:et al. (2006b) for the three Fama-French portfolios and the market, respectively.60
74:2258:147474:18:18:109:520:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:From a practical perspective, however, the estimation of the loadings runs into
74:2259:147553:18:18:91:520:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the exact same market microstructure problems that plague the originalRCovtes-

74:2261:147726:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:typically  required  for  asset  level  risk  analysis.   These  difficulties  may,  of  course,
74:2262:147822:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be partly overcome by resorting to some of the techniques already outlined above.
74:2263:147903:18:17:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This  mainly  involves  suitably  combining  the  different  procedures,  and  we  abstain
74:2264:147993:17:16:101:519:183:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:59Related banding and thresholding procedures for estimating daily realized covariance matrices
74:2265:148088:16:8:91:261:167:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:are discussed in Wang and Zou (2010).
74:2266:148125:8:16:101:519:159:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:60Estimation and forecasting of betas based on high-frequency data have also been explored more
74:2267:148220:16:0:91:417:143:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:recently within the Realized GARCH framework by Hansen et al. (2010b).
75:2268:148292:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from fleshing out the details.  Hence, instead of further discussion of techniques for
75:2269:148378:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measuring the current realized covariance matrix, we now turn to different dynamic
75:2270:148460:18:35:91:353:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models for forecasting realized covariance matrices.

75:2272:148567:26:18:91:519:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:All of the different procedures discussed in the preceding section for estimating the
75:2273:148652:18:18:91:519:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:realized covariance matrix may in principle be applied as short term daily forecasts
75:2274:148736:18:17:91:519:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as well, when augmented with a martingale assumption for the realized covariance
75:2275:148816:17:18:91:520:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrix, e.g., tomorrow’s expected covariance matrix equals today’s realization.61Of
75:2276:148899:18:18:91:519:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:course, the martingale hypothesis is at best a short term approximation, as both vari-
75:2277:148985:18:18:91:519:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ances and covariances generally display mean reversion.  Hence, for longer horizons
75:2278:149068:18:18:91:490:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explicit time series models must be developed as a basis for sensible forecasts.
75:2279:149148:18:18:109:520:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Building on the univariate procedures discussed earlier, this section outlines var-
75:2280:149231:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ious strategies for modeling and forecasting integrated covariance matrices, treating
75:2281:149316:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the realized covariance matrix as directly observable, albeit with some measurement
75:2282:149399:18:18:91:519:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:error.  Since the literature on the estimation of large realized covariance matrices is
75:2283:149486:18:18:91:519:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recent and remains limited, there are still no authoritative studies of the relative per-
75:2284:149575:18:18:91:520:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formance of different approaches.62Consequently, our review of existing techniques
75:2285:149657:18:18:91:519:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is invariably somewhat speculative.  However, we anticipate this to be an area where
75:2286:149741:18:18:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substantial progress will be made over the coming years, and therefore summarize
75:2287:149821:18:17:91:394:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what we see as some of the more promising new directions.
75:2288:149878:17:18:109:520:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In parallel to the notation for the variance forecasts discussed earlier, we denote
75:2289:149961:18:18:91:519:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:theN×Npoint forecast of the integrated return covariance matrix for periodt+k
75:2290:150038:18:18:91:519:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based on information through periodt, byˆΩt+k|t, while the corresponding measures
75:2291:150119:18:18:91:520:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the realized covariance matrix in periodtis generically labeledˆΩt.63Just as many
75:2292:150204:18:16:101:519:230:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:61Both  Hautsch  et  al.  (2011)  and  Lunde  et  al.  (2011)  base  their  exploration  of  one-day-ahead
75:2293:150310:16:8:91:294:214:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:covariance matrix forecasts on this hypothesis.
75:2294:150357:8:16:101:519:206:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:62The set of potential applications is literally unlimited, thus making it hard to settle on a simple
75:2295:150458:16:12:91:519:190:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:metric for assessing the economic value of improved forecasts, even if one focuses on practical risk
75:2296:150558:12:12:91:519:178:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:measurement and management problems.  An early study inspiring this literature is Fleming et al.
75:2297:150654:12:11:91:519:166:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:(2003), who suggest dramatic improvements vis-a-vis the RM and multivariate GARCH frameworks
75:2298:150746:11:9:91:363:155:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:for standard mean-variance efficient asset allocation problems.
75:2299:150809:9:0:101:519:146:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:63Of course, as discussed in the previous section, there are many alternative proposals for esti-
76:2300:150908:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  forecasting  models  for  the  realized  volatilities  discussed  in  section  2.2  were
76:2301:151005:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly inspired by existing techniques for forecasting with daily or lower frequency
76:2302:151091:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data, so are many of the procedures for dynamic realized covariance matrix modeling.
76:2303:151175:18:18:109:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In particular, directly emulating the Risk Metrics approach in equation (40), it
76:2304:151255:18:30:91:209:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is natural to postulate,
76:2305:151279:30:36:225:520:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:ˆΩt+1|t=λˆΩt|t−1+ (1−λ)ˆΩt,(67)
76:2306:151310:36:18:91:520:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where 0< λ <1.  Thus, the integrated covariance matrix forecast is generated as an
76:2307:151392:18:18:91:520:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:exponentially weighted average of past realized covariance matrix measures withλ
76:2308:151472:18:18:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controlling the relative weight ascribed to the more recent realizations.64Intuitively,
76:2309:151559:18:17:91:519:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this  allows  for  persistent  time-variation  in  the  realized  covariance  matrices,  while
76:2310:151653:17:18:91:519:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implicitly  acknowledging  that  each  realization  is  measured  with  error.   Of  course,
76:2311:151745:18:18:91:519:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this approach also inherits all of the problems with the conventional RM approach,
76:2312:151827:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including the lack of mean-reversion, and as such may not be appropriate for longer
76:2313:151910:18:18:91:180:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecast horizons.
76:2314:151928:18:18:109:520:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Alternatively,  mimicking  the  scalar  diagonal  GARCH  model  in  equation  (43)
76:2315:152010:18:33:91:392:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests the following multivariate regression specification,
76:2316:152071:33:33:185:520:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:vech(ˆΩt+1)  =vech(C) +β vech(ˆΩt) +ξt+1,(68)
76:2317:152116:33:18:91:520:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where theN(N+ 1)/2×1 vectorξtdenotes an error term.  This system requires
76:2318:152189:18:14:91:520:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nothing but OLS to implement, and conditional on the estimated parameters,ˆCand
76:2319:152268:14:36:93:486:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ˆβ,, the forecast for the integrated covariance matrix is readily obtained from,
76:2320:152348:36:24:201:520:252:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:vech(ˆΩt+1|t)  =vech(ˆC) +ˆβ vech(ˆΩt).(69)
76:2321:152391:24:12:91:520:228:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:mating Ωtand associated procedures for forecasting it, soˆΩtandˆΩt+k|tmerely serve as generic
76:2322:152484:12:12:91:519:216:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:indicators for the realized covariance measure and forecast being entertained at a given point in the
76:2323:152585:12:12:91:520:204:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:exposition.  We reserve the more specific notation,RCovt(∆), for the standard realized covariance
76:2324:152682:12:12:91:519:192:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:estimator  based  on  the  cross-product  of  returns  sampled  at  fixed  frequency  ∆.   Also,  as  in  the
76:2325:152791:12:12:91:520:180:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:univariate case, the models will typically stipulate a specific dynamic evolution for Ωt, whereas any
76:2326:152892:12:8:91:380:168:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:empirical analysis will be based on the time series of observedˆΩt.
76:2327:152959:8:16:101:519:160:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:64This particular procedure is among the set of dynamic specifications explored by, e.g., Fleming
76:2328:153056:16:0:91:443:144:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:et al. (2003), Liu (2009), Bannouh et al. (2010) and Varneskov and Voev (2010).
77:2329:153137:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Strict positive definiteness of the covariance matrix forecast in equation (69) is guar-
77:2330:153225:18:18:91:469:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anteed for any pd matrixˆCand positive values ofˆβ, as long asˆΩtis psd.
77:2331:153297:18:18:109:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Even though the above procedure generalizes the “martingale” hypothesis, cor-
77:2332:153374:18:18:91:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responding toC= 0 andβ= 1, it still assumes a common degree of mean rever-
77:2333:153448:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sion across all variances and covariances.  As noted previously, this is likely overly
77:2334:153534:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:restrictive,  especially  when  considering  a  diverse  set  of  assets,  so  it  is  worthwhile
77:2335:153631:18:18:91:290:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contemplating suitable generalizations.
77:2336:153670:18:18:109:520:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Pushing the above approach one step further,  any of the other procedures dis-
77:2337:153748:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cussed  in  section  3.1  could  be  similarly  adapted  to  modeling  realized  covariances,
77:2338:153841:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:keeping in mind the restrictions required for positive definiteness.  For example, the
77:2339:153927:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:DCC-type framework naturally suggests first modeling the realized standard devia-
77:2340:154008:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions asset-by-asset using any of the procedures discussed in section 2.2, and the cor-
77:2341:154095:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responding realized correlations in a second step.  Specifically, maintaining a simple
77:2342:154181:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic structure as in equation (68), the correlation dynamics for the standardized
77:2343:154265:17:33:91:239:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns could be modeled as,
77:2344:154293:33:33:193:520:401:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:vech(Qt)  =vech(C) +β vech(Qt−1) +ξt,(70)
77:2345:154334:33:18:91:519:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where we have extended the notation for the conventional DCC model in the obvious
77:2346:154415:18:18:91:519:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:way.  Again, simple OLS is all that is required for estimation.  As for the conventional
77:2347:154503:18:18:91:519:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:DCC model, an additional normalization along the lines of equation (47) is needed
77:2348:154584:18:18:91:519:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to ensure that the resulting correlation matrix is well defined, with ones along the
77:2349:154668:18:18:91:448:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diagonal and all of the off-diagonal elements falling between -1 and 1.
77:2350:154739:18:18:109:520:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The advantages of these approaches are twofold.  First, high-frequency informa-
77:2351:154818:18:17:91:519:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion is used to obtain more precise estimates of current variances and covariances,
77:2352:154901:17:18:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in turn resulting in better “initial conditions” for forecast calculations.  Second, by
77:2353:154988:18:18:91:519:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treating the covariance matrices as directly observable no numerical optimization is
77:2354:155072:18:18:91:298:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:needed for the estimation of the models.
77:2355:155112:18:18:109:520:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Even  though  we  have  focussed  on  simple  first-order  models  and  corresponding
77:2356:155197:18:18:91:519:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one-day-ahead forecasts, all the procedures discussed above could easily be iterated

78:2360:155537:18:18:109:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A  major  obstacle  for  adopting  more  realistic  and  complex  representations  for

78:2362:155714:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed at length previously, the requirement for positive definiteness.  A possible
78:2363:155800:18:18:91:520:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:solution consists of first applying a nonlinear transform to theRCovtmatrix with the
78:2364:155884:18:18:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:property that the inverse transform will ensure positive definiteness.  One may then
78:2365:155968:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specify and estimate the dynamics of the transformed system without imposing any
78:2366:156048:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraints.  Once the future expected value of the transformed system is determined,
78:2367:156133:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  inversion  back  into  a  covariance  representation  automatically  produces  a  pd
78:2368:156222:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matrix forecast.  A popular example of this approach within the univariate setting
78:2369:156304:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  the  specification  of  dynamic  models  for  log  volatility,  as  in  the  EGARCH  and

78:2380:157072:18:18:91:519:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameters can be difficult to interpret in terms of the marginal impacts of shocks

79:2405:158178:40:18:91:520:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:One may then proceed as before by specifying the dynamics ofvech(At), estimating

79:2411:158610:21:18:109:520:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, while the literature on modeling the covariance matrix dynamics is
79:2412:158688:18:18:91:519:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:progressing rapidly along many different directions, there is still no consensus on the
79:2413:158775:18:18:91:519:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative merits of the approaches.  It is clear, however, that the use of high-frequency

79:2420:159399:18:17:91:363:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discuss some recent ideas for implementing this next.
79:2421:159452:17:16:101:519:223:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:66The aforementioned study by Chiriac and Voev (2011) also provides approximate bias correction
79:2422:159547:16:8:91:519:207:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:terms for this, but deem the extent of the bias to be relatively minor in their empirical application.
79:2423:159649:8:12:101:519:199:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:67A related multivariate matrix Exponential GARCH model was proposed by Kawakatsu (2006).
79:2424:159738:12:16:101:519:187:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:68The actual application in Bauer and Vorkink (2011) is relatively modest in terms of dimension-
79:2425:159834:16:0:91:475:171:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:ality, and too highly parameterized to be be practical for high-dimensional applications.

80:2427:159956:26:18:91:519:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As  with  the  univariate  setting,  it  is  tempting  to  combine  the  precision  of  high-
80:2428:160049:18:18:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequency realized volatility based measures with the powerful and flexible economet-

80:2430:160215:18:18:91:519:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the volatility dynamics for multivariate systems.  This can be done in a variety of
80:2431:160298:18:18:91:519:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ways, especially if one breaks the approach down into multiple steps.  Nonetheless,
80:2432:160381:18:18:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the literature dealing with this approach remains nascent and we have little evidence
80:2433:160466:18:18:91:519:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regarding the relative performance of alternative procedures,  so we only briefly il-
80:2434:160551:18:18:91:519:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lustrate how these methods may be combined to construct candidate models with

80:2436:160699:17:18:109:520:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, it is natural to exploit the various techniques for estimation of the realized
80:2437:160784:18:18:91:519:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlation matrix, discussed in the initial parts of section 3, with the flexible dynamic
80:2438:160874:18:18:91:519:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modeling of the individual conditional variances afforded by GARCH style models.
80:2439:160954:18:18:91:519:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Recall  the  decomposition  in  equation  (45),  Ωt=DtΓtDt.   The  diagonal  condi-
80:2440:161037:18:18:91:520:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional standard deviation matrix,Dt, may be obtained from univariate models, each

80:2442:161208:18:18:91:519:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data are available, the candidate univariate volatility models include the GARCH-X
80:2443:161290:18:18:91:519:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Realized GARCH techniques reviewed in section 2.3.3.  These approaches en-
80:2444:161368:18:18:91:519:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sure volatility dynamics that quickly respond to changes in the underlying realized
80:2445:161451:18:18:91:519:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility measures and provide a great deal of freedom in adapting the estimation to
80:2446:161536:18:18:91:519:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accommodate critical features of each specific series,  including asymmetric return-
80:2447:161620:18:18:91:519:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility  relations,  long  memory  dynamic  dependencies,  calendar  effects,  and  the
80:2448:161710:18:18:91:337:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:degree of heavy tails in the return distributions.
80:2449:161760:18:17:109:519:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The conditional correlation matrix, Γt, also changes over time, but it is likely to
80:2450:161843:17:18:91:519:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evolve more slowly than the conditional variances.  As such, one may exploit wider
80:2451:161925:18:18:91:519:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimation windows to enhance the precision of estimation. Technically, one may sim-
80:2452:162009:18:18:91:520:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ply stipulate a constant correlation matrix,  Γt= Γ , for a period of one week or one
80:2453:162094:18:18:91:519:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:month, say, but allow this constant matrix to be estimated over a rolling window so
80:2454:162177:18:18:91:519:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that it does evolve slowly over time.  The longer time series allows for additional flex-
80:2455:162266:18:0:91:519:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ibility in estimating the realized correlation matrix, even for a very large set of assets,

81:2457:162445:18:18:91:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dures for estimating Γ , include the basicRCovtestimator using appropriately sparse
81:2458:162528:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sampling frequencies, the shrinkage estimators, or the various techniques exploiting

81:2460:162697:18:18:91:520:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  blocking.69Clearly,  the  potential  for  developing  alternative  approaches  along
81:2461:162786:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these lines is vast and we currently have only limited knowledge about the relevant
81:2462:162869:18:18:91:471:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical tradeoffs that will govern the success of the different techniques.
81:2463:162946:18:18:109:520:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, we briefly discuss a proposal that directly combines realized covariance

90:2800:181419:18:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:When using non-normal distributions, or any kind of copula, portfolioV aRandES

90:2802:181578:18:18:91:304:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based methods relatively more attractive.
90:2803:181619:18:18:109:520:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the general multivariate case, we can in principle use the Filtered Historical

90:2805:181782:18:18:91:519:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ization is needed.  Using for example the Cholesky or the spectral decomposition we
90:2806:181865:18:29:91:434:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first create vectors of standardized returns as in equation (78); i.e.,

90:2808:181968:36:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:whereˆΩ−1/2tdenotes the relevant decomposition of the estimated covariance matrix.75
90:2809:182052:18:18:91:519:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Now, resampling with replacement vector-wise from the standardized returns will en-

91:2817:182699:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the base asset setup discussed in section 3.1.2, resampling from the factor in-

91:2821:182834:22:18:91:519:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where  we  again  rely  on  the  spectral  or  Cholesky  decomposition  to  build  up  the
91:2822:182924:18:18:91:519:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of the factor returns.  Given the specification in section 3.1.2, the corre-

91:2825:183119:33:18:91:520:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, by resampling sequentially fromˆZtand ˆνt, we can easily build up the required
91:2826:183203:18:17:91:519:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of the individual asset returns.  This, of course, assumes that the base
91:2827:183288:17:18:91:430:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asset model provides a good description of the joint dependencies.
91:2828:183354:18:18:109:520:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Alternatively,  if  one  is  willing  to  assume  constant  conditional  correlations,  as

91:2834:183799:25:18:91:519:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The simulation procedures discussed above work well for numerically describing cor-

91:2836:183971:18:18:91:519:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Extreme Value Theory (EVT) offers a tool for exploring cross-asset dependencies in
91:2837:184053:18:18:91:519:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the “tails” of distributions, which are not well-captured by standard parametric dis-
91:2838:184138:18:18:91:267:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tributions or correlation measures.
91:2839:184173:18:18:109:520:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For example, Longin and Solnik (2001) define and compute extreme correlations
91:2840:184250:18:18:91:519:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between monthly U.S. index returns and a number of foreign country indexes.  In
91:2841:184329:18:18:91:519:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the case of the bivariate normal distribution, correlations between extremes taper off
91:2842:184415:18:18:91:519:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to zero as the thresholds defining the extremes get larger in absolute value.  Actual
91:2843:184500:18:0:91:519:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial  returns,  however,  behave  quite  differently.   In  particular,  the  correlation
92:2844:184596:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between  the  large  (in  an  absolute  sense)  negative  returns  reported  in  Longin  and
92:2845:184688:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Solnik  (2001)  tend  to  be  much  larger  than  the  normal  distribution  would  suggest
92:2846:184779:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(while  interestingly,  the  correlations  of  large  positive  returns  appear  to  approach
92:2847:184872:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero in accordance with the normal distribution).76Such strong correlation between
92:2848:184954:18:18:91:408:613:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:negative extremes is clearly a key risk management concern.77

92:2860:185870:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant correlation captures quite closely the up-market correlations but it cannot

94:2907:188996:26:18:91:519:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We have emphasized using the univariate portfolio-level and multivariate asset-level
94:2908:189080:18:18:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk models discussed in sections 2 and 3, respectively, to construct real-time portfolio

94:2910:189258:18:18:91:519:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sometimes  informative  also  to  consider  risk  measures  that  condition  not  only  on
94:2911:189348:18:18:91:520:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:historical  returns,  but  also  on  assumedscenariosfor  particular  risk  factors.   We
94:2912:189437:18:18:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:might, for example, be interested in the firm-specific effects of a market-wide shock,
94:2913:189523:18:18:91:348:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or the market-wide effects of a firm-specific shock.
94:2914:189575:18:18:109:520:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Such  scenario-based  conditional  risk  measures  are  intrinsically  related  to  mea-

94:2916:189754:17:18:91:519:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will  shortly  introduce  several,  but  the  defining  characteristic  is  that  systemic  risk
94:2917:189850:18:18:91:519:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:– one way or another – involves market-wide movements.  Systemic risk measures
94:2918:189928:18:18:91:519:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can help firms to develop richer and more informative risk reports internally.  They
94:2919:190012:18:18:91:519:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can also be used by supervisory authorities to measure and monitor the firm-specific
94:2920:190096:18:18:91:519:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects  of  market-wide  shocks,  the  market-wide  effects  of  firm-specific  shocks,  and
94:2921:190189:18:18:91:519:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the corresponding totals across all firms.  Those measurements may then impact pol-
94:2922:190272:18:18:91:519:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:icy decisions, such as which banks to support during crises, which bank mergers to

95:2935:191155:18:18:91:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood should depend not only onMES, but also on how much capital the firm

95:2937:191291:18:18:109:520:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These distress considerations raise the idea of expected capital shortfall (ECS),

97:3022:195801:26:18:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Interestingly, modern network theory provides a powerful unifying framework for sys-
97:3023:195885:18:18:91:519:427:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:temic risk measures, including measures likeECSandCoV aRintroduced above.82
97:3024:195960:18:18:91:520:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The simplest network is composed ofNnodes, where any given pair of nodes may or

97:3029:196350:18:17:91:519:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and popular, by far, are based on the idea of a node’sdegree, given by the number

97:3039:196962:12:9:91:198:199:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:by Artzner et al. (1999).
97:3040:196987:9:15:101:519:190:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:81Multivariate quantile models, such as those recently developed by White et al. (2010), could
97:3041:197081:15:9:91:213:175:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:also be used in this context.
97:3042:197110:9:15:101:519:166:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:82Here we provide a brief overview of key ideas. Extended discussion, references, and systemic risk

98:3044:197307:0:18:109:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The network structure sketched above is, however, rather too simple to describe

98:3046:197468:18:18:91:519:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in two key directions is necessary.  First, links may be of varying strength, not just
98:3047:197554:18:18:91:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:0-1.   Second,  links  may  be  of  different  strength  in  different  directions  (e.g.,  firmi
98:3048:197651:18:18:91:520:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may impact firmjmore than firmjimpacts firmi).  Note,  for example,  that the
98:3049:197728:18:18:91:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:systemic risk measures introduced above are weighted and directional.  For example,

98:3052:197941:18:18:109:520:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is a simple matter, however, to characterize directed, weighted networks in a
98:3053:198021:18:18:91:520:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parallel fashion.  To allow for directionality, we allow the adjacency matrixAto be
98:3054:198104:18:18:91:520:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-symmetric, and to allow for different relationship strengths we allowAto contain

98:3056:198267:18:18:91:520:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by summing weights in [0,1] rather than simply zeros and ones.  In addition,  and
98:3057:198348:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:importantly, there are now “to-degrees” and “from-degrees,” corresponding to row

98:3070:198711:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aspects of systemic risk. The from- and to-degrees measure systemic risk with respect

98:3076:199191:18:18:109:520:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A key insight is that many approaches to systemic risk measurement fit naturally
98:3077:199271:18:18:91:520:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into the network framework.  Consider,  for example,  ∆CoV aRmeasure.  One can

99:3090:199759:30:18:91:519:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  risk  models  that  we  have  discussed  thus  far  are  inherently  “reduced  form,”

99:3093:200033:18:18:91:519:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structural understanding of volatility movements, they are nevertheless powerful and
99:3094:200117:18:18:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:useful in a variety of contexts.  We have obviously emphasized risk measurement and
99:3095:200200:18:18:91:519:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:management, but other successful areas of application include portfolio allocation,

99:3102:200760:18:18:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risks.  Here we sketch emerging empirical aspects of those connections, through the

99:3117:201995:12:12:91:520:191:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:that would require replacing each bi-directional arrow in Figure 13 with apairof uni-directional

100:3144:203460:18:18:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determinants of volatility.  In a well-known and exhaustive study in the wake of the
100:3145:203544:18:18:91:519:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1987 crash, for example, Schwert (1989) went farther, showing that, surprisingly, the

101:3167:205052:18:18:109:520:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More recent work, in particular Bloom et al. (2009) as summarized in Table 1,

101:3171:205402:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the statistical significance of the “recession effect” on volatility, but also its sizable
101:3172:205492:18:18:91:203:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economic importance.

101:3174:205592:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and equity market risk, one would expect related links in other market risk contexts.
101:3175:205677:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To  take  one  example,  consider  foreign  exchange.   The  expected  real  streams  that

103:3221:209124:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from those that drive the earlier-discussed real volatility dynamics at business-cycle

103:3223:209222:18:18:109:520:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In intriguing recent work, Carvalho and Gabaix (2010) do precisely that, arguing
103:3224:209302:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the Great Moderation was neither good policy nor good luck,  but rather the
103:3225:209382:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:natural  outcome  of  the  evolution  of  sectoral  shares,  which  during  the  post-1984

103:3227:209555:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from  an  explicit  network  perspective,  Acemoglu  et  al.  (2010)  make  clear  that  the
103:3228:209647:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic workings of “better diversification” are subtle and nuanced, depending not

103:3232:209873:26:17:91:519:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Now consider the links between fundamental volatility and return volatility,σf↔σr.
103:3233:209955:17:18:91:518:208:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:B:Even  with  no  additional  work,  our  earlier  discussion  ofμf↔σrandμf↔σf
103:3234:210031:18:18:91:520:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:immediately implies thatσrandσfmust be positively related.  This is so because

104:3238:210361:18:18:91:434:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:return volatility and real fundamental volatility are clearly related.
104:3239:210431:18:18:109:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:But  one  might  want  to  go  farther.   First,  one  might  want  to  complement  our
104:3240:210518:18:18:91:520:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deduction of aσf↔σrlink with a direct exploration.  Engle et al. (2006) do just
104:3241:210597:18:18:91:520:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that,  directly  documenting  the  links  betweenσfandσrafter  effectively  removing

104:3243:210763:18:18:91:185:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:component model.
104:3244:210779:18:18:109:520:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  one  might  want  to  explore  cross-section  and  panel  aspects.   That  can
104:3245:210866:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be useful because the precision with which relationships can be inferred depends on
104:3246:210949:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the amount of variation in the data, and there may be more variation over a broad
104:3247:211030:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cross section of countries than for a single country over time.  Diebold and Yilmaz

104:3249:211199:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher broad stock market volatility, even controlling for initial development level.  In
104:3250:211288:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the most thorough study to date, Engle and Rangel (2008) explore time-series, cross-
104:3251:211372:17:18:91:519:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sections and panels, clearly finding that the “long-term volatilities of macroeconomic
104:3252:211458:18:18:91:459:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fundamentals ...  are primary causes of low-frequency market volatility.”
104:3253:211531:18:18:109:520:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In closing this section we note that we have largely interpreted “market risk and
104:3254:211612:18:18:91:520:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:macro fundamentals” as “marketvolatilityand macro fundamentals.” As we have
104:3255:211687:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:emphasized  earlier  in  our  discussion  of  portfolio-level  risk  measurement,  however,
104:3256:211778:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one may naturally approach market volatility from a top-down (portfolio-level) or
104:3257:211859:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bottom-up (asset-level) perspective.  In a bottom-up approach, not only conditional
104:3258:211942:18:18:91:520:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variances but also conditionalcorrelationsamong individual returns are of central
104:3259:212023:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:importance  as  they  obviously  impact  portfolio  (i.e.,  market)  volatility.   Hence  the
104:3260:212116:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fundamental  determinants  of  conditional  correlations  have  also  recently  begun  to
104:3261:212205:18:39:91:341:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:receive attention, as in Engle and Rangel (2011).

104:3263:212270:25:18:91:519:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The links between volatility and fundamentals that we have discussed thus far do not

105:3269:212774:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enormous and distinguished literature that is treated extensively elsewhere in this
105:3270:212857:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volume.  Hence we provide here only brief glimpses of aspects of the linksμr↔σr,

105:3272:213003:18:18:109:519:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, consider the equity premium and return-volatility relationship,μr↔σr.
105:3273:213079:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Stimulated by the pioneering work of Markowitz (1959), an enormous amount of asset
105:3274:213161:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pricing research has focused on quantifying various aspects of this financial market
105:3275:213245:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“risk-return tradeoff.” Financial econometric research has followed suit, as exempli-
105:3276:213330:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fied by the GARCH-M model of Engle et al. (1987), defined by equations (7) and (8)
105:3277:213412:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:above withμt=x′tβ+δσt.  In this model the conditional standard deviation enters
105:3278:213491:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly as an explanatory variable for the conditional mean – together with other
105:3279:213573:18:17:91:519:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possible explanatory variablesxt– thus providing an econometric approximation to
105:3280:213653:17:18:91:249:434:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:a time-varying risk premium.89
105:3281:213683:18:18:109:520:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although intuitively appealing, a number of subtleties have emerged in both the-
105:3282:213763:18:18:91:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ory and empirics.  Modern general equilibrium theory reveals that, in principle, pos-
105:3283:213848:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:itive contemporaneous risk-return correlation is not guaranteed, as subtle dynamic
105:3284:213930:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interactions may be operative;  see,  e.g.,  Abel (1988),  Backus and Gregory (1993),
105:3285:214015:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Whitelaw (2000), and Bollerslev et al. (2011a) among others.  In parallel, a wealth
105:3286:214098:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of recent empirical work reveals that, in practice, the contemporaneous risk-return
105:3287:214181:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlation is often found to benegative; see, e.g., Bollerslev et al. (2006), Lettau and

105:3289:214350:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:realize  that  we  know  less  than  we  thought  about  the  most-researched  connection,
105:3290:214440:18:18:91:136:254:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:μr↔σr.

106:3307:215759:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gest that expected growth is indeed a central determinant of expected excess returns,

106:3309:215928:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across numerous competing specifications, including ones involving the “standard”

106:3312:216118:18:18:91:519:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a position to consider the final link,  which also involves fundamental volatility,

106:3314:216284:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expectations,  but  also  fundamental  volatilities  in  the  determination  of  the  equity
106:3315:216376:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:premium.  An obvious example is the “long-run risk” model by Bansal and Yaron
106:3316:216453:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2004), and its extension explicitly incorporating time-varying economic uncertainty

107:3325:217071:26:18:91:519:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In our discussion of the the links between market risk and macro fundamentals we
107:3326:217151:18:18:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have sometimes been casual in distinguishing returns from excess returns, realized
107:3327:217233:18:18:91:519:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from expected returns, realized from expected volatility, and related, in our treatment
107:3328:217320:18:18:91:519:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of timing.  This is to some extent unavoidable, reflecting different conventions both
107:3329:217405:18:18:91:519:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within and among different and evolving literatures, as well as our desire to convey
107:3330:217489:18:18:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wide-ranging  ideas  in  this  broad  survey.   Nevertheless,  a  clearly-emergent  theme
107:3331:217578:18:18:91:520:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that financial markets, as summarized byμrandσr, are very much linked to the
107:3332:217657:18:18:91:520:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business cycle, as summarized byμfandσf.  Indeed it is not an exaggeration to claim
107:3333:217740:18:17:91:520:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:that business cycle risk may be the key driver of expected excess equity returnsand
107:3334:217823:17:18:91:353:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:return volatilities.  Here we expand on that insight.
107:3335:217876:18:18:109:520:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although the business cycle may be a key risk factor, a long tradition, dating at
107:3336:217957:18:18:91:519:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:least to Burns and Mitchell (1946) and actively extending to the present, recognizes
107:3337:218041:18:18:91:519:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that no single observed variable is “the business cycle” or “real activity.” Instead, we
107:3338:218129:18:18:91:519:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observe literally dozens of indicators (employment, industrial production, GDP, per-
107:3339:218213:18:18:91:519:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sonal income, etc.), all of which contain information about the business cycle, which
107:3340:218298:18:18:91:519:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is not directly observable.  Hence the key business cycle real activity fundamental
107:3341:218381:18:18:91:519:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underlying risk may be appropriately and productively viewed as a common factor
107:3342:218460:18:18:91:406:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be extracted from many individual real activity indicators.
107:3343:218522:18:18:109:520:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Expanding on this “factors as fundamentals” perspective, another likely-relevant
107:3344:218602:18:18:91:519:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:additional factor candidate is price/wage pressure, which may of course interact with
107:3345:218687:18:18:91:519:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real activity, as emphasized in Aruoba and Diebold (2010).  In any event, the point is
107:3346:218773:18:18:91:519:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simply that, although we see hundreds of macroeconomic fundamentals, a drastically
107:3347:218855:18:17:91:519:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller set of underlying macroeconomic factors is likely relevant for tracking market
107:3348:218941:17:18:91:519:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk.  This is useful not only for best-practice firm-level risk management, but also
107:3349:219026:18:18:91:519:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for regulators.  In particular, the factors-as-fundamentals perspective has important
107:3350:219111:18:18:91:519:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implications for the design of stress tests that simulate financial market responses to
107:3351:219198:18:18:91:519:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fundamental shocks, suggesting that only a few key fundamentals (factors) need be
107:3352:219279:18:18:91:134:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stressed.
107:3353:219288:18:0:109:520:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Not surprisingly,  then,  we advocate that risk managers pay closer attention to
108:3354:219371:0:18:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:macroeconomic factors, as they are the ultimate drivers of market risk.  We hasten to
108:3355:219456:18:18:91:519:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:add, however, that due to the frequent “disconnect” problems mentioned earlier, we
108:3356:219538:18:18:91:520:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would never advocate conditioning risk assessmentsonlyon macroeconomic factors.
108:3357:219617:18:18:91:519:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Rather,  macroeconomic factors complement,  rather than substitute,  for the meth-
108:3358:219699:18:18:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ods discussed in earlier sections, by broadening the conditioning information set to
108:3359:219783:18:18:91:343:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include fundamentals in addition to past returns.
108:3360:219832:18:18:109:520:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One might reasonably question the usefulness of conditioning on macroeconomic
108:3361:219909:18:18:91:519:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data for daily risk assessment, because macroeconomic data are typically available
108:3362:219991:18:18:91:519:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only quarterly (e.g., GDP and its components), or sometimes monthly (e.g., indus-
108:3363:220072:18:18:91:519:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trial production and the CPI). Recent developments that exploit state space methods
108:3364:220155:18:18:91:519:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and optimal filtering, however, facilitate high-frequency (e.g., daily) monitoring of la-
108:3365:220244:18:18:91:519:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tent macroeconomic fundamental factors.  In particular, based on the high-frequency
108:3366:220327:18:18:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real activity monitoring approach of Aruoba et al. (2009), the Federal Reserve Bank

108:3369:220586:18:18:91:197:416:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:B:released or revised.92
108:3370:220608:18:18:109:520:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We have emphasized macroeconomic fundamentals for equity market risk, but the
108:3371:220685:18:18:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bond market is also closely linked to macroeconomic fundamentals.  In particular,
108:3372:220766:18:18:91:519:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government bond yield curves are driven by just a few factors (level, slope, curvature),
108:3373:220854:18:18:91:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the level factor closely linked to price/wage activity and the slope factor closely
108:3374:220942:18:18:91:519:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:linked to real activity.93The same is true for yield curves of defaultable bonds, except
108:3375:221030:18:18:91:519:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that there is the additional complication of default risk, but that too is linked to the
108:3376:221118:18:18:91:519:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business cycle.  Hence despite data on dozens of government bond yields, and dozens
108:3377:221201:18:18:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of macroeconomic indicators, the interesting reality is their much lower-dimensional
108:3378:221285:18:18:91:519:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“state vectors” – the level and slope factors beneath the yield curve,  and the real
108:3379:221369:18:18:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and price/wage activity factors beneath the macroeconomy.  One can easily imagine
108:3380:221450:18:18:91:519:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the usefulness for daily market and credit risk management (say) of systems linking

109:3388:222007:29:18:91:519:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  have  attempted  to  demonstrate  the  power  and  potential  of  dynamic  financial
109:3389:222095:18:18:91:519:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:econometric methods for practical financial risk measurement and management.  We
109:3390:222175:18:18:91:519:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have surveyed the large literature on high-frequency volatility modeling, interpreting
109:3391:222261:18:18:91:520:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and unifying the most important and intriguing results of practical relevance.94Our
109:3392:222344:18:18:91:519:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussion has many implications for practical financial risk management; some point
109:3393:222428:18:18:91:519:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:toward desirable extensions of existing approaches, and some suggest new directions.
109:3394:222512:18:31:91:190:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Key points include:
109:3395:222531:31:18:106:520:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:1.  Standard  “model-free”  methods,  such  as  historical  simulation,  rely  on  false
109:3396:222619:18:18:121:520:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:assumptions  of  independent  returns.   Reliable  risk  measurement  requires  a
109:3397:222700:18:28:121:451:417:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:A:conditionaldensity model that allows for time-varying volatility.
109:3398:222765:28:18:106:520:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:2.  Successful  risk  measurement  may  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  univariate
109:3399:222852:18:17:121:520:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:density models directly for portfolio returns.  GARCH volatility models offer a
109:3400:222931:17:18:121:520:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:convenient and parsimonious framework for modeling key dynamic features of
109:3401:223005:18:18:121:520:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:such portfolio returns, including volatility mean-reversion, long-memory, and
109:3402:223082:18:28:121:188:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:asymmetries.
109:3403:223094:28:18:106:520:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:3.  Successful risk management, in contrast, requires a fully-specified multivariate
109:3404:223178:18:18:121:520:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:density model.  In that regard,  standard multivariate models are too heavily
109:3405:223255:18:18:121:520:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:parameterized to be useful in realistic medium- and large-scale financial market
109:3406:223335:18:18:121:520:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:contexts.  In medium-scale financial contexts, recently-developed multivariate
109:3407:223413:18:18:121:520:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:GARCH models are likely to be useful.  In very large-scale financial contexts,
109:3408:223491:18:15:101:519:200:7:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f15:F:94We hasten to add that this chapter is a complement, not a substitute, for the more general and
109:3409:223587:15:12:91:519:185:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:technical survey of volatility and covariance forecasting of Andersen et al. (2006a).  In addition,
109:3410:223686:12:12:91:519:173:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:space  constraints  and  other  considerations  have  invariably  limited  our  choice  of  included  topics.
109:3411:223795:12:12:91:519:161:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:For instance, we have largely neglected stochastic volatility and other parameter-driven approaches
109:3412:223894:12:0:91:343:149:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:F:to volatility modeling, as well as option-implied volatility.
110:3413:223958:0:18:121:520:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:more structure must be imposed, such as decoupling variance and correlation
110:3414:224033:18:18:121:520:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:dynamics.  In all cases, resampling methods applied to standardized returns is
110:3415:224111:18:28:121:510:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:an attractive strategy for accommodating conditionally non-normal returns.
110:3416:224185:28:18:106:520:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:4.  Volatility measures based on high-frequency return data hold great promise for
110:3417:224267:18:18:121:520:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:practical risk management, as realized volatility and correlation measures pro-
110:3418:224346:18:18:121:520:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:duce more accurate risk assessments and forecasts than their conventional com-
110:3419:224424:18:18:121:520:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:petitors.  Because high-frequency information is only available for highly liquid
110:3420:224505:18:18:121:520:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:assets, a base-asset factor approach may sometimes be useful.  In addition, the

110:3422:224671:18:18:121:520:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:returns standardized by realized volatility, holds promise for relatively simple-
