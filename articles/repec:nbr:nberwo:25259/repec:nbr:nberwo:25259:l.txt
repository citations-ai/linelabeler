2:26:1197:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  link  USPTO  patent  data  to  U.S.  Census  Bureau  administrative  records  on  individuals  and 
2:27:1300:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:firms. The combined dataset provides us with a directory of patenting household inventors as well 
2:28:1397:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:as a time-series directory of self-employed businesses tied to household innovations. We describe 
2:29:1494:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:the  characteristics of  household  inventors  by  race,  age,  gender  and  U.S.  origin,  as  well  as  the 
2:30:1603:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:types  of  patented  innovations pursued  by  these  inventors.  Business  data  allows  us  to  highlight 
2:31:1709:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:how  patents shape the early life-cycle dynamics of nonemployer businesses.  We find household 
2:32:1803:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:innovators  are  disproportionately  U.S.  born, white  and  their  age  distribution  has  thicker  tails 
2:33:1909:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:relative  to  business  innovators.  Data  shows  there  is a  deficit  of  female  and  black  inventors. 
2:34:2015:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:Household  inventors  tend  to  work  in  consumer  product  areas compared  to  traditional  business 
2:35:2117:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:patents.  While  patented  household  innovations  do  not  have  the  same impact  of  business 
2:36:2213:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:innovations  their  uniqueness  and  impact  remains  surprisingly  high.  Back  of  the envelope 
2:37:2310:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:C:calculations  suggest  patented  household  innovations  granted  between  2000  and  2011  might 
2:38:2407:14:42:72:275:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:generate  $5.0B in revenue (2000 dollars).

3:51:2723:0:36:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:52:2738:36:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The study of innovation has traditionally centered on the institutions where it is believed
3:53:2829:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be conducted, which has primarily consisted of the firm.  The underlying assumption is
3:54:2918:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that innovation is the output from an R&D production function that has the inventor at
3:55:3004:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:its core and where the inputs (materials and human capital) are fully accounted for.  Some
3:56:3094:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the inputs may take the form of knowledge originating outside the firm like universities,
3:57:3186:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government labs and other firms.  In this regard government and universities labs have long
3:58:3277:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been recognized as sources of knowledge and invention.  Other firms may contribute to the
3:59:3366:24:23:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:R&D process through research joint ventures or may license their technologies.  Increasingly
3:60:3458:23:24:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however, researchers are highlighting the importance private households play as sources of
3:61:3548:24:24:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:invention and innovation in this process (e.g.  von Hippel, de Jong, and Flowers (2012) and
3:62:3639:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Arora, Cohen, and Walsh (2016)).  In this paper we aim to contribute to this strand of the
3:63:3729:24:24:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature by using U.S. Census Bureau administrative data combined with USPTO patents
3:64:3815:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data to document household innovations.  The use of administrative data gets around some
3:65:3903:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the problems with current studies in this area, specifically small sample sizes in household
3:66:3998:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:surveys, low power estimates, and low response rates which may raise questions about non-
3:67:4087:24:24:72:226:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response bias (Deming, 1990).
3:68:4116:24:24:93:539:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Use of administrative data provides a rich picture of the types of innovations undertaken
3:69:4205:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by households and their characteristics but it has its own limitations.  We focus on the set
3:70:4297:24:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  household  innovations  we  can  identify  in  administrative  data;  that  is,  those  that  are
3:71:4398:23:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:granted  a  patent  by  the  USPTO.  Admittedly  this  excludes  perhaps  what  might  be  the
3:72:4492:24:24:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lion  share  of  household  innovation;  that  which  is  not  patented.   By  contrast  we  focus  on
3:73:4594:24:24:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what  might  be  the  most  valuable  innovations  (Arora,  Cohen,  and  Walsh,  2016)  and  we
3:74:4689:24:24:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do so in a systematic manner.  We match these patents to Census Bureau administrative
3:75:4774:24:24:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:files  to  understand  the  demographic  characteristics  of  household  inventors  as  well  as  the
3:76:4875:24:0:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics of the unincorporated businesses they start to get a sense for their impact and
4:77:4970:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value.1Use of administrative records comes with other important limitations.  Specifically,
4:78:5061:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is no way for us to determine whether these patents where developed during leisure
4:79:5149:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time or as a remunerated activity.  Here we make the strong assumption that if they have
4:80:5237:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not  been  assigned  to  a  firm  there  was  no  direct  remuneration  for  the  development  of  the
4:81:5339:24:24:72:129:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation.
4:82:5350:24:24:93:539:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When documenting the characteristics of household innovations we describe the technol-
4:83:5436:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ogy classes they fall under, their impact and novelty as captured by the analysis of backward
4:84:5529:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and forward looking citations, and the breadth of their application as captured by a gener-
4:85:5620:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ality index.  In addition we document the characteristics of inventors, their age, gender, race
4:86:5715:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and origin.  When looking at business formation we examine the dynamics of unincorporated
4:87:5804:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:businesses  that  are  tied  to  inventors  and  their  performance  relative  to  similar  businesses
4:88:5906:23:24:72:424:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without inventors specifically their revenue and growth performance.
4:89:5974:24:24:93:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find household inventors are disproportionately U.S. born relative to salaried inven-
4:90:6062:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tors.  They are relatively white.  Household inventors are disproportionately under 25 and
4:91:6152:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over  55.   Across  the  board  we  find  a  deficit  in  female  and  black  inventors  relative  to  the
4:92:6258:24:24:72:233:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overall working age population.
4:93:6289:24:24:93:539:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Household  inventors  work  on  technology  classes  disproportionately  tied  to  consumer
4:94:6380:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:products such as Design, Mechanical and Other.  Patents associated with household inno-
4:95:6467:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vation  are  about  1/2  as  likely  to  be  considered  “radical”.2In  terms  of  value,  household
4:96:6567:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovations accumulate approximately 27-33% fewer citations on average.  While their cita-
4:97:6657:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion impact is smaller it remains remarkably high.  Finally, we find few household inventors
4:98:6749:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attempt to create a business around their invention.  When they do these businesses have
4:99:6837:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher revenues on average and are more than twice as likely to transition to hire their first
4:100:6931:24:36:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employee than nonemployers who do not patent.  Back of the envelope calculations suggest
4:101:7019:36:16:85:539:122:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1Patents by independent inventors have been found to display the largest rates of transfer (Serrano, 2010)
4:102:7125:16:8:72:492:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:so in future drafts we will explore the characteristics of patents that transition to existing firms.
4:103:7226:8:16:85:539:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2We follow the definition in (Dahlin and Behrens, 2005), a radical innovation is one that is considered
4:104:7329:16:46:72:196:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:novel, unique and impactful.

5:106:7358:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patented  household  innovations  granted  in  a  given  year  might  generate  revenue  $5.0B  in
5:107:7456:24:24:72:193:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:revenue in 2000 dollars.
5:108:7480:24:24:93:539:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 provides background.  We
5:109:7568:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:follow with a description of the data in section 3.  We describe basic features of patented
5:110:7659:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household inventions in section 4.  Our analysis of business formation and outcomes follows
5:111:7750:24:54:72:269:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in section 5.  We conclude in section 6.
5:112:7790:54:36:72:202:534:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:2  Background
5:113:7803:36:24:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Innovation is traditionally thought of as a process that takes place inside of a firm.  In this
5:114:7898:24:24:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:context, outside sources of knowledge and invention including universities, government labs
5:115:7989:24:24:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and other firms have long been recognized as important inputs to the firm’s R&D function.
5:116:8078:24:24:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Increasingly however innovation researchers are focusing on households as important sources
5:117:8169:24:24:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of knowledge and innovation. The study of household innovation however has been hampered
5:118:8257:24:23:72:173:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by data availability.
5:119:8278:23:24:93:539:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first set of household innovation studies looked at user innovations in specific prod-
5:120:8368:24:24:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uct  markets.   Early  examples  include  von  Hippel  (1976)  and  Shah  (2000)  looking  at  user
5:121:8467:24:24:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation in scientific instruments and new sporting goods respectively.  Their methodology
5:122:8559:24:24:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:involves a retrospective study of a selected sample of commercially successful innovations as
5:123:8652:24:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identified by either experts in the field or by direct analysis of new product features.  This
5:124:8746:24:24:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was  followed  by  interviews  of  relevant  product  and  industry  experts.   Both  these  authors
5:125:8846:24:24:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find a large percentage of the innovations were in fact invented, prototyped and tested by
5:126:8936:24:24:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:users of the equipment rather  than the equipment manufacturer.  In the case of scientific
5:127:9026:24:24:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instruments, von Hippel (1976) finds existing instrument manufacturers would incorporate
5:128:9114:24:24:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:user innovations into their products with a focus on improved engineering.  In the case of
5:129:9204:24:0:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sporting goods Shah (2000) finds users built innovative equipment for their own use.  The
6:130:9294:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventors  tended  to  be  young  and  they  often  built  businesses  in  order  to  appropriate  the
6:131:9396:24:24:72:232:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:benefits from their innovations.
6:132:9428:24:24:93:539:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Follow-up studies have tried to more broadly describe the characteristics of the innova-
6:133:9516:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tors and rate of user innovation.  L ̈uthje (2004) conducts a survey of users of outdoor sporting
6:134:9613:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equipment identified from the direct mail order listing of two sporting goods manufacturing
6:135:9704:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms.   While  response  rates  are  relatively  low  at  26%,  the  author  finds  a  large  share  of
6:136:9808:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondents,  37%,  claimed at least one idea.  Of these 30% claimed their idea provided a
6:137:9898:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:solution to a problem that was not offered by the manufacturer.  Reportedly, only 4 in 10
6:138:9987:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:took  their  ideas  beyond  concept  by  developing  prototypes.   Franke  and  Shah  (2003)  look
6:139:10085:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at innovation within four distinct communities of extreme sports enthusiasts.  Communities
6:140:10175:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of consumer users were identified through websites or competition rosters.  With a survey
6:141:10264:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response rate of 38% the authors find 32% of community members claimed an innovation
6:142:10348:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and of these 14.5% considered the innovation to be a completely new product.  In their sam-
6:143:10439:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ple, 23% of innovators believed their innovations had been or would be commercialized by
6:144:10527:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a third party.  These innovators did not appear to benefit financially from their innovations.
6:145:10621:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Whether results from these and other surveys of lead users and enthusiasts are representative
6:146:10714:24:24:72:359:325:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of broader user communities remains an open question.3
6:147:10768:24:24:93:539:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:von Hippel, de Jong, and Flowers (2012) take a broader approach to this question by
6:148:10851:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conducting a household survey to look at inventions by a representative sample of consumers
6:149:10942:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the U.K. These are innovations tied to households and their unincorporated businesses.
6:150:11031:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically they look at the development and modification of consumer products by product
6:151:11121:24:23:71:539:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:users.   The  types  of  household  innovations  they  focus  on  exclude  on-the-job  innovations
6:152:11219:23:24:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which are already accounted for in official statistics.  Instead they focus on innovations that
6:153:11314:24:24:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were  developed  during  uncompensated  leisure  time.   With  a  survey  response  rate  of  15%
6:154:11411:24:36:71:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they find 6.2% of U.K. consumers engaged in consumer product innovation in the previous 3
6:155:11500:36:0:85:409:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:3A good survey of consumer user studies can be found in de Jong (2016).
7:156:11572:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years.  When comparing against the amount of R&D investment by U.K. firms they estimate
7:157:11659:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the volume of household based expenditure exceeded that of firms by a factor of 2.3 times.4
7:158:11750:24:24:72:412:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They conclude private households are a major source of invention.
7:159:11815:24:24:93:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In a survey centered on consumer product innovations von Hippel, de Jong, and Flowers
7:160:11900:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2012) find 98% of innovations are product modifications rather than new product creations.
7:161:11991:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Most of the innovations, 80%, are in a few product classes that are related with how people
7:162:12082:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spend their time:  craft and tools, sports and hobbies, gardening as well as child, dwelling
7:163:12174:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or pet related.  Only 17% of the innovations are believed to be adopted by others to some
7:164:12263:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:degree and only 2% of the innovations are protected by intellectual property rights.  There
7:165:12354:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are relatively few software innovations.  von Hippel, de Jong, and Flowers (2012) are the only
7:166:12448:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study collecting demographic information from a representative consumer sample rather than
7:167:12538:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a community of interest.  They find inventors tend to be male, educated, and either a student
7:168:12631:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or age over 55.  Issues with this and other representative consumer surveys that have followed
7:169:12725:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include high non-response rates, small sample sizes, and confusion regarding the definition
7:170:12816:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of innovation by consumers.  With these limitations a general conclusion is the apparent low
7:171:12908:24:24:72:299:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adoption rates of innovations by enterprises.
7:172:12953:24:24:93:539:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Following  a  different  approach  Arora,  Cohen,  and  Walsh  (2016)  conduct  a  survey  of
7:173:13046:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturing firms to examine the extent to which firms in the U.S. use external sources
7:174:13135:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  invention  for  their  innovations.   Arora,  Cohen,  and  Walsh  (2016)  focus  on  the  whole
7:175:13234:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturing sector regardless of industry or whether firms own patents or conduct R&D.
7:176:13322:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Their sample is drawn from the Dun & Bradstreet business frame but adjusted with U.S.
7:177:13407:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Census Bureau based weights to match the population of manufacturing firms by industry,
7:178:13494:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:size  and  age.   For  the  analysis  they  focus  on  product  innovations  (and  exclude  process
7:179:13593:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovations) at firms with more than 10 employees.  With response rates of 30.3% they find
7:180:13683:24:37:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that of the 16% of firms that innovated (introduced a product that is new to the market),
7:181:13772:37:15:85:539:97:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4von Hippel, de Jong, and Flowers (2012) find the average customer invention requires an expenditure of
7:182:13875:15:46:72:154:82:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f6:F:£101 and 4.8 days.

8:184:13894:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:49% report their most important new product originated from outside.  They find customers
8:185:13983:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  the  most  pervasive  source  of  invention  although  not  the  source  of  the  most  valuable
8:186:14084:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ones.  The more valuable inventions are sourced from technology specialists which include
8:187:14173:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independent inventors.  These inventors patent their own inventions at relatively high rates,
8:188:14266:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:56%, higher than university, supplier and customer sourced inventions at 36%, 34% and 16%
8:189:14355:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respectively.  They find independent inventors are also a more common source of inventions
8:190:14445:24:54:72:149:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for small firms.

8:192:14468:36:24:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We focus our analysis on patented household innovations.  Our primary source of patent data
8:193:14559:24:24:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office PTMT Custom Patent Data Extract.  These data
8:194:14643:24:24:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are produced annually from the bibliographic text (i.e., front page) of the patent documents.
8:195:14736:24:24:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It covers all granted patents by the USPTO and detailed information including the patent
8:196:14824:24:23:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number, type of patent, filing date, issue date, inventor information, assignee name at time
8:197:14916:23:24:72:315:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of issue, and classification information for each.
8:198:14966:24:24:93:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use the patent class information to impose some initial restrictions on the patents we
8:199:15055:24:24:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyze.  Depending on the patent documents, patents can be assigned to firms, individuals
8:200:15145:24:24:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or governments.  These can each be either domestic or foreign.  In addition the patents can
8:201:15236:24:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be unassigned.  This happens when the inventors have not granted the rights to the invention
8:202:15328:24:24:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a corporation, university or government agency, or to other individuals.  In these cases the
8:203:15423:24:24:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents are assumed to remain with the inventor, but in some cases can later be reassigned to
8:204:15516:24:24:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms.  We exclude from the set of patents we analyze those that belong to governments and
8:205:15606:24:24:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all foreign patents.  We assume these are not tied to independent U.S. based inventors.  Table
8:206:15700:24:24:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 looks at the number of patents by assignee type in our sample.  We center our analysis on
8:207:15791:24:23:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents granted between 2000 and 2011.  Our sample includes a total of 1.29 million patents
8:208:15882:23:0:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:granted between 2000 and 2011.  The bulk of these, 80%, are assigned to businesses.  Most
9:209:15972:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the remaining patents, 19.2%, are unassigned.  There are very few patents, 0.8%, assigned
9:210:16064:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to individuals.  While unassigned patents are assumed to belong to the inventor it will be
9:211:16154:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  case  that  some  of  these  belong  to  firms  but  were  not  assigned  at  time  of  grant.   We
9:212:16258:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explore the extent of this problem by reviewing patents with large team sizes of inventors
9:213:16348:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to get a sense for the amount of noise in the data.  Our assumption is that the average firm
9:214:16440:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patent will be developed by larger teams of inventors.  The results can be seen in Figure 1.
9:215:16532:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The team size distributions for unassigned and individual assigned patents are fairly similar
9:216:16625:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and well to the left of firm assigned patents.  Unassigned patents have the larger share of
9:217:16716:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:single inventor patents (nearly 80% of unassigned patents have a single inventor).  Looking
9:218:16807:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the right tale of the distribution, we find that fewer than 1% of unassigned and individual
9:219:16901:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assigned patents have inventor team sizes of 5 or more, compared to the nearly 7% of firm
9:220:16990:23:24:72:159:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assigned patents.
9:221:17007:24:24:93:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Firm  assigned  patents  present  a  challenge  to  us.   The  patent  data  does  not  include
9:222:17102:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm identifiers or flags that might help us distinguish patents assigned to employers from
9:223:17193:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those  assigned  to  nonemployer  businesses.   It  is  not  unreasonable  to  think  however  that
9:224:17292:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independent inventors might assign their patents to their own unincorporated nonemployer
9:225:17380:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business.  However, we do not want to exclude these inventors from our analysis since their
9:226:17471:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents  might  be  particularly  valuable.   We  rely  on  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  longitudinal
9:227:17570:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patent-business database (BDS-IF) to identify and exclude from our analysis patents assigned
9:228:17662:24:24:72:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to employer businesses while keeping those assigned to nonemployer businesses.5We identify
9:229:17752:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents assigned to nonemployer firms by matching all patents to the U.S. Census Bureau’s
9:230:17841:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Business Register of nonemployer firms.6A large percentage of patents, nearly 80%, match
9:231:17929:23:36:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  employer  universe  files.   The  employer  matches  tend  to  be  based  on  the  assignee
9:232:18029:36:16:85:539:146:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5The BDS-IF identifies patents assigned to employer businesses while keeping those assigned to nonem-
9:233:18130:16:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ployer businesses.  See Graham, Grim, Islam, Marco, and Miranda (2018) for details of the matching method-
9:234:18236:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ology. Briefly, it uses both the assignee and inventor information to form a match. The use of two independent
9:235:18346:12:8:72:498:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:pieces of information to identify the assignee firm provides a high level of reliability in the match.
9:236:18448:8:16:85:539:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:6All businesses that file an income tax form to the IRS authorities and have no associated payroll tax form
9:237:18555:16:0:72:540:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are included in the nonemployer Business Register.  See Appendix A for details of the matching methodology.
10:238:18663:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:name and address, while the nonemployer matches mostly occur through the inventor.  We
10:239:18749:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remove the known employer matches from Graham, Grim, Islam, Marco, and Miranda (2018)
10:240:18834:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from our universe of matches, leaving us with approximately 200,000 raw nonemployer firm
10:241:18922:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matches.  Our set of initial matches require further refining.  A high quality firm-inventor
10:242:19014:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:match does not guarantee the inventor is matched to its firm.  Think of an inventor named
10:243:19103:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:David Smith in D.C. and a company named David Smith located also in D.C. First, there
10:244:19188:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are possibly many unincorporated entities named David Smith so the match might not be
10:245:19273:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unique.  Even if the match is unique we do not know whether the owner is the inventor (i.e.
10:246:19364:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are many David Smiths).  We retain only cases where the social security number of the
10:247:19455:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventor and the social security number in the nonemployer firm record line up.7This filtering
10:248:19549:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process leaves us with a total set of approximately 125,000 patents.  We remove an additional
10:249:19642:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:55,000 patents by only keeping the unduplicated matches.8Finally,  we drop patents that
10:250:19729:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are associated with nonemployers that have an unusually large number of patents assigned
10:251:19817:24:24:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to them.9This leaves us with a total of 68,000 patents associated to nonemployer businesses
10:252:19908:24:24:72:406:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we are confident belong to the inventors behind the patents.
10:253:19973:24:24:93:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 shows the percentage of patents matched to employer businesses (E) and nonem-
10:254:20058:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployer business (NE) by assignee type and year.  Patents that remain unmatched (U) are
10:255:20144:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not associated with business activity as captured by the Business Register.  To be clear,the
10:256:20236:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set of unmatched patents might include some that were matched to a Census dataset but
10:257:20321:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where  the  match  either  could  not  be  uniquely  resolved  to  an  inventor  or  assignee  or  was
10:258:20423:24:35:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not linked through the PVS process.10Table 2 highlights a clear separation in the match
10:259:20510:35:16:85:539:194:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7This comparison is done indirectly.  The Census Bureau strips personally identifiable information from
10:260:20613:16:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:all of its internal files to protect the confidentiality of records.  Specifically the Census Bureau replaces and
10:261:20726:12:12:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:individual’s name, address (and SSN if present) with a Protected Identification Key (PIK) using the PVS
10:262:20829:12:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:system (Wagner and Layne, 2014).  Each name-address pairing has a unique PIK in the system.  The Census
10:263:20932:12:8:72:440:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Bureau assigned a PIK to the patent data using the name and location information.
10:264:21013:8:16:85:539:134:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:8The PVS system does not guarantee an inventor in the USPTO database will receive a unique person
10:265:21110:16:8:72:519:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:identifier.  In cases where the identifying information is not unique enough multiple PIKs are assigned.
10:266:21214:8:12:85:360:110:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:9These might be holding entities with no associated employers.
10:267:21276:12:0:81:500:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:10See Appendix A for details of the match and Table A8 for a breakdown of unmatched patents
11:268:21368:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates by assignee type, with the vast majority of firm-assigned patents linked to employer
11:269:21458:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms.  By contrast individual-assigned patents have much lower match rates.  Only about
11:270:21546:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:50% of patents are associated with some form of business activity with most of it tied to
11:271:21635:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer  firms.   Only  30.4%  of  unassigned  patents  are  tied  to  some  form  of  business
11:272:21734:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:activity.  We have no links to employer businesses since there is no available firm assignee
11:273:21826:24:54:72:375:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information in the patent document for these patent types.
11:274:21884:54:36:72:531:534:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:4  Characteristics of Patented Household Innovations
11:275:21936:36:24:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we describe the characteristics of patents and inventors associated with what
11:276:22030:24:24:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we call patented household innovations which include patents that are either unassigned or
11:277:22120:24:24:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are assigned to individuals.  We contrast those with patents assigned to firms.  We start by
11:278:22212:24:24:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:describing differences in the demographic composition of the inventors associated with the
11:279:22302:24:46:72:422:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents, before delving into the characteristics of the actual patents.
11:280:22373:46:32:72:273:356:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.1  Inventor Demographics
11:281:22399:32:24:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To highlight potential differences in demographic characteristics of inventors associated with
11:282:22493:24:24:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household  innovations  we  link  demographic  information  from  administrative  U.S.  Census
11:283:22587:24:23:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Bureau files to the inventors in the patent records.  They provide basic demographic infor-
11:284:22678:23:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mation including gender,  race,  country of origin and birth date for all people in the U.S.
11:285:22770:24:24:72:226:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a social security number.
11:286:22800:24:24:93:539:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Information from the demographic files is linked by use of a Protected Identification Key
11:287:22889:24:24:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(PIK) available on both sets.  We are not able to uniquely identify all inventors in the patent
11:288:22984:24:24:72:539:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:documents in our files due to limitations of the data.11There are 1.48M inventors associated
11:289:23076:24:36:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  the  1.29M  patents  that  form  our  analysis.   We  are  able  to  obtain  demographics  for
11:290:23176:36:15:81:539:97:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:11The identification would be greatly facilitated if the USPTO were able to collect either a birth date or
11:291:23282:15:46:72:125:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:a SSN/TIN.
11:292:23292:46:0:303:309:36:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:9
12:293:23293:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventors on 856,000 of the 1.29M patents.12Overall we find inventors tied to firm assignees
12:294:23385:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  more  likely  to  be  uniquely  identified  than  individual  assignees  or  unassigned  patents.
12:295:23487:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We also find that patents unmatched to demographic data are mostly concentrated in the
12:296:23573:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sectors  of  ”Design”  and  ”Plants”.   Details  of  the  matching  procedures  are  results  can  be
12:297:23674:24:24:72:184:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:found in Appendix B.
12:298:23694:24:24:93:539:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 shows demographic information for the set of inventors we were able to identify
12:299:23781:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by assignee type and type of economic activity.  There are some notable differences in the
12:300:23871:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demographic composition of the patent types but also some similarities.  The first thing to
12:301:23962:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:notice is that the vast majority of patents are filed by males.  This is true across all assignee
12:302:24059:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types  and  is  consistent  over  time.13Innovation  activity  whether  household  or  firm  based
12:303:24157:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  a  male  dominated  activity.   This  is  consistent  with  Bell,  Chetty,  Jaravel,  Petkova,  and
12:304:24260:23:24:72:415:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Van Reenen (2016), who find a similar deficit in female innovators.
12:305:24327:24:24:93:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Firm-based patents disproportionately favor foreign-born inventors relative to individual-
12:306:24417:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assigned patents and unassigned patents, with approximately 1/3 of inventors affiliated with
12:307:24509:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm-assigned patents being foreign born, compared to 20% for other assignee types.  Given
12:308:24599:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this it is perhaps not too surprising that firm-assigned patents are less likely to be associated
12:309:24696:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with black or white inventors and nearly twice as likely to be associated with “other” races
12:310:24788:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to individual-assigned and unassigned patents.  The share of foreign born inventors
12:311:24880:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outweighs their relative share in the labor force at 16.7% of the total in 2015.14We find there
12:312:24975:24:24:71:520:253:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:is a deficit of black inventors across the board again consistent with Bell et al. (2016).15
12:313:25067:24:24:93:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, individual-assigned and unassigned patents disproportionately favor both older
12:314:25154:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(over 55) and younger inventors (less than 25).  Nearly 1/3 of the household inventors are
12:315:25244:23:36:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:55 years and older, compared to the 20% found in firm-assigned patents.  This is consistent
12:316:25335:36:16:81:539:146:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:12We are able to identify demographics from 884,000 patents, but 28,000 of the patents are later classified
12:317:25442:16:8:72:294:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:as reassigned, which are dropped from our analysis

12:319:25524:12:12:81:485:110:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:14Shares of foreign born in the labor force are reported in Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016).
12:320:25618:12:16:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:15Blacks and whites made a 12% and 79% respectively of the labor force population in 2015 (Bureau of
12:321:25718:16:0:72:174:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Labor Statistics, 2016).
13:322:25744:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with von Hippel, de Jong, and Flowers (2012) who find household innovations are dispro-
13:323:25831:24:24:72:311:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portionately tied to students and men over 55.
13:324:25877:24:24:93:539:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To summarize our findings,  household innovators (associated with individual assigned
13:325:25962:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  unassigned  patents)  are  more  likely  to  be  US  born,  white,  less  than  25  and  over  55
13:326:26064:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than firm based innovators.  In the case of the latter, the proportion of household innovators
13:327:26158:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:above the age of 55 is more than 12 percentage points higher (31.6 versus 18.8).  Across the
13:328:26250:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:board we find a deficit of female and black inventors relative to the population of employed
13:329:26342:24:46:72:368:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers and over representation of foreign born inventors.

13:331:26421:32:24:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We next focus on the types of technology classes associated with household innovations.  Pre-
13:332:26514:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vious research has focused on consumer product innovations and found innovations tended
13:333:26601:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be focused in a few product classes.  Here we focus on the broader set of patented in-
13:334:26690:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:novations.  We look at the technology composition by assignee-type.  We also look at those
13:335:26780:23:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that lead to direct business activity and those that do not.  For our classification, we use the
13:336:26876:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:primary USPC code assigned to each patent and group them into eight broad classes con-
13:337:26962:24:24:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sisting of:  Chemicals, Computers and Communication (C&C), Design, Drugs and Medicine
13:338:27047:24:24:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(D&M), Electrical and Electronics (E&E), Mechanical, Plant Patents and Other. The group-
13:339:27135:24:24:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing by USPC class is based on Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001) and expanded to include
13:340:27224:24:24:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new patent classes as detailed in Dreisigmeyer, Graham, Grim, Islam, Marco, and Miranda
13:341:27311:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2014).  Table 4 shows the breakdown by assignee type.  We find firm assigned patents are
13:342:27400:24:24:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disproportionately  in  Chemical,  C&C  and  E&E  relative  to  individual  assignee  and  unas-
13:343:27496:24:24:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:signed  patents.   By  contrast  they  are  underrepresented  in  Design,  Mechanical  and  Other.
13:344:27594:24:24:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table A12 in Appendix C provides a listing of technology subcategories associated with each
13:345:27685:24:23:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:broad class.  Amongst the technologies included in Mechanical and Others are Motors, En-
13:346:27773:23:24:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gines & Parts, Transportation and Miscellaneous such as hardware and tools.  Others include
13:347:27864:24:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Amusement Devices, Apparel & Textile, and Furniture & House Fixtures and miscellaneous
14:348:27952:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as Robots and Aquatic Devices.  All fairly typical consumer products.  Design patents
14:349:28042:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provide protection to ornamental designs embodied in or applied to an article of manufac-
14:350:28131:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ture.  Analysis of the top 50 companies having been granted design patents shows that these
14:351:28222:24:24:72:473:636:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:are dominated by technology, automotive, and consumer product companies.16
14:352:28296:24:24:93:539:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 breaks down the previous table by business activity.  The patterns here repli-
14:353:28382:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cate the findings discussed regardless of business type.  A few things stand out.  First, the
14:354:28475:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:majority of Design patents are not associated with business activity and remain unmatched.
14:355:28565:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is true for both individual assigned and unassigned patents and suggests fundamental
14:356:28654:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differences  perhaps  in  the  value  of  design  patents  vis-a-vis  utility  patents  and  maybe  the
14:357:28757:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:requirements for grant.  Second, patents with a firm assignee in the Drugs & Medical class
14:358:28847:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are harder to match to business databases perhaps due to the complex structure of firms
14:359:28934:23:24:72:159:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developing them.
14:360:28950:24:24:93:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We combine our technology classes with the individual demographics to identify compo-
14:361:29035:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sitional differences between employer patents and household innovations.  Table 6 takes the
14:362:29126:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference in the proportion of patents by technology class and demographic characteristic
14:363:29216:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between nonemployer patents and employer patents.  The table highlights several key differ-
14:364:29307:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ences, most of which are significant.  Design patents clearly differentiate themselves in terms
14:365:29402:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of demographics.  The previous sections have alluded to the fact that nonemployer patents
14:366:29491:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are disproportionately male, U.S. born, white and older than employer patents.  However,
14:367:29579:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this does not seem to be the case for Design patents, where the opposite holds.  It appears
14:368:29670:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:design patents in employer businesses are disproportionally associated with white, male, U.S.
14:369:29763:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:born  inventors  where they  might hold  a  relative  advantage  signaling to  the  very  different
14:370:29862:23:36:72:237:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nature of these types of patents.

15:372:29975:0:32:72:181:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.3  Team Size
15:373:29989:32:24:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Evidence from surveys and product studies suggest the complexity and knowledge embodied
15:374:30076:24:24:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  household  innovations  might  not  run  very  deep.   A  typical  story  might  be  that  of  a
15:375:30176:24:24:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumer that modifies the face of a clock to teach their kids how to tell time.17Consistent
15:376:30268:24:24:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  this  survey  data  also  shows  that  the  average  expenditure  in  developing  a  household
15:377:30368:24:24:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation is not very high.  In this section we explore whether this is also true of patented
15:378:30462:24:24:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household  innovations.   We  follow  Jones  (2009)  and  use  team  size  as  a  measure  of  the
15:379:30560:24:23:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complexity and depth of knowledge associated with a particular innovation.  The burden of
15:380:30649:23:24:72:516:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:knowledge hypothesis would indicate household innovations require smaller team sizes.
15:381:30734:24:24:93:539:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure  1  plots  the  distribution  of  team  sizes  by  assignee  types  and  shows  that  firm-
15:382:30832:24:24:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assigned patents tend to be significantly larger on average.  The size distribution for individ-
15:383:30928:24:24:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ual assignee and unassigned patents is fairly similar and rests well to the left of firm assigned
15:384:31025:24:24:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents.   A  large  share  of  individual-assigned  and  unassigned  patents  are  developed  by  a
15:385:31125:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:single inventor relative to patents assigned to firms.  There are single inventors on 60.7% of
15:386:31219:24:24:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual-assigned patents and 83.5% of unassigned patents versus 30.8% on firm-assigned
15:387:31308:24:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents.  Table 7 tabulates the mean team size by assignee type, technology class and type
15:388:31398:24:24:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of business and finds similar results across them.  Team sizes for patents matched to nonem-
15:389:31490:24:24:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployer business tend to be significantly smaller on average than patents matched to employer
15:390:31582:24:23:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms, having on average nearly one less team member.  Patents with no associated business
15:391:31672:23:24:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:activity have the smallest team size on average.  Consistent with Jones (2009) and Kim and
15:392:31762:24:24:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Marschke (2015) Drugs and Medicines and Chemicals tend to be composed of the largest
15:393:31846:24:36:72:415:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventor teams, while Design patents consist of the smallest teams.

16:397:31992:32:24:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Household survey data indicates the impact and quality of household innovations might not
16:398:32081:24:24:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be very high.  Survey respondents often indicate they do not expect their inventions to be
16:399:32171:24:24:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adopted.  In this section we explore whether this extends to patented household innovations.
16:400:32263:24:24:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  this  section  we  follow  the  literature  and  use  citation  counts  as  a  noisy  measure  of  the
16:401:32369:24:24:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality of a patent and their technological impact.  We then use a new measure of impact
16:402:32457:24:24:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  takes  account  of  the  structure  of  forward  and  backward  looking  citations  to  identify
16:403:32559:24:23:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:radical patents.  Finally we examine whether these innovations are general purpose or instead
16:404:32652:23:24:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:narrow in application.  We ignore truncation issues in the analysis assuming similar impacts
16:405:32744:24:41:72:192:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across types of patents.
16:406:32768:41:32:72:167:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.4.1  Citations
16:407:32784:32:24:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For our citation measures we use the latest citation count (as of December 2015) collected
16:408:32874:24:23:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from PatentsView and link them to our dataset.  Figure 2 shows the distribution of citation
16:409:32965:23:24:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:counts by assignee type. Table 8 reports the means by assignee type, business type and broad
16:410:33057:24:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:technology class.  On average, individual-assigned patents have a lower mean citation count
16:411:33148:24:24:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than firm-assigned patents.  The mean citation for firm-assigned patents is 16.4, while the
16:412:33239:24:24:72:539:293:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:mean citation count for individual-assigned patents is 11.3 and 10.2 for unassigned patents.18
16:413:33333:24:24:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  difference  in  average  citation  counts  is  driven  in  part  by  an  across  the  board  lower
16:414:33436:24:24:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:citation count across technology classes.  However, some of the largest differences in mean
16:415:33527:24:24:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:citation counts can be found in the Design, Mechanical and Others categories precisely the
16:416:33617:24:24:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:areas  where  household  innovations  are  concentrated  so  composition  effects  contributes  to
16:417:33715:24:24:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the overall difference.  More interestingly perhaps is the finding that household innovations
16:418:33808:24:35:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are quite heavily cited on average and in some areas such as Computers & Communications
16:419:33895:35:16:81:539:114:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:18Approximately 160,000 patents out of the 1.29M have zero citations.  The proportion of patents with
16:420:33996:16:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:zero  citations  by  matched  data  and  assignee  type  is  approximately  equivalent  to  the  proportion  of  total
16:421:34114:12:50:72:263:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:patents by matched data and assignee type.

17:423:34158:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Electrical & Electronic the difference is not very large.  Looking at the citations across
17:424:34252:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:type of business activity we find patents have a mean citation count of 16.4, 13.4, and 11.4
17:425:34344:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respectively for patents associated with employer businesses, nonemployer businesses and no
17:426:34435:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business activity.  Again, these differences appear to be driven by composition effects as well
17:427:34530:24:24:72:432:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as generally lower citation counts within particular technology classes.
17:428:34602:24:24:93:539:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To examine differences in citation counts after controlling for technology composition we
17:429:34691:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:run a Poisson regression on citations looking at the impact of business type after controlling
17:430:34785:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for patent class (main USPC code) and grant year.  The results are found in Table 9.  Column
17:431:34877:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1) looks at citation impact by business type and Column (2) by assignee type.  Focusing on
17:432:34968:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Column (1) we see the difference in the logs of expected citations is 0.288 units higher for
17:433:35060:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents matched to employer firms and 0.06 units higher for patents matched to nonemployer
17:434:35150:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms relative to unmatched patents, holding everything else constant.  This is equivalent to
17:435:35243:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  citation  count  that  is  33.4%  higher  for  employer-matched  patents  and  6.2%  higher  for
17:436:35342:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer-matched  patents,  for  a  difference  of  27%  in  citations  between  employer  and
17:437:35439:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer patents.  Looking at the differences in citations by assignee type, Column (2)
17:438:35529:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we find a similar difference between firm assigned patents and individual assigned patents.
17:439:35620:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The coefficient values give a difference in the logs of expected citations to be 0.096 units higher

17:444:36008:32:24:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Households  innovators  will  be  relatively  resource  constrained  compared  to  firms.   These
17:445:36105:24:24:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovators might choose to focus on technologies that require smaller investments and prior
17:446:36196:24:24:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:knowledge  –they  are  not  complex.   Consistent  with  this  idea  section  4.2  documented  the
17:447:36294:24:24:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disproportionate weight design patents have amongst household innovators.  In this section
17:448:36384:24:0:72:540:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we explore whether this might lead them also to work on innovations that represent breaks
18:449:36475:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with past knowledge within specific technology fields. In this section we assess the proportion
18:450:36570:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of breakthrough patents amongst patented household innovations as defined by whether they
18:451:36659:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:represent a “radical” break from existing knowledge in that field.  Since it is the focal point
18:452:36754:24:24:72:402:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a new technological trajectory the patent itself must be cited.
18:453:36820:24:24:93:539:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our measure builds on the concepts of Dahlin and Behrens (2005) but is extended to
18:454:36902:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the universe of patents in the USPTO patent database (Dreisigmeyer et al., 2014).  Dahlin
18:455:36991:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Behrens (2005) define the term radical invention as one that meets three properties:  1)
18:456:37083:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is novel - it has distinctive features that are missing in previously observed inventions; 2)
18:457:37179:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is unique - it is the focal point of a new technological trajectory; 3) it must be adopted - it
18:458:37277:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should influence future inventions.  The authors operationalize this idea by examining both
18:459:37368:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forward and backward citation patterns for any given patent.  Forward citations are citations
18:460:37461:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a patent made by other later patents.  It is a measure of the patents impact on future
18:461:37550:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventions and its value in the market.  Backward citations are defined by the prior art cited
18:462:37644:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the patent itself.  Backward citations contain information about the radicalness of the
18:463:37734:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation.  The more radical a technology the more likely it is to cite prior art outside its
18:464:37828:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:own patent class since this will necessarily involve combining different elements rather than
18:465:37921:24:24:72:220:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventions from its own field.
18:466:37951:24:24:93:539:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table  10  reports  the  number  of  patents  (per  thousand)  that  qualify  as  being  radical
18:467:38047:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by assignee type, business type and technology class.  In general, patents matched to em-
18:468:38136:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployer firms are more than twice as likely to be considered radical versus patents matched to
18:469:38229:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer firms and unmatched patents.  This does not appear to be driven by composi-
18:470:38316:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional differences in the patent types, as employer-match patents and firm-assigned patents
18:471:38407:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consistently have higher rates of radical patents across all technology classes.  Design patents
18:472:38503:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appear to have high rates of radical innovations.  Many of these appear to be self referencing
18:473:38597:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and not have much of an impact outside the patenting firm suggesting these might be dis-
18:474:38685:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proportionately defensive patents.  While there are relatively fewer radical patents amongst
18:475:38777:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household innovators there is still a non trivial number of them.  We examine some of the
19:476:38868:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:radical patents identified.  The bulk of them are found in Computers & Communications,
19:477:38954:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Design, and Drugs & Medical.  They include a system for providing traffic information to
19:478:39042:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a plurality of mobile users connected to a network, a system for dynamically pushing infor-
19:479:39133:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mation to a user utilizing global positioning system, a method and apparatus for securing
19:480:39222:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a suture and a flash memory drive with quick connector.  All these technologies had broad
19:481:39311:24:41:72:187:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impacts in their fields.

19:483:39358:31:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally we describe the breath of impact patented household innovations have outside of their
19:484:39451:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:own field.  Some technologies are more specific with a limited application across industries
19:485:39543:24:24:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while  others  have  a  wider  field  of  application.   We  use  the  patent  classification  codes  to

19:487:39748:24:49:71:160:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2004) as follows:

20:509:40930:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for  Chemical,  Drugs  &  Medical  and  Mechanical.   Independent  inventors  appear  to  focus
20:510:41025:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on technologies that have narrower impacts.  Across the board and as expected patents in

20:515:41337:36:24:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Having established how patents associated with household innovations differ from traditional
20:516:41429:24:24:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents, this section looks at the types of business associated with household innovations;
20:517:41520:24:24:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their  characteristics,  innovation  dynamics  and  outcomes.   The  goal  is  to  assess  whether
20:518:41618:24:24:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the innovator is able to monetize their innovation, either through increased business income
20:519:41710:24:23:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possibly from licensing or use of the patent. There are other ways the inventor might monetize
20:520:41804:23:24:72:539:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their innovation that we do not observe here such as through direct payments.20It should be
20:521:41895:24:24:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:noted that the majority of patented household innovations are not directly tied to a business
20:522:41988:24:24:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the inventor owns.  Table 5 shows that only 19% of patented household innovations;
20:523:42075:24:24:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those  accounted  for  by  individual  assignee  and  unassigned  patents,  are  associated  with  a
20:524:42175:24:47:72:495:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business.  The equivalent rate for patents with a declared business assignee is 93%.
20:525:42259:47:31:72:526:212:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.1  Characteristics of Patenting Firms: Industry, Age and Size
20:526:42322:31:24:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  start  by  looking  at  the  industry  composition  of  the  nonemployer  firms  that  obtain  a
20:527:42422:24:24:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patent. Patenting nonemployer firms are extremely rare. Out of more than 20M nonemployer
20:528:42510:24:37:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms  in  a  typical  year,  only  around  5,000  firms  will  seek  out  a  patent  (less  than  0.03%).
20:529:42616:37:60:81:403:96:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:20This form of income might be observed through their income tax forms.
20:530:42687:60:0:300:312:36:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:18
21:531:42689:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We limit our analysis to nonemployer firms that are born after 2000.  We exclude existing
21:532:42778:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployers born prior to avoid left censoring in the patents we can match.21Figure 3 shows
21:533:42870:24:24:71:539:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the industry composition of patenting nonemployer firms weighted by number of patents they
21:534:42960:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:own,  top,  and that of all nonemployer firms,  bottom.  Figure 3 shows,  a disproportionate
21:535:43052:24:24:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share of patents originate at nonemployer firms that engage in Professional Services followed
21:536:43145:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by Finance & Real State and Retail.  This is very different from the industry composition of
21:537:43237:24:24:71:453:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer firms, which is dispersed much more evenly across industries.
21:538:43310:24:24:93:539:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Businesses associated with household innovations differ from the overall population of
21:539:43396:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer businesses.  We are interested in understanding whether the trigger for creating
21:540:43488:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these businesses is the expectation of a patent grant and thus a means to try to capitalize on
21:541:43582:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an innovation or instead the business activity predates the patent application.  We explore
21:542:43673:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar patterns for firms with employees.  Figure 4 graphs the distribution of firm age when
21:543:43766:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the firm/inventor applies for their first patent for both employer and nonemployer firms.22
21:544:43857:24:24:71:450:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We define firm age based on the year the business first filed income taxes.
21:545:43932:24:24:93:539:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  look  at  applications  by  patenting  firms  in  2010.   We  limit  our  analysis  to  firms
21:546:44029:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:up  to  age  10.   If  a  firm  first  files  income  taxes  after  the  application  is  filed  we  assign  a
21:547:44139:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negative age equal to the difference between application year and birth year.  Figure 4 shows
21:548:44232:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a significant share of businesses apply for their patent before they generate revenue.  The
21:549:44323:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mass of distribution is to the left of their second year of business activity.  Approximately
21:550:44416:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:43.6% of nonemployer firms that are granted a patent apply for the patent prior to starting
21:551:44507:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their  nonemployer  business  activity.   For  many  other  businesses  the  birth  of  the  business
21:552:44608:24:23:71:289:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coincides with the patent application year.
21:553:44651:23:24:93:539:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A  non  trivial  number  of  patent  applications,  18%,  are  filed  three  or  more  years  after
21:554:44750:24:36:71:279:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:starting the business activity suggesting.
21:555:44792:36:16:81:539:122:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:21Currently we can only work with patent data starting in 2000.  If we were to include incumbent nonem-
21:556:44895:16:8:72:517:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ployers in 2000 there would be no way for us to determine which ones received a patent prior to 2000.
21:557:44996:8:62:81:234:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:22We only observe granted patents.

22:559:45032:0:24:93:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Compared  to  employer  businesses  household  innovators  are  more  likely  to  start  their
22:560:45126:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business at time of application, although the two distributions are centered around age zero.
22:561:45219:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  tighter  distribution  for  nonemployers  can  be  attributed  to  the  shortened  lifecycle  of
22:562:45320:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer firms, most of whom are very short-lived with more than 50% of nonemployer
22:563:45406:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms  exiting  before  year  2  and  70%  of  nonemployer  firms  exiting  by  year  3  (Fairlie  and
22:564:45508:24:24:72:150:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Miranda, 2017)
22:565:45522:24:24:93:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We are interested in understanding the revenue generated by household innovations vis-
22:566:45608:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a-vis  innovations  tied  to  established  employer  businesses.   Figure  5  looks  at  the  revenue
22:567:45709:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution  for  firms  that  own  patents  as  a  function  of  their  employer  status.   As  before
22:568:45813:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we focus on the cross section of firms age 10 or less in 2010.  Revenue follows a log-normal
22:569:45905:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pattern with the distribution centered at $10,000 for household innovations.23Revenue for
22:570:45994:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovative employer businesses is similarly shaped but centered around much larger revenues
22:571:46085:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of $1.2 million.  Businesses associated with household innovations do not appear to generate
22:572:46177:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much income on average at time of application.  There is however a fairly wide distribution
22:573:46268:24:24:72:263:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a standard deviation of $97,500.
22:574:46305:24:24:93:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 6 looks at income growth before and after patent grant.  To avoid composition
22:575:46389:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects  as  a  result  of  firm  exit  we  show  results  for  a  balanced  panel  of  firms  that  survive
22:576:46497:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for a minimum of 5 years.  For comparison we show revenue for employer businesses.  We
22:577:46583:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:normalize  revenue  to  equal  100  at  grant  time,t,  to  facilitate  comparison  with  employer
22:578:46681:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:businesses.   Figure  6  shows  income  growth  prior  to  patent  grant  is  considerable  and  very
22:579:46782:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar for both employer and nonemployer business.  In the two years prior to patent grant
22:580:46873:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:revenue grows by 25% relative to the base.  Income plateaus for nonemployer business shortly
22:581:46965:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after grant and starts declining one year after.  Very few firms transition to employer status
22:582:47059:24:24:72:471:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so this pattern is not due to excluding successful exits out of nonemployment.
22:583:47137:24:36:93:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Revenue growth by employer businesses seems to be very different after grant.  These
22:584:47221:36:16:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:23It should be noted that firms who patent prior to starting their business (negative age firms) are not
22:585:47325:16:46:72:192:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:included in the distribution
22:586:47353:46:0:300:312:36:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:20
23:587:47355:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms display an acceleration of revenue that seems to exhaust itself two years after grant.
23:588:47447:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Overall these results suggest that on average household innovators are not as successful in
23:589:47538:24:47:72:282:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capitalizing their innovations after grant.

23:591:47628:31:24:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, we look at the probability that a nonemployer business hires employees in particular
23:592:47721:24:24:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether patenting activity is associated with the successful growth expansion to a business
23:593:47812:24:24:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that generates paid jobs for other individuals.  For this exercise we focus on the cohort of new
23:594:47908:24:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer startups in 2000 and ask ourselves how many transition into employer status
23:595:47995:24:24:72:151:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each year after.
23:596:48011:24:24:93:539:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  find  that  of  the  approximately  5.24M  new  nonemployer  entrants  in  2000,  around
23:597:48103:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:100,000 eventually transition to employer firms over their life,  for a cumulative transition
23:598:48196:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of approximately 2%.  Of this cohort, 3,700 nonemployer firms hold a patent.  Of these,
23:599:48288:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less than 130 will transition to employer firms over their life cycle, for a cumulative transition
23:600:48386:23:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of around 3.4%, or 70% higher than non patenting firms.  Annual transitions are graphed
23:601:48478:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Figure 7.  As we can see, patenting firms are more than twice as likely to transition to
23:602:48569:24:47:72:447:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employer firms within the first two years, relative to non patenting firms.
23:603:48644:47:31:72:362:272:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.3  The value of Household Innovations
23:604:48683:31:24:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Relatively few household innovations become the foundation of a business.  However, those
23:605:48772:24:24:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that do give us an indication of the value of these innovations if only from the revenue they
23:606:48865:24:24:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generate.   Household  innovations  that  do  not  directly  translate  into  a  business  owned  by
23:607:48965:24:24:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the inventor might be expected to generate income in other ways that we do not observe
23:608:49051:24:24:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  data  such  as  contracts  or  direct  payments.   Many  other  might  be  monetized  by
23:609:49148:24:24:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent  companies  with  specific  market  knowledge  and  resources  to  market  and  profit
23:610:49244:24:24:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the innovation.  Many other may simply never be pursued directly but contribute to
23:611:49331:24:0:72:540:73:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the knowledge base that generate other innovations.  Other innovations might go unnoticed
24:612:49422:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and yet other may simply have no value at all. Assigning value to these innovations is difficult
24:613:49518:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if not impossible.  However, a simple back of the envelope calculation might give us a sense
24:614:49610:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the magnitude of their overall value.  To this end we calculate a range of potential values
24:615:49704:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based on both the marginal and average direct income generated by businesses owned by
24:616:49789:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household inventors.  We focus first on innovations that are tied to nonemployer businesses.
24:617:49881:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We calculate the average income generated by those business while they remain in operation.
24:618:49972:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For  simplicity  we  ignore  income  generated  by  these  businesses  after  they  hire  their  first
24:619:50074:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employee since there are relatively few transitions.  We base our calculation on the cohort of
24:620:50168:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms born in 2000 that own a patent.  We track these firms through 2011 or until they exit.
24:621:50260:24:24:93:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our starting point for identifying the economic value of these patents is to first come
24:622:50347:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:up  with  a  revenue  elasticity  for  each  patent  grant.   In  Table  12  we  run  several  revenue
24:623:50449:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specifications based on known factors that are seemingly unrelated to the innovation itself,
24:624:50541:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but can potentially impact the revenue stream of these businesses.  These include technology
24:625:50633:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector  and  zip  code-year  controls,  as  well  as  demographic  controls  (male,  U.S.  born,  race
24:626:50735:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and age) across the full nonemployer sample and patenters-only.  In column (5), we control
24:627:50825:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for selection using a Heckman selection model.  The results from our specifications reveal
24:628:50915:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that patents have a positive and significant impact on revenue.  Across all nonemployer and
24:629:51006:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patenting firms, the specifications suggest that a 10% increase in granted patents is associated
24:630:51102:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a 0.3-0.4% increase in revenue (combining the elasticities of the patent application and
24:631:51195:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:grant), while a 10% increase in citations is associated with a 0.03-0.06% increase in revenue.
24:632:51289:24:24:72:368:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These results are consistent after controlling for selection.
24:633:51350:24:23:93:539:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In attempting to compute the economic value of these patents, we first need to tabulate
24:634:51437:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the total number of household innovations as measured by patents and number of businesses
24:635:51526:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated  with  these  patents.   Table  1  and  Table  2  tell  us  that  we  have  approximately
24:636:51626:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:93,000 matched patents to nonemployer businesses.  These 93,000 patents match to 42,000
24:637:51713:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unique nonemployer businesses (2.2 patents per business).  Assuming the same employer-to-
24:638:51802:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer match ratios in Table 2 and applying them to the set of unmatched patents gives
25:639:51895:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:us 184,000 unmatched nonemployer patents, which would convert to approximately 83,000
25:640:51980:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer  businesses  (assuming  the  same  ratio  of  patents  per  business).   We  therefore
25:641:52078:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:need to approximate the revenue streams for the 83,000 ”missing” nonemployer businesses
25:642:52165:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to tabulate the full economic impact of household innovations.  Nonemployer businesses with
25:643:52256:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents generate approximately $10,200 in annual revenue on average (versus $9,700 gener-
25:644:52345:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ated on average for nonemployer businesses who hold no patents).  Nonemployer businesses
25:645:52433:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with patents also have an average survival rate of 3.95 years (versus 2.72 years for nonem-
25:646:52524:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployer  businesses  without  patents).   Therefore,  if  we  take  the  aggregate  lifetime  revenue
25:647:52624:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  42,000  nonemployer  businesses  with  patents,  we  get  an  economic  value  of  approxi-
25:648:52724:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mately $1.7B (or $18,500 per patent).  Applying the same values to the 83,000 ”missing”
25:649:52811:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployer businesses with patents gives us a cumulative economic value of $5.0B for all
25:650:52900:23:24:72:412:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household innovations between 2000 and 2011 in real 2000 dollars.
25:651:52965:24:24:93:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is important to note that this calculation requires a number of strong assumptions
25:652:53050:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which may differ greatly from reality.  First, the revenue generated by business started by
25:653:53141:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household inventors themselves is the same as the revenue generated by household innova-
25:654:53229:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions whose outcomes we are not able to observe including those sold to or appropriated by
25:655:53319:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:existing businesses.  Second, businesses started by household inventors would not generate
25:656:53409:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:revenue  where  it  not  for  the  innovation.   Third,  the  cost  of  developing  the  innovation  is
25:657:53512:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negligible.  Finally, we have limited our analysis to patented household innovations.  While
25:658:53604:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arguably the most valuable innovations likely they represent but a small portion of all house-
25:659:53698:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hold innovations.  We have made no effort at placing an economic value to innovations that
25:660:53788:24:54:72:259:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are not known to the patent system.
25:661:53823:54:36:72:194:151:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:6  Conclusion
25:662:53836:36:23:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Households are increasingly recognized as an important source of invention and innovation.
25:663:53926:23:0:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Survey data shows independent inventors contribute substantially to consumer product in-
26:664:54016:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:novations that are later incorporated into the products of incumbent firms.  A challenge with
26:665:54109:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:survey data are the small sample sizes which either limits what we can learn about the most
26:666:54200:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:valuable innovations (the right tail of the distribution) or limits the scope of the innovations
26:667:54296:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we can study.  In this paper we use administrative data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark
26:668:54386:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Office and the U.S. Census Bureau to describe patented household innovations in a system-
26:669:54475:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:atic way.  While patented innovations arguably represent but a very small slice of household
26:670:54567:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovations it is perhaps the most valuable one.  We match these patents and their inventors
26:671:54659:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to U.S. Census Bureau demographic and business data.  We explore the demographic char-
26:672:54745:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:acteristics of housed inventors vis-a-vis salaried inventors, the characteristics and impact of
26:673:54840:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their innovations, and their value when these inventors monetize their innovations through
26:674:54930:24:23:72:169:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their own business.
26:675:54949:23:24:93:539:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  find  household  inventors  are  disproportionately  born  in  the  U.S.  when  compared
26:676:55041:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  salaried  inventors  and  consequently  they  are  also  relatively  white.   Businesses  that
26:677:55141:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hire  inventors  disproportionately  hire  foreign  born  inventors  relative  to  their  size  in  the
26:678:55244:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:population an indication these corporations might engage in brain gain by tapping foreign
26:679:55333:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets. Household inventors are disproportionately under 25 and over 55 consistent with the
26:680:55425:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:idea that household innovation is a leisure activity.  Across the board, whether household or
26:681:55518:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate inventors, we find a deficit in female and black inventors relative to the population
26:682:55613:24:24:72:120:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as a hole.
26:683:55623:24:24:93:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Looking  at  the  types  of  innovations  we  find  household  inventors  work  in  technology
26:684:55717:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:classes disproportionately tied to consumer products such as Design, Mechanical and Other.
26:685:55807:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These patents are about 1/2 as likely to be considered “radical” when compared with cor-
26:686:55895:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:porate patents.  In terms of value, household innovations accumulate approximately 27-32%
26:687:55984:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fewer  citations  on  average.   While  their  citation  impact  is  smaller  it  remains  remarkably
26:688:56085:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high with an average of 13.6 citations per patent (through December 2016).  Finally, we find
26:689:56177:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively  few  household  inventors  start  a  business  around  their  innovation.   Only  19%  of
26:690:56278:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household innovations are tied to a business.  These businesses average $10,000 in revenue at
27:691:56373:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time of patent application and are more than twice as likely to transition to hire their first
27:692:56467:24:24:72:321:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employee than nonemployers who do not patent.
27:693:56512:24:24:93:539:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  our  back-of-the-envelope  calculations  suggest  patented  household  innovations
27:694:56604:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:granted between 2000 and 2011 may generate approximately $5.0B in 2000 dollar revenue.
27:695:56690:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While this might not be extraordinary when compared to the value of corporate patents, it
27:696:56779:24:24:72:490:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is non-trivial, which raises important questions about R$D and innovation policy.
27:697:56860:24:24:93:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To conclude, patented household innovations have impact and value.  Many of them are
27:698:56944:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:radical and represent breakthroughs in their fields.  Despite efforts to understand their role
27:699:57038:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the economy our knowledge of innovations and their inventors remains limited.  Adminis-

27:701:57220:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:survey of household inventors and their patented inventions could go a long way to expand

40:991:72458:36:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we outline the matching process between USPTO granted patents and the
40:992:72544:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:full non-employer dataset (iLBD) at Census.  We start by describing the individual datasets
40:993:72635:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and features of the datasets that will be matched.  We then outline the matching algorithm
40:994:72725:24:46:72:484:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and post a number of statistics on the match rates across different patent types.

40:996:72828:32:24:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The USPTO patent database consists of all granted patents applied for between 2000 and
40:997:72914:24:24:72:539:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2011 by US entities and excludes all foreign entities, as well as government patents.24Counts

40:999:73083:24:24:93:539:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our matching algorithm attempts to create name and address matches from two distinct
40:1000:73167:24:24:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sources of information contained in USPTO patent record:  i) The assignee, typically a firm,
40:1001:73259:24:23:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for whom patent ownership belongs, and ii) the inventor – persons who may or may not be
40:1002:73346:23:24:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affiliated with a firm.  In cases where no assignee is named, it is assumed that the patent’s
40:1003:73439:24:24:72:276:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership remains with the inventor(s).
40:1004:73478:24:24:93:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We compile our matching database from two distinct sources of PatentsView data from

42:1051:76387:32:24:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Inventors are listed separately from the Assignees and are considered wholly different as they
42:1052:76481:24:24:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are typically employees of the assignee firms.  Inventor data contains a separate identifier
42:1053:76573:24:24:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for each inventor and also contains city and state level geographic data.  Multiple inventors
42:1054:76666:24:24:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can work on each patent.  The number of inventors greatly exceeds the number of assignees.
42:1055:76756:24:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (iLBD) mainly consists of person-

42:1057:76914:24:23:93:539:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In each year, there are around 160,000 unique inventor names on average to match the

45:1149:82389:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through an inventor match, assignee match, or for some patents, in both.  The breakdown
45:1150:82476:24:24:72:197:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of match by identifier is:
45:1151:82502:24:24:93:539:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Nearly 70% of the matches occur through the inventor, which is expected since nearly
45:1152:82586:24:24:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:90% of the patent matching criteria are through the inventor.  About 14% of patents are
45:1153:82673:24:24:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matched through both the inventor and assignee, with the remaining being matched through
45:1154:82761:24:24:72:540:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the assignee.  The next step in the matching process is to filter out the patents that are ac-
45:1155:82855:24:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tually linked with employer firms,  keep patents that have identified inventors in the PVS
46:1156:82947:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process, drop duplicate matches (e.g.  more than one identifier for a patent-name combina-
46:1157:83037:24:47:72:406:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion) and finally augment our data using unique PVS’ed patents.
46:1158:83100:47:31:72:313:637:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:A.4  Cleaning the Set of Matches
46:1159:83132:31:24:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Starting with our set of 103M matches, the first step in the cleaning process is to remove all
46:1160:83226:24:24:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the patents associated with employer firms using an existing Census firm-level crosswalk
46:1161:83317:24:24:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(see Graham et al.  2015).  These patents may have matched to the non-employer data either
46:1162:83407:24:24:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through  the  inventor  who  is  employed  by  an  employer  firm  who  is  the  assignee,  or  if  the
46:1163:83510:24:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:name of the non-employer business is very similar or identical to the name of an employer
46:1164:83599:24:24:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:businesses.  The existing Census firm-level crosswalk exists from 2000-2011 and covers more
46:1165:83690:24:24:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than 1.5M patents, of which 958,000 originate in the US, with the remaining belonging to
46:1166:83778:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:foreign  assignees  with  US  subsidiaries.   This  crosswalk  was  created  using  a  triangulation
46:1167:83878:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of name-address matching of assignee data merged with linked employee-employer inventor
46:1168:83965:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data.  The crosswalk covers around 90% of all domestic patents with firm assignees.  Filtering
46:1169:84059:23:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out the employer patents will remove approximately 80% of the patents matched to the non-
46:1170:84148:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employer data (838,000 patents were removed).  This is suggestive that a large percentage of
46:1171:84240:24:24:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inventors at employer firms also have non-employer businesses.  Not all of the patents from
46:1172:84331:24:24:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these inventors are removed from the final dataset, rather only the patents that are identified
46:1173:84426:24:24:72:269:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to being assigned to an employer firm.
46:1174:84464:24:24:93:539:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The next step in the cleaning of the matches involves filtering out the matches that have
46:1175:84553:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not been linked to Census data using the Census Bureau’s Person Identification Validation
46:1176:84642:24:24:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:System (PVS). The PVS process assigns an anonymous, unique person identifier (PIK) to
46:1177:84727:24:24:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals using name and address information and matching it against the Social Security
46:1178:84817:24:24:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Administration’s numerical identification file (”Numident”).  The matching process is prob-
46:1179:84908:24:23:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:abilistic and it is possible for an individual to receive multiple identifiers (PIKs), especially
46:1180:85005:23:24:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if the provided only partial information.  The USPTO patent data underwent the full PVS
46:1181:85092:24:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process  for  the  original  Census  firm-level  crosswalk,  generating  PIKs  for  all  of  the  inven-
47:1182:85198:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tors  identified  in  patents,  based  on  names  and  a  zip  code.   Because  the  information  used
47:1183:85300:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to generate these matches is rather coarse (only name and zip), approximately 30% of the
47:1184:85388:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patent-inventor combinations have a unique identifier (PIK), while 75% have fewer than 5
47:1185:85476:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identifiers.  The zip code is the unique characteristic here that we miss in our non-employer
47:1186:85569:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matching process and hence, can be used to validate our existing matches.  Our filter involves
47:1187:85663:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly linking all of the PIKs assigned to each patent from the PVS process and merging
47:1188:85752:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them  with  the  PIKs  generated  in  the  non-employer  matches.   We  drop  patents  that  were
47:1189:85849:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matched to the non-employer through the inventor name but are not identified in the PVS
47:1190:85936:24:24:72:371:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process.  This removes nearly 40% of the existing matches.
47:1191:85994:24:24:93:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  third  step  in  the  filter  process  drops  duplicate  matches  by  patent  identifier  and
47:1192:86092:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:name.  These are patents that cannot be assigned to a specific person or business because of
47:1193:86184:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiple matches.  There are several instances where patents match to multiple non-employer
47:1194:86275:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identifiers after the name and address match and after the filters have been applied.  Since
47:1195:86367:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is no way to distinguish between these non-employer matches, we elect to drop them.
47:1196:86456:24:24:72:270:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This removes 45% of existing matches.
47:1197:86493:24:24:93:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The next step in the filter process involves ”winsorizing” our existing matches by the
47:1198:86579:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assignee code.  In this case, we count the number of patents by assignee code-year and drop
47:1199:86670:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the patents for the assignee code-year combinations that are in the top 0.5%.  This number
47:1200:86760:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ranges between 20-50 patents per year.  Our assumption lies in that due to size constraints,
47:1201:86852:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the number of patents a non-employer business can produce in a year are limited and that
47:1202:86940:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these observations are likely to have been missed by the existing Census firm-level crosswalk
47:1203:87033:24:23:72:515:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or are ”unique” for entirely different reasons.  This removes a further 7.5% of matches.
47:1204:87121:23:24:93:539:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  we  augment  our  matches  using  the  unique  inventor  identifiers  from  the  PVS
47:1205:87215:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process.  As mentioned earlier, approximately 30% of the patent-inventor combinations have
47:1206:87305:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  unique  identifier  (PIK).  We  keep  the  ones  with  the  unique  identifier  and  merge  them
47:1207:87404:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the full non-employer database to identify non-employer businesses that our matching
47:1208:87493:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:methodology may have missed.  We then augment our existing matches with this database.

48:1229:88452:24:24:93:539:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This completes the matching process for the nonemployer data.  Starting from 1.29M
48:1230:88534:24:24:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents, we are able to successfully match 68,400 patents to the nonemployer data.  The full

48:1232:88667:24:24:93:539:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We denote the ”unmatched” as unknown since a fairly large proportion of these patents
48:1233:88752:24:24:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were  initially  matched  to  the  nonemployer  dataset,  but  were  dropped  either  because  the

48:1235:88942:24:24:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:name combination had more than one individual listed (dropped out during deduplication
48:1236:89028:24:24:72:443:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process).  A breakdown of the ”Unknown” matches is given in Table A8.
48:1237:89097:24:24:93:539:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table  A8  tells  us  that  approximately  141,000  of  the  273,000  unknown  patents  were
48:1238:89189:24:23:72:540:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unmatched across all Census datasets, which implies that around 132,000 patents were linked
48:1239:89280:23:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the nonemployer.  Of these, approximately, 67% were dropped as they were not listed in

50:1295:91741:36:24:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Matching the patent data to the demographic data is a relatively straightforward process
50:1296:91829:24:24:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of merging multiple files and dropping duplicate matches allocated in the PVS process.  We
50:1297:91919:24:24:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:start with the original patents that have undergone the PVS process.  Of our starting point
50:1298:92010:24:24:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 1.29M patents, 989,000 have undergone the PVS process (76.7%).  These 989,000 PVS’ed
50:1299:92097:24:24:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents have 2.28M inventor names associated with the patents (average team size of approx-
50:1300:92188:24:23:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imately 2.3) and 9.98M inventor PIKs associated with them, indicating that each inventor
50:1301:92276:23:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:name has on average around 4 PIKs.  We start by keeping the PIK with the highest PVS
50:1302:92360:24:24:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:score by patent-inventor combination.  This removes 3.76M of the 9.98M starting inventor
50:1303:92448:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:PIKs.   We  want  to  unduplicate  the  remainder  of  these  PIKs  and  only  keep  the  inventors
50:1304:92547:24:24:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a unique PIK. Removing all of the duplicate PIKs associated with each inventor name
50:1305:92635:24:24:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:leaves us with 1.79M unique inventor PIKs associated with nearly 884,000 patents from the
50:1306:92724:24:24:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:989,000 patents that underwent the PVS process.  A yearly breakout of the counts is below.
50:1307:92814:24:24:93:539:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If  we  break  out  the  counts  by  assignee  type,  we  find  differences  in  the  ratio  of  the
50:1308:92914:24:24:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents that undergo the PVS process by assignee type, along with differences in the ratio
50:1309:93004:24:24:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  inventors  that  unique  PIKs  by  assignee  type.   Firm  assignees  are  most  likely  to  have
50:1310:93105:24:24:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:undergone the PVS process (82%), followed by individual assignees (75%), while fewer than
50:1311:93194:24:0:72:540:73:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:50% of unassigned patents undergo the PVS process.  Looking at the proportion of inventors
51:1312:93286:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that have unique PIKs by assignee type, we find that nearly 91% of inventors in firm assigned
51:1313:93379:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patents have a unique PIK associated with their name.  This is higher than the ratio found
51:1314:93469:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in individual assigned patents (83%) and the ratio in unassigned patents (76.7%).  The full
51:1315:93560:24:24:72:263:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:breakdown by assignee type is below.
51:1316:93596:24:24:93:539:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Starting from the nearly 884,000 patents with unique inventor PIKs, we then merge it to
51:1317:93683:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the Census Numident file which contains the demographic information we are interested in.
51:1318:93772:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The Numident match rate is around 100%, thus completing the full demographic matching
51:1319:93857:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:process for each patent.  Turning back to the unmatched patents, we break down the match
51:1320:93945:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate by sector.  We show that the patents without unique PIKs and no demographic data
51:1321:94030:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are mainly concentrated in the ”Design” and ”Plant” patent sector as shown in the table
