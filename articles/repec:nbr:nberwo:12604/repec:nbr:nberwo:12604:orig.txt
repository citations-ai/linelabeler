2:23:980:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We test whether firms use incompatibility strategically, using data from ATM markets. High ATM
2:24:1074:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:fees degrade the value of competitors' deposit accounts, and can in principle serve as a mechanism
2:25:1172:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:for siphoning depositors away from competitors or for creating deposit account differentiation. Our
2:26:1271:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:empirical framework can empirically distinguish surcharging motivated by this strategic concern from
2:27:1371:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:surcharging that simply maximizes ATM profit considered as a stand-alone operation. The results
2:28:1466:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:are consistent with such behavior by large banks, but not by small banks. For large banks, the effect
2:29:1567:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:of incompatibility seems to operate through higher deposit account fees rather than increased deposit
2:30:1668:14:28:72:137:490:12:Times:12:Times:account base.

3:49:2265:60:36:68:197:557:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:1Introduction
3:50:2278:36:19:68:536:521:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:In recent years the economics of incompatibility have moved to the forefront of policy debates. The
3:51:2377:19:18:68:536:502:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:generic issue is something like this: Firm A produces two products, which may be more valuable
3:52:2471:18:18:68:536:484:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:when consumed together. Firm A faces competition in one or both markets. In principle, consumers
3:53:2567:18:18:68:536:466:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:can “mix and match” Firm A’s products with those of its competitors, but Firm A decides to
3:54:2657:18:19:68:535:448:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:restrict consumers’ ability to do so, effectively forcing them to buy both of its products together.
3:55:2757:19:18:68:536:429:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:In computers, Microsoft is held to have used a variety of technical and contractual restriction to
3:56:2855:18:18:68:536:411:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:link products in this way.1In media and telecommunications markets, the prospect that owners
3:57:2947:18:19:68:536:393:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of “bottleneck” facilities might use that advantage to acquire market power in other markets is an
3:58:3045:19:18:68:536:374:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ongoing concern.2Kodak allegedly used contractual restrictions to deny users of its copiers the
3:59:3140:18:18:68:536:356:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ability to use independent service and parts for repairs.3Printer manufacturer Lexmark was sued
3:60:3235:18:18:68:536:338:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:for restricting consumers’ ability to use third-party toner cartridges in its printers. Terminology in
3:61:3337:18:19:68:536:320:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:these cases varies–some refer to incompatibility, others refer to access or interconnection pricing,
3:62:3437:19:18:68:536:301:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and others term this behavior tying–but the economic question is the same in each case: when
3:63:3529:18:18:68:536:283:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:will afirm attempt to restrict access across related markets, and when will that strategic behavior
3:64:3628:18:16:68:138:265:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:be successful?4
3:65:3643:16:19:80:536:249:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:1See Genakos et al.  (2005) for an empirical examinationof the OS/server issue, in which Microsoft allegedly
3:66:3751:19:15:68:536:230:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:degraded the interoperability of its OS with rivals’ server software. The antitrust suit against Microsoft alleged that
3:67:3870:15:15:68:536:215:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Microsoft tied both Internet Explorer and its Java platform to Windows in order to maintain its Windows monopoly.
3:68:3983:15:10:68:272:200:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:See, e.g., Gilbert and Katz (2001) for a discussion.
3:69:4035:10:19:80:535:190:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:2The government’s case against the AOL/Time Warner merger alleged that the merged entity could harm Internet
3:70:4143:19:15:68:536:171:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Service Provider competition by denying competitors access to Time Warner’s cable lines, and this issue dictated
3:71:4255:15:14:68:536:156:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:the terms of merger approval (which mandated that Time Warner provide open access to competing ISPs). In the
3:72:4363:14:15:68:536:142:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Telecommunications Act of 1996, the concern that local exchange carriers could leverage their monopoly from switches
3:73:4479:15:11:68:339:127:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:to related markets drove the imposition of regulated access pricing.
3:74:4547:11:15:80:306:116:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:3See Mackie-Mason and Metzler (2004) for a discussion.
3:75:4601:15:18:80:536:101:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:4See Whinston (1990) for a clear exposition of the intuitive link between tying, interconnection degradation, and
3:76:4714:18:0:68:131:83:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:incompatibility.
4:77:4731:0:19:85:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:In this paper we provide an empirical framework for examining this question, using data from
4:78:4823:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ATM markets. Banks offer both ATM cards and ATM services as a bundle to their depositors.
4:79:4912:18:18:68:536:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:They also offer other banks’ customers access to their ATMs, but impose a per-usesurchargefor
4:80:5005:18:18:68:536:635:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:each such transaction. Surcharges are closest to the telecommunication example; they are an access
4:81:5103:18:19:68:536:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:fee for off-network transactions. The allegation (highlighted by the quote above) is that large banks
4:82:5204:19:18:68:536:598:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:use surcharges to create incompatibility between their ATMs and other banks’ cards, degrading the
4:83:5301:18:24:68:530:580:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:value of their competitors’ deposit accounts and creating competitive advantage in that market.5
4:84:5397:24:18:85:536:556:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The particular difficulty in ATM markets is that bank might impose surcharges simply to
4:85:5484:18:19:68:536:538:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:maximize profits in their ATM business, considered as a stand-alone entity. This makes it hard
4:86:5578:19:18:68:536:519:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to distinguish behavior intended to maximize profitswithina market from behavior intended to
4:87:5670:18:18:68:536:501:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:maximize profitsacrossmarkets. Do high ATM surcharges reflect an intent to create competitive
4:88:5763:18:19:68:536:483:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:advantage in the deposit account market? Or, do they merely reflect a profit-maximizing response
4:89:5859:19:18:68:536:464:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to ATM demand? This is of particular concern in our setting; while there has been some empirical
4:90:5955:18:18:68:536:446:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:work establishing that surcharges are correlated with changes in deposit market outcomes, that
4:91:6049:18:18:68:536:428:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:work has not attempted to disentangle strategic behavior from other explanations (such as omitted
4:92:6146:18:19:68:536:410:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:variables affecting both markets).6More generally, while there is a substantial theoretical literature
4:93:6248:19:18:68:536:391:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:identifying the conditions under which incompatibility reflects a strategic motive, there has been
4:94:6346:18:24:68:232:373:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:little empirical work on the issue.7
4:95:6382:24:18:85:536:349:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:To distinguish surcharging that maximizes ATM profits from strategic incompatibility, wefirst
4:96:6475:18:19:68:536:331:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:estimate thefirm-level surcharge that would maximize ATM profits without any regard to the
4:97:6565:19:18:68:536:312:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:deposit market.  Our identification strategy benefits from a natural experiment.  Prior to 1996
4:98:6660:18:18:68:535:294:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks were barred from imposing surcharges; afterthe restriction was lifted, surcharging became
4:99:6755:18:18:68:536:276:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:widespread.  This regime change in surcharging allows us to estimate the elasticity of residual
4:100:6850:18:19:68:536:258:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:demand for foreign ATM transactions. With this in hand and information on marginal cost, we
4:101:6941:19:17:68:361:239:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:can estimate the optimal stand-alone surcharge for eachfirm.
4:102:7001:17:19:80:536:222:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:5Controversy surrounded surcharging when it wasfirst allowed in the late 1990s; its opponents advocate statutory
4:103:7113:19:14:68:536:203:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:bans on the practice, precisely to prevent the use of surcharges as strategic incompatibility. See Prager (2001) for a
4:104:7231:14:11:68:334:189:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:discussion, as well as thefirst empirical work examining the issue.
4:105:7298:11:19:80:535:178:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:6Massoud, Saunders and Scholnick (2006) discuss this endogeneity issue, but do not estimate by how much strategic
4:106:7411:19:14:68:536:159:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:behavior distorts surcharges. Hannan et al. (2003) focus on the reduced form link between bank characteristics and
4:107:7525:14:11:68:459:145:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:surcharges without attempting to test whether surcharging is a form of strategic incompatibility.
4:108:7622:11:19:80:536:134:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:7Early theoretical work developing the economics of such markets includes that of Matutes and Regibeau (1988,
4:109:7731:19:14:68:535:115:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:1992), Economides (1989) and Chou and Shy (1990). Later work focusing on incompatibility includes Church and
4:110:7839:14:15:68:536:101:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Gandal (1992, 1996, 2000), Economides and Salop (1992).  Economides, Lopomo and Woroch (1996) discuss the
4:111:7944:15:15:68:536:86:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:strategic use of access fees, and Economides (1998) relates the access issue to telecommunications markets and the
4:112:8058:15:0:68:128:71:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Microsoft case.
5:113:8074:0:19:85:535:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We then measure differences at the bank level between actual surcharges and our estimated
5:114:8163:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:optimal stand-alone surcharges: we call this difference theincompatibility premium.Wefind that
5:115:8257:18:18:68:536:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:large banks have much higher incompatibility premia than small banks; in fact, for small banks
5:116:8351:18:18:68:536:635:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the average incompatibility premium is quite close to zero. This is consistent with the view that
5:117:8448:18:19:68:536:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:smallfirms have little motive or ability to restrict access for competitive advantage, but that large
5:118:8549:19:18:68:536:598:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks do have such a motive. We also estimate a model that can in principle reveal the parameters
5:119:8646:18:18:68:536:580:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of interest to a bank: the partial derivatives of deposit account prices and quantities with respect
5:120:8746:18:19:68:536:562:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to surcharging. In the models where we impose the most structure on the data, the parameters
5:121:8838:19:18:68:536:543:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:suggest that in our sample the strategic incompatibility motive stems from higher deposit fees,
5:122:8933:18:25:68:363:525:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:rather than increased quantity in the deposit account market.
5:123:8994:25:19:85:536:500:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Because the partial equilibrium incentives for incompatibility need not correlate with equilib-
5:124:9089:19:18:68:536:481:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:rium outcomes in any systematic way, we also estimate the relationship between our estimate of the
5:125:9187:18:18:68:536:463:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:incompatibility premium and changes in deposit account prices and quantities after banks began

5:127:9375:18:19:68:536:427:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:deposit account fees even when we condition on surcharges. There is no relationship between the
5:128:9470:19:18:68:536:408:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:incompatibility premium and gains in deposit share for banks of any size. This result sheds light on
5:129:9570:18:18:68:536:390:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:some mixed empirical results from previous studies of ATM markets, whichfind that banks should
5:130:9664:18:19:68:536:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:use high surcharges strategically, and that large banks charge higher fees, but has not been able
5:131:9761:19:18:68:536:353:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to conclusively establish that banks use surcharges strategically.9Our results suggest that higher

5:133:9972:18:15:68:536:317:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:market outcomes; we condition on surcharges and estimate the correlation between changes and our estimated

5:136:10214:18:15:68:536:273:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:for large banks. Hannan et al. (2003) establish that largebanks charge higher surcharges, using data from 1998, and

5:138:10425:15:15:68:536:243:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:result that they argue is consistent with the leveraging motive. But, theyfind little support for the notion that large
5:139:10544:15:15:68:536:228:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:banks are motivated by an attempt to steal existing customersfrom small banks. Prager (2001)finds no evidence
5:140:10653:15:14:68:536:213:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:that surcharges are correlated with depositshare losses by small banks, although her definition of “small” is based
5:141:10768:14:15:68:536:199:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:on national size and includes many banks with high local market share.  Hannan (2005) doesfind evidence that
5:142:10876:15:15:68:536:184:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:large banks gain share in states with surcharges relative to a state that banned them, but is unable to undertake
5:143:10989:15:15:68:536:169:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:any cross-sectional analysis related to surcharging and theincompatibility motive because he does not observe actual
5:144:11105:15:15:68:112:154:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:surcharges.

5:147:11329:15:15:68:536:110:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:account decisions. The estimated parameters in Ishii (2005) also suggest an economically significant role for strategic

6:149:11465:0:26:68:291:690:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:deposit fees are a motive for high surcharges.10

6:152:11710:18:19:68:536:628:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:which estimates the incentive for incompatibility, but does not measure the equilibrium behavior
6:153:11806:19:18:68:536:609:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:generated by such an incentive.  More generally, our work adds to the empirical literature on
6:154:11899:18:48:68:264:591:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:compatibility and competitive strategy.11

6:156:11951:36:18:68:536:507:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Banks offer a variety offinancial products, but we focus on two: ATMs and ATM cards. Together,
6:157:12045:18:18:68:536:489:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the two allow electronic withdrawals from deposit accounts.12Banks bundle cards and access to
6:158:12138:18:19:68:536:471:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:their ATMs together in the standard set of service offerings to depositors. Banks price those bundles
6:159:12239:19:18:68:536:452:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:using monthly fees, service charges and thefloat on deposits to earn revenue. Previous empirical
6:160:12335:18:18:68:536:434:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:work suggests that access to ATMs is an important deposit account characteristic, differentiating
6:161:12432:18:25:68:260:416:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:banks both horizontally and vertically.13
6:162:12473:25:19:85:536:391:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Because banks operate on shared networks, customers can use their ATM cards at other banks’

6:164:12663:18:18:68:536:354:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:paid by the cardholder’s bank to the network, and an interchange fee paid by the cardholder’s bank
6:165:12761:18:19:68:536:336:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to the ATM owner.14A foreign transaction may also generate aforeign feepaid by the cardholder
6:166:12854:19:18:68:536:317:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to the cardholder’s bank.  Foreign transactionsare common in our sample, comprising roughly
6:167:12945:18:18:68:322:299:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:thirty-five percent of all ATM transactions in 1996.15
6:168:12999:18:19:77:536:281:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:10This is consistent with the results in Knittel and Stango (2004), which shows an economically significant reduced
6:169:13114:19:15:68:536:262:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:form relationship between surcharges, ATMs and deposit account fees. That paper does not examine the relationship
6:170:13227:15:10:68:261:247:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:between deposit account share and surcharging.
6:171:13273:10:19:77:535:237:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:11Early work in this literature (e.g., Brynjolfson and Kemerer [1996], Gandal [1994, 1995] and Greenstein [1993]

6:173:13501:15:14:68:536:203:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:richer set of questions, such as the welfare effects of competition between incompatible networks (Rysman [2003],
6:174:13614:14:15:68:536:189:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Shankar and Bayus [2003], Ohashi [2003]), andfirm strategies such as preannouncements (Dranove and Gandal

6:176:13727:11:18:77:536:163:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:12Dove Consulting (1999, 2002)finds that in both 1999 and 2002, roughly eighty percent of ATM transactions were
6:177:13838:18:11:68:377:145:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:cash withdrawals. Deposits and inquiries comprise roughly ten percent each.

6:179:14016:19:10:68:350:115:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:that deposit account prices are correlated with banks’ ATMfleet size.
6:180:14085:10:19:77:536:105:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:14See McAndrews (2003) for a discussion of these fees. TheBank Network Newsperiodically reports fees for the
6:181:14193:19:10:68:185:86:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:largest ATM/debit networks.
6:182:14220:10:0:77:536:76:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:15We take thisfigure from data in the Bank Network News, various years. It closely matches the 38% average
7:183:14327:0:19:85:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Prior to 1996, the major ATM shared networks (PLUS and Cirrus) prohibited ATM owners
7:184:14411:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:from imposingsurchargeswhen non-customers used their machines.  After 1996, however, the
7:185:14499:18:18:68:536:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:networks rescinded the ban and surcharges became widespread.  From 1997-1999, most banks
7:186:14587:18:18:68:536:635:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:adopted surcharges, and they are currently nearly universal. It is this regime change that provides
7:187:14686:18:19:68:536:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the primary source of identification in the data; as we show below, surcharging hadfirst-order effects
7:188:14788:19:18:68:536:598:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:on consumer andfirm behavior. It also led to allegations that surcharges were anti-competitive,
7:189:14883:18:41:68:408:580:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:based in part on the strategic incompatibility motive for large banks.16
7:190:14955:41:32:68:354:539:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:2.1  The Network Economics of ATMs and Fees
7:191:14998:32:19:68:536:507:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The underlying economics in ATM markets are intuitively similar to a variety of other markets.
7:192:15092:19:18:68:536:488:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ATMs and cards are a set ofmix and matchproducts: components that consumers use to con-
7:193:15179:18:18:68:536:470:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:struct acomposite good–an ATM transaction.17Such composite goods are common; examples
7:194:15264:18:19:68:536:452:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:include audio/visual systems, computer systems and hardware/software systems more generally,
7:195:15356:19:18:68:536:433:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and many others.18In these markets, it is often true that competingfirms not only choose prices
7:196:15451:18:18:68:536:415:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:for their components, but also choose whether their components are compatible with those of their
7:197:15548:18:19:68:536:397:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:competitors.19Surcharging is a form of partial incompatibility; higher surcharges impose costs for
7:198:15646:19:25:68:326:378:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:using a card with an ATM owned by a different bank.
7:199:15697:25:18:85:536:353:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The motive for incompatibility in these markets is well-known. In ATM markets, the clearest
7:200:15788:18:18:68:536:335:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:exposition of this motive is found in Massoud and Bernhardt (2002, 2003). Massoud and Bernhardt
7:201:15883:18:19:68:536:317:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:(2002) present a model in which customers make a two-stage decision–first of a bank, then for
7:202:15976:19:18:68:536:298:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ATM use, given their bank choice and ATM fees. Higher surcharges depress willingness to pay
7:203:16067:18:18:68:536:280:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:for competitors’ deposit accounts, by increasing ATM costs associated with those other accounts.
7:204:16163:18:19:68:536:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Banks consider this, and it gives them an incentive to impose surcharges in order to attract deposit
7:205:16263:19:18:68:536:243:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:account customers from competitors. Attracting such consumers is valuable because afirm can
7:206:16354:18:18:68:536:225:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:engage in price discrimination for ATM services on its deposit account customers, but not on its
7:207:16450:18:26:68:160:207:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:foreign ATM users.
7:208:16468:26:22:85:536:181:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The conclusions reached by Massoud and Bernhardt are broadly consistent with those reached
7:209:16558:22:11:68:271:159:82:g_d0_f9:82:g_d0_f7:figure in Massoud, Saunders and Scholnick (2006).
7:210:16607:11:18:77:536:148:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:16A report by the Congressional Budget Office (1998) details these allegations and discusses national and local
7:211:16718:18:11:68:128:130:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:policy debates.
7:212:16733:11:15:77:350:119:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:17To our knowledge Matutes and Regibeau (1988) coined this term.
7:213:16797:15:14:77:389:104:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:18See Katz and Shapiro (1994) and Farrell and Klemperer (2005) for surveys.
7:214:16872:14:19:77:535:90:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:19How providers of complementary products set separate prices for their goods is not a relevant issue in our case,
7:215:16986:19:0:68:422:71:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:because own ATM access and deposit account services are almost never sold separately.
8:216:17072:0:19:68:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:by other theoretical models in whichfirms choose compatibility.  First, the strategic motive is
8:217:17167:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:highly dependent on market structure; incompatibility is typically unattractive when one or more
8:218:17263:18:18:68:536:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of the component markets is perfectly competitive.  Massoud and Bernhardt assume imperfect
8:219:17353:18:18:68:536:635:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:competition, but it is quite easy to see that in their model the incentive for leveraging disappears
8:220:17453:18:19:68:535:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:if the deposit account market is competitive. Second, Massoud and Bernhardt alsofind that large
8:221:17548:19:18:68:536:598:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f1:firms (i.e., those with greater market power) have greater incentives for incompatibility. This is
8:222:17646:18:25:68:256:580:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:also a common feature of other studies.
8:223:17685:25:19:85:536:555:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:This result (and the intuition behind our empirics) is general to other settings. Economides,
8:224:17778:19:18:68:536:536:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Lopomo and Woroch (1996) examine a very similar theoretical question, but in the context of
8:225:17869:18:18:68:536:518:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:telecommunications access. In telecommunications, the owner of a bottleneck facility (such as local
8:226:17968:18:19:68:536:500:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:switches) may charge an excessive price for access to that facility–excessive, in the sense that it
8:227:18067:19:18:68:536:481:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:is motivated by a desire to steal customers in a related market from competitors, and exceeds the
8:228:18164:18:41:68:326:463:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:stand-alone monopoly price for the bottleneck facility.

8:230:18277:32:19:68:536:390:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:While there is substantial theoretical support for strategic incompatibility, there has been very
8:231:18374:19:18:68:536:371:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:little empirical work on the subject. Here we provide a framework that is directly applicable in any
8:232:18474:18:18:68:535:353:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:instance wherefirms might use interconnection degradation or access pricing as the mechanism for
8:233:18570:18:19:68:536:335:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:incompatibility. The intuition is closely relatedto the empirical framework independently developed
8:234:18669:19:25:68:451:316:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:by Genakos et al. (2004) for identifying strategic interoperability degradation.20

8:237:18955:19:14:68:536:254:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:PC OS monopolist reduces interoperability of the PC OS with competitors’ server OSs. This reduces the attractiveness
8:238:19071:14:15:68:536:240:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:of the competitors’ server OS product and increases profits. In our case, the ATM owner reduces the interoperability
8:239:19187:15:15:68:539:225:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:of its ATMs with competitors’ cards, reducing theattractiveness of those cards and increasing profits.Inbothcases,
8:240:19301:15:15:68:467:210:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:a key empirical prediction is that market share and the leveraging motive are positively correlated.
8:241:19401:15:15:77:536:195:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Despite the similarity of the two studies there are both conceptual differences and differences in implementation.
8:242:19515:15:14:68:536:180:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:First, the motive for reduced interoperability in Genakos et al. is foreclosureto achieve price discrimination. In our
8:243:19633:14:15:68:536:166:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:setting inducing exit is not a motive. Price discrimination is important, however; as Massoud and Bernhardt discuss,
8:244:19749:15:15:68:536:151:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:banks can engage in second degree price discrimination against their deposit account customers but not foreign ATM
8:245:19863:15:15:68:536:136:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:users. It is this that motivates stealing customers from otherfirms. A second conceptual difference is that Genakos et
8:246:19981:15:15:68:536:121:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:al. estimate an incentive for reducing interoperability, in partial equilibrium. Theyfind that such an incentive exists
8:247:20100:15:14:68:536:106:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:and is large. Our approach examines the actual levelof interoperability (because we observe a quantifiable metric of
8:248:20216:14:0:68:414:92:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:it), and estimates by how much interoperability is distorted by the leveraging motive.

9:252:20500:18:19:68:536:611:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:using the bank’s ATMs. In all of this analysis, we abstract away from the existence of foreign fees,
9:253:20600:19:25:68:492:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to highlight the role of surcharges. We do account for them in the empirical work below.
9:254:20688:25:18:85:536:567:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:While a surcharge does not directly affect a bank’s own deposit account demand and profits,
9:255:20779:18:18:68:536:549:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:it can make its competitors’ deposit accounts lessvaluable to their customers, by increasing the
9:256:20875:18:19:68:536:531:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:expected fees that they pay. This may increase deposit account profits by making the surcharging
9:257:20971:19:18:68:536:512:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:bank’s deposit accounts relatively more attractive. If the bank maximizes profits across the two

10:321:22593:18:18:68:536:476:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:surcharge and the stand-alone surcharge. If incompatibility increases deposit account demand the
10:322:22689:18:24:68:387:458:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f12:incompatibility premium will be positive, i.e.Z∗i>0ands∗∗i>s∗i.

10:347:24243:18:18:68:536:107:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:a strategic motive is to compare actual surcharges to estimated optimal stand-alone surcharges; if

11:354:24901:18:19:68:536:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:actual on estimated stand-alone surcharges should be one. If on the other hand actual surcharges
11:355:24997:19:18:68:536:598:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:reflect a strategic motive, then a model reflecting the additional term in equation (8) shouldfit
11:356:25094:18:18:68:536:580:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the data better. We can also use this model to uncover some parameters of interest–the partial
11:357:25188:18:26:68:293:562:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:derivatives of profit with respect to surcharges.
11:358:25237:26:18:85:536:536:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Finally, we use data from the three years following surcharging’s inception to examine the
11:359:25327:18:18:68:536:518:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:equilibrium effects of both surcharging and strategic incompatibility in deposit markets.  These
11:360:25423:18:19:68:536:500:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:tests are motivated by the fact that whilefirms may have private incentives for incompatibility,
11:361:25519:19:18:68:535:481:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the multi-firm equilibrium effects of such behavior are ambiguous.23We examine two deposit
11:362:25609:18:18:68:536:463:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:account outcomes: ATM cards (deposit accounts) and average deposit account fees. To estimate the
11:363:25705:18:18:68:536:445:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:equilibrium effects, we examine how changes in the variables over the period following surcharging
11:364:25803:18:48:68:463:427:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:are correlated with the levels of both surcharges and the incompatibility premium.

11:366:25906:37:32:68:282:342:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:3.1  Data and Descriptive Statistics
11:367:25942:32:18:68:536:310:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We take our data from the Card Industry Directory, an annual publication listing data for the
11:368:26035:18:19:68:536:292:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:largest ATM card issuers in the United States. The Card Industry Directory contains information
11:369:26130:19:18:68:536:273:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:on total ATM cards, total ATMs owned and ATM fees (surcharge and foreign). It also contains the
11:370:26225:18:18:68:536:255:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:total number of transactions on the bank’s ATMs. We cross-reference these data with the FDIC
11:371:26317:18:19:68:536:237:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Reports of Condition and Income (or “Call Reports”), and the FDIC Summary of Deposits data.
11:372:26408:19:18:68:536:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:These other sources provide us with bank-level information about local markets. Most important,
11:373:26503:18:18:68:536:200:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:we observe both a bank’s deposit share (across all of its local markets if it operates in more than
11:374:26602:18:19:68:536:182:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:one) and the population density of the markets that the bank serves. Market share is important
11:375:26696:19:18:68:536:163:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:because in much of our analysis we compare the behavior of banks with high market share to that
11:376:26791:18:18:68:536:145:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of banks with low market share–the idea being that large banks should have a stronger incentive
11:377:26886:18:19:77:536:127:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:23In many models wherefirms choose compatibility but are symmetric, a prisoners dilemma-type effect occurs
11:378:26992:19:14:68:536:108:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:where allfirms choose incompatibility, but it has no equilibrium effects on market shares (though welfare and prices
11:379:27108:14:0:68:425:94:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:may change). This occurs in Massoud and Bernhardt (2002) when banks are symmetric.
12:380:27192:0:19:68:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:for incompatibility.24Population density is also important because ATM use involves travel and
12:381:27286:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:travel costs may be higher in dense markets; in related work, we have found that population density
12:382:27385:18:25:68:500:653:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:is strongly correlated with cross-market differences in ATM and deposit account pricing.25
12:383:27475:25:19:85:536:628:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:A further advantage of the cross-indexed data is that it allows us to estimate the foreign fees
12:384:27570:19:18:68:536:609:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and surcharges charged by a bank’s competitors in its local markets. We do this by exploiting the
12:385:27667:18:18:68:536:591:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:fact that bank size is strongly correlated with both surcharging and foreign fees (as we illustrate
12:386:27766:18:18:68:536:573:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:in Table 1 below). Thus, the size distribution of a bank’s local competitors is a good proxy for
12:387:27862:18:19:68:536:555:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the fees charged by those competitors.26As it turns out, this is not critical for our analysis, as
12:388:27960:19:18:68:536:536:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:we are primarily interested in how a bank’s own surcharges affect its own transaction demand.
12:389:28053:18:18:68:536:518:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Further, there is not much scope for mis-measuring within-bank variation in competitors’ fees over
12:390:28151:18:19:68:536:500:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:time, because foreign fees do not change much at all in our sample, and variation in competitors’
12:391:28248:19:18:68:536:481:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:surcharging is almost exclusively a 0/1 transition before and after 1996. Nonetheless this measure
12:392:28346:18:25:68:372:463:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:does provide us with some useful complementary information.27
12:393:28407:25:19:85:536:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Table 1 presents summary data for our relevant bank-level variables during the sample period
12:394:28499:19:18:68:536:419:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1994-1999. The data are an unbalanced panel, with roughly 150 observations per year for 210 banks.
12:395:28597:18:18:68:536:401:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:In order to clarify some of the cross-sectional differences across card issuers, we classify banks as
12:396:28698:18:18:68:536:383:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:being “large” if they have a deposit share in their local markets that is above the sample median,
12:397:28796:18:19:68:536:365:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and “small” otherwise.28Large banks impose higher surcharges and foreign fees than smaller banks.
12:398:28893:19:18:68:536:346:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The former is consistent with strategic incompatibility, but could also reflect a systematic difference
12:399:28996:18:18:68:536:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:in the elasticity of residual demand for foreign transactions; it will be important to control for this
12:400:29099:18:18:68:536:310:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:possibility in the empirical work. The latter may reflect differential price discrimination, although
12:401:29200:18:19:77:535:292:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:24Ideally, we could exploit cross-sectional variation in relative deposit and ATM shares, but ATM and deposit
12:402:29309:19:11:68:322:273:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:shares are too highly correlated for this to be a useful exercise.
12:403:29375:11:14:77:315:262:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:25See Knittel and Stango (2003) for evidence on this point.
12:404:29434:14:19:77:536:248:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:26We estimate competitors’ fees by running a within-sample regression of fees on bank size dummies, local market
12:405:29546:19:15:68:536:229:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:population density, year effects and interactions between the variables. We then use these coefficients to predict out
12:406:29664:15:15:68:536:214:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:of sample for the remaining banks, and average thesefitted values by deposit share for each local market. We discuss
12:407:29780:15:10:68:305:199:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:the procedure in more detail in Knittel and Stango (2004).
12:408:29838:10:19:77:535:189:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:27As we discuss in Knittel and Stango (2004), our results are robust to a number of alternative imputation methods.
12:409:29953:19:15:68:536:170:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Moreover, our estimates of the key parameter here (the slope of residual demand for a bank’s own ATM transactions,
12:410:30067:15:14:68:536:155:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:with respect to its own surcharge) are identical whether we include estimated competitors’ fees or just condition only
12:411:30185:14:11:68:408:141:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:on fees that we observe with certainty (i.e., a bank’s own surcharge and foreign fee).
12:412:30271:11:19:77:536:130:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:28In our data, “large” banks are those with a local market share greater than thirteen percent.  We have also
12:413:30380:19:14:68:535:111:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:estimated bank’s local ATM shares and classified them based on that variable; the two are nearly perfectly correlated,
12:414:30498:14:0:68:314:97:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:so the results do not depend much on which measure we use.
13:415:30558:0:19:68:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:this is difficult to establish with certainty.29While surcharges change dramatically over the sample
13:416:30658:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:period, foreign fees rise only slightly (at roughly the inflation rate). Large banks begin the sample
13:417:30759:18:18:68:536:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:with a higher average level of transactions per ATM, but this relationship reverses by the end of the
13:418:30860:18:18:68:536:635:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:sample. Large banks appear to be more aggressive in deploying ATMs when measured relative to
13:419:30952:18:19:68:536:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:cards; the ratio of cards per ATM is lower for largebanks and falls for large banks, while remaining
13:420:31052:19:24:68:175:598:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:stable for small banks.
13:421:31075:24:18:85:536:574:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We present the data stratified in this way to illustrate two points. First, there are significant
13:422:31172:18:18:68:536:556:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:cross-sectional differences in the degree to which banks impose surcharges. These are largely con-
13:423:31270:18:19:68:536:538:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:sistent with theory; large banks impose higher surcharges. However, this should not be viewed as
13:424:31366:19:18:68:536:519:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:conclusive evidence of the strategic behavior that interests us, as cross-sectional differences in pric-
13:425:31470:18:18:68:535:501:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ing could stem from cross-sectional variation in the elasticity of residual demand. A second point
13:426:31568:18:19:68:536:483:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:regarding these data is that they illustrate thefirst-order effects of surcharges on consumer and
13:427:31665:19:18:68:536:464:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f1:firm behavior; per-ATM transactions fell by 30% after the advent of surcharges.30This provides a
13:428:31761:18:39:68:301:446:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:useful identifying source of variation in the data.

13:430:31870:32:18:68:536:375:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Beginning with Equation (7) above, if the residual demand for foreign transactions is linear, we
13:431:31966:18:26:68:392:357:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:can rewrite the expression for the optimal stand-alone surcharge as:

13:440:32245:19:18:68:536:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:slope of residual demandγiin the vein of Baker and Bresnahan (1988). Their approach specifies
13:441:32338:18:18:68:535:244:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:a relationship between quantity demanded, own prices, competitors’ prices, and controls.31In our
13:442:32434:18:18:68:536:226:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:case, we estimate the demand for foreign ATM transactions with respect to surcharges using the
13:443:32528:18:27:68:175:208:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:following specification:
13:444:32552:27:18:84:536:181:121:g_d0_f12:121:g_d0_f1:ATMTransit=α+γ1ForCostit+γ2ForCostit·Largei+γnForCostit·Densityqtileit(10)
13:445:32626:18:18:77:535:163:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:29We do not observe the bank-level menu of checking fees–some of these exhibit nonlinear pricing of foreign trans-
13:446:32740:18:15:68:539:145:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:actions. It is not uncommon for banks to givefivefreeforeigntransactionspermonthoncertaincheckingaccounts.
13:447:32846:15:15:68:536:130:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:In any event, as we noted above, our residual demand analysis uses within-firm changes in fees for identification;
13:448:32960:15:11:68:316:115:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:foreign fees do not change much at thefirm level in our data.
13:449:33021:11:14:77:528:104:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:30Some of this change is the result of greater ATM deployment; we control for this in the empirical work below.
13:450:33132:14:19:77:536:90:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:31Baker and Bresnahan use a double-log specification, which yields elasticities directly. We can not employ this

14:455:33541:18:18:68:535:624:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:variation in surcharges–in particular, whether high fees for large banks reflect strategic behavior–
14:456:33641:18:19:68:536:606:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:we allow the slope of the residual demand to vary byfirm size.33This allows us to identify whether
14:457:33739:19:18:68:536:587:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the cross-sectional variation in surcharges is driven by differences in residual demand or differences
14:458:33841:18:18:68:536:569:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:in the level of strategic incompatibility. We also allow the slope of residual demand to vary based

14:479:35618:19:11:68:350:207:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:specifications with only the surcharge; the results are nearly identical.
14:480:35691:11:18:77:536:196:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:33We are agnostic about the direction of such a difference. We might expect that the least price-sensitive customers
14:481:35807:18:15:68:536:178:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:would sort into large banks, to avoid paying surcharges. This would increase the elasticity of foreign transaction
14:482:35921:15:15:68:536:163:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:demand for large banks, because a large bank’s foreign transactions would be made by the price-sensitive customers
14:483:36035:15:15:68:536:148:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:of small banks and vice versa. On the other hand, we remain open to the possibility that large banks face less elastic
14:484:36153:15:10:68:362:133:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:demand–perhaps because they deploy their ATMs in superior locations.
14:485:36221:10:19:77:535:123:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:34We have also allowed the slope to vary by population density tertile or quartile rather than quintile. We have
14:486:36333:19:10:68:188:104:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:also usedfiner size categories.
14:487:36364:10:19:77:536:94:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:35More precisely, we can write total demand as the sum of demand by own and foreign customers:QTit=QOit+QAit.

15:515:37863:26:18:85:536:419:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We have experimented with different sets of instruments with no effect on the results; this

15:523:38495:18:18:68:535:236:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:coefficient becomes more negative. Model 3 includes competitors’ foreign cost, cards per ATM and
15:524:38591:18:18:68:536:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ln (ATMs). Model 4 restricts the sample to include only those banks that impose surcharges at
15:525:38684:18:19:68:536:200:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:some point during the sample period.38Because some of our analysis uses the sample of banks in
15:526:38778:19:18:77:536:181:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:36These variables are all statistically significant in cross-sectional regressions with either surcharges or cards per
15:527:38896:18:11:68:198:163:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:ATM as the dependent variable.
15:528:38926:11:18:77:535:152:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:37We have also treated ln(ATMs) as endogenous. This increases all of the estimated standard errors in the model
15:529:39037:18:11:68:361:134:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:but does not change the point estimate on the slope of residual demand.
15:530:39108:11:19:77:536:123:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:38It is somewhat puzzling that some banks do not surcharge, particularly when our model predicts that surcharging
15:531:39221:19:14:68:536:104:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:at some level is optimal for nearly all banks. There may be other reasons for such behavior. Many banks, for example,
15:532:39338:14:0:68:377:90:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:seem to use low ATM fees as a marketing device to signal generally low fees.

16:534:39511:19:25:68:130:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:observations.
16:535:39524:25:18:85:536:646:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:In every specification, the estimated coefficient onForCostitis negative and statistically sig-
16:536:39619:18:19:68:536:628:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:nificant. The large bank interaction is negative, suggesting that banks with higher market share
16:537:39715:19:18:68:536:609:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:may face more elastic demand for ATMs. While the population density interaction terms are only
16:538:39809:18:18:68:536:591:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:statistically significant for the densest quintile, the pattern of coefficients suggests that demand is
16:539:39912:18:18:68:536:573:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:less elastic in dense areas; this accords with the general pattern of results we have found in previ-
16:540:40013:18:19:68:536:555:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ous work.39Cards per ATM are positively correlated with transactions per ATM. The cross-price
16:541:40106:19:18:68:536:536:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:coefficient is positive, and significant in the last column, as theory would predict. ATMs are not
16:542:40204:18:25:68:215:518:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:significant in any specification.
16:543:40237:25:19:85:536:493:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Reading from the third column, we estimate an economically significant effect of fees on trans-
16:544:40332:19:18:68:536:474:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:action demand. We estimate that a one dollar increase in fees reduces foreign transactions per
16:545:40426:18:18:68:536:456:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:machine by roughly 1000 per month. The 1000 transaction point estimate is quite large relative
16:546:40520:18:18:68:535:438:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:to the typical number of foreign transactions per machine, which averages 2000 in our sample.40
16:547:40615:18:19:68:536:420:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Using this coefficient estimate and those on the interaction terms, we construct our estimate of the

16:549:40815:18:18:68:536:383:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1999, the last year in the sample; this allows for the possibility that there was a gradual adjustment
16:550:40917:18:19:68:536:365:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to the surcharging equilibrium over the period 1997-1999. We then usebγito estimate the optimal

16:552:41111:18:18:68:536:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:mation on interchange fees and marginal cost, and also requires an estimate of the share of total
16:553:41208:18:19:68:536:310:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ATM transactions that are foreign. ForkandcA,we use values of $0.40 and $0.10. The $0.40figure
16:554:41302:19:18:68:535:291:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:is the median value of the interchange fee across networks.41While we do not observe marginal
16:555:41395:18:18:68:536:273:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:cost directly, it is quite low, involving only the incremental cost of switching the transaction over

16:557:41585:18:19:68:536:237:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and marginal cost are virtually identicalacross issuers, meaning that they do not affect any of our

17:574:43109:18:18:68:536:573:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:who surcharge. We also stratify the results by ourlarge/small bank category. Large banks face more
17:575:43207:18:19:68:536:555:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:elastic demand and have fewer transactions per ATM; both of these push ˆs∗idown relative to small
17:576:43304:19:18:68:536:536:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks.44Large banks also impose higher surcharges. In concert, this leads to estimates ofZ∗ithat
17:577:43400:18:18:68:536:518:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:are substantially higher, on average, for large banks. The results suggest that large banks impose
17:578:43498:18:19:68:536:500:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:surcharges $0.28 higher than they would absent a strategic motive, while small banks undercharge
17:579:43594:19:18:68:539:481:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:by $0.52 relative to the optimum. Much of the latter negative effectcomesfromthefactthatwe
17:580:43684:18:18:68:536:463:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:include banks with no surcharge in the average; when we drop them, large banks have an average
17:581:43778:18:18:68:536:445:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:premium of $0.66, while small banks have an average close to zero ($-0.02). We are somewhat
17:582:43869:18:19:68:536:427:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:circumspect about interpreting the level of these estimates, which depend on our assumptions

17:584:44056:18:18:68:536:390:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:is independent of these assumptions, and quite robust to changes in the specifications we use to

17:586:44245:19:18:68:536:353:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f1:find evidence that actual surcharges exceed stand-alone surcharges, and this difference is positively
17:587:44346:18:16:68:209:335:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:correlated with market share.

17:589:44484:19:14:68:535:300:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:tions until 2001. In that year, the average share of foreigntransactions for large banks is 20%; for small banks it is
17:590:44602:14:11:68:335:286:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:30%. (Bothfigures are presumably lower than they were in 1999).
17:591:44665:11:19:77:536:275:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:43One issue we do not treat in this analysis is the fact thatmost surcharges are increments of $0.25, with modes at
17:592:44780:19:14:68:536:256:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:$1.00 and $1.50. An alternative approach to the one we takehere would account for such discreteness, but we do not
17:593:44894:14:15:68:539:242:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:have a good model that explains why surcharges are priced thisway.However,aslongasbanksizeisnotcorrelated

17:595:45114:11:18:77:536:216:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:44Although they are not of primary interest, we have calculated the corresponding demand elasticities in our sample.
17:596:45230:18:15:68:536:198:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Note that there are actually two such elasticities, because prices paid by consumers (ForCostit) do not correspond
17:597:45344:15:15:68:536:183:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:to prices received by banks (si+k). We call the former the “consumer demand elasticity” and the latter the “firm
17:598:45456:15:15:68:536:168:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:demand elasticity.” For large (small) banks in 1999, the consumer demand elasticity averages 2.9 (2.0) and thefirm
17:599:45570:15:0:68:215:153:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:demand elasticity averages 1.9 (1.2).

18:604:45938:18:44:68:457:603:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:a random component, we can rewrite the equation for the optimal surcharge as:45

18:619:46283:18:19:68:536:404:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:models using least squares and test the restrictions. We also estimate the model separately for the

18:622:46492:25:18:85:536:342:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Table 4 shows results from this model. As the second throughfifth columns show, for large
18:623:46581:18:19:68:535:324:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:banks the estimate ofβ2is positive and statistically significant. For small banks (columns 6-9)β2
18:624:46678:19:18:68:536:305:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:is not significantly different from zero. Comparing the significance ofβ2andβ3can in principle

18:631:46977:14:19:68:536:251:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:pricing here. We are somewhat cautious about making a definitive interpretation of the result,
18:632:47071:19:18:68:536:232:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:becauseβ2andβ3are identified from a restriction on functional form. But this result squares with
18:633:47167:18:41:68:299:214:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:what wefind when we look at market outcomes.

18:635:47254:32:18:68:536:141:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:All of the analysis to this point focuses on partial equilibrium incentives for incompatibility, and
18:636:47354:18:19:68:535:123:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:how they distort pricing relative to stand-alone ATM operations. But because banks compete with
18:637:47449:19:14:77:426:104:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:45While theory suggests a coefficient restriction (β1= 1), we relax the restriction here.
18:638:47538:14:19:77:535:90:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:46We have also estimated models that attempt to include deposit account fees as a proxy for price-cost margins.

19:641:47805:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Because we lack the data to estimate a fully specified model of equilibrium changes in deposit

19:655:48365:18:19:68:536:403:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:a log-difference, and changes in deposit fees as the level change in dollars of revenue per $1000 of

19:661:48877:18:18:68:536:286:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:see a zero coefficient on the variable. Suppose, however, that some banks have high unobserved
19:662:48971:18:19:68:536:268:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:quality (on ATMs and other dimensions). This would be reflected in both a high surcharge and
19:663:49063:19:18:68:536:249:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:increases in deposit account price and quantity.  To control for this possibility, we also include
19:664:49161:18:18:68:536:231:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the actual surcharge. The exercise therefore compares changes in deposit market variables, holding

19:666:49358:19:18:68:536:194:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:as engaging in strategic incompatibility and oneof which we do not, which experiences the greater

20:674:50077:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:surcharges and incompatibility premia. Large banks also have higher fees and more cards. Table 5
20:675:50173:18:25:68:517:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:also shows that large banks exhibited larger growth in both cards and fees from 1996 to 1999.

20:680:50642:18:19:68:536:555:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks with high incompatibility premia (above the sample median for those banks with surcharges)
20:681:50738:19:18:68:536:536:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:also have high surcharges. They also tend to be bigger in their local markets and bigger overall,
20:682:50835:18:18:68:536:518:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:although this difference is not as pronounced as in the large/small stratification. Their deposit
20:683:50932:18:19:68:536:500:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:account fees, however, are no different than those of banks with lowˆZi, although all banks who
20:684:51027:19:18:68:536:481:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:surcharge tend to have higher fees than those who do not. The raw changes in prices and quantity
20:685:51123:18:15:68:536:463:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:(cards) after 1996 are consistent with strategic incompatibility. Banks who surcharge but with low
20:686:51221:15:21:70:536:448:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ˆZiexperience changes in cards and fees that are roughly equal to those experienced by banks that
20:687:51318:21:19:68:536:427:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:do not surcharge at all, but banks with highˆZiexperience relatively greater increases in both cards
20:688:51418:19:25:68:122:408:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and ATMs.
20:689:51427:25:18:85:536:383:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Table 6 summarizes the regression results. Thefirst row shows a specification that pools large
20:690:51521:18:19:68:536:365:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and small bank and includes only the actual surcharge as an explanatory variable. The second
20:691:51613:19:18:68:536:346:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:includesˆZi, and the remaining columns split the sample by large/small bank. The results show
20:692:51706:18:18:68:535:328:121:g_d0_f1:65:g_d0_f4:no significant relationship between changes in deposit accounts andˆZi(or surcharging overall).49
20:693:51803:18:18:68:536:310:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:This result holds even when we split the sample. In contrast, the results suggest a statistically
20:694:51900:18:19:77:536:292:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:48One might wonder why we observe any banks without surcharges, given our estimates of the slope of residual
20:695:52008:19:15:68:536:273:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:demand. While our results suggest that banks without surcharges have lower-than-average optimal surcharges, very
20:696:52120:15:15:68:281:258:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:few have estimated optimal surcharges that are zero.
20:697:52172:15:14:77:536:243:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:One explanation for this is that banks do receive revenuefrom foreign transactions through the interchange fee,
20:698:52283:14:15:68:536:229:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:even when surcharges are zero. We may be underestimating the slope of residual demand at very low prices (it is
20:699:52394:15:15:68:179:214:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:estimated at higher prices).
20:700:52422:15:15:77:536:199:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:Another possible explanationis that at least some banks apparently use a“no-surcharge” pricing policy as a signal
20:701:52535:15:15:68:536:184:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:that they generally have low fees (since surcharges are a more visible component of fees). One notable example of
20:702:52648:15:14:68:536:169:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:this is Washington Mutual, which features the fact that it does not surcharge prominently in its checking account
20:703:52761:14:15:68:536:155:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:marketing (despite the fact that its prospective checking account customers shouldfindotherbanks’ deposit accounts
20:704:52875:15:11:68:136:140:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:more attractive).
20:705:52892:11:18:77:536:129:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:49This result contrasts with that in Massoud, Saunders and Scholnick (2005), whofind a positive correlation. On
20:706:53003:18:15:68:536:111:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:the other hand, Prager (2001)finds that small banks experienced no loss in market share in those states that allowed
20:707:53119:15:15:68:536:96:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:surcharging prior to 1996. Hannan (2005)finds that concentration is positively correlated with surcharging across
20:708:53232:15:0:68:94:81:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:states.
21:709:53241:0:19:68:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and economically significant correlation betweenˆZiand changes in deposit account fees–for large

21:712:53387:32:18:68:536:599:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:One might also ask how ATM deployment after 1996 is correlated with our estimates of the in-
21:713:53479:18:19:68:536:581:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:compatibility premium.50The raw data suggest that this is the case; banks with high estimated
21:714:53572:19:18:68:536:562:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:leveraging premia increased their ATMfleets by 70 percent on average between 1996 and 1999,
21:715:53663:18:18:68:536:544:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:while those with lowˆZiincreased theirs by 37 percent and those who did not surcharge by 32
21:716:53754:18:18:68:536:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:percent. We have also estimated a variant of the model above with the change in ATM deployment
21:717:53848:18:53:68:193:508:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:as the dependent variable:

21:720:53957:34:19:85:536:399:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The results of this model show no systematic relationship between actual surcharges and changes
21:721:54052:19:18:68:535:380:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:in ATM deployment, but a coefficient onˆZiof 0.38 for large banks, significant at the 5 percent
21:722:54147:18:47:68:430:362:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:level. The coefficient for small banks is 0.27 but not statistically significant.

21:724:54239:36:18:68:536:279:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Identifying situations in whichfirms use incompatibility strategically is critical for developing sound
21:725:54342:18:18:68:536:261:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:antitrust and public policy toward compatibility.  Here, we present a simple economic frame-
21:726:54434:18:19:68:536:243:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:work for analyzing whether a particular form of incompatibility–an access charge for off-network
21:727:54530:19:18:68:536:224:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:transactions–is intended to shift competitive advantage in a related market. Our results are con-
21:728:54627:18:25:68:400:206:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:sistent with such behavior in ATM markets, but only for large banks.
21:729:54695:25:18:85:536:181:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We see a few directions for future work in the area. First, our analysis largely abstracts from
21:730:54790:18:18:68:536:163:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the dynamic issues inherent in compatibility choice. In almost any market with network effects
21:731:54884:18:19:68:535:145:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:there are strong intertemporal demand links, both because of network effects and often because of
21:732:54981:19:18:68:536:126:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:switching costs. Incorporating these features into an empirical model would improve it. A second
21:733:55077:18:18:68:536:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:limitation is that here we pursue a reduced form approach to many of the questions we raise (such
21:734:55174:18:19:77:535:90:36:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:50We take a simple approach to this question given our smallsample size. Other work (e.g., Ishii (2005)) endogenizes
21:735:55290:19:0:68:256:71:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:the deployment decision in a structural model.
22:736:55338:0:19:68:536:690:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:as estimating equilibrium effects of incompatibility). Our small sample dictates this approach, but
22:737:55437:19:18:68:536:671:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:with more data one could certainly place more structure on the model. Genakos et al. (2004) is an
22:738:55534:18:18:68:536:653:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:example of one way to do this. Finally, the central question in all of this is whether incompatibility
22:739:55636:18:18:68:536:635:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:reduces social welfare. More work pursuing this question would greatly advance our understanding
22:740:55732:18:0:68:328:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of how policy should viewfirms’ compatibility choices.
