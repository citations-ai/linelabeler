2:39:2277:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:We test the effectiveness of self-help peer groups as a commitment device for precautionary savings,
2:40:2377:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:through two randomized field experiments among 2,687 microentrepreneurs in Chile. The first experiment
2:41:2479:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:finds that self-help peer groups are a powerful tool to increase savings (the number of deposits grows
2:42:2581:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:3.5-fold and the average savings balance almost doubles). Conversely, a substantially higher interest
2:43:2682:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:rate has no effect on most participants. A second experiment tests an alternative delivery mechanism
2:44:2782:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:and shows that effects of a similar size can be achieved by holding people accountable through feedback
2:45:2885:14:42:72:330:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:text messages, without any meetings or peer pressure.

3:60:3164:0:36:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:61:3181:36:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Peer effects have been widely shown to affect behavior, for example with respect to pro-
3:62:3269:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ductivity at work (e.g., Falk and Ichino, 2005; Mas and Moretti, 2009; Bandiera et al.,
3:63:3356:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2010), alcohol consumption (e.g., Sacerdote, 2001; Kremer and Levy, 2008), contributions
3:64:3444:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to public goods (e.g., Frey and Meier, 2004a; Shang and Croson, 2009; Chen et al., 2010;
3:65:3532:18:18:72:526:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Allcott, 2011; DellaVigna et al., 2012), and financial decision-making (e.g, Duflo and Saez,
3:66:3624:18:18:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2002, 2003; Hong et al., 2004; Bursztyn et al., 2012).  Individuals can use these effects
3:67:3713:18:18:72:526:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:strategically to overcome self-control problems by joining self-help peer groups as a com-
3:68:3803:18:18:72:526:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mitment device (Battaglini et al., 2005; Schelling, 1984), such as for example Alcoholics
3:69:3892:18:18:72:525:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Anonymous (AA), weight-loss groups, running groups, or savings clubs.1This approach is
3:70:3978:18:17:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particularly important where other formal commitment devices are inaccessible.  Notably
3:71:4065:17:18:72:526:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the area of savings, other mechanisms such as defaults and direct deposits from wages,
3:72:4154:18:18:72:526:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which have been found to be highly effective (e.g. Madrian and Shea, 2001; Thaler and
3:73:4239:18:18:72:526:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Benartzi, 2004),  are not available to the millions of people worldwide who work in the
3:74:4326:18:18:72:526:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:informal sector or as independent entrepreneurs, and therefore do not have a formal wage
3:75:4414:18:24:72:92:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bill.
3:76:4419:24:18:95:525:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We   conducted   two   randomized   field   experiments   among   low-income   micro-
3:77:4504:18:18:72:526:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:entrepreneurs  in  Chile  to  study  the  power  of  self-help  peer  groups  as  a  commitment
3:78:4599:18:18:72:526:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:device for precautionary savings.  Our first experiment,  the “Peer Group Experiment,”
3:79:4685:18:18:72:526:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shows  that  self-help  peer  groups  have  a  strong  impact  on  savings.   We  offered  2,687
3:80:4781:18:18:72:526:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:micro-entrepreneurs, who met regularly as members of a microcredit association, the op-
3:81:4868:18:18:72:526:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portunity to open a formal savings account. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
3:82:4957:18:18:72:526:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three conditions: 1) a control condition where individuals only received the basic account;
3:83:5048:18:18:72:526:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2) a Self-Help Peer Group Treatment where participants additionally had the option to
3:84:5133:18:17:72:526:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:publicly announce their savings commitment,  which was then monitored in the weekly
3:85:5216:17:18:72:526:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:meetings; and 3) a High Interest Rate Treatment with a 5% real interest rate (instead of
3:86:5304:18:18:72:526:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the 0.3% in the basic account), which serves as a benchmark to measure the effectiveness
3:87:5392:18:18:72:225:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the Peer Group Treatment.
3:88:5420:18:16:85:525:182:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1Many  “Use  buddies  and  teams:   exercise  together,  order  each  other’s  lunches”  (Schelling,  1984,
3:89:5527:16:12:72:525:166:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:p.7).For   example,   AA   has   more   than   2m   members   world-wide,   1.3   of   them   in   the   US
3:90:5634:12:12:72:526:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(www.aa.org),  and  each  week  an  average  of  1.3m  participants  attend  a  Weight  Watchers  meeting
3:91:5739:12:12:72:526:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(www.weightwatchersinternational.com).  Some have argued that an important function of ROSCAs (Ro-
3:92:5837:12:12:72:526:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:tating  Savings  and  Credit  Associations)  is  also  to  serve  as  peer  group  commitment  device  (Gugerty,
3:93:5949:12:0:72:99:118:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:2007).
4:94:5956:0:18:95:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Participants assigned to the Peer Group Treatment deposit 3.5 times more often into
4:95:6039:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the savings account, and their average savings balance is almost twice that of the con-
4:96:6126:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trol group.  The Treatment-on-the-Treated effect of 7,400 Chilean pesos (about 15 USD)
4:97:6212:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:represents about 8% of monthly income and corresponds in size to the type of expendi-
4:98:6297:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tures participants had expressed wanting to build a buffer stock for, such as unexpected
4:99:6385:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:doctor’s visits and payments for heating, electricity or food during periods of short-term
4:100:6475:18:18:72:525:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income  fluctuation.2In  contrast,  for  most  participants,  the  strongly  increased  interest
4:101:6571:18:18:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rate has a surprisingly small effect.  While average savings increase somewhat, suggesting
4:102:6661:18:18:72:526:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by  linear  extrapolation  that  the  effect  of  self-help  peer  groups  would  correspond  to  an
4:103:6761:18:18:72:526:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate increase of about eight percentage points, quantile analysis reveals that most
4:104:6853:18:18:72:526:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participants do not respond to the interest rate at all, neither in terms of amount saved,
4:105:6943:18:24:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nor by reallocating their savings (for those who had a pre-existing lower-interest account).
4:106:7035:24:17:95:525:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our second “Feedback Message Experiment” was conducted one year after the open-
4:107:7114:17:18:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing of the accounts and was designed to distinguish some of the mechanism behind the
4:108:7198:18:18:72:526:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effectiveness  of  self-help  peer  groups.   Such  group  meetings  always  consist  of  a  bundle
4:109:7297:18:18:72:526:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of different, potentially important elements:  being observed by others/peer pressure, ob-
4:110:7387:18:18:72:526:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:serving  the  behavior  of  others,  goal  setting,  regular  feedback  and  holding  participants
4:111:7485:18:18:72:526:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:accountable for following through with their goals, information sharing, rewards, moral
4:112:7572:18:18:72:526:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:support, etc.  The Feedback Message Experiment strips the treatment of many of these
4:113:7656:18:18:72:526:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aspects in order to get more information about what might be driving the effect.  Partici-
4:114:7746:18:18:72:526:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pants were assigned to one of two types of weekly feedback text messages, or to a control
4:115:7835:18:18:72:526:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:group.  The results show that holding people accountable through the weekly feedback
4:116:7919:18:18:72:526:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:messages increases savings almost as much as self-help peer groups – even without any
4:117:8004:18:24:72:165:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:physical meetings.
4:118:8022:24:18:95:525:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to the regular feedback and follow-up,  we distinguished one treatment
4:119:8104:18:18:72:526:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that includes the aspect of peer pressure – others observing the performance of the partici-
4:120:8196:18:17:72:526:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pant (Schelling, 1984) – from a second treatment that includes the aspect of observing the
4:121:8286:17:18:72:526:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:performance of others (Battaglini et al., 2005).  Surprisingly, we find that the feedback
4:122:8375:18:18:72:526:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:message  coupled  with  peer  pressure  by  a  real-life  “Savings  Buddy”,  who  was  regularly
4:123:8471:18:18:72:526:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:informed about the performance of the participant, has no larger effect than the feedback
4:124:8560:18:18:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:message that simply informs participants of their own achievement and the success rate
4:125:8646:18:16:85:525:140:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:2While large amounts of savings would be suboptimal for a population that is borrowing at the same
4:126:8744:16:12:72:526:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:time, this type of precautionary savings is valuable at any level of debt, because of the different liquidity
4:127:8853:12:0:72:232:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of savings and loans (Zinman, 2007).
5:128:8890:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of other participants.  These results suggest that while peer groups can provide a highly
5:129:8979:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effective commitment device, neither in-person meetings nor peer pressure seem to be in-
5:130:9067:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispensable features, and regular accountability and follow-up seem to play an important
5:131:9155:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:role.  Modern technology – in the form of text messages or other feedback devices – may
5:132:9242:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore render the accountability mechanism of self-help peer groups more scalable and
5:133:9330:18:24:72:363:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:potentially attractive to larger and different populations.
5:134:9389:24:18:95:525:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This  paper  makes  contributions  in  three  areas.   First,  it  provides  evidence  on  the
5:135:9483:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:role of peers to overcome self-control problems.  Despite the large prevalence of self-help
5:136:9574:18:18:72:526:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:peer groups as a commitment device, there is surprisingly little evidence evaluating their
5:137:9664:18:18:72:525:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effectiveness.3Our findings show that self-help peer groups can provide a way in which
5:138:9750:18:18:72:526:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individuals can leverage their peers to support them towards an individual but mutually
5:139:9837:18:18:72:526:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shared  goal.   After  having  found  an  effective  policy  to  increase  precautionary  savings,
5:140:9935:18:17:72:526:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it  is  helpful  to  understand  what  mechanism  might  be  driving  the  result,  in  order  to
5:141:10032:17:18:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gain a better understanding about how the policy might be implemented or scaled most
5:142:10116:18:18:72:526:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effectively (Ludwig et al., 2011).  The Feedback Message Experiment takes a step in that
5:143:10204:18:18:72:526:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:direction.  It starts to unbundle some of the mechanisms and at the same time provides
5:144:10290:18:18:72:526:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an alternative delivery mechanism of the service provided by peer group meetings, that
5:145:10376:18:18:72:526:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proves  to  be  almost  as  effective.   Combined  with  evidence  that  information  about  the
5:146:10472:18:18:72:525:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:savings behavior of peers has only limited effects (Beshears et al., 2009)4and that even
5:147:10560:18:18:72:525:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simple regular reminders can increase savings (Karlan et al., 2010)5, the results suggest
5:148:10649:18:18:72:526:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the regular feedback and follow-up could be more important to the success of self-help
5:149:10740:18:24:72:271:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:peer groups than the peers themselves.
5:150:10778:24:18:95:525:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, this paper speaks to the literature on commitment devices for saving.  While
5:151:10862:18:18:72:526:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:much of the literature on savings commitment devices in developed countries has studied
5:152:10949:18:18:72:525:265:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:B:deposit commitment devices(e.g., Madrian and Shea, 2001; Thaler and Benartzi, 2004;
5:153:11032:18:16:85:525:247:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:3Walsh et al. (1991) compare the effect of AA meetings to a hospital treatment.  The effect of AA
5:154:11129:16:12:72:525:231:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:meetingsper seis not tested, however. Jebb et al. (2011) compare a commercial Weight Watchers (WW)
5:155:11227:12:8:72:339:219:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:program to a standard program of care for obese individuals.
5:156:11287:8:16:85:525:211:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:4The evidence on peer information is in general mixed.  While positive effects have been found in some
5:157:11389:16:12:72:526:195:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:domains,  such as electricity usage when bundled with tips to save energy (Ayres et al., 2009; Allcott,
5:158:11492:12:12:72:526:183:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:2011)  or  contributions  to  public  goods  (Frey  and  Meier,  2004b),  peer  information  has  been  shown  to
5:159:11605:12:11:72:526:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reduce work effort (Barankay, 2010) or lower take-up of tax credits (Manoli and Bhargava, 2011).  For a

5:161:11808:9:15:85:525:151:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:5Reminders have also been found to be effective in other areas, for example to decrease overdraft bank
5:162:11910:15:12:72:526:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:fees (Stango and Zinman, 2011),  or to improve books returns to the library (Apesteguia et al., 2010),
5:163:12012:12:12:72:526:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:repayment of loans (Cadena and Schoar, 2011), goal achievement in the workplace (Cadena et al., 2011),
5:164:12114:12:0:72:269:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:and vaccination rates (Milkman et al., 2011).
6:165:12160:0:18:72:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:B:Carroll et al., 2009), most of the literature on developing countries has focused onwith-
6:166:12249:18:18:72:525:690:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:B:drawal commitment devices(see, e.g., Ashraf et al., 2006b; Dupas and Robinson, 2012b;
6:167:12334:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Brune et al., 2011, and  Bryan et al., 2010 for a review article).  With the notable excep-
6:168:12425:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion of Ashraf et al. (2006a), who study the determinants of take-up for deposit collectors
6:169:12516:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the Philippines,  our paper provides one of the first analyses of the effectiveness of a
6:170:12607:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deposit  commitment  device  for  developing  countries.   Deposit  commitment  devices  are
6:171:12699:18:18:72:526:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particularly important for precautionary savings, since in contrast to withdrawal commit-
6:172:12788:18:18:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment devices, they limit the risk that the commitment device creates large welfare losses
6:173:12877:18:18:72:526:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if an emergency arises, as the savings are always available in times of need.  This paper
6:174:12966:18:18:72:526:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demonstrates the effectiveness of a deposit commitment device that does not rely on a
6:175:13051:18:18:72:526:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:formal wage bill, and is therefore available to those working in the informal sector, the
6:176:13140:18:24:72:293:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unemployed, or independent entrepreneurs.
6:177:13181:24:17:95:525:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Third,  the  results  on  the  interest  rate  contribute  to  the  discussion  on  the  relative
6:178:13278:17:18:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:impact of ‘social’ or behavioral versus monetary incentives.  While the finding that the
6:179:13366:18:18:72:524:451:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:interest rate has limited effectiveness for most individuals is of interest in and of itself,6
6:180:13460:18:18:71:525:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it fits into a larger pattern of evidence showing the importance of social incentives (e.g.,
6:181:13552:18:18:71:525:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Bandiera et al., 2010; Barankay, 2010; Gneezy and Rey-Biel, 2011) and surprising limita-
6:182:13640:18:18:71:525:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions of monetary rewards for behavioral change and even for financial decisions (Gneezy
6:183:13728:18:18:71:525:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2010).  A new and rapidly growing literature uses field experiments
6:184:13822:18:18:71:525:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to directly compare social and financial incentives (e.g. Bertrand et al., 2010; Ashraf et
6:185:13912:18:18:71:525:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:al., 2012).  Beyond its general interest, this comparison is particularly relevant in the area
6:186:14006:18:18:71:525:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of savings, as it has implications for the large number of government programs aimed at
6:187:14093:18:24:71:176:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:encouraging savings.
6:188:14113:24:18:95:525:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 presents set-up and
6:189:14195:18:18:71:525:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:design  of  both  field  experiments.   Section  3  and  4  show  the  results  of  the  Peer  Group
6:190:14295:18:35:71:525:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Experiment and the Feedback Message Experiment respectively, and Section 5 concludes.
6:191:14380:35:16:85:525:212:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:6There has been surprisingly little micro-empirical evidence on the impact of interest rates on savings.
6:192:14484:16:12:72:526:196:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:A notable exception is an experiment by Schaner (2011) in Kenya, which randomly varies interest rates
6:193:14585:12:0:72:391:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:to study decision-making in couples with heterogeneous time preferences.
7:194:14658:0:36:72:497:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:2    Background, Data, and Design of Experiments
7:195:14706:36:32:72:264:672:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2.1    Background and Data
7:196:14732:32:18:72:526:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Both randomized field experiments for this study were conducted in collaboration with
7:197:14817:18:18:72:526:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the microfinance institution Fondo Esperanza (FE), and a large commercial bank, Banco
7:198:14902:18:18:72:526:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Credichile.  The context of FE is particularly suitable to analyze the role of self-help peer
7:199:14995:18:18:72:526:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups as a savings commitment device for those outside the formal labor market.  The
7:200:15080:18:17:72:526:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:study participants were members of FE, and the savings accounts that were offered were
7:201:15166:17:18:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:held with Banco Credichile.  Members of FE are self-employed micro-entrepreneurs (e.g.,
7:202:15253:18:18:72:526:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:street vendors, cosmetic saleswomen), many of whom work in the informal sector.  They
7:203:15338:18:18:72:526:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:meet regularly, on a weekly or biweekly basis, in groups of about 10-20 peers, together
7:204:15425:18:18:72:526:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a group supervisor from FE. The purpose of the meetings is to enforce the regular
7:205:15511:18:18:72:526:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:repayment  of  the  micro-loans  that  participants  receive  from  FE  in  3-month  cycles  for
7:206:15607:18:18:72:526:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment  in  their  micro-enterprise.   This  feature  allowed  us  to  incorporate  the  peer
7:207:15704:18:24:72:255:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:group-based commitment structure.
7:208:15737:24:18:95:525:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Members expressed substantial desire to increase their savings.  Sixty-eight percent
7:209:15821:18:18:72:526:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:said they frequently regret not having saved more.  In focus groups conducted before the
7:210:15909:18:18:72:525:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intervention,7many mentioned the goal of building savings as a buffer stock for emergen-
7:211:15997:18:18:71:525:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cies. The main reason why they were looking to build savings, while borrowing at the same
7:212:16086:18:18:71:525:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time borrowing from the microfinance organization, is the difference in liquidity (see also
7:213:16177:18:17:71:525:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zinman, 2007).  The rigid schedule of the micro-loans renders them unsuitable to cover
7:214:16263:17:18:71:525:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:irregular or unexpected financial needs (Karlan and Mullainathan, 2009).  However, given
7:215:16351:18:18:71:525:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this  precautionary  motive,  the  optimal  amounts  of  savings  can  be  expected  to  be  low,
7:216:16448:18:18:71:525:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since for amounts beyond what is necessary for short-term smoothing, it would be more
7:217:16533:18:24:71:300:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:beneficial to reduce the amount of debt first.
7:218:16579:24:18:95:525:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This paper draws on three different sources of data. First, information on take-up and
7:219:16665:18:18:71:525:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all transactions in the accounts was obtained directly from Banco Credichile.  The second
7:220:16754:18:18:71:525:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:source of data came from FE’s administrative files, which include participants’ estimated
7:221:16843:18:18:71:525:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:household size, income, and years of education.  Unfortunately, data on loan size or default
7:222:16935:18:18:71:525:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates  was  not  available.   Finally,  we  complemented  these  two  sources  of  administrative
7:223:17032:18:18:71:525:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data  with  an  extensive  baseline  and  follow-up  survey,  conducted  by  the  independent
7:224:17125:18:18:71:525:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:survey agency Microdatos.  These surveys include questions about participants’ savings
7:225:17211:18:0:85:516:108:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:7The groups that participated in the focus groups were not included in the randomized evaluation.
8:226:17309:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and debt, their economic situation and recent economic difficulties, as well as a number
8:227:17397:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of questions about individuals’ preferences and self-assessment, such as attitudes towards
8:228:17487:18:24:72:371:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:savings and banks, financial literacy, time preferences, etc.
8:229:17548:24:18:95:525:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The timeline of the interventions was as follows (see Figure 1 for an illustration): The
8:230:17636:18:18:72:526:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline survey was conducted in April-May 2008, during one of the group meetings.  The
8:231:17723:18:18:72:526:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:savings accounts for the Peer Group Experiment were introduced soon after, in June-July
8:232:17810:18:18:72:526:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2008.   A  year  later,  the  follow-up  survey  was  conducted  through  individual  interviews
8:233:17906:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at participants’ home or workplace, to be able to cover all participants, including those
8:234:17995:18:18:72:526:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that had left FE in the meantime.  During this follow-up survey, eligible participants were
8:235:18086:18:34:72:447:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:introduced to the second experiment, the Feedback Message Experiment.

8:240:18325:18:17:72:526:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and was conducted among 196 groups with a total of 2,687 members of the microfinance
8:241:18409:17:18:72:526:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:organization  Fondo  Esperanza  (FE).  The  universe  of  study  participants  consists  of  all
8:242:18505:18:18:72:526:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:members of the 196 groups who were present in the meeting when the baseline survey
8:243:18587:18:24:72:150:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was conducted.
8:244:18601:24:18:95:525:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  the  weeks  following  the  baseline  survey,  one  of  three  types  of  savings  accounts
8:245:18696:18:18:72:526:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was introduced to the groups (see below).  Groups were randomly assigned to treatments,
8:246:18783:18:18:72:526:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and all members within a group were offered the same treatment, without knowing of the
8:247:18869:18:18:72:526:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:existence of the other types of accounts (see Figure 1 for a graphical representation of
8:248:18957:18:18:72:526:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the experimental design).  The randomization was stratified by group supervisor, which
8:249:19043:18:18:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:automatically led to balance by region as well.  Half of the groups were randomly selected
8:250:19133:18:18:72:526:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the Self-Help Peer Group Treatment while the rest were assigned to one of the other
8:251:19220:18:34:72:468:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two treatments in equal proportion.  The accounts had the following features:
8:252:19297:34:18:86:525:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:1.The basic savings accounthad  a  real  annual  interest  rate  of  0.3%  (similar  to  the
8:253:19389:18:18:101:525:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:highest available alternative in the Chilean market).  It was attractive compared to
8:254:19473:18:18:101:525:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:other options in the market in that it had no maintenance fee and no minimum bal-
8:255:19554:18:0:101:525:96:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:ance, except for a 2-dollar minimum opening deposit.  The account was completely
9:256:19635:0:18:101:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:liquid for withdrawals at any time, and the financial conditions were guaranteed for
9:257:19719:18:28:101:194:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:at least two years.

9:259:19827:18:18:101:525:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:companied by an accountability structure, in which the weekly meetings acted as a
9:260:19908:18:18:101:525:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:self-help peer group in the following way:  group members had the option of publicly
9:261:19992:18:18:101:525:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:announcing to the group what their weekly savings goal was for the coming three
9:262:20071:18:18:101:525:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:months.  Subsequently, members verified in each group meeting who had complied
9:263:20149:18:18:101:525:572:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:with their savings goal.  Those who complied, and showed a deposit slip as proof,
9:264:20230:18:18:101:525:554:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:received a sticker in a booklet, and those who collected enough stickers received a
9:265:20313:18:18:101:525:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:diploma as a non-monetary award.  There were no financial incentives for complying
9:266:20395:18:28:101:181:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:with one’s goal.
9:267:20411:28:18:86:525:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:3.The high-interest accountwas identical to the basic account, but offered a 5% real in-
9:268:20499:18:17:101:525:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:terest rate.  It was explicitly presented as “the Best Option in the Market”-Account,
9:269:20584:17:18:101:525:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:and when the account was introduced,  its high return was illustrated graphically
9:270:20665:18:18:101:525:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:and with great care by their FE group leader during a one-hour workshop in the
9:271:20743:18:18:101:525:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:weekly meeting, which included the visualization of a growing piggy-bank and an

9:275:20965:18:18:72:526:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Peer Group Experiment.  As expected given the random assignment, average character-

9:277:21149:18:37:72:355:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant differences, with the exception of group size.

9:279:21228:36:18:95:525:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Participants in the study are an average of 44 years old and have a mean of 9.7 years
9:280:21313:18:18:71:525:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of schooling.  Monthly income per capita of their households is 84,188 pesos (about 175
9:281:21400:18:18:71:525:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:USD), with an average household size of 4.3 people.  Sixty-eight percent of participants
9:282:21488:18:18:71:525:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:did not have a savings account prior to the study.8Correspondingly, the median of pre-
9:283:21574:18:18:72:526:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:existing savings was zero, with a mean of 68,980 pesos (while income is expressed in per

10:287:21936:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loan from FE, is 407,974 pesos, with a median of 185,000 pesos.  The larger amounts of
10:288:22022:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debt compared to savings is not surprising given that participants are entrepreneurs and
10:289:22110:18:24:72:395:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:most of their debt is backed up by inventories and future sales.
10:290:22174:24:18:95:525:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The average number of participants was 15 per group, with a slightly lower average in
10:291:22259:18:18:72:525:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups offered the basic savings account.9For the questions about participants’ attitudes
10:292:22348:18:18:72:526:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and preferences,  we conducted an F-test,  which clearly rejects the null hypothesis that
10:293:22437:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they are jointly significant in predicting whether a group had been assigned to a basic
10:294:22524:18:45:72:284:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account or one of the other two accounts.

10:297:22610:24:18:95:525:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Since the Peer Group Treatment consists of a whole bundle of different, potentially
10:298:22693:18:18:72:526:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important elements, the goal of the Feedback Message Experiment is to strip the treat-
10:299:22779:18:18:72:526:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment of most of these aspects.  It keeps many things constant, in order to advance our
10:300:22865:18:18:72:526:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:understanding of what drives the effect and investigate an alternative, potentially more
10:301:22953:18:24:72:219:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:scalable delivery mechanism.
10:302:22981:24:18:95:525:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The experiment was conducted one year later, during the follow-up survey, among
10:303:23060:18:18:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:873 participants who had opened an account in the scope of the Peer Group Experiment
10:304:23144:18:18:72:526:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(see Figure 1).  Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the control group,
10:305:23234:18:18:72:526:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or one of two weekly text message services designed to simulate the regular feedback and
10:306:23322:18:18:72:526:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:follow-up of peer group meetings.  The research team matched weekly transaction data
10:307:23406:18:18:72:526:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from  the  bank  with  individuals  in  the  study,  and  sent  corresponding  messages  to  the
10:308:23502:18:17:72:526:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participants.  If participants had made a deposit,  the text message congratulated them
10:309:23589:17:24:72:475:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for doing so.  If they had missed it, the text message alerted them to that fact.
10:310:23670:24:18:95:525:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Peer groups are often thought to affect behavior by creating pressure on individuals.
10:311:23755:18:18:72:526:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Reneging on one’s commitment can be punished directly or can negatively affect a person’s
10:312:23844:18:18:72:525:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reputation or image (e.g. Schelling, 1984).10Alternatively,  Battaglini et al. (2005) suggest
10:313:23937:18:18:72:526:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that participants of self-help peer groups may be motivated by observing the success of
10:314:24024:18:16:85:525:141:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:9The baseline survey was conducted before it was determined, which groups were going to be assigned
10:315:24123:16:8:72:464:125:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:to which treatment, so we can exclude a selection effect based on the type of the account.
10:316:24213:8:15:81:525:117:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:10For a similar argument about norm adherence, see, e.g., Bernheim (1994) and for image motivation,
10:317:24312:15:0:72:298:102:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:see Benabou and Tirole (2006); Ariely et al. (2009).
11:318:24365:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:others, which leads them to update their belief about their own ability to follow through
11:319:24454:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the shared goal. In addition to the regular feedback, one treatment therefore included
11:320:24545:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the aspect of peer pressure – others observing the success rate of the participant – while
11:321:24635:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the second treatment included the aspect of the participant observing the success rate of
11:322:24724:18:37:72:107:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:others.

11:324:24818:18:18:101:525:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:They then chose a person as their “Savings Buddy” to monitor their performance
11:325:24896:18:18:101:525:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:and encourage them to stick to their goal.  Both the participant and the Savings
11:326:24976:18:18:101:525:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Buddy  subsequently  received  weekly  text  messages,  informing  them  whether  the
11:327:25061:18:18:101:525:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:participant did or did not make their deposit that week.  The message sent to par-
11:328:25143:18:18:101:525:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:ticipants also reminded them that the Savings Buddy received the same information.
11:329:25225:18:18:101:525:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The text message to the Savings Buddies also thanked them for being the partici-
11:330:25305:18:27:101:506:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:pant’s Savings Buddy (see the Appendix A for exact wording of the messages).
11:331:25381:27:18:86:525:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:2.Peer Information Treatment:In the same way as in the Peer Pressure Treatment,
11:332:25460:18:18:101:525:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:participants  set  a  weekly  savings  goal  for  themselves  and  received  a  weekly  text
11:333:25552:18:18:101:525:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:message, informing them whether they made their weekly deposit.  However, no one
11:334:25632:18:18:101:525:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:else could observe the participant’s performance and there was no Savings Buddy

11:336:25795:18:28:101:329:356:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:similar to them made their weekly deposit.11

11:340:26021:24:18:95:525:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Prior to administering the follow-up survey,  all participants who opened a savings
11:341:26104:18:17:71:525:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account during the first experiment were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment
11:342:26192:17:18:71:525:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups for the second experiment.  The randomization was stratified by savings balance
11:343:26278:18:18:71:525:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the study account and by the group to which participants belonged.  The latter auto-
11:344:26365:18:18:71:525:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matically assures stratification by treatment in the first experiment.  In order to maximize
11:345:26457:18:16:81:525:160:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:11The  design  of  the  Peer  Information  Treatment  in  principle  also  allowed  analyzing  the  impact  of
11:346:26567:16:12:72:526:144:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:varying quality of peers, by introducing random variation in which peers participants were compared to.
11:347:26670:12:12:72:526:132:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:This makes it possible to test whether participants who are informed about a different level of success of
11:348:26776:12:12:72:526:120:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:their peers in their first week of treatment display a different deposit pattern thereafter.  However, power
11:349:26884:12:0:72:394:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:limitations did not allow distinguishing such differential treatment effects.
12:350:26963:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:take-up, a set of screening questions was asked during the survey, to determine who re-
12:351:27050:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mained in this study.  Only those 873 participants who had a cell phone (85.2% of the
12:352:27135:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:total) and were interested in a weekly text message service designed to help people reach
12:353:27224:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their savings goals (69.5% of participants with cell phones) were included in the Feedback
12:354:27314:18:24:72:181:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Message Experiment.
12:355:27333:24:18:95:525:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:All participants, including the control group, were asked what their weekly savings
12:356:27416:18:18:72:526:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goal would be for the next three months if such a service were offered.  This allowed us to
12:357:27507:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rule out that the effect is driven by the process of goal-setting itself (see e.g., Locke and
12:358:27600:18:18:72:526:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Latham, 2006; Hsiaw, 2008).  Those assigned to one of the treatments were then informed
12:359:27687:18:18:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that they could indeed receive such a service for free, and the details of their particular
12:360:27778:18:18:72:526:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:service were explained (without mention of the existence of other treatments).  Since the
12:361:27867:18:18:72:526:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interviews happened in a staggered manner,  different participants started receiving the
12:362:27955:18:17:72:526:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:service at different points in time.  However, the service ended for everyone at the same
12:363:28044:17:39:72:250:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time (at the end of October 2009).

12:366:28175:18:18:72:526:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pected given the random assignment, average characteristics across treatment groups are
12:367:28262:18:37:72:135:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:very similar.
12:368:28275:37:37:245:352:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 2 about here.]
12:369:28296:37:18:95:525:297:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Similar to the Peer Group Experiment, participants have an average of 9.6 years of
12:370:28378:18:18:71:525:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:schooling, their mean age is 44 years, and 70% did not have a savings account prior to the
12:371:28468:18:18:71:525:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account they opened in the context of this study.  The mean monthly per capita income
12:372:28553:18:18:71:525:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of participants’ households is 116,854 Chilean pesos (about 230 USD), which is somewhat
12:373:28640:18:18:71:525:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher  than  for  participants  in  the  Peer  Group  Experiment.   The  average  number  of
12:374:28733:18:18:71:525:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:household  members  is  4.4.   The  average  savings  balance  in  the  study  accounts  at  the
12:375:28829:18:18:71:525:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:beginning of the Feedback Message Experiment is 14,853 pesos, or about 30 USD, and on
12:376:28914:18:0:71:492:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average, participants made 0.18 deposits and 0.06 withdrawals per month in 2008.

13:378:29047:41:31:72:401:667:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3.1    Self-Help Peer Groups vs.  Basic Account
13:379:29094:31:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This  section  analyzes  the  effect  of  the  Peer  Group  Treatment  compared  to  the  control
13:380:29191:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:group.  Figure 2 shows the effect of self-help groups on the number of deposits and on
13:381:29277:18:18:72:526:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the savings balance.  It displays the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) effect for 12 months after the
13:382:29367:18:18:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:introduction of the accounts, and compares those assigned to the Peer Group Treatment
13:383:29452:18:18:72:526:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  those  assigned  to  the  basic  account.   The  self-help  peer  groups  clearly  increase  the
13:384:29552:18:18:72:526:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:savings outcomes.  Panel A shows that the number of deposits is almost four times higher
13:385:29640:18:18:72:526:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the Peer Group Treatment.  While the effect strongly decreases over time, even in the
13:386:29728:18:18:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:last quarter of the year, the number of deposits is still over three times higher (0.059 vs.
13:387:29820:18:34:72:106:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0.016).
13:388:29827:34:33:244:352:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Figure 2 about here]
13:389:29848:33:18:95:525:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Panel B of Figure 2 shows that self-help peer groups not only increase the number
13:390:29929:18:18:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  deposits  but  also  lead  to  higher  savings  balances.   The  average  balance  is  twice  as
13:391:30029:18:18:72:526:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high for participants in the Peer Group Treatment than in the control group.  The effect
13:392:30117:18:18:72:526:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:persists over time and does not decrease during the entire year.  The fact that savings
13:393:30204:18:18:72:526:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase initially and stay constant afterwards suggests that individuals may have reached
13:394:30294:18:18:72:526:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a stable level of savings that they maintain, consistent with a precautionary savings model.
13:395:30386:18:18:72:526:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Before building any savings beyond a small buffer stock, it would be in their interest to
13:396:30475:18:24:72:187:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first reduce their debt.
13:397:30499:24:18:95:525:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The decrease in the number of deposits over time might also be explained by at least
13:398:30583:18:18:72:526:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two other reasons.  First, individuals might not continuously participate in the self-help
13:399:30673:18:18:72:526:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:peer  groups,  for  example  if  they  leave  FE.  Secondly,  the  FE  group  leader  might  lose
13:400:30770:18:18:72:526:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some of the initial motivation, and the quality and regularity of the self-help peer group
13:401:30860:18:17:72:526:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:follow-up in the meetings might consequently decline over time.  Answers to corresponding
13:402:30949:17:18:72:526:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:questions from our follow-up survey suggest that all of the above are in fact happening
13:403:31036:18:18:72:526:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to some degree.  Individuals in the Peer Group Treatment who are still with FE one year
13:404:31123:18:18:72:526:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:after  the  introduction  of  the  accounts  make  more  deposits  until  the  end,  in  groups  in
13:405:31222:18:18:72:526:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which the leader implemented the treatment more judiciously, the treatment effect stays
13:406:31309:18:18:72:526:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher for longer.  However, these correlations have to be interpreted with caution, since
13:407:31399:18:0:72:432:96:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they are not exogenously identified and very prone to selection effects.
14:408:31473:0:18:95:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 3 shows these results in an OLS framework.12We estimate regressions of the

14:419:32239:18:18:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:findings  of  Figure  2:   the  number  of  deposits,  the  amount  deposited,  and  the  savings
14:420:32336:18:18:72:526:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balance are significantly higher for those in the Peer Group Treatment.  Panel B shows
14:421:32422:18:18:72:526:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT) effects.  Take-up rates of the savings accounts are very
14:422:32509:18:18:72:526:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similar across treatments:  50% for the basic account, 51% for the high-interest account
14:423:32597:18:18:72:526:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  55%  for  the  self-help  peer  group  account  (none  of  the  differences  are  statistically
14:424:32697:18:18:72:526:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant).  Correspondingly, Panel B shows that the TOT effects are about twice the
14:425:32783:18:24:72:188:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size of the ITT effects.
14:426:32807:24:18:95:525:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:These  effects  are  both  statistically  and  economically  significant,  as  the  number  of
14:427:32901:18:18:72:525:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deposits increases 6-fold and average savings balances more than double.14The increase
14:428:32987:18:18:72:526:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the balance of 7,400 pesos (approximately 15 USD) represents about 8% of monthly
14:429:33070:18:17:72:526:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income and corresponds in size to the precautionary savings goal of these accounts.  In
14:430:33157:17:18:72:526:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:line with this, Abraham et al. (2011) find that the positive impact of the self-help peer
14:431:33246:18:18:72:526:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups is also reflected in a reduction of participants’ worry about their financial future.
14:432:33338:18:18:72:526:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These findings are also consistent with other studies showing that even relatively small
14:433:33426:18:12:81:346:212:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:12Tobit specifications do not change the results qualitatively.
14:434:33489:12:16:81:525:200:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:13The winzorized dataset excludes the top 1% or 5%, respectively, of the entire dataset, including the
14:435:33591:16:8:72:299:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:period of the first and second experiment combined.
14:436:33642:8:16:81:525:176:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:14Evidence from e.g. Ashraf et al. (2006b) and Meier and Sprenger (2010) suggests that individuals
14:437:33740:16:12:72:526:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:who exhibit time-inconsistent preferences might benefit particularly from financial commitment devices.
14:438:33843:12:11:72:526:148:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:In our context, peer groups lead to front-loading of the cost of not saving, which may have a particularly
14:439:33949:11:12:72:526:137:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:strong effect on those with time-inconsistent preferences.  Table C1 in the Appendix explores differential
14:440:34055:12:12:72:526:125:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:treatment  effects  along  this  category,  and  the  evidence  indeed  suggests  that  the  treatment  might  be
14:441:34168:12:0:72:357:113:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:particularly effective for those with time-inconsistent preferences.
15:442:34238:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:amounts of savings can make a substantial difference in dealing with income shocks (e.g.,

15:446:34516:18:18:72:526:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:couraging deposits, which in turn leads to substantially increased savings balances.  The
15:447:34605:18:18:72:526:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increased number of deposits is not offset by a corresponding increase in withdrawals, even
15:448:34696:18:24:72:510:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:though the accounts are fully liquid and withdrawals are not observable by the peers.
15:449:34781:24:18:95:525:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Having found that self-help peer groups double savings in the study account,  it is
15:450:34864:18:18:72:526:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important  to  ask  whether  this  constitutes  additional  savings  or  just  crowds  out  other
15:451:34961:18:18:72:526:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forms of savings.  Generally, it is very difficult to obtain evidence on this question, since
15:452:35054:18:18:72:526:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:researchers usually only have information about one savings vehicle, and survey data on
15:453:35141:18:18:72:526:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:total savings tends to be very noisy.  Keeping this caveat in mind, most previous studies
15:454:35230:18:17:72:526:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that tested for this found no evidence of crowd-out, or even some evidence for crowding
15:455:35317:17:24:72:518:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in (e.g. Ashraf et al., 2006b; Dupas and Robinson, 2012b,a; Gelber, 2010; Prina, 2012).
15:456:35404:24:18:95:525:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consistent with these previous findings, our sources of evidence suggest that the self-
15:457:35491:18:18:72:526:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:help peer groups increase total savings and do not just replace other forms of savings.
15:458:35578:18:18:72:526:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:First, we measure the impact of the treatments on other forms of savings based on detailed
15:459:35668:18:18:72:526:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:information from the baseline and follow-up surveys about participants’ other forms of
15:460:35754:18:18:72:525:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:formal and informal savings.15While the data on self-reported savings amounts is very
15:461:35839:18:18:71:525:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:noisy,16if anything, it seems to suggest a crowd-in of other forms of savings.  Anticipating
15:462:35931:18:18:71:525:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the noisiness of self-reported amounts, we also elicited a binary measure, where partici-
15:463:36020:18:18:71:525:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pants indicated whether they made deposits or withdrawals from any other account in the
15:464:36107:18:18:71:525:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:previous six months.  This measure is much less noisy, since it is easier for participants to
15:465:36200:18:18:71:525:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:remember than exact amounts of the balance.17Analyzing this binary measure confirms
15:466:36283:18:18:71:525:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that those in the Peer Group Treatment are not less likely to use other accounts than
15:467:36368:18:17:71:431:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:those in the control group, both in terms of deposits and withdrawals.
15:468:36438:17:16:81:525:224:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:15For the 70% of participants that did not have another savings account, savings in the study account
15:469:36539:16:8:72:219:208:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:represents all newformalsavings.
15:470:36571:8:16:81:525:200:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:16To get a sense of how noisy the self-reported information is, we compare the self-reported amount
15:471:36670:16:12:72:526:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for the study account with the correct amount in the account, which we know from administrative data,
15:472:36771:12:8:72:234:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:and find a correlation of merely 0.43.
15:473:36809:8:16:81:525:164:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:17Confirming the validity of this measure, we test whether participants in the Peer Group Treatment
15:474:36908:16:12:72:526:148:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reported a higher probability of having made a deposit into the study account, which we know from the
15:475:37009:12:0:72:417:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:administrative data to be true, and find that this is indeed the case (p <0.01).
16:476:37091:0:18:95:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A second indicator that the savings account in the study has real impacts and does
16:477:37173:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not only replace other savings stems from evidence in Abraham et al. (2011) mentioned
16:478:37258:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above, which shows that having access to the study account helps participants alleviate the
16:479:37349:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:burden of economic shocks, both objectively and subjectively.  After one year, participants
16:480:37440:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with access to one of the three accounts have less informal debt, fewer outstanding pay-
16:481:37528:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ments, and need to reduce consumption due to economic difficulties less often, compared
16:482:37615:18:18:72:526:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to a group that was not offered any account.  Subjectively, they report being significantly
16:483:37706:18:18:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less worried about their financial future, and evaluate their recent economic situation as
16:484:37796:18:18:72:526:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less severe.  Taken together, this evidence suggests that the savings in our field experiment
16:485:37889:18:45:72:302:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are additional rather than mere substitution.

16:487:37986:31:18:72:526:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To get a sense of the magnitude of the effect of self-help peer groups, we compare it to
16:488:38074:18:18:72:526:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the impact of a more classical treatment to encourage saving, a substantially increased
16:489:38161:18:37:72:240:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:real interest rate of 5% annually.

16:491:38216:37:18:95:525:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 3 shows the mean monthly savings balance as well as the 75th, 95th, and 99th
16:492:38299:18:18:72:525:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percentiles.18Looking at the mean, it is not readily apparent whether the savings balance
16:493:38388:18:18:71:525:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differs between the High-Interest Treatment and either the Peer Group Treatment or the
16:494:38474:18:18:71:525:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:basic account.  However, Panels B-D show that looking at the whole distribution reveals
16:495:38561:18:18:71:525:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a much starker result.  The vast majority of participants do not respond to the increased
16:496:38650:18:18:71:525:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate at all.  At the 75th and even at the 95th percentile, the savings balance in the
16:497:38744:18:17:71:525:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:basic account and the High-Interest Treatment are virtually identical, while participants
16:498:38833:17:18:71:525:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the Peer Group Treatment display substantially higher savings.  Only at the very top
16:499:38920:18:18:71:525:217:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the distribution (Panel D for the 99th percentile) does the interest rate lead to higher
16:500:39011:18:18:71:525:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:savings.  In sum, Figure 3 indicates that self-help peer groups shift the entire distribution
16:501:39104:18:18:71:525:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of savings, while the increased interest rate only affects the very top tail of the savings
16:502:39195:18:24:71:134:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distribution.
16:503:39208:24:18:95:525:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The results of Table 3 support those findings in regressions for all three of our savings
16:504:39297:18:18:71:525:121:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes.  The Peer Group Treatment not only leads to a much bigger increase in the
16:505:39380:18:0:81:343:103:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:18The median is zero, given that take-up is only about 50%.
17:506:39441:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:number of deposits than the High-Interest Treatment, but also to a substantially higher
17:507:39528:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balance.  The treatment effect on the balance is almost twice as large overall, and almost
17:508:39618:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eight times larger when we exclude the top 5%.  Consistent with the graphical evidence
17:509:39704:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above, the difference only becomes statistically insignificant when including the top 1%
17:510:39792:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the distribution.  If we take the results from Column (5) and linearly extrapolate the
17:511:39881:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:point estimation of the interest rate increase, the results suggest that the self-help peer
17:512:39972:18:24:72:456:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups have an effect equivalent to an increase in the interest rate of 7.8%.
17:513:40049:24:18:95:525:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The fact that an increase in the interest rate of almost five percentage points has no
17:514:40135:18:18:72:525:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:impact on savings for most participants is noteworthy in itself.19While from a theoretical
17:515:40225:18:18:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:perspective, an argument could be made that the overall effect of interest rates on savings
17:516:40316:18:18:72:526:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is ambiguous, due to the income effect that could potentially dominate the substitution
17:517:40403:18:18:72:525:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect20,  the  prediction  on  the  substitution  effect  is  clear:  In  the  absence  of  significant
17:518:40507:18:17:72:526:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transaction costs, individuals should reallocate their savings portfolio towards the higher-
17:519:40599:17:24:72:150:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:return account.
17:520:40614:24:18:95:525:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In our setting, we have the opportunity to analyze this aspect separately, by inves-
17:521:40698:18:18:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tigating  whether  those  participants  who  had  substantial  pre-existing  savings  reallocate
17:522:40794:18:18:72:525:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them to the higher-yield account.21When asked in the follow-up survey,  less than 1%
17:523:40878:18:18:72:526:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicate having made any transfers from a pre-existing account into their study account.
17:524:40966:18:18:72:526:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Since  for  small  amounts  of  savings,  the  transaction  costs  may  be  too  large  to  warrant
17:525:41065:18:18:72:526:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reallocation,  we also split the group of those with pre-existing accounts further in two,
17:526:41155:18:18:72:526:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and focus on those with above-median pre-existing balance.  Interestingly, even these ‘high
17:527:41246:18:18:72:526:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pre-treatment savers’ do not shift their savings towards the high-interest account.  While
17:528:41336:18:18:72:526:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their average balance in the pre-existing accounts is about 315,000 pesos (or about 650
17:529:41423:18:24:72:443:283:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:USD), their savings in the study accounts are only about 15,000 pesos.22
17:530:41495:24:18:95:525:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There  are  many  potential  explanations:   tangible  or  mental  costs  associated  with
17:531:41585:18:17:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this transaction, limited liquidity of the alternative account, a lack of understanding of
17:532:41675:17:18:72:526:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  interest  rate,  mental  accounting,  or  reasons  other  than  the  interest  rate  that  lead
17:533:41775:18:16:81:525:206:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:19These findings are particularly surprising given that in the context of this experiment,  the higher
17:534:41877:16:12:72:526:190:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:interest rate is made exceptionally salient, including an entire training session that elaborated this point
17:535:41985:12:8:72:161:178:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(see Design section).
17:536:42006:8:16:81:525:170:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:20In practice, the income effect is likely to be less important for shorter-term precautionary savings,
17:537:42109:16:8:72:190:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:such as those in this study.
17:538:42137:8:16:81:525:146:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:21Given that the high-interest accounts represent by far the highest alternative in the market, we know
17:539:42240:16:8:72:343:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:that the interest rates of their pre-existing accounts are lower.
17:540:42305:8:16:81:525:122:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:22Similarly, but less surprisingly, we do not observe a shift for those with below-median pre-existing
17:541:42407:16:0:72:526:106:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:savings.  Their average balance is 40,000 pesos in the pre-existing account and 3,000 in the study account.
18:542:42516:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participants to prefer the alternative bank account.  Determining the specific reasons goes
18:543:42607:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper,  but  we  obtained  some  suggestive  evidence  through  a
18:544:42702:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:series of detailed questions in the follow-up survey.  Two aspects stand out in the survey
18:545:42792:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:responses:  a lack of understanding of the interest rate and mental accounting (Thaler,
18:546:42879:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1990).  There is also some indication that this might be less the case for those with higher
18:547:42971:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:education  and  financial  literacy.   For  a  full  tabulation  and  more  detailed  discussion  of

18:550:43161:36:18:72:526:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The previous section established that the self-help peer group meetings are effective at
18:551:43249:18:17:72:526:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increasing savings.  As mentioned above, such peer group programs consist of a whole bun-
18:552:43338:17:18:72:526:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dle of interventions.  To understand whether there might be alternative ways to deliver the
18:553:43429:18:18:72:526:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:service that peer groups provide, it is important to unpack some of these mechanisms to
18:554:43516:18:18:72:526:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:learn which elements are required for the effectiveness (Ludwig et al., 2011).  This section
18:555:43608:18:18:72:526:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore makes a step towards distinguishing some of these elements by investigating the
18:556:43697:18:18:72:526:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:importance  of  two  of  its  key  elements:  physical  meetings  and  peer  pressure.   We  first
18:557:43795:18:18:72:526:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analyze whether in-person meetings (and all the related activities such as distribution of
18:558:43885:18:18:72:526:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stickers, diplomas, moral support, etc.)  are required, by testing the effectiveness of reg-
18:559:43977:18:18:72:526:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ular feedback and follow-up in “synthetic” peer groups through text messages.  We then
18:560:44063:18:18:72:526:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investigate whether peer pressure is the driving force, by comparing two different types
18:561:44151:18:45:72:236:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of feedback message treatments.
18:562:44182:45:31:72:459:258:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.1    The Effect of Feedback Text Messages on Savings
18:563:44236:31:18:72:526:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 4 shows the impact of being offered the weekly text message feedback service.  The
18:564:44325:18:18:72:526:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:horizontal axis represents months since the treatment began in the year 2009, and the area
18:565:44415:18:18:72:526:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the vertical lines marks the period during which the text message intervention
18:566:44501:18:18:72:526:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was implemented (called “intervention period” going forward).  Panel A shows the number
18:567:44588:18:37:72:407:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of deposits per month, and Panel B shows the amount deposited.
18:568:44650:37:0:244:352:118:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Figure 4 about here]
19:569:44673:0:18:95:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 4 reveals three important points.  First, there is no significant difference be-
19:570:44760:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tween treatment and control groups in both panels before the experiment begins in August
19:571:44848:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2009 (month “1” in the figure).  Deposits in June and July trend slightly downward in the
19:572:44937:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cold winter months in Chile, but this trend is no different between treatment and control.
19:573:45027:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Second, during the intervention period, savings outcomes are substantially higher in the
19:574:45115:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:treatment compared to the control group, almost tripling the number of weekly deposits.
19:575:45202:18:18:72:526:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The  amounts  deposited  are  more  noisy,  but  even  there  we  see  a  substantial  increase.
19:576:45298:18:18:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Third, after the text messages stop, the savings behavior looks very similar again across
19:577:45387:18:24:72:388:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups, and we observe no long-run impact on savings habits.
19:578:45447:24:18:95:525:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Also, in contrast to the self-help peer groups, the effect of the text messages does not
19:579:45535:18:18:72:526:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seem to decay over the three treatment months.23This might be due to the fact that the
19:580:45621:18:18:72:526:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default with respect to continuing participation is different:  In order to stop participating
19:581:45715:18:17:72:526:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the text message service, individuals would have to actively opt out, while for the peer
19:582:45806:17:18:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:group support to continue, participants have to actively opt in each week by attending
19:583:45892:18:18:72:526:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the meeting.  The effect of text messages might therefore be more sustainable over time.
19:584:45980:18:24:72:511:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Future research is required to test the effectiveness of the messages over the long run.
19:585:46068:24:18:95:525:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In order to estimate the significance of the treatment effects, we run regressions of
19:586:46153:18:33:72:169:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the following form:
19:587:46172:33:39:180:525:358:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:A:Si=α+β1Treatmenti+Prior Savingsi+-i(2)
19:588:46210:39:18:95:525:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:whereSiis the savings outcome for individuali, andTreatmentis a dummy vari-
19:589:46285:18:18:72:526:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:able  equal  to  one  for  individuals  in  the  treatment  groups.   In  addition,  we  control  for
19:590:46386:18:17:72:526:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the amount saved prior to the intervention period, which reduces much of the noise by
19:591:46471:17:18:72:526:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:capturing individual-specific variation, similar to what would be the case in a difference-
19:592:46562:18:18:72:525:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in-difference specification.24We use the following measures ofSi:  (1) average number of
19:593:46650:18:18:72:526:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monthly deposits, (2) average monthly amount deposited, and (3) new savings (deposits-
19:594:46736:18:18:72:526:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:withdrawals) in the intervention period.  Amounts are also shown winsorized at the top
19:595:46822:18:18:72:154:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1% and top 5%.
19:596:46836:18:16:81:525:176:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:23This can be seen more clearly in figure C1 in the Appendix,  which represents weeks since a given
19:597:46935:16:8:72:220:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:participant started the treatment.
19:598:46969:8:15:81:525:152:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:24Results without controlling for prior balance (shown in Table C2 in the appendix) are qualitatively
19:599:47070:15:0:72:243:137:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:similar but measured more imprecisely.
20:600:47110:0:18:95:525:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table  4  presents  the  results  for  all  three  outcomes  during  the  intervention  period.
20:601:47205:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Panel A shows Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Panel B Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT) ef-
20:602:47287:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fects.  The feedback text messages have a substantial effect on savings.  In the ITT speci-
20:603:47378:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fication, the average number of deposits is almost three times that of the control group,
20:604:47467:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the amount deposited per month is about 2,000 pesos higher.  Overall, participants
20:605:47553:18:18:72:526:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the treatment group increase their savings balance in the intervention period by about
20:606:47642:18:18:72:525:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:7,800 pesos.25Take-up rates of the two treatments are very similar.  Of participants who
20:607:47730:18:18:71:525:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:initially express interest in the service, 42.8% end up signing up when offered the Savings
20:608:47821:18:18:71:525:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Buddy  service  and  41.6%  when  offered  the  Peer  Information  service.   Correspondingly,
20:609:47915:18:18:71:525:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the TOT effects are somewhat more than double in size,  increasing amounts deposited
20:610:47999:18:18:71:525:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:4.5-fold in the winsorized sample (nearly 6-fold in the full sample).  To put these numbers
20:611:48090:18:18:71:525:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in perspective, Karlan et al. (2010) found that in a pooled sample from Peru, Bolivia and
20:612:48179:18:35:71:436:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Philippines, monthly savings reminders in increased savings by 6%.
20:613:48249:35:35:245:352:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 4 about here.]
20:614:48270:35:18:95:525:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Comparison  of  the  treatment  effects  between  the  two  experiments  (self-help  peer
20:615:48359:18:18:71:525:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups versus feedback messages) clearly has to be interpreted with much caution, since
20:616:48446:18:18:71:525:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it  is  not  based  on  random  assignment.   The  treatment  happens  in  a  different  year,  to
20:617:48544:18:18:71:525:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  different  subsample  of  participants,  and  over  a  different  length  of  time.   However,  a
20:618:48644:18:18:71:525:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:back-of-the-envelope calculation allows us to get some sense on how much of the effect of
20:619:48733:18:18:71:525:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:self-help peer groups can be achieved without physical meetings.  First, we need to take
20:620:48821:18:18:71:525:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:into  account  that  participants  in  the  Feedback  Message  Experiment  are  a  non-random
20:621:48914:18:18:71:525:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subsample of the Peer Group Experiment, namely those who opened an account in the
20:622:48995:18:18:71:525:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:scope of the first experiment, own a cellphone, and expressed interest in a text message
20:623:49083:18:18:71:525:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:service to help them save more.  We therefore recalculate the effect of self-help peer groups
20:624:49176:18:23:71:251:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among only those 873 participants.
20:625:49210:23:18:95:525:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To further increase comparability, we hold the duration constant and focus on the
20:626:49291:18:18:71:525:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first  three  months  of  treatment.   Focusing  on  this  initial  period,  when  the  Peer  Group
20:627:49390:18:18:71:525:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Treatment had the strongest effect, stacks the odds in favor of the Peer Group Treatment,
20:628:49479:18:18:71:525:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in order to provide a conservative estimate for the hypothesis that physical meetings are
20:629:49568:18:15:81:525:147:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:25The coefficient on prior savings is negative, since mechanically, people who have prior savings can
20:630:49669:15:12:72:526:132:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:withdraw more in the intervention period, leading to possible negative new savings.  The new savings of
20:631:49772:12:12:72:526:120:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:zero in the control group correspondingly indicates that participants in this group withdrew the same
20:632:49873:12:12:72:526:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:amount as they deposited.  We also test whether the effect of the Feedback Message Experiment varies
20:633:49973:12:0:72:355:96:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:by treatment in Experiment 1 and find no significant differences.
21:634:50040:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less important than expected.  It also has the advantage of controlling for seasonal effects,
21:635:50133:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since it compares savings in the same calendar months one year apart.  Table C3 in the
21:636:50219:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Appendix shows this specification and indicates a treatment effect of 10,000 pesos for the
21:637:50309:18:24:72:291:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Peer Group Treatment among this sample.
21:638:50348:24:18:95:525:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, TOT and ITT for the Peer Group Experiment are by construction identical in
21:639:50431:18:18:72:526:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this sample, since all participants in the Feedback Message Experiment opened a savings
21:640:50518:18:18:72:526:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account in the scope of the Peer Group Experiment.  For a conservative comparison, we
21:641:50603:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore compare it with the ITT effect of the Feedback Message Experiment in Table 4,
21:642:50690:18:18:72:525:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:where  savings  increase  by  about  8,000  pesos.26This  back-of-the  envelope  calculation
21:643:50782:18:18:71:525:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that feedback text messages can achieve 80% or more of the effect of self-help
21:644:50869:18:18:71:525:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:peer groups in terms of new savings balance, and implies that physical meetings might
21:645:50954:18:24:71:462:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not be as central to the effect of self-help peer groups as previously thought.
21:646:51033:24:17:95:525:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In sum,  feedback text messages provide an alternative delivery mechanism to self-
21:647:51115:17:18:71:525:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:help peer groups that has a substantial effect on savings and is potentially more scalable.
21:648:51206:18:18:71:525:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:They strip the bundle of interventions used in self-help peer groups of many elements and
21:649:51295:18:18:71:525:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thereby provide a first step towards understanding the underlying mechanism of peers as
21:650:51382:18:45:71:174:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:commitment device.
21:651:51400:45:32:71:449:364:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.2    Is Peer Pressure Required for the Effectiveness?
21:652:51455:32:18:71:525:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The  previous  section  established  that  peer-related  feedback  text  messages  can  achieve
21:653:51550:18:18:71:525:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:substantial  increases  in  savings  rates  without  actual  in-person  meetings.   This  section
21:654:51647:18:18:71:525:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investigates whether the effect can also be achieved without peer pressure, by comparing
21:655:51735:18:18:71:525:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  two  types  of  feedback  message  treatments  (see  Section  2  for  a  description  of  their
21:656:51835:18:23:71:111:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:design).
21:657:51843:23:18:95:525:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure  5  shows  the  ITT  effect  of  the  Peer  Pressure  Treatment  compared  to  both
21:658:51933:18:18:71:525:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the control group and the Peer Information Treatment.  The savings behavior in the two
21:659:52019:18:18:71:525:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:treatments follows a very similar pattern,  both in terms of the number of deposits per
21:660:52106:18:19:71:401:183:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:month (Panel A) and in terms of amount deposited (Panel B).27
21:661:52167:19:15:81:525:164:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:26If we choose the specification that does not control for prior balance, shown in Table C2, then the
21:662:52268:15:9:72:376:149:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:benchmark effect of the text messages is even higher, at 10,000 pesos.
21:663:52338:9:15:81:525:140:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:27The figures seem to suggest that there is a different time trend between the two treatments.  However,
21:664:52442:15:12:72:526:125:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the monthly graphs based on the overall intervention period are not ideal for observing time trends, since
21:665:52548:12:12:72:526:113:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:participants joined the treatment in different weeks.  When looking at a graph representing weeks since
21:666:52651:12:0:72:526:101:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the start of treatment for a given participant (shown in Figure C1 in the Appendix), the two treatments
22:667:52756:0:37:243:354:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Figure 5 about here.]
22:668:52778:37:18:95:525:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table  5 confirms this impression with regressions.  Both treatments independently
22:669:52860:18:18:72:526:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase  savings  compared  to  the  control  group  (statistically  significantly  for  all  three
22:670:52960:18:18:72:526:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes  except  new  savings  in  the  Peer  Pressure  Treatment).   When  comparing  the
22:671:53051:18:18:72:525:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of the two treatments with aF-test, having a Savings Buddy has no substantially
22:672:53138:18:37:71:345:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different effect on any of the three outcome variables.
22:673:53193:37:37:245:352:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 5 about here.]
22:674:53214:37:18:95:525:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The fact that the Peer Pressure Treatment does not lead to stronger effects is even
22:675:53297:18:18:71:525:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more striking in light of a) the kind of person participants chose as their Savings Buddy
22:676:53386:18:23:71:419:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and b) the information contained in the Peer Information messages.
22:677:53452:23:18:95:525:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:a) When signing up for the text message service, participants in the Peer Pressure
22:678:53534:18:18:71:525:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Treatment  indicate  their  relationship  to  the  Savings  Buddy  and  the  main  reason  they
22:679:53629:18:18:71:525:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:chose that person.  Participants are allowed to select their own Savings Buddy so that they
22:680:53720:18:18:71:525:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can choose their “optimal” peer.  The reasons given for choosing that particular person
22:681:53807:18:18:71:525:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indeed indicate that participants are using the text message services as a peer pressure
22:682:53895:18:18:71:525:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:commitment device and select Savings Buddies who really hold them accountable.  The
22:683:53978:18:18:71:525:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:most  frequently  stated  reason  (31%)  is  that  the  person  chosen  is  very  strict  and  will
22:684:54077:18:18:71:525:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:motivate  the  participant  to  comply  with  his  or  her  savings  goal  (see  Table  C4  in  the
22:685:54176:18:18:71:525:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Appendix).  This is followed by 29% indicating that the person was chosen because the
22:686:54261:18:18:71:525:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participant generally shares financial information with them; 19% because the person is a
22:687:54350:18:18:71:525:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:role model when it comes to saving, by being very organized and good at complying with
22:688:54436:18:18:71:525:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:his or her own savings goals; and 12% because the participant shares a bank account with
22:689:54524:18:18:71:525:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that person.  Very few participants (5%) indicate that they chose their Savings Buddy
22:690:54609:18:17:71:525:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for being a relaxed person who would be understanding if the participant could not reach
22:691:54697:17:24:71:163:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their savings goal.
22:692:54716:24:18:95:525:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  terms  of  their  relationship  to  their  Savings  Buddy,  participants  tend  to  choose
22:693:54810:18:18:71:525:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:someone who is close to them, either a close relative or a close friend.  The most common
22:694:54899:18:18:71:525:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choice is a son or daughter (32%), followed by partner (25%), close friend (17%), other
22:695:54986:18:18:71:525:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative (14%), parent (6%), neighbor (2%), and someone else (3%).  According to Mas
22:696:55070:18:22:71:525:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Moretti (2009), peer pressure can be expected to be particularly strong if the peers
22:697:55158:22:0:72:192:97:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:look very similar over time.
23:698:55188:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:know  each  other,  have  had  past  interactions,  and  expect  future  interaction.   Similarly,
23:699:55286:18:18:72:526:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:research by Ferrara (2003) and   Karlan (2007) shows that in peer lending groups, close
23:700:55373:18:18:72:526:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:social connections can reduce default. This would suggest that the selected peers should be
23:701:55464:18:18:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particularly effective.  However, we cannot rule out that in our context, the optimal social
23:702:55556:18:18:72:526:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distance is different, for example if close peers are too understanding when a commitment
23:703:55645:18:24:72:360:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is not reached and therefore less likely to exert pressure.
23:704:55704:24:18:95:525:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:b) One possible explanation as to why the Peer Pressure Treatment does not have
23:705:55783:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a stronger effect than the Peer Information Treatment could be that the peer pressure
23:706:55868:18:18:72:526:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect  is  strong,  but  the  effect  of  the  information  about  the  performance  of  others  is
23:707:55968:18:18:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equally  strong.   While  we  cannot  rule  out  that  this  could  be  the  case,  the  nature  of
23:708:56067:18:18:72:526:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the information that was conveyed suggests that this is not very likely.  The message in
23:709:56155:18:18:72:526:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Peer Information Treatment (see text in Appendix A) informs participants about the
23:710:56241:18:17:72:526:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percentage of others similar to them that made a deposit in a given week.  It turns out that
23:711:56333:17:18:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in most weeks, that number is very low or even zero (on average, they are informed that
23:712:56420:18:18:72:526:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:6% of their peers followed through with their goals).  This fact, combined with evidence
23:713:56508:18:18:72:526:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from Beshears et al. (2009) showing that such information may have very limited effects
23:714:56595:18:18:72:526:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on savings, suggests that the peer information component is not very likely to have had
23:715:56682:18:24:72:155:397:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:a strong effect.28
23:716:56700:24:18:95:525:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  sum,  we  find  that  feedback  text  messages  are  effective  even  without  a  savings
23:717:56793:18:18:72:526:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:buddy and that peer pressure is not required.  This not only makes them less cumbersome
23:718:56880:18:18:72:526:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to implement and scale, it also avoids the potential disutility from social pressure, which
23:719:56971:18:51:72:451:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can make participants potentially worse off (e.g., DellaVigna et al., 2012).
23:720:57047:51:36:72:326:268:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:5    Discussion and Conclusion
23:721:57077:36:18:72:526:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Peer groups are often used as a commitment device to achieve personal goals, but there has
23:722:57167:18:18:72:526:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:been little empirical evidence evaluating their effectiveness and analyzing what aspects
23:723:57255:18:18:72:526:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lead  to  their  success.   Our  findings  that  self-help  peer  groups  increase  the  number  of
23:724:57354:18:18:72:526:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deposits 3.5-fold, and almost double the average savings balance after a year, show that
23:725:57442:18:17:72:526:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these groups can be a powerful tool to help participants reach an individual but mutually
23:726:57531:17:18:72:526:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shared goal.  Beyond savings, this mechanism is applicable for a wide area of self-control
23:727:57621:18:16:81:525:125:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:28We also analyzed whether the treatment effect of the Peer Information Treatment is different for those
23:728:57725:16:12:72:526:109:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:who have been randomly assigned to different quality peers, but did not find any significant differences
23:729:57829:12:0:72:200:97:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(for details, see Footnote 11).
24:730:57862:0:24:72:121:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:problems.
24:731:57871:24:18:95:525:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Self-help peer groups may be particularly effective in areas where a small behavior
24:732:57954:18:18:72:526:666:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:change can generate a large impact.  This is for example the case in our context of pre-
24:733:58042:18:18:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cautionary savings,  where the relatively small magnitudes in dollar amounts (about 15
24:734:58128:18:18:72:526:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:USD)  can  have  large  implications  for  participants’  quality  of  life.   The  income  stream
24:735:58226:18:18:72:526:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of these populations is not only low, but also highly volatile.  Correspondingly, prior to
24:736:58316:18:18:72:526:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the intervention, many participants expressed the desire to build a buffer stock against
24:737:58404:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:economic shocks, and frustration about their inability to do so on their own.  This can
24:738:58491:18:18:72:526:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have large implications, as having a small cushion on the side can for example make the
24:739:58578:18:18:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:difference between paying the utility bill or sleeping in the cold during the freezing Chilean
24:740:58672:18:24:72:115:522:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:winter.29
24:741:58681:24:18:95:525:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Adding a savings club component is especially convenient in contexts where people
24:742:58762:18:17:72:526:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:meet regularly anyway,  such as microfinance groups,  schools,  sports clubs,  or churches.
24:743:58853:17:18:72:526:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The Feedback Message Experiment suggests that even outside of contexts where people
24:744:58936:18:18:72:526:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:meet regularly in groups, savings can be strongly increased by holding people accountable
24:745:59025:18:18:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through simple feedback messages.  While self-help peer group meetings can be cumber-
24:746:59110:18:18:72:526:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some to set up and to maintain, text message services require little coordination and do
24:747:59198:18:18:72:526:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not rely on physical proximity, making them more broadly applicable.  Given the aston-
24:748:59284:18:18:72:526:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ishing growth rate of cell phone use worldwide, this is a channel that can potentially reach
24:749:59376:18:18:72:526:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:millions of people and may be attractive to a wider and different population than those
24:750:59463:18:24:72:350:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:who are willing to come together for regular meetings.
24:751:59517:24:18:95:525:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In addition, the Feedback Message Experiment makes a first step towards disentan-
24:752:59598:18:18:72:526:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gling  the  mechanism  of  self-help  peer  groups  as  a  commitment  device.   The  fact  that
24:753:59694:18:18:72:526:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regular Feedback Messages are surprisingly effective even without physical meetings and
24:754:59781:18:18:72:526:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:without a Savings Buddy that observes participants’ behavior,  suggests the hypothesis
24:755:59867:18:17:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that rather than exerting pressure, participants may simply provide a mutual service to
24:756:59954:17:18:72:526:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regularly hold each other accountable.  This interpretation raises at least four additional
24:757:60045:18:18:72:526:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:research questions: 1) How important is the feedback element, and would simple reminders
24:758:60133:18:18:72:526:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(Karlan et al., 2010) have a similar effect?  2) Could other types of Savings Buddies than
24:759:60223:18:18:72:526:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the ones chosen by the participants (e.g., in terms of social distance, personality traits,
24:760:60314:18:18:72:526:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:etc.)  be more effective at holding them accountable?  3) Does the peer information have
24:761:60402:18:18:72:526:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a motivational effect after all, despite the fact that participants are informed that only
24:762:60492:18:16:81:525:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:29In  line  with  this,  Abraham  et  al.  (2011)  find  that  after  one  year,  participants  in  the  Peer  Group
24:763:60608:16:0:72:368:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Treatment are significantly less worried about their financial future.
25:764:60680:0:18:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:few others are making a deposit each week?  4) How generalizable are these findings to

25:767:60870:18:18:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:many potential applications in other areas where people make resolutions but find it dif-
25:768:60959:18:18:72:526:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ficult to follow through, such as preventive health measures (e.g., for diabetes, exercising,
25:769:61052:18:18:72:526:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or vaccinations), environmentally-friendly behavior (e.g., saving energy), education (e.g.,
25:770:61143:18:18:72:526:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:completing homework, solving math exercises), etc.  As these methods find wider applica-
25:771:61231:18:18:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion, the question arises to what degree multiple feedback messages crowd out attention,
25:772:61319:18:18:72:526:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and further research is required to investigate interactions between multiple messages, as
25:773:61409:18:24:72:404:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well as the effect of feedback messages over a longer time period.
25:774:61475:24:18:95:525:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The analysis of the interest rate serves as a benchmark for the effectiveness of the Peer
25:775:61564:18:18:72:526:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Group Treatment.  In addition, the weak effect of the interest rate for most participants is
25:776:61656:18:17:72:526:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of interest by itself.  While further research is needed to understand whether this might be
25:777:61748:17:18:72:526:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a more general result, it suggests that some caution is warranted in the use of policies or
25:778:61839:18:18:72:526:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:economic models that assume large shares of the population will respond to changes in the
25:779:61928:18:18:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate.  This also raises the question to what degree this finding is driven by limited
25:780:62022:18:18:72:526:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial sophistication.  Would the results be different in more educated environments?
25:781:62110:18:18:72:526:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:And how does it affect our thinking about the design of public policy if policies vary by
25:782:62199:18:24:72:484:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the degree of cognitive ability and sophistication required for their effectiveness?
25:783:62283:24:18:95:525:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, our findings speak to a larger point about what types of interventions tend
25:784:62367:18:18:72:526:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  be  effective  in  particular  situations.   While  traditional  economic  incentives  may  be
25:785:62465:18:18:72:526:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effective in contexts where individuals lack motivation, they may have limited impact if
25:786:62553:18:18:72:525:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the constraint that impedes the behavior change lies elsewhere.30Implementing behavior
25:787:62639:18:18:72:526:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:change can be challenging even for motivated individuals – either psychologically, due for
25:788:62729:18:18:72:526:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:example to self-control problems, or practically, due for example to complicated processes.
25:789:62820:18:17:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In these situations, policies that facilitate compliance may be more effective than policies
25:790:62912:17:124:72:234:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that further increase incentives.

41:1116:86114:14:15:72:526:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reallocate  them  into  the  high-interest  account.   To  get  a  sense  of  what  the  underlying
41:1117:86213:15:14:72:526:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reasons  might  be,  we  asked  participants  a  series  of  detailed  questions  in  the  follow-up
41:1118:86313:14:20:72:107:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:survey.
41:1119:86320:20:15:95:525:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Two aspects stand out among the answers:  A lack of understanding of the interest
41:1120:86401:15:14:72:526:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rate,  and  mental  accounting.   Concerning  the  former,  only  2%  of  participants  indicate
41:1121:86497:14:15:72:526:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:knowing the interest rate in their other account.  Despite that, 63% of those in the High-
41:1122:86587:15:14:72:526:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Interest Treatment claim that their other savings account has a higher interest rate which,
41:1123:86678:14:15:72:526:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as discussed above, is not only unlikely, but also surprising given that participants were
41:1124:86768:15:14:72:526:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:made  aware  in  several  ways  when  the  accounts  were  introduced  that  the  high-interest
41:1125:86863:14:20:72:315:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account offers the highest return in the market.
41:1126:86911:20:15:95:525:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This raises the question to what degree financial literacy or lack of schooling could
41:1127:86996:15:14:72:526:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be at the source of these findings.  There is some indication that financial sophistication
41:1128:87087:14:15:72:525:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:might interact with the treatments.  For those with above-median financial literacy31or
41:1129:87174:15:14:72:526:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above-median education,  the High-Interest Treatment leads to statistically significantly
41:1130:87263:14:15:72:526:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher overall savings than the basic account, while for the overall population it does not

41:1132:87443:14:21:72:215:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subgroups is not significant.
41:1133:87472:21:14:95:525:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Mental accounting stands out when participants are asked directly for their reasons
41:1134:87555:14:14:72:526:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not  to  transfer  money  from  their  other  account  into  the  high-interest  account.   After

41:1140:88132:15:163:72:342:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:named as very important by far the most frequently.
41:1141:88183:163:15:81:525:111:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:31We use three financial literacy questions similar to the ones used in, e.g., Banks and Oldfield (2007);
