2:28:1423:34:19:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We test whether executive stock ownership affects firm payouts using the 2003 dividend tax cut to
2:29:1520:19:20:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:identify an exogenous change in the after-tax value of dividends. We find that executives with higher
2:30:1621:20:20:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:stock ownership were more likely to increase dividends after the tax cut in 2003, whereas no relation
2:31:1722:20:20:71:539:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:is found in previous periods when the dividend tax rate was higher. Relative to previous years, firms
2:32:1823:20:20:71:539:503:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:that initiated dividends in 2003 were more likely to reduce repurchases. The stock price reaction to
2:33:1923:20:19:71:539:483:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the tax cut suggests that the substitution of dividends for repurchases may have been anticipated,
2:34:2021:19:51:71:230:464:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:consistent with agency conflicts.

3:56:2396:0:27:72:140:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Introduction 
3:57:2409:27:24:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Shareholder payouts have changed dramatically over the past two decades, with dividend payout 
3:58:2503:24:24:72:525:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratios falling substantially and share repurchases increasing rapidly (Fama and French (2001), 
3:59:2598:24:25:71:512:633:144:Times:144:Times:B:Grullon and Michaely (2002)).  Following the dividend tax cut in the Jobs and Growth Tax 
3:60:2687:25:24:71:542:608:144:Times:144:Times:B:Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of May 2003, however, dividend activity increased sharply, 
3:61:2781:24:24:71:516:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:particularly the number of dividend initiations (e.g., Blouin, Raedy and Shackelford (2004), 
3:62:2874:24:24:71:514:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chetty and Saez (2005)).1  The dividend tax cut represented a large increase in the after-tax 
3:63:2968:24:24:71:538:536:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of dividends to individual investors, as the top marginal tax rate on dividends was cut over 
3:64:3067:24:24:71:515:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:20 percentage points, from 38.6% to 15%.2  This tax change moved from initial proposal to 
3:65:3157:24:25:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:signed law in under five months, and was thus largely unanticipated prior to 2003.  Because this 
3:66:3254:25:24:72:517:463:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax cut is an exogenous increase in the after-tax value of dividends to individual investors, it 
3:67:3351:24:24:72:529:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:represents a unique laboratory for using actual firm behavior to determine the role of taxes and 
3:68:3448:24:24:72:268:415:144:Times:144:Times:B:other factors that affect dividend policy. 
3:69:3491:24:24:107:530:391:144:Times:144:Times:A: We use this dividend tax change to answer three questions.  First, what determines how 
3:70:3578:24:24:72:533:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms responded to the dividend tax cut?  In particular, can executive stock holdings explain the 
3:71:3676:24:24:72:535:343:144:Times:144:Times:B:cross-sectional pattern of dividend increases?  Second, do the dividend increases raise total firm 
3:72:3775:24:25:72:525:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:payouts, or are they partially offset by reduced share repurchases?  Third, by examining share 
3:73:3870:25:24:72:519:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:price reactions around key events leading to the tax cut, are we able to shed light on whether 
3:74:3965:24:24:72:443:270:144:Times:144:Times:B:these payout policy decisions reflect possible agency problems within firms? 
3:75:4042:24:24:108:544:246:144:Times:144:Times:A:Why might executive stock holdings influence the firm’s reaction to the dividend tax cut?  
3:76:4133:24:24:72:480:222:144:Times:144:Times:B:The 2003 dividend tax cut raised the after-tax value of a $1 dividend to high-income 
3:77:4218:24:24:72:495:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:shareholders from 61.4 cents to 85 cents, a 38% increase.  Thus, the cost of initiating or 
3:78:4309:24:24:72:526:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing dividend payments for executives who have large direct stock ownership decreased 
3:79:4401:24:25:72:541:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:substantially in 2003.  Moreover, executives who are under-diversified with large company stock 
3:80:4497:25:24:72:539:125:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership may place additional value on dividends for liquidity reasons, stemming from the fact 
3:81:4593:24:0:72:510:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:that they may face explicit/contractual restrictions (e.g., Core and Guay (1999)) or implicit 
4:82:4688:0:24:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions (e.g., insider sales may be viewed as a negative signal by the market) on their ability 
4:83:4789:24:24:71:192:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:to sell shares of stock.3   
4:84:4817:24:24:108:518:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:In contrast, firms whose executives are compensated primarily in the form of cash or 
4:85:4902:24:24:72:503:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock options would have no such incentives.  Because employee stock options are rarely 
4:86:4990:24:24:72:512:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend-protected (Murphy (1999)), executives compensated with options have a personal 
4:87:5078:24:24:72:535:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial incentive to limit dividends because they face a 100% implicit “tax” rate on dividends, 
4:88:5176:24:25:72:508:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:both before and after the dividend tax cut.  That is, executive options fall in value with the 
4:89:5271:25:24:72:542:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:decline in the share price that would result from a cash dividend which is not offset by the receipt 
4:90:5372:24:24:72:515:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the dividend to option holders.  Thus, while an executive who holds a large share of their 
4:91:5466:24:24:71:537:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:wealth in options would have a personal financial incentive to keep dividend payments low, this 
4:92:5562:24:24:71:530:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:is true both before and after the dividend tax cut.   Indeed, several prior studies have found that 
4:93:5662:24:24:71:531:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:when managers have more of their wealth in the form of options, rather than direct shares, they 
4:94:5758:24:25:71:540:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:tend to use dividends less heavily (Lambert, Lanen and Larcker (1989), Jolls (1998), Weisbenner 
4:95:5854:25:24:71:299:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2000), Fenn and Liang (2001), Kahle (2002)). 
4:96:5900:24:24:108:518:370:144:Times:144:Times:A:These prior studies, however, did not have any exogenous shift in the relative cost of 
4:97:5987:24:24:72:538:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:distributing cash through dividends or repurchases.  Because of this lack of exogenous variation, 
4:98:6085:24:24:72:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:the previous literature is subject to the criticism that the cross-sectional correlation between 
4:99:6182:24:24:72:516:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive compensation and payout policy may reflect unobservable characteristics, such as 
4:100:6273:24:24:72:499:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:managerial quality or corporate governance, that generate both compensation policy and 
4:101:6360:24:25:72:528:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend policy.  A key contribution of our study is that we use the unexpected and exogenous 
4:102:6454:25:24:72:515:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:shift in the relative cost of paying dividends that arises from the tax change to address these 
4:103:6550:24:24:72:505:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:criticisms and thus provide stronger econometric identification of the relations of interest. 
4:104:6644:24:24:108:514:177:144:Times:144:Times:A:More recently, in work conducted simultaneously with ours, other authors have also 
4:105:6727:24:24:72:512:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:investigated the effect of the 2003 tax cut on firm payout behavior.  While Chetty and Saez 
4:106:6819:24:24:72:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2005) and Nam, Wang and Zhang (2004) are focused primarily on establishing a causal link 
4:107:6909:24:24:72:504:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the tax cut and increased dividend activity, they do provide some cross-sectional 
4:108:6999:24:0:72:541:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence that dividend increases are positively related to share ownership by managers.4  Blouin, 
5:109:7098:0:24:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Raedy and Shackelford (2004) also report that dividend increases are positively related to insider 
5:110:7197:24:24:72:532:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership.  Our study differs from these studies in several ways.  First, our primary focus is on 
5:111:7295:24:24:72:529:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:using the tax cut as a source of exogenous variation in the tax cost of executive ownership as a 
5:112:7392:24:24:72:514:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:way of more definitively testing whether executive ownership influences payout decisions.  
5:113:7483:24:24:72:515:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:Second, we test whether the dividend tax cut resulted in an increase in total firm payouts, or 
5:114:7578:24:24:72:516:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:instead represented a substitution between payout mechanisms for some firms.  Grullon and 
5:115:7668:24:25:72:519:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:Michaely (2002) find that some of the increase in share repurchases over the past decade has 
5:116:7761:25:24:72:511:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:come at the expense of a reduction (or lack of increase) in dividends.  We provide what we 
5:117:7852:24:24:72:528:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:believe is the first test of whether this pattern occurs in reverse, i.e., whether in response to the 
5:118:7954:24:24:72:488:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:2003 dividend tax cut, an increase in dividends is accompanied by a decrease in share 
5:119:8040:24:24:72:514:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:repurchases.  Third, we examine whether excess stock returns around key legislative events 
5:120:8131:24:24:72:538:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:pertaining to the tax cut reflect potential agency costs.  Specifically, we are interested in whether 
5:121:8233:24:25:72:508:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock prices reacted to the possible agency conflict between executives’ incentives to raise 
5:122:8326:25:24:72:507:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends when their personal ownership stakes are higher and the fact that the overall tax 
5:123:8418:24:24:72:526:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:burden for other individual shareholders may have actually risen if dividends were substituted 
5:124:8513:24:24:72:533:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:for share repurchases (which ought to still be preferred due to their lower effective tax rate).5     
5:125:8615:24:24:107:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:We have three principal findings.  First, we provide evidence that executive stock 
5:126:8698:24:24:71:494:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:holdings are an important explanation of which firms chose to respond to the tax cut by 
5:127:8786:24:24:71:510:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing dividends.  We show that the substantial variation across firms in the fraction of 
5:128:8880:24:25:71:517:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:shares held by top executives can explain approximately one-quarter of the total unexpected 
5:129:8972:25:24:71:533:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in dividends after the May 2003 tax cut, and an even larger share (roughly one-half) of 
5:130:9069:24:24:71:514:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend initiations.  In further support of this effect, we find that while there is virtually no 
5:131:9168:24:24:71:513:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:relation between executive stock ownership and the likelihood of a dividend increase in the 
5:132:9260:24:24:71:522:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:decade before the tax cut (when the dividend tax rate, and hence the cost to the stock-owning 
5:133:9354:24:24:71:545:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive of paying out dividends, was much higher), not only is the relation quite strong in 2003, 
5:134:9454:24:24:71:541:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:but it is disproportionately concentrated after the passage of the act in late May of that year when 
5:135:9555:24:0:71:535:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:the tax cost of paying dividends is substantially reduced.  While other factors, such as executive 
6:136:9655:0:24:72:496:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock option holdings, firm cash flow, leverage, past firm performance, and institutional 
6:137:9745:24:24:72:536:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership are important determinants of dividend policy in general, only the effect of executive 
6:138:9842:24:24:72:535:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock holdings substantially changed with the change in tax regime, which is supportive of a tax 
6:139:9939:24:24:72:526:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect.  These results are quite robust to additional controls and to alternative specifications.     
6:140:10041:24:24:108:523:612:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our second finding is that, despite the increase in dividends in response to the tax cut, 
6:141:10131:24:24:72:528:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:about one-third of firms that initiated dividends in 2003 scaled back repurchases by an amount 
6:142:10226:24:25:72:533:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:sufficient to reduce total payouts (dividends plus share repurchases). This is in sharp contrast to 
6:143:10326:25:24:71:531:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior years, when approximately 10% of dividend initiators reduced total payouts in the year of 
6:144:10422:24:24:71:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:initiation.  Our results further suggest that while the firms with more executive stock holdings are 
6:145:10523:24:24:71:501:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:more likely to increase dividends, they are no more likely to increase total payouts.  This 
6:146:10615:24:24:71:529:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that, among those firms for which executive ownership had a large effect on dividend 
6:147:10709:24:24:71:514:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:initiations, there is some degree of dividend-repurchase substitution occurring.  Thus, while 
6:148:10803:24:25:71:518:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Grullon and Michaely (2002) found that firms with lower-than-expected dividend yields had 
6:149:10893:25:24:71:533:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger repurchase programs in the 1990s, we find that many of the firms that initiated dividends 
6:150:10990:24:24:71:497:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:in response to the 2003 tax cut were likely to at the same time reduce share repurchases, 
6:151:11080:24:24:71:385:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggesting that payout substitution may work in both directions.  
6:152:11146:24:24:108:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally, we explore potential agency problems by examining how the market responded 
6:153:11230:24:24:72:515:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:to news of the 2003 tax cut.  To the extent that there is some substitution occurring between 
6:154:11324:24:24:72:506:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends and share repurchases, this suggests that the dividend tax cut may have actually 
6:155:11415:24:25:72:533:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased the overall tax burden for the typical individual shareholder as capital gains are likely 
6:156:11515:25:24:72:519:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:still tax advantaged relative to dividends even after the tax cut.  We find that the firms which 
6:157:11612:24:24:72:537:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:historically have paid large dividends and which have a large fraction of individual shareholders 
6:158:11710:24:24:72:530:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:experienced stock price gains in response to the proposal and passage of the tax cut.  However, 
6:159:11806:24:24:72:537:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:the market appears to have at least partially anticipated that some firms, in particular those firms 
6:160:11907:24:24:72:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:whose executives had large stock holdings, would substitute dividends for tax-advantaged share 
6:161:12002:24:24:72:501:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:repurchases or the retention of earnings, and thus potentially raise the tax burden on total 
6:162:12095:24:0:72:282:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:distributions for individual shareholders.     
7:163:12143:0:24:108:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper proceeds as follows.  In section I, we discuss our sample, summary statistics 
7:164:12232:24:24:72:540:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the data, and provide more background on the 2003 dividend tax cut.  In section II, we present 
7:165:12330:24:24:72:523:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:our results on the effect of executive share ownership on dividend increases, and test how the 
7:166:12425:24:24:72:535:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:relation between executive holdings and dividend policy has changed over the pre- and post-tax-
7:167:12520:24:24:71:540:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:change regimes.  In section III, we examine whether firms who increase dividends are increasing 
7:168:12616:24:24:71:509:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:total payouts, or are just substituting dividends for share repurchases, leaving total payouts 
7:169:12711:24:25:71:526:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:unchanged.  In section IV, we analyze the market response to news of the tax cut to determine 
7:170:12805:25:24:71:531:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the market anticipated for which firms the tax cut would lead to dividend substitution.  
7:171:12902:24:24:71:182:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section V concludes.   
7:172:12925:24:24:108:111:491:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
7:173:12925:24:24:72:349:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:I.  Sample, Summary Statistics, and the 2003 Tax Cut 
7:174:12978:24:24:108:541:443:144:Times:144:Times:A:We begin with approximately 1,700 publicly traded firms in each year from 1993 to 2003 
7:175:13065:24:25:72:485:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:for which we are able to merge the necessary firm characteristic, stock, and executive 
7:176:13152:25:24:72:539:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation data from Compustat, CRSP and Execucomp.6  These firms together comprise the 
7:177:13242:24:24:72:507:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:vast majority of total U.S. stock market capitalization.  In addition to share ownership and 
7:178:13335:24:24:72:516:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:options outstanding held by the top five executives, as provided by Execucomp, we are also 
7:179:13426:24:24:72:498:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:interested in shares and options held by others.  Because institutional investors may face 
7:180:13517:24:24:71:510:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:different tax rates from managers and may serve as important monitors of firm activity, we 
7:181:13608:24:24:71:523:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:collect data on institutional ownership from CDA Spectrum, including a split between mutual 
7:182:13700:24:25:71:523:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds and other institutions.  We also hand collect data from company 10-k filings on options 
7:183:13794:25:24:71:532:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:held by employees who are not among the top executive ranks.  Specifically, we define options 
7:184:13888:24:24:71:540:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:held by non-executive employees to be the difference between total and top executive holdings.   
7:185:13985:24:24:108:502:177:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table I reports summary statistics for our sample in 2002 and 2003.  We focus on 
7:186:14066:24:24:72:539:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:ordinary dividend increases in 2003 and contrast them with those in earlier years.  As we discuss 
7:187:14163:24:24:72:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:below, our analysis is robust to the inclusion of special dividends.  We use CRSP data so that we 
7:188:14261:24:24:72:538:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:can accurately measure whether the dividend announcement date was before or after the passage 
7:189:14355:24:0:72:536:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the tax cut in May 2003.  We code a firm as having increased dividends if, at any time during 
8:190:14453:0:24:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:the period in question, the firm announced a dividend that was higher than the level of dividends 
8:191:14551:24:24:71:542:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:they paid previously.  Specifically, an increase in dividends is defined as an increase in dividends 
8:192:14652:24:24:71:536:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:per share (adjusted for stock splits).  We also make use of the Compustat definition of dividends 
8:193:14750:24:24:71:470:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:to confirm dividend initiations among firms that previously did not pay dividends. 
8:194:14833:24:24:108:203:612:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table I here] 
8:195:14855:24:24:108:522:588:144:Times:144:Times:A:In 2003, 28.7% of the entire sample increased dividends, which is substantially larger 
8:196:14942:24:25:72:524:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the fraction of dividend increasers in 2002 (which was 22.0%) and in other recent years.  
8:197:15037:25:24:72:524:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:Particularly striking is the frequency of dividend initiations: 5.9% of previously non-dividend 
8:198:15133:24:24:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:paying firms started paying dividends in 2003, compared to only 1.2% in 2002, and it is higher 
8:199:15228:24:24:72:245:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:than for any other year since 1980.  
8:200:15265:24:24:108:520:467:144:Times:144:Times:A:Because our primary question of interest is how the executive ownership of company 
8:201:15348:24:24:72:549:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock influences firm dividend policy, we highlight executive stock and option holdings in table I.  
8:202:15449:24:25:72:521:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consistent with prior literature, top executive ownership is 0.8% of firm shares at the median 
8:203:15544:25:24:72:538:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm, and 3.8% on average.  While the fraction of total shares outstanding held by top executives 
8:204:15642:24:24:72:542:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:is relatively small, this can represent substantial wealth for these individuals.  For example, at the 
8:205:15745:24:24:72:538:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:median, the value of stock held by the top executives at the end of 2002 was almost $12 million, 
8:206:15842:24:24:72:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:nearly four times the median annual cash salary and bonus for top executives of $3.3 million.  
8:207:15937:24:24:72:435:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:Summary statistics for other variables are provided at the bottom of table I.

8:209:16015:25:24:72:436:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:II.  Empirical Results on Executive Ownership and Dividend Increases 
8:210:16084:24:24:72:393:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:A.  Results: Dividend Increases for 2003 Relative to Prior Decade 
8:211:16150:24:24:108:537:201:144:Times:144:Times:A:The May 2003 dividend tax cut represents an ideal experiment for several reasons.  First, 
8:212:16240:24:24:72:510:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:it is the first time in 17 years that the market faced a substantial reduction in the tax cost of 
8:213:16338:24:24:72:532:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:paying dividends.7  Second, aside from the reduction in dividend taxes, the legislation was free 
8:214:16435:24:24:72:546:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:of other major changes to the tax law that might confound empirical analysis of its effects.  Third, 
8:215:16536:24:24:72:532:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:it came largely as a “surprise” to the market, thus enabling us to treat it as an exogenous event.  
8:216:16636:24:0:72:514:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:Specifically, the May 2003 legislation, which was made retroactive to January 1, 2003, was 
9:217:16728:0:24:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:completely unanticipated until the days leading up to President Bush’s speech to the Economic 
9:218:16822:24:24:72:522:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:Club of Chicago in early January 2003.  The news leakage of this idea prior to this event was 
9:219:16916:24:24:71:508:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimal, and fewer than five months elapsed from the time of this announcement until the 
9:220:17005:24:24:71:536:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:legislation passed.8  Therefore, it is virtually certain that firms did not adjust their compensation 
9:221:17107:24:24:71:514:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:structure prior to 2003 in anticipation of a future dividend tax cut, and thus we can treat our 
9:222:17203:24:24:71:530:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure of executive ownership (which is based on 2002 data) as pre-determined.  This allows 
9:223:17296:24:25:71:542:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:us to identify the causal effect of executive holdings on changes in dividend policy in response to 
9:224:17396:25:24:71:127:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:the tax cut. 
9:225:17409:24:24:108:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:In table II, we begin by exploring the correlation between the likelihood of a dividend 
9:226:17497:24:24:72:519:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase and the fraction of shares held by the top five executives of the company.9  We also 
9:227:17591:24:24:72:536:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:control for a rich set of covariates, including executive holdings of options, the firm’s market-to-
9:228:17691:24:24:72:530:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:book ratio (a proxy for growth opportunities), free cash flow, cash on hand, leverage, past firm 
9:229:17788:24:25:72:516:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock market performance, volatility, firm size, firm age (to control for the “maturity” effect 
9:230:17884:25:24:72:533:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:posited by Julio and Ikenberry (2005)), and industry effects covering 14 broad groups.10  These 
9:231:17980:24:24:72:498:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables are as of year-end 2002, and are related to whether the firm increased ordinary 
9:232:18070:24:24:72:523:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends per share in 2003.  Columns 1 through 3 report the results from a linear probability 
9:233:18165:24:24:72:418:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:model, whereas columns 4 through 6 report results for a Probit model.   
9:234:18237:24:24:108:207:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table II here] 
9:235:18260:24:24:108:522:274:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our first principal finding is that the fraction of shares held by top five executives is a 
9:236:18352:24:25:72:522:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:very important determinant of dividend policy.  As shown in column 1, the coefficient on the 
9:237:18445:25:24:71:525:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:fraction of shares outstanding held by the top executives is positive and highly significant; the 
9:238:18543:24:24:71:513:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient of 54 indicates that moving from the 25th percentile (0.3%) to the 75th percentile 
9:239:18638:24:24:72:523:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3.2%) of the fraction of shares held by the top executives raises the probability of a dividend 
9:240:18735:24:24:72:539:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase by 1.6 percentage points, from a baseline of 28.7%.11  Further, a one-standard-deviation 
9:241:18833:24:24:72:513:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in executive ownership translates into a 4.2 percentage point higher likelihood of a 
9:242:18927:24:0:72:162:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend increase. 
10:243:18947:0:24:108:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:If it is indeed the case that the relation between executive stock ownership and dividend 
10:244:19037:24:24:72:527:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:activity is driven by the change in the tax cost of paying dividends, then such a relation should 
10:245:19135:24:24:71:505:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:not appear in prior years when dividends were taxed at a considerably higher rate (the top 
10:246:19226:24:24:71:513:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:personal rate was nearly 40% over the 1993 to 2002 period).  The next two columns, which 
10:247:19315:24:24:72:534:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:report coefficients from a single regression, provide such a comparison.  In column 2, we report 
10:248:19412:24:24:72:530:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:the coefficients on key covariates over the 1993 to 2002 period pooled, while column 3 reports 
10:249:19507:24:25:72:540:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:the interaction of these covariates with a year 2003 indicator variable.12  This approach allows us 
10:250:19607:25:24:72:504:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:to easily test whether the effect of each covariate is different in 2003 than in prior years.   
10:251:19703:24:24:108:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Focusing again on shares held by top five executives, we immediately see that there is no 
10:252:19793:24:24:72:535:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlation between executive share ownership and dividend increases in the prior decade, but a 
10:253:19889:24:24:72:536:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:strong relation in 2003, with the difference in the executive ownership effect highly significant.  
10:254:19989:24:24:71:511:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:This pattern is consistent with the view that the dividend tax cut reduced the cost of paying 
10:255:20083:24:25:71:496:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends and thus raised the probability of a dividend increase for those firms in which 
10:256:20173:25:24:72:533:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:management had the most to gain, such as by obtaining liquidity through dividend payments.     
10:257:20268:24:24:108:534:370:144:Times:144:Times:A:Before discussing other covariates, we also report, in columns 4 through 6, the marginal 
10:258:20357:24:24:72:539:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects from a Probit specification.  The marginal effect of a change in the fraction of shares held 
10:259:20458:24:24:72:491:322:144:Times:64:Times:B:by the top five executives is nearly identical to that from the linear probability model.13
10:260:20549:24:24:108:522:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:Turning to the many covariates that might plausibly explain firm payout behavior, we 
10:261:20634:24:24:72:504:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:find a pattern that is quite consistent with our hypothesis.  Not surprisingly, most of these 
10:262:20728:24:25:72:504:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:covariates have significant explanatory power in explaining cross-sectional differences in 
10:263:20819:25:24:72:526:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend policy.  Starting with the OLS results over the 1993 to 2002 period, the likelihood of 
10:264:20915:24:24:72:526:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing dividends is increasing with free cash flow, past five-year returns, and (log) market 
10:265:21012:24:24:72:540:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of the firm.  It is decreasing in the number of options held by top executives, cash on hand, 
10:266:21112:24:24:72:292:153:144:Times:64:Times:B:leverage, and monthly stock price volatility.14
10:267:21159:24:24:108:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:A:Perhaps most importantly for our hypothesis, the differences in the magnitude of these 
10:268:21246:24:24:72:515:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects between 2003 and the earlier decade are all insignificant.  In other words, we cannot 
10:269:21340:24:0:72:532:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:reject a zero difference between the effects of these covariates in 2003 versus prior years (the p-
11:270:21440:0:24:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of the joint test that the differences in the non-ownership coefficients are all zero is 0.85).  
11:271:21543:24:24:72:536:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, the only effect that has a differential effect in 2003 is executive share ownership, which is 
11:272:21643:24:24:72:504:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with our tax-motivation hypothesis.  The lack of a significant difference on the 
11:273:21735:24:24:72:523:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive options variable is particularly notable, because the implicit 100% tax on dividends 
11:274:21830:24:24:72:534:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:faced by executives who own non-dividend protected options did not change with the change in 
11:275:21923:24:24:72:528:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:the tax law.  This provides further reassurance that the observed correlations of interest are not 
11:276:22022:24:25:72:482:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:being spuriously driven by some third factor that generally influences both executive 
11:277:22108:25:24:72:234:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation and payout policy. 
11:278:22140:24:24:108:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:The results from the Probit are similar.  Executive stock option holdings, free cash flow, 
11:279:22231:24:24:72:493:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:cash on hand, leverage, past returns, volatility, and firm market value are all significant 
11:280:22323:24:24:72:542:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:predictors of firm payout behavior in general, but there is again no significant difference between 
11:281:22423:24:24:72:512:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:2003 and prior years.  Owing to the non-linear fit of the Probit model, the magnitude of the 
11:282:22516:24:25:72:498:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginal effects for many of the covariates are larger in absolute value than in the linear 
11:283:22608:25:24:72:493:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:probability model, but as noted, our primary coefficient of interest (executive shares) is 
11:284:22699:24:24:72:519:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:essentially unaffected.  The p-value of the joint test that the differences (i.e., 2003 relative to 
11:285:22799:24:24:72:540:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:1993-2002 period) in the non-ownership coefficients are all zero is 0.53, with only the difference 
11:286:22898:24:24:72:447:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the coefficient on market-to-book individually significant at the 10% level. 
11:287:22978:24:24:108:517:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:To summarize, the results in table II are consistent with our hypothesis that dividend 
11:288:23065:24:24:71:494:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases were motivated by executives’ personal financial incentives.  Executive share 
11:289:23153:24:25:71:538:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership is a significant determinant of dividend policy in 2003 but not in prior years, which is 
11:290:23252:25:24:71:541:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with a change in tax rates in 2003.  Conversely, other determinants of dividend policy, 
11:291:23351:24:24:71:538:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:while significant in all years, are generally not significantly different in 2003 versus prior years.  
11:292:23454:24:24:71:518:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:This provides assurance that there were not other factors or events changing in 2003 that are 
11:293:23548:24:24:72:541:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:spuriously driving the observed relation.  These results suggest that dividend policy was changed 
11:294:23646:24:24:72:545:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:in 2003 in response to the fact that the fall in dividend taxes reduces the cost of paying dividends, 
11:295:23748:24:24:72:533:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:and this effect is strongest in firms where the executives’ personal financial incentives are most 
11:296:23847:24:0:72:197:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:affected by the tax cut.     
12:297:23877:0:24:72:363:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:B.  Further Identification of the Executive Ownership Effect 
12:298:23938:24:24:108:532:684:144:Times:144:Times:A:In order to provide further evidence that the executive ownership effect is due to the tax 
12:299:24029:24:24:71:536:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut, we extend our analysis in two important ways in table III.  First, recognizing that the tax cut 
12:300:24130:24:24:71:533:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:did not occur until late May 2003, we break 2003 into two shorter time periods representing the 
12:301:24226:24:24:71:533:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:part of the year that fell before the tax cut and the part that fell after the tax cut.  In other words, 
12:302:24331:24:24:71:525:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:rather than simply focusing on 2003 versus 2002 (or the prior decade), we can focus on: i) the 
12:303:24426:24:25:71:530:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-2003 period, ii) the portion of 2003 through May 23 (when the tax cut was formally passed 
12:304:24520:25:24:71:535:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:by Congress), and iii) the portion of 2003 after May 23 (the period immediately after the tax cut 
12:305:24618:24:24:71:535:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:was passed).  The CRSP data allow us to divide dividend increases into these sub-periods based 
12:306:24713:24:24:71:541:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the announcement date, rather than the payable date, so that we can be sure of the relevant tax 
12:307:24812:24:24:71:397:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:regime in place at the time the firm made its dividend decisions.      
12:308:24883:24:24:108:527:443:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second, we distinguish between dividend increases that are dividend initiations among 
12:309:24969:24:25:72:531:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms that did not pay dividends in the prior year and dividend increases among firms that were 
12:310:25065:25:24:72:534:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:already paying dividends.  Among this latter group of firms that were already paying dividends, 
12:311:25161:24:24:72:537:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:we can also look at firms increased dividends by a large amount, which we define as an increase 
12:312:25257:24:24:72:273:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:in dividends per share of more than 25%. 
12:313:25298:24:24:108:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:A: These extensions are potentially important for determining causality.  For example, 
12:314:25382:24:24:72:538:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividing 2003 into a period before and after the tax cut may provide insight as to whether the tax 
12:315:25481:24:24:71:540:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut itself is the reason for the observed strong 2003 correlation between executive ownership and 
12:316:25579:24:25:71:531:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend policy.  If the observed correlation occurred mostly in the early part of the year, when 
12:317:25677:25:24:71:495:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:ultimate passage of the tax cut was uncertain, one might be concerned that the observed 
12:318:25765:24:24:71:534:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlation is not tax related.  Of course, as with any legislative event, there is uncertainty about 
12:319:25867:24:24:71:511:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:the release of information during the period between the initial announcement and the final 
12:320:25959:24:24:71:537:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:passage of the act, and thus how firms will react.  As noted earlier, the tax cut was unanticipated 
12:321:26059:24:24:71:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:before January 2003, but then from January to May, the possibility of a dividend tax cut was in 
12:322:26155:24:24:71:533:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:the news regularly.  While the ultimate passage of the tax bill was not a “sure thing” during this 
12:323:26254:24:0:71:502:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:period, some firms may have made changes to their dividend policy in anticipation of the 
13:324:26345:0:24:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible tax cut.  In particular, while it is highly unlikely that many firms would make a dramatic 
13:325:26445:24:24:72:516:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:change in payouts, such as initiating a dividend program, solely in anticipation of a possible 
13:326:26540:24:24:71:527:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:future tax cut, it is quite conceivable that a firm that was already paying dividends and already 
13:327:26638:24:24:72:539:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:considering an increase, might go ahead and raise the dividend during the January to May period 
13:328:26734:24:24:72:512:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:in anticipation of the tax cut.  If the latter were the case, and if executives with heavy stock 
13:329:26831:24:24:72:527:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership are more likely to push for the increase, then we might expect to see the correlation 
13:330:26927:24:25:72:527:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:between ownership and dividend increases become more important even before the passage of 
13:331:27017:25:24:72:526:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Act than in previous years.  Such an uptick in the correlation at the start of 2003 should be 
13:332:27115:24:24:72:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:less likely for a dividend initiation, however, since the cost of being wrong about the tax cut 
13:333:27211:24:24:72:532:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be greater (because the dollar amount of an average dividend initiation is typically much 
13:334:27307:24:24:72:438:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger than the size of a dividend increase among prior dividend payers.)      
13:335:27386:24:24:107:515:443:144:Times:144:Times:A:   The results, reported in table III, are consistent with these patterns.  Each coefficient 
13:336:27479:24:25:72:507:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported in table III represents the marginal effect of the percent of shares held by top five 
13:337:27574:25:24:72:536:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:executives on dividend increases from a separate linear probability model.15  In each regression, 
13:338:27672:24:24:72:537:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:we include all of the same control variables from table II, including the age and industry effects, 
13:339:27772:24:24:72:504:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:but do not report the individual coefficients on those controls in the interest of brevity.16   
13:340:27868:24:24:108:211:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table III here] 
13:341:27892:24:24:108:500:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:The first row corresponds to the linear probability model from table II, where the 
13:342:27975:24:24:72:509:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent variable is defined as any dividend increase (including firms with and without a 
13:343:28066:24:25:72:529:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:previous history of paying dividends).  In column 1, the coefficient of 6.3 on the probability of 
13:344:28164:25:24:72:481:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing dividends over 1993 to 2002 suggests that executive share ownership was 
13:345:28247:24:24:72:508:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:uncorrelated with dividend increases in the decade prior to the tax cut (this is the same 6.3 
13:346:28341:24:24:72:534:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient from column 2 in table II).  The second column in table III shows the result for 2002 
13:347:28439:24:24:72:527:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:only, and the coefficient is again quite similar and insignificant, as expected.  In column 3, we 
13:348:28537:24:24:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:see the highly significant coefficient of 54 on executive ownership for the year 2003, suggesting 
13:349:28635:24:24:71:532:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:a strong effect of executive ownership on dividend increases (again, this is the same coefficient 
13:350:28733:24:0:71:521:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:that we found in column 1 of table II).  In columns 4 and 5 of table III, we separate 2003 into 
14:351:28831:0:24:72:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre- and post-tax cut periods.  As can be seen, the significant correlation between executive 
14:352:28925:24:24:72:510:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and dividend increases is driven almost entirely by the post-tax cut period.  The 
14:353:29017:24:24:72:511:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient in the pre-tax cut period is indeed higher than in prior years, consistent with the 
14:354:29113:24:24:72:526:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility that some firms may have increased dividends in anticipation of the tax cut, but the 
14:355:29210:24:24:72:512:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect is not statistically different from zero.  In contrast, the coefficient for the post-tax cut 
14:356:29310:24:24:72:541:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:period is 43.3, which is not only significantly different from zero, but also from the coefficient in 
14:357:29412:24:25:72:531:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior years.  These results provide further evidence that the observed correlation is indeed a tax 
14:358:29511:25:24:72:111:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect.   
14:359:29521:24:24:108:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:How big is this executive ownership effect?  The actual fraction of firms increasing 
14:360:29606:24:24:72:507:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends in the portion of 2003 following the tax cut approval in May was 16.8%.  If one 
14:361:29696:24:24:72:515:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated a regression of dividend increases on the various explanatory variables during the 
14:362:29789:24:24:72:513:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:same time period in 2002, and used the estimated coefficients to predict the post-May 2003 
14:363:29880:24:25:72:514:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend increases, one would have predicted that only 9.5% of firms would have increased 
14:364:29970:25:24:72:499:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends.  The difference, approximately 7.4%, represents the “unexpected” increase in 
14:365:30058:24:24:72:533:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend activity.  The change in the relation between dividend policy and executive ownership 
14:366:30153:24:24:72:545:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:after the tax cut (relative to the same period in 2002) can explain 2.0 of this 7.4 percentage points, 
14:367:30256:24:24:72:279:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:or about one-quarter of the overall effect.   
14:368:30302:24:24:108:529:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:The results from row 1 of table III represent the combined effect of dividend initiations 
14:369:30392:24:24:72:519:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:and dividend increases among firms already paying dividends.  As noted, however, there are 
14:370:30483:24:25:72:541:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:reasons to suspect that firms already paying dividends might be willing to increase their dividend 
14:371:30582:25:24:72:510:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:in anticipation of a possible tax cut, whereas firms are less likely to initiate a new dividend 
14:372:30678:24:24:72:522:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:program for tax reasons until after the tax cut has become law.  This is because dividends are 
14:373:30773:24:24:72:531:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:“sticky,” in that investors may expect dividends to be paid out regularly once started and rarely 
14:374:30871:24:24:71:179:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut (Lintner (1956)).   
14:375:30895:24:24:108:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:A:Turning to the second row of table III, we focus on the subset of firms that did not pay 
14:376:30984:24:24:72:530:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends in the prior year and examine how executive compensation affects initiations.  In the 
14:377:31080:24:0:72:506:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:period prior to 2003, there is no discernable relation between executive compensation and 
15:378:31172:0:24:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend initiations, with an insignificant coefficient of 6.2 over the prior decade and –3.6 in 
15:379:31269:24:24:72:540:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002.  In contrast, there is a strong relation in 2003, with a highly significant coefficient of 37.8.  
15:380:31373:24:24:72:522:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:The coefficient of 37.8 indicates that moving from the 25th percentile (0.3 percent) to the 75th 
15:381:31469:24:24:72:535:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentile (3.2 percent) of the fraction of shares held by the top executives raises the probability 
15:382:31570:24:24:72:514:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:of a dividend initiation by 1.1 percentage points, while a one-standard-deviation increase in 
15:383:31664:24:24:71:504:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive ownership translates into a 2.9 percentage point higher likelihood of a dividend 
15:384:31755:24:25:72:541:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:initiation – both are economically large effects given the baseline initiation rate of 5.9% in 2003.  
15:385:31857:25:24:72:533:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:An examination of columns 4 and 5 indicate that this correlation with initiations occurs entirely 
15:386:31955:24:24:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:after the passage of the 2003 dividend tax cut.  This result is consistent with our hypothesis, as a 
15:387:32056:24:24:72:532:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm is unlikely to initiate a new dividend program for tax reasons until they are quite confident 
15:388:32155:24:24:72:199:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the passage of the act.   
15:389:32184:24:24:108:525:443:144:Times:144:Times:A:As above, we can use the regression coefficients from the latter part of 2002 to predict 
15:390:32273:24:25:72:503:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:the level of dividend initiations in the latter part of 2003 had the tax cut not occurred.  By 
15:391:32368:25:24:72:536:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparing the predicted to the actual, we find an “extra” 3.8 percentage points of firms initiated 
15:392:32467:24:24:72:541:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends after the tax cut.  The change in the relation between dividend initiations and executive 
15:393:32567:24:24:72:532:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership after the tax cut (relative to the same period in 2002) can explain approximately half 
15:394:32664:24:24:72:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:of this additional initiation activity (specifically, 1.8 percentage points of the 3.8 percentage 
15:395:32762:24:24:72:217:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:point “unexpected” increase.) 
15:396:32792:24:24:108:530:274:144:Times:144:Times:A:In row 3, we turn to dividend increases among firms that already have a prior history of 
15:397:32881:24:25:72:538:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:paying dividends to shareholders.  While there is no significant relation between executive share 
15:398:32979:25:24:72:498:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and dividend increases in the period before 2003, there is a highly significant 
15:399:33069:24:24:72:538:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient (72.6) for the year 2003.  In contrast to initiations, where this effect was concentrated 
15:400:33171:24:24:72:544:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the post-tax cut months, this effect is more evenly divided over the pre and post tax cut period.  
15:401:33273:24:24:72:542:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:This is not entirely surprising given that firms that already pay dividends and that may be already 
15:402:33373:24:24:72:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:considering increasing dividends further may be more willing to go ahead and increase dividends 
15:403:33469:24:24:72:530:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:in anticipation of the tax cut, because of the cost of being wrong about the tax cut is lower than 
15:404:33568:24:0:72:159:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:for an initiation.   
16:405:33591:0:24:108:505:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Because many firms with dividend programs follow a rather predictable pattern of 
16:406:33672:24:24:72:503:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:slightly increasing dividends every year, it is also of interest to focus on “large” dividend 
16:407:33766:24:24:72:538:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases.  We therefore examine whether executive ownership is correlated with the probability 
16:408:33862:24:24:72:533:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:of increasing dividends by more than 25% over the prior year’s dividend level.17  We observe a 
16:409:33957:24:24:72:525:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant relation between executive ownership in the pooled 1993 to 2002 data, 
16:410:34053:24:24:72:529:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:although this effect is substantially and significantly smaller than in 2003, with a coefficient of 
16:411:34153:24:25:72:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:only 12.9, versus the 64.9 that we observe in 2003.  Thus, the overall pattern is similar to that of 
16:412:34254:25:24:72:528:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:any dividend increase among prior payers (i.e., including smaller increases), with a coefficient 
16:413:34351:24:24:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:for 2003 that is significant and much higher than in prior years, but with the effect spread much 
16:414:34449:24:24:72:270:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:more evenly over 2003 than initiations.   
16:415:34491:24:24:108:540:467:144:Times:144:Times:A:Overall, these results indicate that the correlation between executive share ownership and 
16:416:34582:24:24:72:503:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend activity was uniquely strong in the year 2003.  Firms were loathe to start paying 
16:417:34673:24:25:72:538:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends for tax reasons until they had a high degree of confidence that the tax reduction would 
16:418:34771:25:24:72:516:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:become law, and thus the executive ownership effect upon initiations is concentrated almost 
16:419:34863:24:24:72:537:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:entirely in the period following the tax cut.  For dividend increases among firms that already pay 
16:420:34962:24:24:72:524:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends, the results suggest that many of the firms with high executive ownership increased 
16:421:35056:24:24:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends even prior to final passage, during the period in which the President and Republican 
16:422:35151:24:24:72:499:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:members of Congress were moving the tax cut from initial proposal to final legislation.   
16:423:35241:24:24:72:413:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:C.  Share and Option Ownership by Institutions and Other Individuals 
16:424:35310:24:25:108:534:250:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our results provide evidence that the stock ownership of top executives has a significant 
16:425:35400:25:24:72:496:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect on a firm’s decision of whether to increase dividends after the tax cut.  Of course, 
16:426:35492:24:24:72:511:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership by other groups could also have led to a differential response to the tax cut.  For 
16:427:35586:24:24:72:537:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, a firm that is owned mostly by individual investors would benefit relatively more from 
16:428:35682:24:24:72:514:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:the tax cut than a firm whose shares are owned primarily by pension funds, whose dividend 
16:429:35772:24:24:72:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:income is not subject to tax.18  Further, options held by non-executives, as well as those held by 
16:430:35871:24:24:72:545:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:top executives, have been shown to influence payout policy (Lambert, Lanen and Larcker (1989), 
16:431:35966:24:0:72:542:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:Jolls (1998), Weisbenner (2000), Fenn and Liang (2001), Kahle (2002)).  However, since options 
17:432:36063:0:24:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:are not dividend-protected, their effect on dividends should not vary with a change in dividend 
17:433:36159:24:24:72:534:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax rates.  In light of this, we have tested whether these other stock and option holders influence 
17:434:36259:24:24:72:413:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend policy, and if so, whether the effect changed with the tax cut. 
17:435:36332:24:24:108:536:636:144:Times:144:Times:A:In table IV, we re-estimate our primary specifications for the 2003 sample, as well as the 
17:436:36423:24:24:72:543:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference in the relevant coefficient for 2003 relative to the pooled period 1993-2002.  However, 
17:437:36522:24:24:72:522:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:this time we include additional controls for the fraction of shares held by individual investors 
17:438:36619:24:25:72:540:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:other then the top five executives and the fraction of shares held by non-mutual fund institutional 
17:439:36719:25:24:72:542:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:investors (primarily tax-exempt pension funds).  Like top executives, all individuals would face a 
17:440:36818:24:24:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher after-tax return to dividends in 2003 than earlier years.  However, the share of the firm 
17:441:36915:24:24:72:533:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:held by each of the non-executive individuals is less likely to represent a large part of their own 
17:442:37015:24:24:72:527:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:personal wealth, and so the provision of liquidity is not nearly as an important an incentive for 
17:443:37113:24:24:72:519:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend payments as it is for top management.  The omitted category in this specification is 
17:444:37207:24:25:72:540:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:mutual funds, which includes both taxable and tax-exempt accounts and which would potentially 
17:445:37301:25:24:72:434:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefit more from the tax cut than non-mutual fund institutional investors.  
17:446:37378:24:24:108:212:370:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table IV here] 
17:447:37401:24:24:108:525:346:144:Times:144:Times:A:The key finding from this specification is that even after controlling for individual and 
17:448:37491:24:24:71:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutional ownership, the coefficient on executive ownership shares in 2003 relative to the 
17:449:37586:24:24:71:511:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior decade (displayed in column 3 of table IV), is 47.4 and highly significant, and is little 
17:450:37682:24:24:71:502:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:changed from the 47.7 in the specification without individual and institutional ownership 
17:451:37772:24:25:71:519:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:(displayed in column 3 of table II).19  Thus, while many of the other ownership variables are 
17:452:37866:25:24:72:533:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:themselves significant, their inclusion does not alter the executive ownership effect, and, unlike 
17:453:37965:24:24:72:530:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive stock holdings, their own effect on dividend policy does not change in 2003 with the 
17:454:38060:24:24:72:110:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax cut. 
17:455:38069:24:24:108:531:153:144:Times:144:Times:A:The effects of the other ownership variables are of some interest in their own right.  For 
17:456:38160:24:24:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, we find a positive relation between the fraction of shares held by individuals and the 
17:457:38256:24:24:72:544:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:likelihood of a dividend boost during 2003, which by itself is consistent with the tax motivations.  
17:458:38357:24:0:72:506:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, in contrast to the results for executive ownership, the relation for non-executive 
18:459:38451:0:24:72:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals was no different in 2003 than it was for the prior decade when dividend tax rates 
18:460:38545:24:24:72:521:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:were much higher.20  Brav, Graham, Harvey, and Michaely (2005) find that only 1/5 of chief 
18:461:38636:24:24:72:517:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial officers report that the personal taxes shareholders pay are important when making 
18:462:38729:24:24:72:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend decisions.  Our results are consistent with this survey evidence—we find that firms with 
18:463:38827:24:24:72:539:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:high individual ownership did not boost dividends in response to the 2003 tax cut, but those with 
18:464:38925:24:24:72:221:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:high executive ownership did.  
18:465:38956:24:25:108:541:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:In addition, we find a positive and significant coefficient on the fraction of shares held by 
18:466:39050:25:24:72:536:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-mutual fund institutions, which presumably have more tax-exempt assets than mutual funds 
18:467:39143:24:24:72:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:(the omitted category), throughout the 1993 to 2003 period.  The effect is not statistically 
18:468:39236:24:24:71:517:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:different in 2003 than over the prior decade.  Of course, the dividend tax cut yields no direct 
18:469:39332:24:24:71:534:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in the after-tax value of dividends paid on shares held by tax-exempt institutions, and a 
18:470:39431:24:24:71:519:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:pure tax story would suggest the opposite sign.  This finding, however, is consistent with the 
18:471:39526:24:25:72:542:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:view that institutional investors such as pension funds serve as monitors of firms.  Pension funds, 
18:472:39626:25:24:72:538:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:for example, are generally considered to be much more active monitors of corporations, whereas 
18:473:39721:24:24:72:530:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:mutual funds are thought to “vote with their feet” and simply sell the shares of companies with 
18:474:39817:24:24:71:531:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:poor governance mechanisms (Gillan and Starks (1998)).  With skepticism about the quality of 
18:475:39910:24:24:71:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:corporate earnings in the post-Enron period, there was a growing perception that firms should be 
18:476:40007:24:24:71:535:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:pressured to pay dividends, because cash distributions cannot be manipulated and make it easier 
18:477:40103:24:24:71:540:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:for investors to verify the cash flows of the firm.  In addition, DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Skinner 
18:478:40201:24:25:71:541:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2000) also argue that institutions may like the smoothness of regular dividends because it makes 
18:479:40299:25:24:71:542:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:their task of rebalancing their portfolios more predictable and thus they increase their demand for 
18:480:40399:24:24:71:395:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends when its after-tax cost to other shareholders declines.      
18:481:40470:24:24:108:514:177:144:Times:144:Times:A:In unreported results, we also find that options held by employees outside of the top 
18:482:40556:24:24:72:539:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:senior ranks have a negative effect on dividend increases in 2003, but that the effect is about one-
18:483:40656:24:24:72:531:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:third the magnitude of that for options held by the top executives. Similar to executive options, 
18:484:40754:24:0:72:523:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:the effect of lower management options on dividend policy is not different in 2003 relative to 
19:485:40851:0:24:72:506:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002, as would be expected, given that the dividend “tax rate” on options is 100% in both 
19:486:40941:24:24:71:108:684:144:Times:64:Times:B:years.21
19:487:40949:24:24:108:527:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:In sum, the coefficients on the additional ownership variables and the option variables, 
19:488:41038:24:24:72:519:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:both for upper management and lower level employees, suggest that they also influenced the 
19:489:41129:24:24:72:511:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:likelihood of a dividend increase in 2003.  However, only the relation with executive stock 
19:490:41221:24:24:71:528:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership is larger in 2003 relative to the pre-tax cut period, indicating that the tax cut did not 
19:491:41321:24:25:71:540:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence dividends through these other measures.  The inclusion of these other controls has very 
19:492:41419:25:24:71:542:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:little influence on the executive holdings variables, suggesting that our executive holdings results 
19:493:41520:24:24:71:472:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:are not being spuriously driven by the composition of the other owners of the firm. 
19:494:41604:24:24:72:225:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:D.  Further Robustness Checks 
19:495:41634:24:24:108:506:467:144:Times:144:Times:A: In this section, we briefly discuss the large number of specification checks that we 
19:496:41719:24:24:72:540:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:conducted.22  The key point is that our primary finding – namely, that executive stock ownership 
19:497:41816:24:25:71:518:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:strongly influenced payout policy following the 2003 dividend tax cut – is extremely robust. 
19:498:41909:25:24:108:513:394:144:Times:144:Times:A:Using the CRSP definition of dividends allows us to determine the precise dividend 
19:499:41992:24:24:72:523:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:announcement date and thus to sub-divide the 2003 period into pre- and post-tax cut periods.  
19:500:42086:24:24:72:505:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:We have, however, also tested our hypothesis using annual dividends paid as measured in 
19:501:42174:24:24:72:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Compustat, which includes both ordinary dividends as well as special dividends.  In contrast to 
19:502:42270:24:24:72:531:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:ordinary dividends, where the firm has the incentive to increase them only if they are confident 
19:503:42367:24:24:72:518:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:that they continue to pay them in the future, special dividends are a one-time tool and do not 
19:504:42462:24:25:72:501:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily signal a long-term increase in payouts.  Given the prominence of Microsoft’s 
19:505:42551:25:24:72:541:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:announcement in July 2004 that they would pay a special dividend of $3 per share, totaling about 
19:506:42648:24:24:72:534:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:$32 billion,23 and the work of Blouin, Raedy, and Shackelford (2004) that finds a rise in special 
19:507:42746:24:24:72:504:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends after the tax cut, one might be interested in whether the results are significantly 
19:508:42840:24:24:72:516:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:affected.  Using the Compustat measure of annual total dividends paid to construct dividend 
19:509:42932:24:24:72:500:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases and initiations, we find that the results for 2003 are quite similar, with a highly 
19:510:43026:24:24:72:531:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant coefficient on executive share ownership of 55.5 in the dividend increase regression 
19:511:43123:24:0:72:528:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 38.1 in the initiation regression (the differences between these 2003 coefficients and those 
20:512:43222:0:24:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the pre-tax cut period 1993 to 2002 are 51.4 and 32.6, respectively, and are also highly 
20:513:43316:24:24:72:147:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant).24   
20:514:43334:24:24:108:513:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:Baker and Hall (2004) argue that for many incentive problems, the dollar amount of 
20:515:43417:24:24:72:517:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:management ownership is a more accurate measure of management’s incentives.  Thus, as a 
20:516:43505:24:24:72:534:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:second specification check, we replace our dependent variable with the log of the dollar amount 
20:517:43601:24:24:72:538:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:of shares held.  Returning to our CRSP definition of an increase in ordinary dividends, we find a 
20:518:43699:24:25:72:523:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient on the natural log of the dollar value of shares held by top executive shares of 3.0, 
20:519:43797:25:24:72:533:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:which is significant at the 1% level.  Of note, we find that the coefficient in 2003 is also greater 
20:520:43898:24:24:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the coefficient in the 1993 to 2002 period, and that this difference of 1.8 is significant at the 
20:521:44001:24:24:72:541:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:5% level.  Among dividend initiators, we find a similar effect, with a coefficient on the log of the 
20:522:44102:24:24:72:532:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:dollar value of executive shares of 1.8, which is significantly different from both zero and from 
20:523:44200:24:24:72:526:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:the coefficient in the 1993 to 2002 period at the 1% level (difference in coefficients is 1.7).      
20:524:44301:24:25:108:524:419:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally, we also break executive ownership into that held by the CEO and that held by 
20:525:44387:25:24:72:533:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:other top executives to see if the holdings of the CEO are a bigger determinant of payout policy 
20:526:44484:24:24:72:535:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:than those of the next four top executives in the firm (CEOs, on average, account for about one- 
20:527:44581:24:24:72:502:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:half of the stock held by the firm’s top five executives at the end of 2002).  For both total 
20:528:44675:24:24:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend increases and dividend initiations, we find that both the share ownership of the CEO 
20:529:44769:24:24:72:513:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:and that for the other top executives are important determinants of dividend policy in 2003. 
20:530:44862:24:25:72:75:274:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
20:531:44862:25:24:72:416:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:III.  Executive Holdings and the Dividend Substitution Hypothesis  
20:532:44929:24:24:108:532:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:The 2003 Economic Report of the President, released in February of that year, provided 
20:533:45016:24:24:71:506:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Bush administration’s economic rationale for the dividend tax cut.  In the analysis, the 
20:534:45109:24:24:71:505:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:administration highlighted a number of reasons that a cut in dividend tax rates could have 
20:535:45200:24:24:71:519:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive economic effects, including the elimination of distortions to investment decisions of 
20:536:45295:24:24:71:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms, arguing that “the heavier tax burden on dividends can encourage investment in established 
20:537:45392:24:24:71:528:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:businesses with internally generated earnings, because these businesses will tend to have more 
20:538:45487:24:0:71:540:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:retained earnings because of the tax distortion.”  Implicit in this claim is that the dividend tax cut 
21:539:45592:0:24:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:will increase dividends and result in higher total payouts, rather than cause firms to shift the type 
21:540:45694:24:24:72:523:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:of payout towards dividends and away from share repurchases.  Grullon and Michaely (2002) 
21:541:45784:24:24:72:528:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:find that firms with large repurchase programs also have a lower than expected dividend yield, 
21:542:45879:24:24:72:511:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicating some substitutability between the two.  We, on the other hand, wish to test if the 
21:543:45973:24:24:72:540:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:reverse is also true – do firms that increased dividends in response to the tax cut at the same time 
21:544:46074:24:24:72:200:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduce share repurchases? 
21:545:46100:24:25:108:515:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:In table V, we examine dividends and share repurchases paid during a given year by 
21:546:46183:25:24:71:539:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms in our sample as reported in Compustat.  We define share repurchases as funds used to buy 
21:547:46279:24:24:71:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:back shares, as reported on cash flow statements, consistent with other studies (e.g., Jagannathan, 
21:548:46379:24:24:71:540:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:Stephens, and Weisbach (2000), Fenn and Liang (2001), and Grullon and Michaely (2002)).  For 
21:549:46472:24:24:71:523:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:the subset of firms that increased/initiated dividends, as well as for firms that did not increase 
21:550:46571:24:24:71:498:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:their dividend payouts, we report three statistics.  First, we report the likelihood the firm 
21:551:46665:24:25:71:531:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:repurchased shares in the previous year and thus has a track record of distributing cash through 
21:552:46762:25:24:72:499:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:other means.  Second, we report the likelihood that the firm decreased share repurchases 
21:553:46851:24:24:72:516:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:(normalized by assets) conditional on having bought back stock in the prior year.  Third, we 
21:554:46944:24:24:72:515:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:report the probability that the firm increased total payouts (dividend plus share repurchases, 
21:555:47039:24:24:72:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:normalized by assets) relative to the prior year.  We do these calculations for three cohorts of 
21:556:47136:24:24:71:519:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend increasers, those that increased in the periods prior to the tax cut (1993 to 2002 and 
21:557:47232:24:24:71:318:274:144:Times:64:Times:B:2002) and those that increased dividends in 2003.25
21:558:47283:24:25:108:208:250:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table V here] 
21:559:47305:25:24:108:536:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:The first row of table V reports results for all firms that increased dividends.  It indicates 
21:560:47400:24:24:72:542:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the fraction of dividend increasers in 2003 that had previously repurchased shares (67%) was 
21:561:47498:24:24:71:542:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:not significantly different from the prior decade (65%).  Just less than two-thirds of the firms that 
21:562:47600:24:24:71:516:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased dividends in 2003 reduced their level of share repurchases (normalized by assets), 
21:563:47693:24:24:71:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:which is slightly higher than in prior years.  The net result is that only about one-half (52%) of 
21:564:47792:24:24:71:527:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividend increasers actually increased total payouts (normalized by assets).  This fraction is in 
21:565:47890:24:0:71:190:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:line with prior years.26   
22:566:47919:0:24:108:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:For dividend initiations, the evidence is strongly suggestive of partial substitution.  As 
22:567:48010:24:24:72:536:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in the middle row of the upper panel, we find that among firms that initiated dividends in 
22:568:48107:24:24:71:520:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:2003, 68% had repurchased shares in the previous year, significantly greater than the 38% in 
22:569:48200:24:24:72:531:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:1993 to 2002.  Among these repurchasing-firms, 78% reduced their share repurchases from the 
22:570:48292:24:24:72:535:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:previous year’s level upon initiating dividends in 2003, again significantly greater than the 56% 
22:571:48390:24:24:72:509:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:in 1993 to 2002.  The net result is that 66% of all the firms that initiated dividends in 2003 
22:572:48485:24:25:72:529:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:(including those that had not repurchased shares in 2002) also increased total payouts, with the 
22:573:48582:25:24:72:528:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:remaining one-third actually cutting total payouts the year they started paying dividends.  As a 
22:574:48679:24:24:72:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:benchmark, if no substitution had occurred, 100% of the firms that initiated dividends would 
22:575:48772:24:24:72:541:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:have increased total payouts.27  The contrast of the effect of a dividend initiation on total payouts 
22:576:48874:24:24:71:534:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:for 2003 relative to previous years is striking.  During the previous decade (1993 to 2002), 89% 
22:577:48971:24:24:71:518:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:of firms that initiated dividends increased total payouts.  In 2002, the figure was 92 percent.  
22:578:49068:24:25:71:530:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:These rates are much closer to the 100% that we would expect if no substitution had occurred.  
22:579:49163:25:24:71:529:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:These results are not driven by what may have been a lower inclination to repurchase shares in 
22:580:49258:24:24:71:514:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:the early to mid-1990s, as the pattern of increased payouts upon a dividend initiation is also 
22:581:49353:24:24:71:536:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:present when we focus only on the year 2002.  Thus, it appears that there are an additional 20 to 
22:582:49451:24:24:71:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:25% of dividend initiators in 2003 than in prior years that failed to increase total payouts in the 
22:583:49551:24:24:71:219:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:year they initiated dividends.   
22:584:49584:24:24:108:524:274:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another possible reason that repurchases might have fallen in 2003 is that fewer stock 
22:585:49671:24:25:72:544:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:options were being exercised that year, and thus the incentive to buy back is potentially lessened.  
22:586:49772:25:24:72:516:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:To test this possibility, we show in row 3 of table V that payouts did not decline to the same 
22:587:49867:24:24:71:508:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:degree for firms that did not increase dividends.  Specifically, the fraction of non-dividend 
22:588:49961:24:24:71:539:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasers in 2003 that repurchased shares in the prior year (50%) was similar in 2003 as in prior 
22:589:50060:24:24:71:517:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:years (44% for 1993 to 2002, and 51% in 2002).  Similarly, the fraction of firms that did not 
22:590:50154:24:24:71:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase dividends in 2003 that experienced a decline in repurchases-to-assets in 2003 was quite 
22:591:50251:24:0:71:541:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar to prior years (64% in 2003, versus 63% over prior decade and 58% in 2002).  As such, it 
23:592:50350:0:24:72:504:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:does not appear that our substitution result among initiators is driven by a general decline 
23:593:50443:24:24:72:211:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:repurchases across all firms. 
23:594:50473:24:24:108:537:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:To provide perspective on the size of the change in total payouts, the bottom panel of the 
23:595:50564:24:24:72:521:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:table shows the distribution of changes in dividends, share repurchases, and total payouts (all 
23:596:50660:24:24:72:519:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:normalized by assets) for firms that initiated dividends.  The normalized size of the dividend 
23:597:50755:24:24:72:520:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:initiation is comparable for the pre-tax cut period (1993 to 2002) and the post-tax cut (2003), 
23:598:50851:24:25:72:502:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:with no statistical difference in the mean or median.  However, the changes in both share 
23:599:50941:25:24:72:542:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:repurchases and total payouts in 2003 are considerably lower than the changes in previous years.  
23:600:51039:24:24:71:535:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:The mean change in share repurchases (normalized by assets) is –1.6 percentage points in 2003, 
23:601:51134:24:24:71:509:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:leading to only a 0.6 percentage point increase in the payout-to-asset ratio, compared to an 
23:602:51227:24:24:71:542:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:average of a 4.5 percentage point increase over the period 1993 to 2002.  Median changes in total 
23:603:51325:24:24:71:529:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:payouts are also smaller in 2003, though not significantly different from earlier years.  Perhaps 
23:604:51423:24:25:71:532:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:most telling is the negative change in payouts at the 25th percentile in 2003 relative to the slight 
23:605:51524:25:24:72:537:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in payouts at the 25th percentile from 1993 to 2002, owing to the more frequent cutback 
23:606:51621:24:24:71:280:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:in share repurchases that occurred in 2003. 
23:607:51665:24:24:108:522:346:144:Times:144:Times:A:Overall, these tabulations suggest some substitution from repurchases to dividends, at 
23:608:51752:24:24:72:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:least among dividend initiators, prompted by the dividend tax cut.  The fact that there was no 
23:609:51847:24:24:72:504:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in total payouts among about one-third of dividend initiators might be somewhat 
23:610:51936:24:24:72:539:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:surprising given that the tax burden of total payouts declined.  However, for firms that had relied 
23:611:52036:24:25:71:531:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:more heavily on share repurchases to distribute excess cash flow (which was evidently the case 
23:612:52131:25:24:71:539:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:for many of the dividend initiators in 2003), the reduction in the tax burden is actually somewhat 
23:613:52230:24:24:71:524:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:small.  The tax rate on dividends was cut to the statutory rate on long-term capital gains (both 
23:614:52327:24:24:71:525:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:were changed to 15%), but firms for which the previously higher tax burden of dividends was 
23:615:52419:24:24:71:508:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:important likely had switched to share repurchases to exploit their tax advantage.  With an 
23:616:52511:24:24:71:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:equalization of statutory rates, these firms became more willing to substitute towards dividends 
23:617:52608:24:0:71:381:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:and scale back repurchases, leaving total payouts little changed. 
24:618:52676:0:24:108:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:The analysis in table V suggests nontrivial substitution of dividends for share repurchases 
24:619:52768:24:24:72:484:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:among firms initiating dividend programs.  In table VI we more rigorously model the 
24:620:52852:24:24:72:527:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:determinants of the broader payout policy choices firms made in response to the 2003 tax cut.  
24:621:52947:24:24:72:526:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:As in the bottom panel of table V, we also focus here on the level of payouts, this time using a 
24:622:53044:24:24:72:523:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tobit specification.  Having established that there is some substitution occurring, we are now 
24:623:53139:24:24:72:529:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:interested in whether the executive-ownership-induced increase in dividends in 2003 translated 
24:624:53234:24:25:72:510:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly into higher total payouts or was instead offset, leaving total payouts little changed. 
24:625:53330:25:24:108:212:539:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table VI here] 
24:626:53353:24:24:108:528:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:We begin by running a Tobit specification where the dependent variable is equal to the 
24:627:53440:24:24:72:533:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in the amount of dividends paid (again normalized by assets), or zero for firms that did 
24:628:53538:24:24:72:538:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:not increase dividends-to-assets, during the year 2003.  Column 1 reports the coefficients for the 
24:629:53637:24:24:72:533:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification estimated on all firms.  Looking first at the non-ownership control variables in the 
24:630:53736:24:25:72:510:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tobit model, the results indicate, not surprisingly, that free cash flow and cash on hand are 
24:631:53830:25:24:72:516:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:positively related to the size of a dividend increase, while the executive option holdings, the 
24:632:53926:24:24:72:523:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:market-to-book ratio, and volatility are negatively related to the amount of the increase.  This 
24:633:54023:24:24:72:498:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:holds true both in 2003 and in unreported results for prior years.  Turning to the primary 
24:634:54114:24:24:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient of interest, we see that greater executive ownership of shares leads to a larger amount 
24:635:54214:24:24:72:529:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:of dividends.  Importantly, this effect is not only significantly different from zero, but it is also 
24:636:54316:24:24:72:497:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly different from the effect of executive ownership on the amount of dividend 
24:637:54405:24:25:72:529:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases in the earlier decade.  Indeed, in unreported results, a Tobit model estimated over the 
24:638:54503:25:24:72:538:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-tax cut period yields a statistically insignificant, close to zero, effect of executive ownership. 
24:639:54606:24:24:108:522:201:144:Times:144:Times:A:In column 2, we report a similar specification, but this time we replace the increase in 
24:640:54695:24:24:72:534:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends(-to-assets) with the increase in total payouts (dividends plus repurchases-to-assets) as 
24:641:54794:24:24:72:527:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:the dependent variable.  We find that while greater executive share ownership translates into a 
24:642:54890:24:24:72:518:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher level of dividends, it does not lead to greater total payouts.  These results suggest that 
24:643:54988:24:24:72:542:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms with executive-ownership-induced dividend initiations in response to the 2003 tax cut often 
24:644:55086:24:0:72:540:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:engaged in dividend substitution (i.e., often did not boost total payouts to shareholders as a result 
25:645:55190:0:24:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the new dividend program).  In unreported results, a Tobit model estimated over the pre-tax 
25:646:55285:24:24:72:536:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut period also yields a statistically insignificant, close to zero, effect of executive ownership on 
25:647:55387:24:24:72:519:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:total payouts.  Thus, unlike the dividends result, the relation between executive holdings and 
25:648:55482:24:24:72:289:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:total payouts do not seem to change in 2003. 
25:649:55527:24:24:108:525:612:144:Times:144:Times:A:In columns 3 and 4, the exercise is repeated for those firms that did not previously pay 
25:650:55616:24:24:72:536:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends.  We find a highly significant positive relation between the executive share ownership 
25:651:55713:24:25:71:533:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable and the amount of a dividend initiation.  This relation does not, however, exist for total 
25:652:55813:25:24:71:503:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:payouts.  Again, this is evidence that those firms that initiated dividends due to executive 
25:653:55906:24:24:71:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership considerations did not always experience a comparable increase in total payouts.   
25:654:55999:24:24:108:486:491:144:Times:144:Times:A: These findings on dividend substitution complement prior studies that support 
25:655:56077:24:24:71:537:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:substitution between dividends and share repurchases.  Grullon and Michaely (2002) find higher 
25:656:56172:24:24:71:536:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:share repurchases by firms whose dividend increases are less than what would be predicted by a 
25:657:56267:24:25:71:511:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:model of firm-level dividend changes, and Dittmar (2000) has similar findings based on an 
25:658:56357:25:24:71:542:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate-level analysis.  Our study, which benefits from the exogenous change in the tax rate on 
25:659:56455:24:24:71:534:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends, provides evidence of payout substitution in the other direction.  Specifically, we find 
25:660:56554:24:24:71:538:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:that shareholder taxes are a factor in the choice of payout mechanism and that when the tax rates 
25:661:56652:24:24:71:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:are more closely aligned, firms exhibit some substitutability between the two (i.e., increasing 
25:662:56748:24:24:71:342:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends, at least in part, by reducing stock buybacks). 
25:663:56806:24:25:72:75:274:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
25:664:56806:25:24:72:489:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:IV.  Evidence from the Market Reaction to the Dividend Tax Cut Announcement 
25:665:56882:24:24:108:524:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:We have shown that a firm’s ownership structure and the composition of its executive 
25:666:56967:24:24:72:531:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:holdings influenced the change in payout policy following the dividend tax cut.  This raises the 
25:667:57064:24:24:72:523:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility that, to the extent that the financial markets anticipated these responses, one might 
25:668:57162:24:24:72:542:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:expect a differential market response to the dividend tax cut based on these characteristics.  Here, 
25:669:57263:24:24:72:531:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:we explore whether the market anticipated that at firms with large management stock holdings, 
25:670:57357:24:24:72:528:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:the tax cut would lead to a substitution of dividends for tax-advantaged share repurchases, and 
25:671:57453:24:0:72:483:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:thus perhaps raise the average tax burden on total distributions, at least for individual 
26:672:57545:0:24:72:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:shareholders.  This analysis can be thought of as an indirect test of whether the compensation 
26:673:57640:24:24:72:498:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:contract for executives results in agency problems between executives and shareholders. 
26:674:57728:24:24:108:504:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:As with any event study, the power of the test depends on how accurately one can 
26:675:57809:24:24:72:520:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:identify the actual date on which the value-relevant information was released to the financial 
26:676:57904:24:24:72:540:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets.  While an ideal event study has a very well defined event window, for legislative events 
26:677:58002:24:24:72:503:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:the release of information is often spread out over a long legislative process, including, at 
26:678:58096:24:25:72:526:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum, an initial announcement of intent, committee hearings and votes, and votes by each 
26:679:58188:25:24:72:523:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:house of Congress prior to final Presidential approval.  Despite the difficulties, there is a long 
26:680:58287:24:24:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:history of research examining the effect of legislative events on stock prices.28  The legislative 
26:681:58386:24:24:72:523:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:process surrounding the 2003 dividend tax cut includes the possible release of information on 
26:682:58480:24:24:72:530:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:multiple dates.  For purposes of this section, we focus on eight event windows, each consisting 
26:683:58576:24:24:72:518:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:of five trading days (a +/-2 day window around each event).  These eight event windows are 
26:684:58667:24:25:72:540:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:based on the careful analysis of news events between December 2002 and the May 2003 passage 
26:685:58759:25:24:72:536:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the dividend tax cut conducted by Auerbach and Hassett (2005).  These eight event windows, 
26:686:58853:24:24:72:519:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:combined spanning 40 trading days, are meant to capture the market reaction from the initial 
26:687:58946:24:24:72:525:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:announcement of the tax cut proposal by the White House through the final passage of the tax 
26:688:59039:24:24:72:226:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut in the House and Senate.29   
26:689:59072:24:24:108:510:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:The average stock return for our sample of firms, compounded over the eight event 
26:690:59154:24:24:72:523:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:windows, is 9.9 percent, with a median of 6.4 percent.  Because a standard OLS regression of 
26:691:59247:24:25:72:530:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns will be sensitive to outliers (some sample firms had extreme performance over these 40 
26:692:59342:25:24:72:501:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:days as returns varied from a high of over 200% to a low of –44%), we estimate a robust 
26:693:59430:24:24:72:247:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression and a median regression. 
26:694:59466:24:24:108:498:177:144:Times:144:Times:A:Given that the dividend tax cut applied only to individual investors, we have two 
26:695:59548:24:24:72:531:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:predictions for the stock price reaction of firms to the dividend tax cut.  First, returns should be 
26:696:59649:24:24:72:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher for those firms with higher individual ownership (the group that gains from the reduction 
26:697:59746:24:24:72:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:in individual tax rates) and that also have historically paid more.  This implies that the coefficient 
26:698:59849:24:0:72:528:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the interaction of individual ownership and the prior year dividends-to-asset ratio should be 
27:699:59948:0:24:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive.  This simply reflects the fact that, holding payout policy constant, the dividend tax cut 
27:700:60048:24:24:72:518:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:is more valuable for firms with higher levels of dividends (as opposed to share repurchases). 
27:701:60142:24:24:108:534:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our second prediction is the most important for investigating the role of executive share 
27:702:60232:24:24:72:517:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership.  To the extent that the markets anticipated that some of the firms that initiated or 
27:703:60328:24:24:71:510:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased dividends were more likely to reduce share repurchases (less likely to boost total 
27:704:60421:24:24:72:539:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:payouts) in 2003 than in prior years, we would expect a negative coefficient on the interaction of 
27:705:60520:24:25:72:507:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:the level of individual ownership and executive holdings.  As noted earlier, the overall tax 
27:706:60613:25:24:72:532:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:burden for the individual shareholder may have increased because despite equal statutory rates, 
27:707:60709:24:24:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:share repurchases are still tax-preferred because capital gains can be deferred.  The intuition is as 
27:708:60811:24:24:72:527:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows:  if a firm has a higher level of individual ownership, which leads shareholders to care 
27:709:60908:24:24:72:533:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:more about dividend taxes, and also has a higher level of executive ownership, which leads to a 
27:710:61004:24:24:72:517:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater likelihood of dividend substitution and greater individual tax burden, then relative to 
27:711:61100:24:25:72:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:other firms there should be a negative stock price reaction.  In a sense, this interaction of 
27:712:61194:25:24:72:518:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive holdings with the share of individual ownership provides a way of quantifying the 
27:713:61286:24:24:72:540:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential agency issues between management and shareholders.  If the tax cut induces executives 
27:714:61382:24:24:72:522:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:with wealth tied up in company stock to boost or initiate dividend payments, even though the 
27:715:61475:24:24:72:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-executive individual shareholders with far less concentrated portfolios would still prefer 
27:716:61570:24:24:72:528:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:receipt of capital gains via earnings retention or stock buybacks to dividends even after the tax 
27:717:61668:24:24:72:535:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut, this would be indicative of agency issues.  Thus, the more negative is the coefficient on this 
27:718:61768:24:25:72:293:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction term, the greater the agency costs. 
27:719:61816:25:24:108:216:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:[Insert table VII here] 
27:720:61840:24:24:108:538:201:144:Times:144:Times:A:As shown in table VII, the results are supportive of both hypotheses.  Consistent with the 
27:721:61931:24:24:72:529:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:first hypothesis, we find that the interaction of a firm’s dividend-to-asset ratio in 2002 with the 
27:722:62031:24:24:72:526:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual investors’ share of ownership is positive and significant.  It indicates that for a firm 
27:723:62131:24:24:72:492:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:with a dividend yield of 2%, a one-standard-deviation increase in individual ownership 
27:724:62218:24:24:72:534:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponds to a 1.0 percentage point higher stock return during the eight tax-cut events.  These 
27:725:62316:24:0:71:525:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:results are consistent with Perez-Gonzalez (2003) who finds that dividend valuation increased 
28:726:62412:0:24:72:481:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:when dividends were less tax disadvantaged, but only for firms with large individual 
28:727:62497:24:24:72:145:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:shareholders.   
28:728:62513:24:24:108:535:660:144:Times:144:Times:A:We also find evidence supportive of our second hypothesis.  Specifically, the coefficient 
28:729:62603:24:24:72:542:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the interaction of executive stock ownership with the individual ownership share is significant 
28:730:62702:24:24:72:511:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:and negative.  We find that for firms primarily owned by institutions, the executives’ stock 
28:731:62795:24:24:72:522:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:holdings do not influence how the market reacted to the tax cut (i.e., the executive ownership 
28:732:62890:24:25:72:513:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient is small in magnitude and insignificant).  However, firms with higher individual 
28:733:62983:25:24:72:540:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and high executive ownership actually declined in value.  Specifically, for a firm with 
28:734:63081:24:24:72:502:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the average level of individual ownership, a one-standard-deviation increase in executive 
28:735:63171:24:24:72:527:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership leads to a 1.7 percentage point lower return.30  This is consistent with the view that 
28:736:63268:24:24:72:526:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:the markets anticipated the potential agency conflicts between executives and other individual 
28:737:63363:24:24:72:535:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:shareholders.  Further, this negative price reaction is suggestive that, at least for some firms, the 
28:738:63465:24:25:72:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation contract in place for top executives may not lead to optimal payout policy 
28:739:63553:25:24:72:539:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions from the shareholders’ perspective under a lower dividend-tax regime.  The right panel 
28:740:63650:24:24:72:537:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:of table VII repeats these specifications using returns in excess of Fama-French benchmarks and 
28:741:63746:24:24:72:222:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:the results are nearly identical. 
28:742:63780:24:24:108:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:These results are suggestive of potential agency problems within some firms.  Ex post, 
28:743:63867:24:24:72:529:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:we found that firms whose executives had large ownership shares were more apt to increase or 
28:744:63960:24:24:72:539:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:initiate dividends, often by at least partial substitution with share repurchases.  Even after the tax 
28:745:64063:24:25:72:513:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:cut, retained earnings and share repurchases, which distribute capital gains, are likely taxed 
28:746:64158:25:24:72:527:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:somewhat less heavily than dividends since the gains are taxed on a realization basis.  Thus, at 
28:747:64255:24:24:72:519:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:least in part, the market seems to have capitalized the likely payout-policy response by firms 
28:748:64350:24:42:72:395:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:based on the incentives provided by executives’ share ownership.   
28:749:64417:42:30:72:230:135:144:Times:144:Times:B:V.  Summary and Conclusions 
28:750:64444:30:24:108:502:105:144:Times:144:Times:A:The 2003 tax cut provides a unique laboratory to test how a large reduction in the 
28:751:64527:24:0:71:526:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual dividend tax rate influences corporate payout policy.  We provide evidence that top 
29:752:64624:0:24:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:executive holdings of company stock significantly influence a firm’s choice of payouts.  We find 
29:753:64721:24:24:72:505:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:that top executive holdings of company stock have a substantial impact on whether a firm 
29:754:64810:24:24:72:538:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased or initiated dividends in response to the reduction in the tax-cost of paying dividends.   
29:755:64911:24:24:108:534:636:144:Times:144:Times:A:Unlike past studies in this area that identify results from cross-sectional correlations, the 
29:756:65005:24:24:72:506:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:unexpected and exogenous change in the after-tax value of dividends allows us to directly 
29:757:65095:24:24:72:537:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:address the usual criticism that a cross-sectional relation between executive holdings and payout 
29:758:65193:24:25:72:531:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy may simply reflect unobservable characteristics, such as managerial quality or corporate 
29:759:65289:25:24:71:419:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:governance, that generate both option compensation and low dividends. 
29:760:65359:24:24:108:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:We find that in 2003, especially in the months following the passage of the May tax cut, a 
29:761:65450:24:24:72:536:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm was much more likely to increase dividends if the executives owned a larger fraction of the 
29:762:65547:24:24:72:494:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:outstanding shares.  This correlation between executive ownership and payout policy is 
29:763:65634:24:24:72:531:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly different in 2003 than in prior years.  In contrast, while other factors, such as cash 
29:764:65735:24:25:72:497:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:flow, leverage, past firm performance, executive stock option holdings, and institutional 
29:765:65825:25:24:72:517:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership are important determinants of dividend policy in general, their effect on dividend 
29:766:65918:24:24:72:516:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy did not change in 2003.  Because only the effect of executive stock holdings changed 
29:767:66010:24:24:72:525:346:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly with the change in tax regime, we interpret this as strong evidence of a tax effect 
29:768:66108:24:24:72:183:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:upon payout policy.     
29:769:66132:24:24:108:516:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our work also indicates that, at least for dividend initiations, taxes are a factor in the 
29:770:66223:24:24:71:527:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:choice of dividends versus share repurchases and that when tax rates are more closely aligned, 
29:771:66318:24:25:71:533:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms exhibit some substitutability between the two.  We also provide evidence that the markets 
29:772:66414:25:24:71:534:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:may have at least partially anticipated these effects, leading to differential stock price responses 
29:773:66515:24:24:71:337:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:to key events leading up to the passage of the tax cut.   
29:774:66573:24:24:108:533:177:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper raises a particularly interesting avenue for future research.  The main finding 
29:775:66664:24:24:72:523:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:of this paper is that personal financial incentives for executives clearly matter for firm payout 
29:776:66762:24:24:72:529:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior.  This finding is consistent with a standard agency theory perspective that, rather than 
29:777:66860:24:24:72:494:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:operating the firm solely in the best interests of shareholders who may still prefer share 
29:778:66951:24:0:72:522:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:repurchases or earnings retention to dividends even after the tax cut, managers are inclined to 
30:779:67049:0:24:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:also incorporate their own financial incentives in corporate decisions.  The results in this paper, 
30:780:67149:24:24:72:515:684:144:Times:144:Times:B:particularly those concerning the stock price reaction to the tax cut, suggest there may be an 
30:781:67244:24:24:72:534:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:agency problem between management and outside shareholders that should be considered when 
30:782:67334:24:24:72:541:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:structuring management compensation contracts.  The relation between firm actions (e.g., payout 
30:783:67430:24:24:72:521:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy, capital structure, investment decisions, etc.) and the incentives provided by executive 
30:784:67526:24:24:72:538:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:holdings to undertake these actions, and whether the compensation package is structured a priori 
30:785:67623:24:25:72:515:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the firm to encourage these reactions by managers remains an interesting area for further 
30:786:67716:25:0:72:118:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:research.

34:894:74586:14:14:72:535:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:The table presents linear model (the left panel) and Probit model (the right panel) regressions of 
34:895:74685:14:14:72:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether a firm increases dividends in 2003 and in earlier years.  A dividend increase is defined 
34:896:74782:14:13:72:481:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:as a rise in ordinary dividends per share (adjusted for stock splits) based on dividend 
34:897:74870:13:14:72:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:announcements in CRSP.  The dependent variable is measured in percentage points, while the 
34:898:74961:14:14:72:523:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanatory variables are expressed as raw ratios (i.e., not in percentage points), unless stated 
34:899:75059:14:14:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:otherwise.  Thus, the dependent variable in this table takes on values of either 0 (did not increase 
34:900:75160:14:14:72:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:dividends) or 100 (did increase dividends).  The likelihood of a dividend increase is related to the 
34:901:75261:14:13:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:top five executive stock and options (both normalized by total firm shares outstanding) as well as

34:904:75549:14:14:72:517:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:to-assets (where debt is long-term debt), past five-year stock return, monthly stock volatility 
34:905:75645:14:14:72:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:(based on the past 24 months), log of market value, firm age indicator variables (1-5, 6-10, 11-
34:906:75741:14:13:72:534:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:15, 16-20, and 21 or more years), and industry indicator variables.  The top five executive stock 
34:907:75839:13:14:72:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:and option variables are obtained from Execucomp, the firm financial characteristics are 
34:908:75928:14:14:72:523:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:obtained from Compustat, and the past five-year stock return and monthly stock volatility are 
34:909:76022:14:14:72:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:obtained from CRSP.  The table presents regressions of whether a firm increases dividends in the 
34:910:76119:14:14:72:517:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:2003 (leftmost column of each panel), the 1993-2002 period pooled (middle column of each 
34:911:76208:14:13:72:535:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:panel), and the difference between the coefficients over the two time periods (rightmost column 
34:912:76304:13:14:72:538:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:of each panel).  Specifically, a regression is estimated across the pooled sample 1993-2003, with 
34:913:76402:14:14:72:518:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:an indicator variable for 2003 interacted with all the explanatory variables (interaction terms 
34:914:76498:14:14:72:539:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in far right column) to test whether the effect of a variable on the likelihood of a dividend 
34:915:76598:14:14:72:510:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase is different in 2003 relative to earlier years (i.e., the period 1993-2002).  Marginal 
34:916:76694:14:13:72:523:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects evaluated at the sample mean are presented for the Probit model.  The standard errors, 
34:917:76789:13:14:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:given in parentheses, account for heteroskedasticity (i.e., robust standard errors), and, in the 
34:918:76886:14:14:72:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:pooled regressions, correlation across observations of the same firm over time (i.e., clustering on

41:1311:91983:7:27:72:535:701:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 While Julio and Ikenberry (2005) have argued that the up-tick in dividend activity started before the 2003 tax cut, 
41:1312:92101:27:23:72:542:674:100:Times:100:Times:F:Chetty and Saez (2005) subsequently showed that this result was due to issues with sample construction, and that the 
41:1313:92218:23:19:72:374:651:100:Times:100:Times:F:tax cut was indeed responsible for an increase in dividend activity in 2003. 
41:1314:92295:19:27:72:532:632:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 The 2003 tax change also reduced the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income from 38.6% to 35%, and reduced 
41:1315:92406:27:23:72:536:605:100:Times:100:Times:F:the statutory long-term capital gains tax rate from 20% to 15%.  Repurchases still are tax-preferred because, though 
41:1316:92523:23:23:72:536:582:100:Times:100:Times:F:subject to the same rate as dividends, the tax is deferred until the capital gains are realized at the time the shares are 
41:1317:92646:23:23:72:529:559:100:Times:100:Times:F:sold (and may go untaxed through basis step-up at death).  However, this preference shrunk substantially with the 
41:1318:92760:23:19:72:155:536:100:Times:100:Times:F:dividend tax cut.      
41:1319:92782:19:27:72:537:517:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 While executives are not allowed to short their own company stock, Bettis, Bizjak, and Lemmon (2001) show that 
41:1320:92895:27:23:72:526:490:100:Times:100:Times:F:some executives hedge the idiosyncratic risk of their portfolios through collars and equity swaps.  Managers also 
41:1321:93009:23:23:72:522:467:100:Times:100:Times:F:could pre-commit to a regular pattern of stock sales to try to avoid sending a negative signal to the market when 
41:1322:93123:23:23:72:525:444:100:Times:100:Times:F:their stock is sold.  To the extent any of these diversification strategies occur will make it more difficult to find a 
41:1323:93243:23:19:72:426:421:100:Times:100:Times:F:relation between executive ownership and the likelihood of a dividend increase in 2003. 
41:1324:93331:19:27:72:531:402:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 The Nam, Wang and Zhang (2004) is much more limited in scope, in that it examines only S&P 1500 firms with 
41:1325:93440:27:19:72:486:375:100:Times:100:Times:F:ongoing dividend programs and thus misses the important effects of the tax cut on dividend initiations. 
41:1326:93544:19:27:72:526:356:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 Auerbach and Hassett (2005) and Amromin, Harrison, and Sharpe (2005) find that high dividend-paying stocks 
41:1327:93653:27:23:72:518:329:100:Times:100:Times:F:earned excess returns of a few percentage points around the period of the tax cut.  Neither of these two studies, 
41:1328:93767:23:19:72:319:306:100:Times:100:Times:F:however, examined the firm-level variation in excess returns. 
41:1329:93829:19:27:72:528:287:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 In the regressions, the samples contain about 1,350 firms each year because roughly 350 firms are dropped each 
41:1330:93942:27:19:71:311:260:100:Times:100:Times:F:year due to missing values for some explanatory variables.  
41:1331:94002:19:27:72:532:241:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 We do not examine the previous dividend tax rate cut in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 for three reasons.  First, we 
41:1332:94117:27:23:71:532:214:100:Times:100:Times:F:lack the extensive data on the stock ownership of top executives during this time period.  Second, this act included 
41:1333:94234:23:23:71:538:191:100:Times:100:Times:F:numerous other changes in the relative tax treatment of corporate and individual income that would make it difficult 
41:1334:94351:23:23:71:521:168:100:Times:100:Times:F:to isolate the effect of the dividend tax cut.  Third, the 1986 Act was the outcome of a much longer political and 
41:1335:94466:23:19:71:463:145:100:Times:100:Times:F:legislative process, making it less plausible that the 1986 tax cut was a surprise to the market.       
41:1336:94570:19:27:72:526:126:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 Auerbach and Hassett (2005) provide a very careful chronology of the events leading to the tax cut and confirm 
41:1337:94683:27:0:72:456:99:100:Times:100:Times:F:that there was very little, if any, information released prior to the announcement of the tax cut.

42:1340:94942:7:27:72:529:701:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 Unless stated otherwise, when referring to dividend increases we include both initiations as well as increases for 
42:1341:95059:27:23:72:501:674:100:Times:100:Times:F:prior dividend payers.  In table III we will analyze initiations as well as increases for prior dividend payers 
42:1342:95171:23:19:72:118:651:100:Times:100:Times:F:separately. 
42:1343:95183:19:27:72:500:632:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Industry groups are as follows: mining, oil and gas, construction, food, basic materials, biotech/medical, 
42:1344:95293:27:19:71:490:605:100:Times:100:Times:F:manufacturing, transportation, telecom, utilities, retail/wholesale trade, financial, technology, and other. 
42:1345:95402:19:27:72:532:586:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 Throughout the tables, our dependent variable is measured in percentage points, while our explanatory variables 
42:1346:95517:27:19:71:305:559:100:Times:100:Times:F:are expressed as raw ratios (i.e., not in percentage points). 
42:1347:95579:19:27:72:515:540:42:Times:100:Times:F:12 The first year we can relate a change in dividend payouts to executive holdings at the prior year-end is 1993 
42:1348:95692:27:19:71:256:513:100:Times:100:Times:F:because the Execomp database starts in 1992. 
42:1349:95737:19:27:72:534:494:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 Note that, unlike the linear probability model, the marginal effects of 1993 to 2002 and 2003 separately need not 
42:1350:95854:27:23:71:507:467:100:Times:100:Times:F:add up to the marginal effect over the entire period 1993 to 2003.  This is because in a non-linear model, the 
42:1351:95965:23:19:71:528:444:100:Times:100:Times:F:marginal effects are evaluated at the sample means, which themselves differ slightly in the different time periods. 
42:1352:96081:19:27:72:542:425:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 The negative relation with cash on hand likely reflects that firms with greater needs to hold cash balances, because 
42:1353:96201:27:23:71:536:398:100:Times:100:Times:F:of higher transaction costs or precautionary demands (Boyle and Guthrie (2003), Almeida, Campello and Weisbach 
42:1354:96312:23:23:71:532:375:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2004)) are less likely to commit to paying or increasing dividends.  In addition, firms with greater debt ratios, and 
42:1355:96431:23:23:71:535:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:likely higher claims from interest expense on their earnings, are less likely to pay dividends as well.  Leverage may 
42:1356:96549:23:19:71:396:329:100:Times:100:Times:F:also substitute for dividends as a way to reduce agency problems (Jensen, 1986). 
42:1357:96630:19:27:72:527:310:42:Times:100:Times:F:15 As with the results of Table 2, the magnitude of the marginal effect of executive share ownership from a Probit 
42:1358:96745:27:19:71:327:283:100:Times:100:Times:F:model is nearly identical to that of the linear probability model. 
42:1359:96812:19:23:72:360:264:42:Times:100:Times:F:16 These coefficient estimates are available from the authors by request. 
42:1360:96886:23:27:72:538:241:42:Times:100:Times:F:17 While 53.5% of prior dividend payers increased ordinary dividends per share in 2003, only 13.8% increased them 
42:1361:97000:27:23:71:533:214:100:Times:100:Times:F:by more than 25% over their prior level.  For comparison, in 2002, while 43.3% of prior dividend payers increased 
42:1362:97114:23:23:71:525:191:100:Times:100:Times:F:dividends, only 5.5% increased them by more than 25% over their prior level.  Thus, most of the rise in dividend 
42:1363:97227:23:19:71:506:168:100:Times:100:Times:F:increases among dividend payers following the tax cut seems to be concentrated among the larger increases. 
42:1364:97334:19:27:72:538:149:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 While not all stocks held by individuals are in taxable accounts (e.g., some stocks are owned through tax deferred 
42:1365:97452:27:23:71:537:122:100:Times:100:Times:F:accounts such as IRAs), the fraction of direct stock ownership held in taxable accounts is higher than the fraction of 
42:1366:97571:23:0:71:250:99:100:Times:100:Times:F:mutual fund assets held in taxable accounts. 
43:1367:97618:0:36:72:75:744:144:Times:144:Times:B:

43:1369:97774:7:27:72:515:701:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 In contrast to the results from Table II where the omitted group was total non-executive ownership, here the 
43:1370:97886:27:23:71:535:674:100:Times:100:Times:F:omitted group is mutual funds.  As such, the coefficient on executive ownership during the pre tax cut period (1993 
43:1371:98002:23:23:71:537:651:100:Times:100:Times:F:to 2002) changes from 6.3 to 50.8.  What matters for our hypothesis, however, is that the difference in the executive 
43:1372:98120:23:19:71:438:628:100:Times:100:Times:F:ownership coefficient for 2003 versus earlier years is nearly identical in each specification. 
43:1373:98215:19:27:72:532:609:42:Times:100:Times:F:20 This ongoing demand for dividends by individuals is consistent with Shefrin and Statman (1984) who argue that 
43:1374:98328:27:23:71:547:582:100:Times:100:Times:F:individuals may prefer dividends despite their tax disadvantage because it helps them to solve a self-control problem.  
43:1375:98448:23:23:71:539:559:100:Times:100:Times:F:That is, by committing to consume only out of dividends, investors avoid deciding how many shares to sell and how 
43:1376:98562:23:19:71:374:536:100:Times:100:Times:F:much to consume, and thus commit themselves not to consume too much.   
43:1377:98633:19:27:72:535:517:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 Because total options outstanding, and hence the difference between total and top executive option holdings, had 
43:1378:98749:27:23:71:520:490:100:Times:100:Times:F:to be collected by hand, we collected these data for year-end 2001 and 2002, and related non-executive options, 
43:1379:98861:23:23:71:537:467:100:Times:100:Times:F:along with other variables, to dividend changes in the next year.  Thus, our comparison of 2003 with earlier years is 
43:1380:98979:23:23:71:531:444:100:Times:100:Times:F:limited to a comparison of 2003 with 2002 when this variable is included in the regression.  The coefficient on the 
43:1381:99095:23:23:71:537:421:100:Times:100:Times:F:variable non-executive options-to-total firm shares outstanding is significantly negative in both years (-36.4 in 2002 
43:1382:99214:23:19:71:390:398:100:Times:100:Times:F:and -50.7 in 2003), with the difference in coefficients statistically insignificant. 
43:1383:99299:19:27:72:520:379:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 In the interest of space, we do not report the coefficients from all the specification checks.  These results, and 
43:1384:99417:27:19:72:280:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:others, are available from the authors upon request. 
43:1385:99470:19:23:72:403:333:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 This large special dividend by Microsoft does not fall within our sample period. 
43:1386:99554:23:27:72:541:310:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 We also estimated a specification using another possible definition of a “dividend increase,” namely an increase in 
43:1387:99673:27:23:71:514:283:100:Times:100:Times:F:the amount of dividends paid relative to firm size (e.g., an increase in the dividends-to-assets ratio), and found 
43:1388:99788:23:23:71:537:260:100:Times:100:Times:F:similar results.  For example, the coefficient on executive share ownership is 44.8 in 2003, with a difference of 42.4 
43:1389:99907:23:19:72:383:237:100:Times:100:Times:F:between the 2003 coefficient and that from the pre-tax cut period 1993-2002. 
43:1390:99984:19:27:72:518:218:42:Times:100:Times:F:25 We report results for the Execucomp sample (roughly the S&P 1500).  An analysis of all firms in Compsutat 
43:1391:100093:27:19:71:211:191:100:Times:100:Times:F:yields qualitatively similar results. 
43:1392:100131:19:27:72:529:172:42:Times:100:Times:F:26 It is possible that an increase in dividends per share need not increase the dividends-to-assets ratio, and thus not 
43:1393:100251:27:23:71:520:145:100:Times:100:Times:F:increase total payouts.  To address this possibility, we also redefined a “dividend increase” as an increase in the 
43:1394:100367:23:23:71:541:122:100:Times:100:Times:F:amount of dividends paid relative to firm size (i.e., an increase in the dividends-to-assets ratio).  With this alternative 
43:1395:100491:23:23:71:527:99:100:Times:100:Times:F:definition, we find the following patterns in payout policy for those firms that boosted dividends-to-assets: (i) the 
43:1396:100609:23:0:71:522:76:100:Times:100:Times:F:fraction of dividend increasers in 2003 that had previously repurchased shares (62%) was identical to that of the 
44:1397:100725:0:36:72:75:744:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
44:1398:100725:36:11:539:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                                                                                                                             
44:1399:100881:11:23:72:526:697:100:Times:100:Times:F:prior decade; (ii) among those that had repurchased shares in 2002, 65% reduced repurchases in 2003 while only 
44:1400:100992:23:23:72:501:674:100:Times:100:Times:F:53% did in the prior decade, a statistically significant difference; (iii) the net result is that 66% of dividend 
44:1401:101106:23:23:72:523:651:100:Times:100:Times:F:increasers actually increased total payouts in 2003, significantly less than the 73% over the prior pre-tax period.  
44:1402:101223:23:19:72:434:628:100:Times:100:Times:F:Note that for dividend initiations, the two measures of a “dividend increase” are identical. 
44:1403:101316:19:27:72:538:609:42:Times:100:Times:F:27 We also compared share repurchases and payouts during the year a firm increased dividends to the firm’s average 
44:1404:101431:27:23:71:524:582:100:Times:100:Times:F:level of dividends and share repurchases over the past three years (as opposed to just the prior year).  The results 
44:1405:101548:23:23:71:526:559:100:Times:100:Times:F:regarding dividend substitution are very similar.  For example, only 58% of dividend-initiators in 2003 increased 
44:1406:101662:23:23:71:541:536:100:Times:100:Times:F:total payouts above their average payout-to-assets ratio over the past three years (79% of dividend-initiators over the 
44:1407:101782:23:19:71:390:513:100:Times:100:Times:F:period 1993 to 2002 increased payouts relative to the prior three-year average). 
44:1408:101863:19:27:72:515:494:42:Times:100:Times:F:28 Some examples include the effect of the 1986 tax reform act (Cutler (1988)), financial services deregulation 
44:1409:101975:27:23:71:530:467:100:Times:100:Times:F:(James, 1983; Cornett and Tehranian, 1990), regulation of the market for corporate takeovers (Schumann (1988)), 
44:1410:102087:23:19:71:463:444:100:Times:100:Times:F:and the passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (Brown, Cummins, Lewis, and Wei (2004)). 
44:1411:102180:19:27:72:542:425:42:Times:100:Times:F:29 By using all eight event windows, we are taking the conservative approach in that we are biasing ourselves against 
44:1412:102298:27:23:71:530:398:100:Times:100:Times:F:finding a significant effect.  This is because a few of the 8 events have been shown by Auerbach and Hassett to be 
44:1413:102413:23:23:71:540:375:100:Times:100:Times:F:less informative to the market than the others.  By restricting ourselves to the more salient news days, our results are 
44:1414:102534:23:19:71:196:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:even more highly significant.   
44:1415:102566:19:27:72:523:333:42:Times:100:Times:F:30 However, the interaction of the individual ownership share with the amount of executive stock options had no 
44:1416:102678:27:23:71:530:306:100:Times:100:Times:F:effect on the market reaction to the tax cut (recall that the effect of dividends on stock option value did not change 
44:1417:102797:23:23:71:532:283:100:Times:100:Times:F:with the tax cut, thus whether the executives had a lot of stock options would not lead to a change in payout policy 
44:1418:102914:23:0:71:474:260:100:Times:100:Times:F:after the tax cut relative to earlier years, as confirmed in our earlier dividend policy regressions).
