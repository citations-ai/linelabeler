2:14:485:52:19:275:319:501:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:Abstract
2:15:493:19:12:127:483:482:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:We consider the optimal trade execution strategies for a large portfolio of single
2:16:575:12:12:112:483:470:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:stocks proposed by Almgren (2003). This framework accounts for a nonlinear impact
2:17:656:12:12:112:483:458:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of trades on average market prices. The results of Almgren (2003) are based on the
2:18:738:12:11:112:483:446:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:assumption that no shares of assets per unit of time are trade at the beginning of
2:19:820:11:12:112:483:435:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the period. We propose a general solution method that accomodates the case of a
2:20:899:12:12:112:483:423:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:positive stock of assets in the initial period. Our findings are twofold. First of all,
2:21:986:12:12:112:483:411:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:we show that the problem admits a solution with no trading in the opening period
2:22:1066:12:12:112:483:399:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:only if additional parametric restrictions are imposed.  Second, with positive asset
2:23:1150:12:12:112:483:387:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:holdings in the initial period, the optimal execution time depends on trading activity
2:24:1236:12:24:112:287:375:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:at the beginning of the planning period.

3:32:1832:0:27:85:195:673:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:C:1  Introduction
3:33:1847:27:17:85:510:646:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:The execution of large trades in financial markets requires the balance between risks and
3:34:1936:17:16:85:510:629:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:costs. The main risk concerns the lack of availability of a counterparty, which can lead to
3:35:2027:16:17:85:510:613:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:a delay in the execution of a transaction. In order to guarantee a fast trade execution, a
3:36:2117:17:16:85:510:596:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:trader may incur additional costs. As clarified by Hasbruock and Schwartz (1988), a trader
3:37:2207:16:17:85:408:580:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:faces a choice between a ‘passive’ and an ‘actice’ execution strategy.
3:38:2277:17:16:101:509:563:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Given this background, the available models of optimal execution assume that the
3:39:2357:16:16:85:510:547:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:trading activity of individual investors has an impact on the average price prevailing in the
3:40:2450:16:17:85:510:531:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:market. The transaction costs are characterized by parametric forms that replicate stylized
3:41:2541:17:16:85:510:514:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:facts documented in the market microstructure literature (e.g. see Kraus and Stoll, 1972).
3:42:2631:16:17:101:509:498:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Almgren and Chriss (1999, 2000) and Konishi and Makimoto (2001) provide examples
3:43:2711:17:16:85:510:481:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:of optimal strategies for the execution problem in the stock market. Their models assume
3:44:2799:16:17:85:510:465:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:that the transaction cost per share is a linear function of the number of shares of assets
3:45:2889:17:16:85:475:448:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:traded. The only source of uncertianty consists in the volatility of the stock price.
3:46:2974:16:17:101:509:432:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Almgren (2003) suggests that the linearity assumption is largely at odds with reality.
3:47:3060:17:16:85:510:415:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:First, the average liquidity premium on stocks tends to be either a convex or a concave
3:48:3147:16:16:85:510:399:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:function of the traded size.  This depends on the counterparty’s perception about the
3:49:3232:16:17:85:510:383:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:reason for the trade, namely on whether it is driven by liquidity or information needs (see
3:50:3323:17:16:85:510:366:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Huang and Stoll, 1997). Moreover, the liquidity premium is related to the risk of finding
3:51:3412:16:17:85:510:350:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:a counterparty. In other words, the lower the probability of finding a counterparty in the
3:52:3502:17:16:85:284:333:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:market, the higher the liquidity premium.
3:53:3543:16:17:101:509:317:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:In this paper, we review the optimal transaction strategy proposed by Almgren (2003).
3:54:3628:17:16:85:510:300:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:We show that the solution method used by Almgren (2003) is ill-posed. The reason is
3:55:3711:16:16:85:510:284:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:that it is based on the assumption that no shares per unit of time are exchanged at the
3:56:3798:16:17:85:510:268:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:beginning of the period. We use an approach based on the Gauss hypergeometric function
3:57:3884:17:16:85:510:251:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:to solve for the case of positive initial trades. Our results differ strongly from those of
3:58:3975:16:17:85:510:235:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Almgren (2003). First of all, the problem admits a solution with no trading in the opening
3:59:4065:17:16:85:510:218:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:period only if additional parametric restrictions are imposed. Second, with positive initial
3:60:4157:16:17:85:488:202:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:trading, the optimal execution time depends on trading activity in the initial period.
3:61:4243:17:16:101:509:185:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:This note is organized as follows.  Section 2 provides a selected discussion of the
3:62:4326:16:16:85:510:169:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:literature on optimal trade execution.  Section 3 outlines the structure of the problem.
3:63:4414:16:17:85:510:153:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Section 4 proposes a general solution method for positive initial values of the velocity.
3:64:4503:17:16:85:510:136:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Section 5 concludes. Finally, in Appendix A, we discuss the general method for the solution
3:65:4594:16:0:85:448:120:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:of second order differential equations with a Gauss hypergeometric function.
4:66:4671:0:27:85:361:673:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:C:2  A selected overview of the literature
4:67:4711:27:17:85:510:646:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Rebalancing portfolios of assets requires executing trades in the marketplace. With the
4:68:4798:17:16:85:510:629:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:advent of algorithmic trading and access availability to many alternative trading venues,
4:69:4887:16:17:85:510:613:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:investors have dedicated increasing resources to the scheduling of trades. The practical
4:70:4975:17:16:85:510:596:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:setup of the problem is rather intuitive. An investor has a target number of, say shares
4:71:5063:16:17:85:510:580:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:that it intends to sell or buy within a given time frame. The decision problem requires to
4:72:5153:17:16:85:510:563:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:compute how many shares to place or demand in the market at each point in time within
4:73:5238:16:16:85:510:547:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:the trade horizon. The aim of the investor is to minimize the execution costs. These are
4:74:5326:16:17:85:510:531:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:typically measured as the difference between the price obtained from the market and a
4:75:5411:17:16:85:259:514:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:benchmark price for the transaction.
4:76:5447:16:17:101:509:498:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:There are multiple relevant dimensions to the execution problem. Several contributions
4:77:5533:17:16:85:510:481:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:have showed that the liquidity premium is time-varying. The reason is that it is determined
4:78:5624:16:17:85:510:465:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:by the availability of traders willing to act as counterparties, namely traders willing to buy
4:79:5718:17:16:85:510:448:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:or sell a given quantity of an asset at a desired price. However, as the presence of traders
4:80:5810:16:17:85:510:432:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:willing to ‘take the other side’ of a trade is uncertain, any trading is characterized by
4:81:5899:17:16:85:154:415:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:execution risk.
4:82:5914:16:16:101:509:399:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Another relevant aspect is related to the fact that market illiquidity generates
4:83:5994:16:17:85:510:383:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:transaction costs. This typically takes the form of a large spread between bid and ask
4:84:6080:17:16:85:510:366:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:prices (Huang and Stoll, 1997). Therefore, as noticed by Wagner and Banks (1992), the
4:85:6165:16:17:85:510:350:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:minization of transaction costs is a key aspect of the portfolio optimization problem. As
4:86:6254:17:16:85:510:333:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:documented in various studies including Chakravarty (2001), Holthausen, Leftwich and
4:87:6338:16:17:85:510:317:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Mayers (1990) and Kraus and Stoll (1972), large trades do impact market prices and, thus
4:88:6426:17:16:85:223:300:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:affecting the bid-ask spreads.
4:89:6456:16:16:101:509:284:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Asset price volatility is a source for execution risk. The reason is that it affects the
4:90:6544:16:17:85:510:268:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:probability of finding a suitable counterparty. Hence, it affects the sucessfulness of a trading
4:91:6640:17:16:85:510:251:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:strategy execution. The recent literature has focused on the specific aspect of volatility,
4:92:6731:16:17:85:510:235:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:namely the increased uncertainty in execution price incurred by rapid execution of large
4:93:6819:17:16:85:510:218:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:share blocks. In fact, Hasbruock and Seppi (2001) show that liquidity fluctuates due to
4:94:6906:16:17:85:396:202:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:intrinsic variations in market activity independently of trade size.
4:95:6974:17:16:101:509:185:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Based on the considerations outlined earlier, what are the properties of an ‘optimal’
4:96:7059:16:16:85:510:169:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:execution strategy? What defines an ‘optimal execution price’? Bertsimas and Lo (1998)
4:97:7145:16:17:85:510:153:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:argue that ‘best’ execution can be thought of as a dynamic strategy that minimizes
4:98:7227:17:16:85:510:136:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:‘liquidation’ costs. They show that dynamic programming techniques can be used fruitfully
4:99:7316:16:17:85:234:120:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:to characterize these strategies.
4:100:7349:17:16:101:509:103:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Almgren and Chriss (2000) compute optimal trajectories for trading prices that are
4:101:7431:16:17:85:510:87:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:obtained by balancing market impact costs. The optimal profiles provide a motivation for
4:102:7519:17:16:85:510:70:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:low execution speed.1This results arises from the balance between the need to reduce
4:103:7603:16:0:97:510:54:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f12:F:1The literature has proposed two main alternative bechmarks. These consist of average prices that
5:104:7701:0:17:85:510:673:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:the expected value of execution, and the need to minimize the adverse effects of market
5:105:7788:17:16:85:510:656:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:volatility. While the first factor provides a reason for slower execution, the second factor
5:106:7880:16:16:85:510:640:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:lays the ground for rapid execution.  That would, in fact, reduce execution risk in the
5:107:7967:16:17:85:510:624:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:form of the variance of execution cost with respect to the benchmark price. In short, early
5:108:8058:17:16:85:510:607:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:execution reduces execution risk, whereas a delayed execution is more geared towards
5:109:8142:16:17:85:510:591:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:minimizing execution costs. Evidently the degree of investor risk aversion determines how
5:110:8231:17:16:85:510:574:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:early within the trading horizon the execution starts. The shape of the schedule instead
5:111:8319:16:17:85:365:558:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:depends on the form of the assumed market impact model.
5:112:8374:17:16:101:509:541:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:Konishi and Makimoto (2001) makes the assumption that the market impact of trading
5:113:8456:16:17:85:510:525:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:is a linear function of trade size.  In this case, the optimality frontier representing
5:114:8543:17:16:85:510:508:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:the combinations of minimized costs and market volatility has an analytical solution.
5:115:8628:16:16:85:510:492:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Value-at-risk utility funcations are then used to select the first-best solution. This choice
5:116:8721:16:17:85:510:476:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:of utility function provides a natural testing ground for the concept of liquidity-adjusted
5:117:8812:17:16:85:510:459:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:VaR, which explicity considers the best trade-off between volatility risk and liquidation
5:118:8901:16:17:85:510:443:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:cost. Almgren (2003) generalizes the results of Konishi and Makimoto (2001) to the case
5:119:8988:17:16:85:510:426:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:of nonlinear functions for the market impact of trades. In this framework, the assumption
5:120:9077:16:38:85:510:410:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:is that the market impact cost per share follows a power law function of the trading rate.
5:121:9167:38:28:85:326:372:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:C:3  The optimal execution problem
5:122:9199:28:16:85:510:344:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:We follow the general framework of Almgren and Chriss (2000). At timet= 0, an investor
5:123:9285:16:16:85:509:328:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:holdsXshares of an asset. The problem is to sell these shares by by timet=T. We
5:124:9364:16:17:85:509:312:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f18:B:should stress that this is the statement of a general framework. In fact, the initial sizeX
5:125:9455:17:16:85:510:295:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:can either be positive or negative. In the first case, the investor needs to schedule a selling
5:126:9550:16:17:85:510:279:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:program. In the second case, the investor looks at a buying program. In this paper, for
5:127:9637:17:16:85:269:262:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:simplicity, we focus on the caseX >0.
5:128:9674:16:17:101:509:246:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:The execution problem consists in minizing the market impact of trades subject to both
5:129:9760:17:16:85:510:229:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:initial and terminal conditions. In mathematical terms, the model proposed by Almgren

12:559:16514:0:27:85:184:673:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:C:5  Conclusion
12:560:16527:27:17:85:510:646:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:Rebalancing large portfolios of stocks requires taking into account two peculiar issues. The
12:561:16619:17:16:85:510:629:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:first one is related to the market impact of trades, which generates transaction costs. The
12:562:16710:16:17:85:510:613:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:second issue arises from the risk of finding counterparties willing to trade at the desired
12:563:16801:17:16:85:510:596:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:price. Both empirical and theoretical considerations suggest that the market impact of
12:564:16887:16:17:85:510:580:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:trades is typically nonlinear.  Almgren (2003) proposes an optimal execution strategy
12:565:16972:17:16:85:510:563:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:that minimizes the tradeoff between volatility risk and transaction costs while taking into
12:566:17063:16:16:85:243:547:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:account this form of nonlinearity.
12:567:17097:16:17:101:509:531:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:A:In this paper, we review the optimal liquidation strategy of Almgren (2003). We show
12:568:17181:17:16:85:510:514:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:that the solution method used by Almgren (2003) is ill-posed. The reason is that it is
12:569:17267:16:17:85:510:498:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:based on the assumption that no shares per unit of time are traded at the beginning of the
12:570:17357:17:16:85:510:481:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:period. We use an approach based on the Gaussian hypergeometric function to solve for
12:571:17442:16:17:85:510:465:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:the case of positive initial trades. Our results differ strongly from those of Almgren (2003).
12:572:17536:17:16:85:510:448:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:First of all, the problem admits a solution with no trading in the opening period only if
12:573:17625:16:17:85:510:432:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:additional parametric restrictions are imposed. Second, with positive initial trading, the
12:574:17715:17:0:85:428:415:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f15:B:optimal execution time depends on trading activity in the initial period.
