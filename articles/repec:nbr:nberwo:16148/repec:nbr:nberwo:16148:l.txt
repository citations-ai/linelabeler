2:31:1598:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:This paper addresses three basic questions about an under-studied food subsidy program, the Child
2:32:1695:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP): (1) Does CACFP reach targeted low-income children? (2)
2:33:1786:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:How do eligible families and child care providers who participate differ from those who do not participate?
2:34:1893:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:(3) What is the association between attending CACFP-participating child care and children's food
2:35:1989:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:intake, weight, and food security?  We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort to
2:36:2087:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:examine these questions for a representative sample of young children and their providers.  We find
2:37:2186:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:that program eligibility rules leave many poor children outside the CACFP program.  Yet, among poor
2:38:2285:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:preschoolers in center-based care, participation in the program is correlated with positive outcomes
2:39:2385:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:such as increased consumption of milk and vegetables, and healthier weight (BMI).  We discuss the
2:40:2482:14:42:72:538:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:implications of our findings, especially in relation to other food and child care subsidy programs.

3:67:3221:0:28:108:509:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In 2008, nearly 15% of households were food insecure—had inconsistent access to 
3:68:3301:28:27:72:535:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enough food for active healthy lives—including 6% with very low food security—reduced food 
3:69:3392:27:28:72:506:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intake and disrupted eating patterns due to lack of food; these are the highest rates of food 
3:70:3486:28:28:72:526:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:insecurity recorded since the first national food security survey was conducted in 1995 (Nord, 
3:71:3581:28:27:72:508:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Andrews, and Carlson 2009: 8).  Rates of food insecurity were higher for households with 
3:72:3670:27:28:72:519:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children, single-parent households, minority households, and poor households.  Fully half of 
3:73:3763:28:27:71:520:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:low-income female-headed households with children were food insecure in 2008 (Nord et al. 
3:74:3853:27:28:71:538:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2009: 15).  The extent of food insecurity is worrisome because child hunger can adversely affect 
3:75:3950:28:28:71:544:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children’s health, and their cognitive and social development (Tanner and Finn-Stevenson 2002).  
3:76:4047:28:27:71:515:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Sustained child hunger can lead to short stature and low weight for height, which have been 
3:77:4139:27:28:71:540:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:linked to worse adult health and reduced economic well being even in the U.S. (Case and Paxson 
3:78:4234:28:27:71:172:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2008; Fogel 2004).   
3:79:4255:27:28:107:533:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To address inadequate child nutrition, more than a dozen federal programs provide food 
3:80:4342:28:28:71:532:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and nutrition to children and families (Fox, Hamilton, and Christenson 2004).  In FY 2008, $38 
3:81:4437:28:27:71:516:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion was spent on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food 
3:82:4525:27:28:71:503:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Stamps), which represents more than half of federal expenditures for nutrition programs.  
3:83:4615:28:27:71:516:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Expenditures on four other programs exceeded one billion dollars each: the National School 
3:84:4706:27:28:71:532:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Lunch Program ($9.3 billion), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants 
3:85:4798:28:28:71:504:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Children (WIC; $6.2 billion), the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP; $2.4 
3:86:4883:28:27:71:536:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion), and the School Breakfast Program ($2.4 billion; Oliveira, 2009).  All of these programs 
3:87:4981:27:28:71:539:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have been widely studied, except for the CACFP.  A review by Frederic Glantz (2004) identified 
3:88:5076:28:27:72:540:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only a handful of studies of the CACFP and concluded, “Some studies have assessed the nutrient 
3:89:5171:27:28:72:539:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of CACFP meals and snacks to participants’ overall diets.  However, there has been 
3:90:5267:28:0:72:532:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:no research on the impact of the program on participants’ nutrition and health status, relative to 
4:91:5413:0:28:72:520:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nonparticipants” (p. 236). In a comprehensive review of federal nutrition programs, Janet M. 
4:92:5506:28:27:72:541:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Currie (2006a) makes a similar point: “One of the most important [of the smaller food programs] 
4:93:5602:27:28:72:512:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which operates somewhat like the school meals 
4:94:5690:28:28:72:532:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:programs, but serves approximately 1.7 million low-income children in daycare centers.  There 
4:95:5784:28:27:72:523:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:has been little investigation of the benefits of participation in these programs, but the positive 
4:96:5883:27:28:72:531:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects of the school meal programs suggests that providing meals to younger children....makes 
4:97:5978:28:27:72:135:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sense.” (86). 
4:98:5992:27:28:108:518:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In this study, we begin to fill the gap in research about CACFP.  We use a nationally-
4:99:6078:28:28:72:501:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:representative sample of children and their childcare providers to examine three research 
4:100:6168:28:27:72:124:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:questions: 
4:101:6179:27:28:90:528:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:1. How well does the CACFP reach targeted low-income children who are most at risk of 
4:102:6264:28:27:108:205:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:nutritional deficits? 
4:103:6286:27:28:90:526:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:2. How do eligible families and child care providers who participate in the CACFP differ 
4:104:6374:28:28:108:279:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:from those who do not participate? 
4:105:6409:28:27:90:537:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:3. What is the association between attending CACFP-participating child care and children's 
4:106:6499:27:28:108:353:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:consumption of food, food insecurity, and weight? 
4:107:6549:28:27:72:539:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Our study makes two contributions.  First, we add to the limited evidence about whether CACFP 
4:108:6643:27:28:72:536:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reaches targeted children and what characteristics of providers and families affect participation.  
4:109:6743:28:28:72:504:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Previous research on CACFP has examined only participating homes (or those which had 
4:110:6828:28:27:72:522:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recently participated) and has not included a comparison group of non-participating homes or 
4:111:6921:27:28:72:542:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:centers.  The evidence on coverage we present should help policymakers and analysts understand 
4:112:7016:28:27:72:534:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who is and is not being served by CACFP.  Second, as far as we are aware, our study is the first 
4:113:7113:27:28:72:542:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to compare children attending CACFP participating child care to nonparticipants in terms of food 
4:114:7210:28:0:72:333:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intake, weight status and food insecurity of children.

5:123:7808:28:28:108:535:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Eligibility criteria are not very exclusionary; any child and most providers are eligible to 
5:124:7901:28:27:71:531:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participate in the program, although reimbursement rates are higher if certain eligibility criteria 
5:125:8001:27:28:71:519:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are met.  Four central criteria determine eligibility and benefit levels: type of care (center vs. 
5:126:8100:28:27:71:540:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:home, for-profit vs. non-profit, licensed vs. unlicensed), neighborhood income, provider income, 
5:127:8197:27:28:71:402:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and/or family income of children.  Figure 1 describes these criteria.1

5:130:8376:27:28:72:517:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:eligible to participate, but they receive higher (Tier I) or lower (Tier II) reimbursement rates 
5:131:8473:28:27:72:505:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:depending on some combination of their neighborhood income, their own income and the

5:138:9067:18:18:72:538:98:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:2 Federal guidelines allow states to extend eligibility to license-exempt homes, although a comprehensive

6:145:9808:27:28:71:529:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reimbursement need not serve poor children.3  Licensed homes that do not meet the criteria for 
6:146:9903:28:27:72:530:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Tier I reimbursement are eligible for Tier II (lower) reimbursement.  However, these providers 
6:147:9998:27:28:72:507:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:can still be reimbursed at Tier I rates for children in their care who have low incomes.  To

6:150:10281:27:28:71:522:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:categorically eligible.  Thus, all licensed family day care homes are eligible for some level of

6:156:10687:28:27:71:537:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reimbursement is either full (if the child’s family income is below 130% of poverty), reduced (if 
6:157:10785:27:28:72:538:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:family income is between 130% and 185% of poverty), or paid (if family income is above 185% 
6:158:10877:28:28:72:527:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of poverty).  Full rates were $1.23 for breakfast, $2.24 for lunch, and $0.61 for snacks in 2004-
6:159:10974:28:27:72:528:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2005.  Reduced rates were $0.93, $1.84 and $0.30, respectively.  Paid rates were $0.23, $0.21,

7:187:13505:18:18:72:522:127:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:4 As with license-exempt homes, states vary in which types of centers are not required to be licensed.  
7:188:13609:18:12:72:520:109:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:But, unlike license-exempt homes, which are typically small (3-4 children in care) and outside of any 
7:189:13711:12:13:72:529:97:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:regulatory scrutiny, states typically exempt from licensing centers and preschool programs overseen by

8:195:14234:27:28:72:539:594:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unlike other nutritional entitlement programs (e.g., Food Stamps/SNAP), many poor children are 
8:196:14329:28:28:72:537:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not served by CACFP because of provider ineligibility, and receipt of CACFP benefits will vary 
8:197:14424:28:27:72:525:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:among similar low-income children according to the characteristics and behavior of their care 
8:198:14518:27:28:72:540:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providers.  Ineligible children include those with no non-parental child care arrangements, which 
8:199:14616:28:28:72:524:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:includes at least half of children ages 0 to 2 and one-quarter of children ages 3 to 4 (Iruka and

8:201:14803:27:28:72:535:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:neighbors, friends or relatives are not eligible, which, in one three-city study, included over half

8:204:15084:28:28:72:524:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly on characteristics of providers.  For centers, eligibility and reimbursement levels 
8:205:15182:28:27:72:509:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:depend on ownership (e.g., for-profit) status and the income levels of children served.  For 
8:206:15275:27:28:72:509:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:licensed homes, eligibility and reimbursement levels depend on the provider’s income, the

8:209:15552:28:28:72:528:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:licensed homes and centers, we expect to find that a significant portion of poor children do not 
8:210:15649:28:27:72:404:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:receive CACFP and a portion of non-poor children receive CACFP.  
8:211:15714:27:28:108:517:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We expect costs and benefits (broadly defined) of participation to influence provider

9:217:16357:28:27:72:488:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively fixed (e.g., a menu must be planned for three or three hundred children), but 
9:218:16446:27:28:71:494:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reimbursement increases linearly with the number of children, especially poor children, 
9:219:16534:28:28:71:494:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation should become more attractive when the provider cares for more children, 
9:220:16621:28:27:71:238:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particularly low-income children.  
9:221:16656:27:28:107:534:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 1 illustrates how CACFP reimbursements vary according to type of care (home or 
9:222:16741:28:27:71:521:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:center), the total number of children in care and the number of low-income children (who are 
9:223:16834:27:28:71:528:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reimbursed at a higher rate, except in Tier I homes).  Amounts shown are monthly and assume 
9:224:16926:28:28:71:532:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:23 days of care per month per child, and reimbursement for breakfast, lunch and snack for each 
9:225:17021:28:27:71:531:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:child, which is the most common configuration of meals and snacks (Crepinsek et al. 2002).  If 
9:226:17116:27:28:72:523:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one assumes that centers and home-based care providers would serve meals and snacks in the 
9:227:17207:28:27:72:532:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:absence of the program, then it is clear that homes and centers that serve large numbers of poor 
9:228:17304:27:28:72:535:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children (Tier I or full reimbursement) have very substantial monetary incentives to participate.  
9:229:17403:28:28:72:542:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:For many mid-size to large centers, benefits as high as $9,000 to $14,000 per month would likely 
9:230:17500:28:27:72:535:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:far exceed administrative costs of CACFP. Likewise, a large home would receive nearly $1,000 
9:231:17593:27:28:72:207:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:per month at the Tier I rate. 
9:232:17623:28:27:108:533:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Comparing across columns of Table 1 shows how incentives for providers to participate 
9:233:17709:27:28:72:533:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:vary according to the incomes of children in their care.  Monthly reimbursement levels increase 
9:234:17805:28:28:72:526:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:much more steeply with different reimbursement levels for centers than homes, giving centers 
9:235:17898:28:27:72:528:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that serve poor children a greater incentive to participate than those serving non-poor children, 
9:236:17996:27:28:72:536:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and also creating strong incentives for centers to serve more poor children.  For homes, the ratio 
9:237:18095:28:27:72:534:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of Tier 1 to Tier II reimbursement is only 2 to 1.  For centers, in contrast, the ratio of reduced to 
9:238:18197:27:28:72:468:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:paid reimbursement is 6 to 1, and the ratio of full to paid reimbursement is 8 to 1.  
9:239:18283:28:0:108:500:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:One study provides evidence that providers respond to the financial incentives of 
10:240:18412:0:28:72:518:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:different reimbursement rates. Abt Associates conducted a large national study of the switch 
10:241:18505:28:27:72:518:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from one to two reimbursement tiers for home-based providers was introduced as part of the 
10:242:18596:27:28:72:541:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1996 welfare reform legislations in order to better target low-income children (Glantz 2004; U.S. 
10:243:18694:28:28:72:520:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Department of Agriculture 2002).  The new category of Tier I homes was not affected by the 
10:244:18785:28:27:72:540:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:change, but homes in the new Tier II category received a lower rate.  The Abt study reported that 
10:245:18883:27:28:72:507:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the number of participating homes fell by about 14% following the introduction of tiering, 
10:246:18974:28:27:72:510:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relative to projected trends (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2002).  Among providers who 
10:247:19063:27:28:72:525:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participated at the lower Tier II rate, nearly two-thirds reported that meal reimbursement rates 
10:248:19160:28:28:72:521:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were unsatisfactory, compared to about ten percent of Tier I providers.  Tier II providers also 
10:249:19256:28:27:72:513:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reported spending about $20 less per week on food, on average, than Tier I providers ($110 
10:250:19347:27:28:72:140:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:versus $91).   
10:251:19362:28:27:108:506:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Among similar children, several provider and family characteristics may influence 
10:252:19444:27:28:72:540:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation.  For example, although the cost of participation is low for home-based providers in 
10:253:19543:28:28:72:529:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:low-income areas because all licensed home providers in the area are eligible and validation of 
10:254:19639:28:27:72:531:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their income or the income of children in their care is not required, providers must still find out 
10:255:19739:27:28:72:542:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:about the program, be willing to work with a sponsor, and complete the required paperwork (e.g., 
10:256:19836:28:27:72:539:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:submit menus to sponsors).  These considerations suggest that characteristics related to access to 
10:257:19935:27:28:72:491:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information such as participation in professional networks, or characteristics that make 
10:258:20024:28:28:72:514:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:paperwork and scrutiny less daunting such as participation in other public programs, should 
10:259:20116:28:27:72:522:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase participation.  Licensed homes are predicted to have high participation rates because 
10:260:20211:27:28:72:537:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:licensing itself entails oversight procedures and the licensing agency likely provides many kinds 
10:261:20309:28:27:72:148:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of information. 
10:262:20325:27:28:108:534:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Centers typically have greater access to information and existing oversight relationships 
10:263:20415:28:0:72:519:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than homes.  Most center-based care is licensed or associated with larger organizations (e.g., 
11:264:20557:0:28:72:541:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:public and private schools or religious organizations) that regularly provide information to center 
11:265:20657:28:27:72:532:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:directors including information about CACFP.  Still, broader professional networking may also 
11:266:20751:27:28:71:530:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:affect center participation.  Because centers must determine the correct level of reimbursement 
11:267:20847:28:28:71:532:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for each child, participation may be viewed as costly, especially when most children in care are 
11:268:20944:28:27:71:530:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not poor.  However, centers tend to have more formal administrative relationships with parents 
11:269:21039:27:28:71:521:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than do home-based caregivers, which would facilitate income-eligibility checks.  Also, poor 
11:270:21132:28:27:71:528:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families may already be participating in other programs involving the provider such as general 
11:271:21227:27:28:71:541:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:child care subsidies or Head Start.  Referral relationships with Head Start may be associated with 
11:272:21326:28:28:71:515:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher participation either because poverty rates are high among Head Start children, which 
11:273:21418:28:27:71:513:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase financial incentives to participate, or due to network/information ties to Head Start 
11:274:21513:27:28:71:393:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providers or families, virtually all of whom are served by CACFP. 
11:275:21579:28:27:107:520:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We also expect family characteristics to affect whether children participate.  Families 
11:276:21667:27:28:71:536:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:affect participation in three ways: by their poverty status or other program participation, by their 
11:277:21768:28:28:71:525:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:residence in areas with more poor children, and by their choice of provider.  In choosing care, 
11:278:21864:28:27:71:486:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some parents may directly seek out a provider who participates in CACFP or who has 
11:279:21947:27:28:71:513:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics that may correlate with participation (like a higher quality care environment, 
11:280:22042:28:27:71:536:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including higher nutritional quality).  Other parents may avoid care settings with numerous poor 
11:281:22139:27:28:71:503:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children, taking this as a signal of lower quality.  Furthermore, providers may factor such 
11:282:22231:28:28:71:538:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parental choices into their decisions about participation in CACFP.  For example, a provider in a 
11:283:22329:28:27:71:496:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mixed income area may, on the one hand, be able to raise revenues in the form of larger 
11:284:22417:27:28:71:530:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reimbursements from the CACFP by serving more low-income children but, on the other hand, 
11:285:22507:28:27:71:467:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may worry about the potentially adverse market signal this sends to some parents. 
11:286:22589:27:28:108:526:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, participation in CACFP depends on eligibility rules and characteristics of both 
11:287:22677:28:0:72:523:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families and providers, particularly characteristics linked to the costs and benefits of provider 
12:288:22823:0:28:72:534:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation.  Below, we provide the first national portrait of participation in relation to the key 
12:289:22925:28:27:72:538:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:determinants of eligibility and reimbursement levels: type of care (center vs. home, for-profit vs. 
12:290:23025:27:28:72:542:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-profit, licensed vs. unlicensed), neighborhood income, provider income, and family income.  
12:291:23121:28:28:72:529:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We then focus on a set of similar eligible children (low income children attending centers) and 
12:292:23217:28:27:72:533:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employ multiple regression analyses that include characteristics of providers and families (such 
12:293:23314:27:28:72:498:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as the center’s referral relationships with Head Start and willingness to accept child care 
12:294:23406:28:27:72:523:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies and the mother’s education level and reasons for choosing care) that may determine 
12:295:23499:27:28:72:378:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who among these eligible children participates in the program.

12:297:23615:28:27:108:521:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We also assess whether the CACFP is associated with child nutritional outcomes.  As 
12:298:23699:27:28:72:522:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:described above, participating providers must develop menus that meet USDA meal patterns, 
12:299:23789:28:27:72:508:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including requirements for serving nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, and milk.  If 
12:300:23883:27:28:71:539:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providers follow these patterns, children’s consumption of nutritious foods should increase when 
12:301:23980:28:28:71:516:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cared for in a participating setting.  Children’s consumption of less nutritious foods (such as 
12:302:24076:28:27:71:483:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:drinking soda or fruit-flavored drinks or eating sweet snacks) might also be reduced.  
12:303:24163:27:28:72:528:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Reimbursements from CACFP may also allow providers to increase food portions, which may 
12:304:24251:28:27:72:533:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:help some poor children meet their calorie needs and reduce food insecurity.  Whether and how 
12:305:24345:27:28:72:510:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these changes in diet affect weight, however, is unclear, as weight is determined by caloric 
12:306:24438:28:28:72:538:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intake; and, whereas some nutritious foods (e.g., fruit and whole milk) are high in calories, other 
12:307:24538:28:27:72:501:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nutritious foods (like vegetables) are low in calories.  Children in full-time care typically 
12:308:24632:27:28:72:511:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consume half to two-thirds of their daily meals and snacks in the care setting (Ziegler et al. 
12:309:24727:28:27:71:539:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2006).  Thus, to the extent the program improves nutrition, food security, and appropriate caloric 
12:310:24826:27:28:71:525:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intake, we expect the associations to be greater for children who are in care for longer hours.   
12:311:24924:28:0:107:524:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:On the other hand, CACFP participation might not be associated with child nutritional 
13:312:25058:0:28:72:502:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes because providers have latitude in food menus and their meals are infrequently 
13:313:25146:28:27:72:503:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:monitored (i.e., one time per year).  Some studies find relatively good adherence to menu 
13:314:25236:27:28:72:532:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:requirements.  For example, a study by Abt Associates found that in Tier II homes over 90% of 
13:315:25330:28:28:72:520:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:breakfasts, lunches and snacks met the meal pattern requirements (Crepinsek et al. 2002).  In 
13:316:25424:28:27:72:527:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:addition, the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) showed that children consumed more 
13:317:25515:27:28:72:541:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:milk, fruits and vegetables at lunches served at child care than at lunches served at home (Ziegler 
13:318:25615:28:27:72:521:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:et al. 2006).5  However, other studies that observed the meals served in CACFP-participating 
13:319:25708:27:28:71:536:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:settings reveal that meal patterns are sometimes not followed; substitutions from planned menus 
13:320:25804:28:28:71:518:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are not documented, or children do not consume the food served.  One study of participating 
13:321:25896:28:27:71:535:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:homes and centers in Texas found that no provider met the meal patterns all of the time, and the 
13:322:25993:27:28:71:501:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only meal components served 100% of the time were milk at breakfast and meat at lunch 
13:323:26079:28:27:71:500:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Kuratko et al. 2000). In a study of Head Start centers, only four meals served out of 269 
13:324:26170:27:28:71:385:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:perfectly matched menu descriptions (Fleischhacker et al. 2006). 
13:325:26235:28:28:71:531:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: As far as we are aware, no prior study has examined how food intake, weight status and 
13:326:26322:28:27:71:536:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:food insecurity differ between children who attend CACFP-participating settings and those who 
13:327:26416:27:28:71:532:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:do not.  Although our study has some limitations, including reliance on parental reports (except 
13:328:26513:28:27:71:508:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for child height and weight) and non-random assignment of children to CACFP settings, it 
13:329:26602:27:28:71:526:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provides the first estimates of associations between CACFP participation and nutrition-related 
13:330:26697:28:28:71:254:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes of preschool aged children. 
13:331:26734:28:27:71:120:179:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f3:B:Summary 
13:332:26741:27:28:71:521:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In summary, the CACFP is clearly understudied compared to other federal nutritional 
13:333:26825:28:27:71:532:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:programs. In the remainder of this paper we present the first national portrait of participation in 
13:334:26925:27:28:71:540:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the CACFP in relation to key program eligibility and reimbursement rules.  An important feature 
13:335:27021:28:8:71:219:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
13:336:27069:8:0:72:421:61:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:5 The study did not identify which child care providers participated in CACFP. 
14:337:27196:0:28:72:524:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the CACFP is that eligibility for the program and the benefits and costs of participation are 
14:338:27293:28:27:72:502:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:linked to provider as well as family characteristics. We therefore describe how numerous 
14:339:27382:27:28:72:513:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics of providers and families correlate with participation for similar low-income 
14:340:27476:28:28:72:522:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children in center care.  We also compare nutrition-related outcomes for low income children 
14:341:27569:28:27:72:531:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who attend a participating center to low income children who attend a non-participating center, 
14:342:27665:27:28:72:530:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adjusting for other characteristics of providers and families that we found to be associated with 
14:343:27763:28:27:72:504:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation.  We conclude with a detailed discussion of the implications of our findings, 
14:344:27855:27:28:72:446:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:especially in the context of other nutritional and child care subsidy programs.

14:347:27965:27:28:72:110:428:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Sample 
14:348:27972:28:27:108:516:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), which is a 
14:349:28053:27:28:72:542:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of children from birth onward.6  Children 
14:350:28152:28:28:71:512:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the sample were born in 2001 in 46 states.  The sample size was 10,700, resulting from a 
14:351:28244:28:27:71:506:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:response rate of 74% at the initial 9-month interview. At the two- and four-year follow up 
14:352:28335:27:28:71:537:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interviews, sample sizes were 9,850 and 8,950, respectively. The ECLS-B oversampled children 
14:353:28428:28:27:71:527:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:born with a low birth weight or a twin as well as American Indian and Asian children.  At two-
14:354:28522:27:28:71:526:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:years, 43% of children in the sample were non-Hispanic white, 16% non-Hispanic black, 20% 
14:355:28612:28:28:71:527:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-Hispanic other, and 21% were Hispanic.  At the two- and four-year follow-ups the child’s 
14:356:28705:28:27:71:522:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:primary non-parental care provider, the person who cared for the child for the most hours per 
14:357:28799:27:28:71:540:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:week, was contacted for an interview.  The weighted response rate in the two year follow-up was 
14:358:28895:28:27:71:535:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:70% for the child care provider interview (Bethel et al. 2007: 3-25). The weighted response rate 
14:359:28992:27:8:71:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
14:360:29040:8:18:72:530:89:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:6 A data-sharing agreement is required for the restricted-use ECLS-B data.  All sample sizes reported in 
14:361:29145:18:0:72:440:71:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:the text and tables are rounded to the nearest 50, as per the data-sharing agreement. 
15:362:29279:0:28:72:539:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the four year follow-up was approximately 90% for center-based providers and 80% for home-
15:363:29372:28:27:72:517:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:based providers (Snow et al. 2007: 306).  We use sampling weights in all analyses that were 
15:364:29464:27:28:72:540:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:created to adjust for the initial sampling design, initial nonresponse, and differential nonresponse 
15:365:29565:28:28:72:215:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:over time (Snow et al. 2007). 
15:366:29595:28:27:72:187:593:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Measures and Methods 
15:367:29616:27:28:108:478:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To answer our three research questions, we constructed measures of CACFP 
15:368:29689:28:27:72:541:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation, child nutritional outcomes, child care provider characteristics, and child and family 
15:369:29790:27:28:72:505:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics, including information about the family, provider, and ZIP code poverty to 
15:370:29881:28:28:72:520:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approximate eligibility rules and reimbursement levels.  We present descriptive statistics and 
15:371:29976:28:27:71:324:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:details about variable measurement in Appendix A.  
15:372:30027:27:28:107:516:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Our analyses have three overarching purposes: to describe the populations served by 
15:373:30111:28:27:71:540:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:CACFP, to identify correlates of participation, and to estimate associations between participation 
15:374:30210:27:28:71:512:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in CACFP and nutritional outcomes among low-income children.  For the first purpose, we 
15:375:30298:28:28:71:541:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:present simple descriptive statistics.  We calculate the percentage of children who are in different 
15:376:30399:28:27:71:516:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:types of care and, within these types of care, the percentage who receive CACFP and whose 
15:377:30489:27:28:71:501:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families are poor.  To examine the importance of area income, we then calculate CACFP 
15:378:30575:28:27:71:522:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation rates by area and family poverty, separately for homes and centers.  Because we 
15:379:30669:27:28:71:508:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:anticipate age differences in types of care arrangements, we report all descriptive statistics 
15:380:30764:28:28:71:525:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:separately for two year olds and four year olds.  We apply the appropriate sampling weight so 
15:381:30858:28:27:71:426:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that these statistics are nationally representative of children born in 2001. 
15:382:30936:27:28:71:527:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:  To identify which provider and area characteristics have independent associations with 
15:383:31023:28:27:71:531:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:take up among similar children, we estimate a series of four OLS linear probability models that 
15:384:31119:27:28:71:523:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predict whether low income children who attend centers participate in CACFP or not (OLS is 
15:385:31210:28:0:71:523:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:used for simplicity of interpretation; the pattern of statistical significance is highly similar for 
16:386:31359:0:28:72:531:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:logistic regression models; results are available from the authors).  Standard errors are adjusted 
16:387:31458:28:27:72:512:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for heteroskedasticity and for clustering at the ZIP code level. Our first model includes key 
16:388:31552:27:28:72:514:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:determinants of the financial benefits to centers of participating, including area poverty, for-
16:389:31648:28:28:72:510:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:profit status, licensure status and licensed capacity, but with only minimal controls (for the 
16:390:31743:28:27:72:540:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sampling weight, dummy variables for child age in months, and dummy variables for geographic 
16:391:31836:27:28:72:536:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:state or region).  In our second model, we add center covariates that may indicate organizational 
16:392:31934:28:27:71:518:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:capacity to find out about and enroll in the program, such as referral relationships with Head 
16:393:32029:27:28:71:495:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Start and the director’s tenure at the center.  In the third model, we add child and family 
16:394:32121:28:28:71:511:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics that may influence whether parents choose participating centers, such as the 
16:395:32214:28:27:71:533:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mother’s reasons for selecting care and her education level.  In the fourth model, we add lagged 
16:396:32311:27:28:71:539:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(measured at age two) child milk consumption, BMI, and food insecurity to study whether or not 
16:397:32406:28:27:71:541:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children who participate in CACFP are nutritionally selected, conditional on other characteristics 
16:398:32505:27:28:71:507:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of their families and care providers.  Evidence of such selectivity has been found for other 
16:399:32598:28:28:71:531:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nutritional programs, such as Food Stamps, where families most in need are also most likely to 
16:400:32693:28:27:71:371:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:take up (Burstein et al., 2004; Gibson-Davis & Foster 2006).   
16:401:32756:27:28:107:524:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:For our third research question, examining associations between CACFP participation 
16:402:32840:28:27:71:527:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and child nutritional outcomes, we estimate another series of OLS linear probability models in 
16:403:32935:27:28:71:527:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which four year olds’ food consumption, food insecurity and weight status are outcomes and a 
16:404:33028:28:28:71:532:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dummy indicator of attending a CACFP-participating center is the central predictor (the pattern 
16:405:33124:28:27:71:529:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of significance is again highly similar for logistic regression models; results are available from 
16:406:33223:27:28:71:538:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the authors).  Similar to our models predicting participation, we estimate a series of four models. 
16:407:33323:28:27:71:503:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The first child outcome model includes an indicator of CACFP participation and minimal 
16:408:33410:27:28:71:527:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:controls for the sampling weight and dummy variables for child age in months, for geographic 
16:409:33503:28:0:71:537:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:state or region, and for whether the parent respondent is the mother.  The second model adds the 
17:410:33648:0:28:72:503:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:child and family covariates described above and shown in Appendix A, which may select 
17:411:33734:28:27:72:533:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children into participating settings based on health, nutritional or socioeconomic status and also 
17:412:33833:27:28:72:532:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be correlated with child outcomes.  The third model adds controls for center characteristics that 
17:413:33931:28:28:72:535:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are potential confounders; for example, directors with a longer tenure at the center may be more 
17:414:34028:28:27:72:519:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to seek reimbursements from CACFP and already deliver effective care in other ways, 
17:415:34119:27:28:72:537:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:such as better health practices.  Our fourth model includes controls for child outcomes measured 
17:416:34216:28:27:71:540:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at age two (i.e., lagged child outcomes) to adjust for unmeasured stable characteristics associated 
17:417:34316:27:28:71:532:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with child health and nutrition at age four as well as age two.  We do not use child fixed effects 
17:418:34415:28:28:71:517:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., first differences) because we do not have exact repeated measures for all outcomes and 
17:419:34509:28:27:71:518:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because we anticipate that the association between CACFP participation and child outcomes 
17:420:34599:27:28:71:486:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:might vary for two and four year olds (but standard fixed-effects models constrain the 
17:421:34686:28:27:71:325:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:associations to be identical at age two and age four). 
17:422:34741:27:28:107:515:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:For the participation and outcome regression models, we restrict our analysis to low-
17:423:34826:28:28:71:538:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income four-year olds who are cared for in non-Head Start centers. We focus on centers because 
17:424:34921:28:27:71:515:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a small percentage of children, and small numbers of children in our sample, are in licensed 
17:425:35014:27:28:71:540:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:homes at ages two or four. We study four-year olds because many more children are in centers at 
17:426:35110:28:27:71:528:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:age four than two.  We drop children in Head Start centers from our analyses because virtually 
17:427:35205:27:28:71:520:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:all Head Start centers participate in CACFP, so it is difficult to distinguish effects of CACFP 
17:428:35301:28:28:72:522:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from those of the Head Start program; we lack a comparison group of Head Start participants 
17:429:35393:28:27:72:484:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who are not CACFP participants.  We study low-income children in order to increase 
17:430:35476:27:28:72:405:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:comparability between participating and non-participating children.   
17:431:35546:28:27:72:543:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: We also re-estimated the participation and outcome regressions for children who were not 
17:432:35635:27:28:72:512:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in care at age two, to assess whether covariates of CACFP participation and associations of 
17:433:35727:28:0:72:540:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation with preschoolers’ outcomes were similar among those who had not been in care as 
18:434:35870:0:28:72:497:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two year olds.  In addition, anticipating that associations with child nutrition and calorie 
18:435:35963:28:27:72:530:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consumption might be larger for children who spend more time in care (and thus who eat more 
18:436:36055:27:28:72:536:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:meals and snacks in care) we re-estimated the outcome models for children who were in care 30

18:442:36385:28:28:108:519:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:According to the ECLS-B data, the overall rate of participation in the CACFP is low, 
18:443:36470:28:27:72:521:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including among poor children.  Among two years olds, just 9% receive CACFP, and receipt 
18:444:36559:27:28:72:519:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:varies little by poverty status (10% of non-poor two-year-olds and 8% of poor two-year-olds 
18:445:36651:28:27:72:540:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:receive CACFP).  Among four year olds, participation is higher, especially among poor children, 
18:446:36747:27:28:72:528:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:although it is still the case that the majority do not receive CACFP.  Overall, 28% of four-year 
18:447:36844:28:28:72:536:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:olds receive CACFP; 20% of non-poor four-year-olds and 37% of poor four-year olds.  We now 
18:448:36935:28:27:72:515:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:turn to more detailed descriptive analyses by type of care and area poverty in order to better 
18:449:37030:27:28:72:524:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:understand the sources of low participation overall, the modest differences in participation by 
18:450:37126:28:27:72:503:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poverty status, and much better coverage and targeting of benefits on poor children at the 
18:451:37217:27:28:72:147:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preschool age.  
18:452:37233:28:28:108:536:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To begin, Table 2 shows basic information about the percentage of two year old children 
18:453:37321:28:27:72:533:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in each type of care arrangement, the CACFP participation rate (in relevant care types), and the 
18:454:37418:27:28:72:542:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:family poverty rate (overall in each type of care and, where relevant, within CACFP participation 
18:455:37516:28:27:72:508:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:status).  The results show that many poor two-year olds are missed because they are not in 
18:456:37607:27:28:72:531:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:eligible settings, and that coverage of poor children is better in centers than licensed homes.  In 
18:457:37707:28:0:72:538:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particular, most two-year olds are cared for in settings that are either ineligible for CACFP (61% 
19:458:37854:0:28:72:530:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are in exclusive maternal care), or that are either ineligible or participate at low rates;  one fifth 
19:459:37957:28:27:72:535:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of all two-year olds, and one-half of those in child care, are in unlicensed homes, and just 5% of 
19:460:38056:27:28:72:330:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unlicensed providers said they participate in CACFP. 
19:461:38109:28:28:108:515:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Many children who are not served are poor, including over half (55%) of children in 
19:462:38193:28:27:72:538:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exclusive maternal care and over one-third of those in unlicensed homes (46% of those cared for 
19:463:38289:27:28:72:535:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at home or by a relative; 37% of those care for by a nonrelative outside of the child’s home).  In 
19:464:38388:28:27:72:541:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, although nearly two-thirds of licensed home providers participate in CACFP, just 5% of 
19:465:38485:27:28:72:524:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:all two-year olds and 13% of two-year olds in care are in this type of setting.  In addition, just 
19:466:38584:28:28:72:531:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:over one-quarter (28%) of two-year olds in licensed homes are poor, and the poverty rate is the 
19:467:38680:28:27:72:523:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:same among children in participating and non-participating settings.  In terms of centers, two-
19:468:38775:27:28:72:521:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year olds are nearly evenly split between for-profit and non-profit centers; together, over one-
19:469:38871:28:27:72:529:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:third of two-year olds who are in child care are cared for in centers (17% in non-profit centers; 
19:470:38969:27:28:72:506:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:19% in for-profit centers).  Coverage of poor children is better in for-profit and non-profit 
19:471:39063:28:28:72:542:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:centers than in licensed homes.  The majority of centers do not participate in CACFP—just under 
19:472:39159:28:27:72:477:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one out of every three for-profit centers and about two out of five non-profit centers 
19:473:39246:27:28:72:531:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participate—but children who attend participating centers are more likely to be poor than those 
19:474:39342:28:27:72:424:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in non-participating centers (about half versus one-fifth to one-quarter).   
19:475:39419:27:28:108:520:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Participation is higher, and coverage of poor children is better, at age four than at age 
19:476:39509:28:28:72:520:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two.  The primary explanation is that more children are cared for in centers than in exclusive 
19:477:39604:28:27:72:532:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:maternal care or unlicensed care.  As Table 3 shows, less than one-quarter of four-year olds are 
19:478:39701:27:28:72:540:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in exclusive maternal care and only 16% are in unlicensed homes (13% with a relative or in their 
19:479:39798:28:27:72:518:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:own home; 3% with nonrelatives outside their own home).  Yet poverty rates remain high in 
19:480:39888:27:28:72:532:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these settings: two-thirds of children who are in exclusive maternal care at age four are poor, as 
19:481:39987:28:0:72:522:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are over half of those in unlicensed care provided by a relative or in their own home and over 
20:482:40130:0:28:72:427:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one-third of those in unlicensed care by a non-relative away from home.   
20:483:40204:28:27:108:527:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Coverage of poor children remains better in centers than licensed homes at four years.  
20:484:40292:27:28:72:540:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Although a high proportion of licensed home providers who care for four-year olds participate in 
20:485:40389:28:28:72:529:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:CACFP (66%), the percentage of children in this type of care is low (4% of all children; 5% of 
20:486:40484:28:27:72:521:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children in care) and the child poverty rate is similar in homes that participate in CACFP and 
20:487:40579:27:28:72:522:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those that do not (27% and 34% respectively).  In contrast, family poverty is much higher for 
20:488:40673:28:27:72:526:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children attending CACFP-participating centers than non-participating centers, especially non-
20:489:40767:27:28:72:531:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:profit centers where coverage of poor children is particularly good.  About one-third of all four-
20:490:40865:28:28:72:530:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year olds (34%) and nearly half of those in care (45%) are cared for in non-profit centers. And, 
20:491:40962:28:27:72:530:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:whereas 63% of those at CACFP-participating non-profit centers are poor, just 21% of those at 
20:492:41056:27:28:72:510:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-participating non-profit centers are poor.  Also as expected, participation in CACFP is 
20:493:41148:28:27:71:530:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nearly universal for Head Start centers (94%), and most children in Head Start centers are poor 
20:494:41244:27:28:71:107:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(88%). 
20:495:41251:28:28:107:518:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To assess the role of area poverty, we focus our attention on licensed homes and non-
20:496:41336:28:27:71:531:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Head Start centers because virtually all Head Start centers participate and almost no unlicensed 
20:497:41433:27:28:71:512:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:homes participate.  Table 4 shows CACFP participation rates by both family and area-level 
20:498:41523:28:27:71:520:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poverty for licensed homes at ages two and four.  The table also shows whether participating 
20:499:41616:27:28:71:509:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providers are low income (with incomes under $40,000). Strikingly, among licensed home 
20:500:41703:28:28:71:527:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providers, there is little consistent association between participation in CACFP and either area 
20:501:41800:28:27:71:538:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poverty levels or the poverty status of the children in their care.  Regardless of the poverty status 
20:502:41902:27:28:71:539:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the child’s family or the fraction of children who are eligible for free or reduced lunch in local 
20:503:42004:28:27:71:529:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools, generally about two-thirds of children who attend licensed homes receive CACFP.  In 
20:504:42097:27:28:71:490:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:terms of provider income, in most cases less than half of licensed home providers who 
20:505:42183:28:0:71:543:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participate in CACFP have incomes below $40,000 regardless of family and area poverty levels.   
21:506:42327:0:28:72:540:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Although our approximation of provider poverty is crude because we do not know the providers’ 
21:507:42421:28:27:72:517:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:household size, it is striking that among CACFP participating providers who serve non-poor 
21:508:42512:27:28:72:531:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children in areas with no poor schools just one-fifth (at age two) to half (at age four) fall below 
21:509:42612:28:28:72:542:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this income cutoff.  Of course, if we could have identified whether the provider received Tier I or 
21:510:42712:28:27:72:505:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Tier II reimbursement rates, we may have found a stronger link between area poverty and 
21:511:42800:27:28:72:495:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation, since Tier I eligibility is linked to local poverty rates (see again Figure 1). 
21:512:42895:28:27:108:522:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Among children in centers (Table 5), in most cases, those who live in a lower-income 
21:513:42980:27:28:72:540:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:area are more likely to receive CACFP; the exception is non-profit centers serving poor two-year 
21:514:43077:28:28:72:507:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:olds, where the majority participates regardless of the area poverty level.  Presumably this 
21:515:43170:28:27:72:538:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gradient reflects the fact that the incentive for any center to participate is greater when the center 
21:516:43273:27:28:72:528:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:serves more low-income children; and for-profit centers located in low-income neighborhoods 
21:517:43365:28:27:72:517:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are more likely to meet the criterion of serving at least 25% low-income children.  Although 
21:518:43458:27:28:72:498:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:within each type of area, poor children are more likely than non-poor children to receive 
21:519:43548:28:28:72:532:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:CACFP, they are generally least likely to receive CACFP when they live in non-poor areas.  At 
21:520:43642:28:27:72:526:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both two years and four years, when poor children attend for-profit centers, one-third or fewer 
21:521:43738:27:28:72:523:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participate in CACFP if they are located in a non-poor area (<10% poor) in contrast to half to 
21:522:43833:28:27:72:524:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two-thirds in poor areas (>= 20% poor).  Many more four-year olds than two-year olds attend 
21:523:43925:27:28:72:504:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-profit centers, and at four years a similar gradient is seen by area poverty: 48% are at 
21:524:44018:28:28:72:516:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participating centers when located in non-poor areas in comparison to three-quarters in poor 
21:525:44111:28:27:72:538:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:areas.  Thus, the chance that a poor child will receive CACFP in a center depends on the level of 
21:526:44209:27:28:71:199:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poverty in the local area.   
21:527:44238:28:27:107:531:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, our results indicate that the majority of children do not receive CACFP because 
21:528:44326:27:28:71:503:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:many are cared for in settings such as maternal care or an unlicensed home that are either 
21:529:44417:28:0:71:516:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ineligible for or do not participate in CACFP.  This is especially true for two year olds.  The 
22:530:44561:0:28:72:529:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:majority of these children are poor.  Licensed homes have high CACFP participation rates, but 
22:531:44655:28:27:72:530:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:few children are in this type of care and participation is equally high among non-poor and poor 
22:532:44751:27:28:72:529:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children.  Coverage of poor children is better in centers than licensed homes, and by four years 
22:533:44848:28:28:72:523:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of age the majority of children are cared for in centers.  But, among centers, poor children are 
22:534:44945:28:27:72:532:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less likely to participate when they live in higher-income areas, especially those who attend for-

22:538:45201:28:28:72:538:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 6.  The results in Column 1 of Table 6 confirm our descriptive results; among low-income 
22:539:45296:28:27:72:521:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:four-year olds who attend centers, CACFP participation is higher in higher-poverty areas.  In 
22:540:45390:27:28:72:537:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:addition, for-profit centers are 19 percentage points less likely to participate in CACFP than non-
22:541:45489:28:27:72:529:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:profit centers.7  Unlicensed centers and small licensed centers are less likely to participate than 
22:542:45589:27:28:72:526:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large licensed centers; predicted participation rates holding covariates at their means are 73%, 
22:543:45686:28:28:72:492:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:65%, and 52% for large, medium and small licensed centers, respectively, and 50% for 
22:544:45771:28:27:72:172:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unlicensed centers.   
22:545:45793:27:28:108:493:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:When we control for other characteristics of centers (column 2; only significant 
22:546:45874:28:27:72:535:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:covariates are shown in Table 6; see Appendix C for all coefficients) significant effects of some 
22:547:45972:27:28:72:531:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:determinants including local poverty are reduced, but remain substantial in size (about 10 to 20 
22:548:46069:28:28:72:516:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points).  Of the new covariates, we see that centers with a referral relationship to 
22:549:46165:28:27:71:499:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Head Start are more likely to participate (16 percentage points), which likely reflects the 
22:550:46257:27:28:71:539:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presence of more poor children at the center or the influence of informational links to Head Start 
22:551:46356:28:27:71:526:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:programs.  School-based prekindergarten and other preschool programs, which are sometimes 
22:552:46446:27:0:71:515:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:part-day programs and may serve fewer meals, are less likely to participate than community 
23:553:46585:0:28:72:536:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:centers, which are typically full-day programs.  Accredited centers are more likely to participate 
23:554:46684:28:27:72:505:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(10 percentage points), which may indicate the selection of higher quality centers into the 
23:555:46776:27:28:71:536:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:program, the ability of participating centers to invest in quality, or access to better informational 
23:556:46878:28:28:71:536:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:networks.  When the center director reports accepting subsidies the center is (unexpectedly) less 
23:557:46976:28:27:71:512:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to participate; this result may reflect the fact that the question asks whether subsidies 
23:558:47073:27:28:71:315:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would be accepted, rather than actually received.   
23:559:47125:28:27:107:484:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As shown in Column 3 of Table 6, several child and family characteristics are 
23:560:47203:27:28:71:534:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly related to CACFP participation (see Appendix C for all coefficients).  Children are 
23:561:47301:28:28:71:516:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to attend a participating center if they are in care 30 or more hours per week (10 
23:562:47396:28:27:71:536:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points), if their mother is less educated (14 percentage point increase for high school 
23:563:47495:27:28:71:535:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:graduate versus having some college or more),8 and if the mother reported that small care group 
23:564:47591:28:27:72:510:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:size was very important to her child care decision (8 percentage points).  In Column 4, two 
23:565:47683:27:28:72:515:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lagged child outcomes also predict attending a participating center (estimates in Column 4): 
23:566:47776:28:28:72:535:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:families in which the child was food insecure at age two are 16 percentage points more likely to 
23:567:47873:28:27:72:533:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attend a participating center at age four; and children who drank more milk at age two are more 
23:568:47969:27:28:72:536:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to attend a participating center at age four (10 percentage points for those who drank milk 
23:569:48068:28:27:72:508:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at meals versus neither meals nor snacks).  These associations remain significant when we 
23:570:48158:27:28:72:484:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrict the analysis to those who had not been in care at two years old (Appendix D). 
23:571:48245:28:28:72:533:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: To summarize, our estimates suggest that provider, family and locational characteristics 
23:572:48334:28:27:72:539:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:all affect participation in CACFP.  Poor children who reside in low-income areas are more likely 
23:573:48431:27:28:72:530:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to participate than similar poor children in wealthier areas. These area differences likely reflect 
23:574:48531:28:27:72:526:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the fact that the benefits to participation are greater for centers that serve many poor children.  
23:575:48631:27:8:72:542:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                                                                                                                             
23:576:48787:8:0:72:397:89:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:7 Interactions between profit-status and area poverty were not significant. 
24:577:48911:0:28:72:526:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Provider characteristics also clearly matter.  Large, licensed, accredited and non-profit centers 
24:578:49009:28:27:72:511:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are more likely to participate, as are those connected to Head Start through referrals. These 
24:579:49103:27:28:72:530:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:patterns of participation by providers suggest the importance of both direct financial incentives 
24:580:49201:28:28:72:506:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(costs and benefits) as well as informational/organizational linkages.  As expected, family 
24:581:49293:28:27:72:513:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics also affect participation, even among low-income families. Not surprisingly, 
24:582:49386:27:28:72:487:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:controlling for provider characteristics, participation is higher among parents of lower 
24:583:49475:28:27:72:395:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:socioeconomic status and whose children are in care more hours.

24:585:49614:28:28:108:537:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The coefficients of CACFP participation for each model and outcome are summarized in 
24:586:49699:28:27:72:532:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Table 7 (the full set of regression coefficients is available from the authors).  Overall, estimates 
24:587:49800:27:28:72:541:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicate that attending a CACFP-participating center is associated with increased consumption of 
24:588:49897:28:27:71:526:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:milk, vegetables, and (to some extent) fruits, a lower probability of being underweight (versus 
24:589:49993:27:28:71:534:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:healthy weight) and is not associated with overweight or food insecurity.  In Column 1 of Table 
24:590:50089:28:28:71:525:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:7, the center’s participation in CACFP is associated with an 8 percentage point increase in the 
24:591:50185:28:27:71:527:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:chance that a child will drink two servings of milk per day and with a similar percentage point 
24:592:50281:27:28:71:527:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the chance that a child will consume fruits and vegetables at least twice daily.  The 
24:593:50379:28:27:71:522:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differentials for milk and vegetable consumption are generally robust to the addition of child, 
24:594:50475:27:28:71:521:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:family, and provider controls (Table 7, Columns 2 and 3), and lagged outcomes (Column 4).  
24:595:50566:28:28:71:506:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The associations are also sizable, given that just about two-thirds of poor four year olds in 
24:596:50660:28:27:71:534:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:centers, on average, drink two or more cups of milk and just over one-third, on average, eat two 
24:597:50757:27:28:71:520:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily.  Predicted probabilities for the full models in 
24:598:50854:28:27:71:528:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Column 4, holding covariates constant at their means, indicate that about 62% of children who 
24:599:50948:27:8:71:542:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                                                                                                                             
24:600:51104:8:18:72:541:89:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:8 Mothers with less than a high school education were also more likely to participate than those with some 
24:601:51211:18:0:72:218:71:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:college or more in some models. 
25:602:51291:0:28:72:527:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attend centers that do not participate in CACFP drink two or more cups of milk per day versus 
25:603:51385:28:27:72:523:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nearly 71% of those at participating centers.  For fruits and vegetables, the increases are from 
25:604:51482:27:28:72:310:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:38% to 43% and from 33% to 42%, respectively. 
25:605:51528:28:28:108:540:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast, we find limited evidence that CACFP is associated with weight status or food 
25:606:51618:28:27:72:532:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:insecurity (see again Table 7).  There is some evidence that children at participating centers are 
25:607:51717:27:28:72:541:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to be healthy weight than underweight; predicted probabilities indicate that about 8% 
25:608:51815:28:27:72:529:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are underweight at non-participating centers versus about 3% at participating centers, based on 
25:609:51911:27:28:72:509:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Column 4.  Regarding overweight, about one-third of all poor four-year olds in centers are 
25:610:52002:28:28:72:506:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:overweight (not shown in tables), and being healthy versus overweight is not significantly 
25:611:52093:28:27:72:525:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:associated with CACFP participation (Table 7).  Regarding food insecurity, on average, about 
25:612:52186:27:28:72:503:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:40% of all poor children who are in centers at four years have some household-level food 
25:613:52275:28:27:72:532:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:insecurity and about 25% of these children are themselves food insecure (not shown in tables).  
25:614:52371:27:28:72:526:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The coefficient for CACFP-participation in Table 7 is small, never statistically significant and 
25:615:52468:28:28:72:526:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:usually (unexpectedly) positive in sign for household and child food insecurity.  However, the 
25:616:52563:28:27:72:538:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient for child food insecurity reverses in sign to the expected negative direction in models 
25:617:52663:27:28:72:539:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with lagged outcomes (Column 4 of Table 7).  Indeed, we saw in Table 6 that children who were 
25:618:52757:28:27:72:525:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:food insecure at age two were more likely to attend a CACFP-participating center at age four. 
25:619:52851:27:28:108:541:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix E presents sensitivity analyses, re-estimating the models with minimal controls 
25:620:52940:28:28:72:520:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for children who were not in care at two years of age, who were in care 30 or more hours per 
25:621:53033:28:27:72:508:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:week, and for children who were in community centers (as opposed to pre-kindergarten or 
25:622:53121:27:28:72:541:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preschool).  The associations between CACFP participation and milk and vegetable consumption 
25:623:53214:28:27:72:541:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remained significantly positive and of similar magnitude in the models restricted to children who 
25:624:53312:27:28:72:495:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:had not been in care at two years (Appendix E, Column 3).  The coefficients of CACFP

26:626:53542:0:28:72:539:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:positive and sometimes larger than for the full sample, but significant only for milk consumption

26:628:53728:27:28:72:542:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:larger for children with greater exposure to the care setting, it is also possible that children whose 
26:629:53831:28:28:72:533:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parents put them in longer hours of care and in community settings may be selectively different 
26:630:53927:28:27:72:366:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than children placed in care for fewer hours or in preschool.  
26:631:53990:27:28:108:526:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, among lower-income children, attending a CACFP-participating center is 
26:632:54073:28:27:72:540:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:associated with greater consumption of milk, vegetables, and (to some extent) fruits at four years 
26:633:54172:27:28:72:506:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of age.  In addition, poor children at CACFP participating centers are no more likely to be 
26:634:54264:28:28:72:541:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:overweight and are less likely to be underweight than children at non-participating centers.  Food 
26:635:54363:28:27:72:500:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:insecurity does not differ between poor children attending CACFP-participating and non-

26:638:54473:27:28:72:205:373:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:Summary and Discussion 
26:639:54496:28:28:108:538:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a national portrait of the determinants 
26:640:54589:28:27:72:502:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of receiving CACFP benefits and the association of CACFP participation with children’s 
26:641:54676:27:28:72:509:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nutrition-related outcomes.  Our results reveal that the CACFP program misses many poor 
26:642:54764:28:27:72:542:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children, and a sizable fraction of non-poor children participate in the program. Coverage of poor 
26:643:54863:27:28:72:523:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children is particularly limited at age two because over 80% of two-year olds are cared for by 
26:644:54958:28:28:72:538:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parents at home or in an unlicensed child care home, and family poverty rates are relatively high 
26:645:55056:28:27:72:514:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for two-year old children who are cared for in these settings.  The program reaches a higher 
26:646:55149:27:28:72:520:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of poor four-year olds because many poor children spend time in Head Start centers, 
26:647:55242:28:27:72:527:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where CACFP participation rates are nearly 100%, or in other participating centers.  Yet, poor 
26:648:55337:27:28:72:526:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children who are cared for in centers are much less likely to receive CACFP when they live in 
26:649:55431:28:0:72:533:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealthier areas than when they live in poorer areas, especially if they attend a for-profit center.  
27:650:55580:0:28:72:540:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Furthermore, even at four years, nearly 40% of children are cared for by parents at home or in an 
27:651:55678:28:27:72:516:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unlicensed child care home, and a relatively high proportion of children in these settings are 
27:652:55773:27:28:72:535:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poor.  Licensed family day care is notable because few children are cared for in these settings at 
27:653:55872:28:28:72:516:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:either two years or four years, and there is little variation in CACFP participation by family, 
27:654:55968:28:27:72:200:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provider, or area poverty.  
27:655:55996:27:28:108:537:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We also found that provider, family, and locational characteristics all affect participation 
27:656:56089:28:27:72:491:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in CACFP.  As noted, poor children who reside in low-income areas are more likely to 
27:657:56174:27:28:72:512:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participate in CACFP than poor children in wealthier areas.  CACFP participation is higher 
27:658:56265:28:28:72:509:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:among parents of lower socioeconomic status and whose children are in care more hours.   
27:659:56354:28:27:72:518:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Provider characteristics clearly matter. Large, licensed, accredited and non-profit centers are 
27:660:56450:27:28:72:528:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to participate, as are those connected to Head Start through referrals (or who serve 
27:661:56547:28:27:72:507:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:children who are also served by Head Start).  These results are broadly consistent with the 
27:662:56639:27:28:72:523:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conclusion reached by Currie (2006b) that standard transaction costs (and benefits) as well as 
27:663:56734:28:28:72:512:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:administrative burden importantly affect the take-up of social programs (though our results 
27:664:56826:28:27:72:327:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would also suggest a role for information networks). 
27:665:56879:27:28:108:539:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we found evidence that CACFP is associated with increased milk, vegetable, and 
27:666:56967:28:27:72:519:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(to some extent) fruit consumption and lower prevalence of underweight among low-income 
27:667:57055:27:28:72:510:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:four-year olds in centers.  The associations with milk, vegetables, and healthy weight were 
27:668:57147:28:28:72:499:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:robust to inclusion of detailed child, family and provider controls, including lagged milk 
27:669:57238:28:27:72:533:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and lagged food insecurity. The findings for milk persisted when we restricted the 
27:670:57333:27:28:72:528:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample to children in care full-time and to those not in care at age two.  We found no evidence 
27:671:57429:28:27:72:535:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that CACFP increased the prevalence of overweight among this group of four-year olds, and we 
27:672:57522:27:28:71:536:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also found no evidence for an association with child or household food insecurity. Evidence that 
27:673:57619:28:0:71:540:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the program may benefit participating children underscores the importance of the finding that the 
28:674:57765:0:28:72:364:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:program fails to reach a substantial portion of poor children. 
28:675:57828:28:27:108:534:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It is worth considering what the rationale might be for a nutrition redistribution program 
28:676:57919:27:28:72:528:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that does not reach all poor children, and that treats poor children differently depending on the 
28:677:58017:28:28:72:508:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics of their child care provider.  Considering how CACFP intersects with other 
28:678:58108:28:27:72:499:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nutritional and child care subsidy program is revealing in this regard.  Consider first that 
28:679:58201:27:28:72:502:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consuming food away from home in child care (including when meals are paid for by the 
28:680:58287:28:27:72:523:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:CACFP program) does not reduce eligibility for, or benefits from, other nutritional assistance 
28:681:58382:27:28:72:521:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:programs (such as Food Stamps/SNAP or WIC).  Whether this rule advances redistributional 
28:682:58471:28:28:72:526:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:objectives depends in part on the goals of the CACFP program, the economic incidence of the 
28:683:58563:28:27:72:536:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy, and the impact of the different food subsidy programs on food consumption. If CACFP 
28:684:58656:27:28:72:534:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is meant to subsidize meals consumed away from home by poor children, and Food Stamps and 
28:685:58746:28:27:72:514:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:WIC benefit amounts are set optimally, then Food Stamp or WIC benefits would have to be 
28:686:58834:27:28:72:504:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted downward if CACFP raises children’s food consumption.9  On the other hand, if 
28:687:58921:28:28:71:535:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:CACFP is meant to augment inadequate levels of Food Stamps and WIC benefits, then it would 
28:688:59012:28:27:71:533:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be more efficient to raise the benefit amounts in those programs to an adequate level, or, failing 
28:689:59111:27:28:71:534:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that, to make all low-income children eligible for CACFP, regardless of provider characteristics 
28:690:59208:28:27:71:517:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(including poor children cared for in their own homes).  A third possibility is that CACFP is 
28:691:59302:27:28:71:536:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conditioned on care outside the home because it is intended to reward employment by offsetting 
28:692:59397:28:28:71:532:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:costs to families associated with holding a job, the most important of which are child care costs 
28:693:59495:28:7:71:219:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
28:694:59543:7:18:72:527:172:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:9 Anecdotal evidence suggests that most providers supply meals, rather than having parents send meals 
28:695:59645:18:13:72:530:154:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:with children, and our data shows that 95 percent or more of providers report serving meals and snacks. 
28:696:59749:13:12:72:520:141:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:Thus, Food Stamps and WIC benefits must cover fewer of the families’ total food consumption when 
28:697:59846:12:13:72:532:129:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:children are in child care.  Providers might include meal costs in fees. But, families will not directly pay 
28:698:59955:13:13:72:523:116:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:these fees if their care is covered by CCDF child care subsidies, thus they are effectively better off (in 
28:699:60062:13:12:72:526:103:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:terms of total food subsidies) than comparable families whose children are not in care.  And, if they do 
28:700:60167:12:13:72:526:91:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:pay the fees directly, including the child’s meal costs, then they are left with less fungible income than 
28:701:60274:13:13:72:535:78:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:they would be if more food subsidies went directly to the provider (since Food Stamps and WIC must be 
28:702:60376:13:0:72:310:65:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:spent on foods, and a limited bundle of foods at that). 
29:703:60480:0:28:72:535:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and the implicit tax on earnings inherent in means-testing benefits.  Nonetheless, if other means-
29:704:60578:28:27:72:522:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tested nutritional assistance benefits are set optimally, it would be more efficient to use direct 
29:705:60677:27:28:71:529:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(cash) subsidies to child care to promote employment of the poor, rather than link eligibility to 
29:706:60775:28:28:72:452:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provider characteristics or characteristics of other children in the care setting.   
29:707:60860:28:27:108:526:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It is also worth considering the rationale for more stringent eligibility requirements for 
29:708:60951:27:28:72:526:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for-profit than non-profit centers. One possibility is that these different payment schedules are 
29:709:61049:28:27:72:541:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intended as a crude quality-adjustment of the subsidy (see, e.g., Blau 2001) under the assumption 
29:710:61147:27:28:72:527:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that non-profit centers are of higher quality, on average, than for-profit centers (Cleveland and 
29:711:61245:28:28:72:525:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Krashinsky 2009).  Policymakers might similarly have made eligibility criteria more stringent 
29:712:61339:28:27:72:534:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:among for-profit centers out of concern that for-profit centers are more likely to use the subsidy 
29:713:61438:27:28:72:518:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to increase profit rather than to increase the quality of care.  However, even if quality of non-
29:714:61535:28:27:72:531:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:profit centers is higher, on average, because there is substantial variation in quality within each 
29:715:61635:27:28:72:528:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sector, it would be more efficient to target quality directly with quality-adjusted subsidies than 
29:716:61734:28:28:72:533:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with a nutritional subsidy that is higher for care in the non-profit sector.  States are increasingly 
29:717:61836:28:27:72:507:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adopting Quality Rating and Improvement Systems to provide such tiered reimbursement, 
29:718:61922:27:28:72:510:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:although they have not been rigorously evaluated (National Child Care Information Center 
29:719:62011:28:27:72:106:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2009). 
29:720:62018:27:28:108:513:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Policymakers may similarly have excluded license-exempt homes from the national

29:722:62194:28:27:72:538:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:receive public subsidy. This practice would be in contrast to federal policy in the Child Care and 
29:723:62293:27:28:72:510:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Development Fund (CCDF) which provides general child care subsidies.  In the 1980s and 
29:724:62380:28:27:72:541:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1990s, the CCDF program moved increasingly toward reimbursing whatever type of care parents 
29:725:62472:27:28:72:530:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choose, including license-exempt care (Kahn and Kamerman 1987; U.S. Department of Health 
29:726:62561:28:0:72:542:69:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Human Services 2009).  Nationally, one-quarter of children who receive CCDF subsidies are 
30:727:62703:0:28:72:530:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in license-exempt care; in some states as many as two-thirds are in such care (U.S. Department

30:729:62894:27:28:72:508:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may reflect a combination of a preference for supporting parental choice, a need to rapidly 
30:730:62986:28:28:72:508:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase the supply of care when the welfare reforms of the 1990s required parents to seek 
30:731:63077:28:27:72:521:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employment, and evidence that small home-based and unregulated settings are not inferior to 
30:732:63169:27:28:72:507:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:licensed settings, at least according to some definitions of quality (such as the warmth and 
30:733:63262:28:27:72:531:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sensitivity of caregivers to infants and toddlers, NICHD 1996; and flexibility to parental needs, 
30:734:63360:27:28:72:519:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:but not developmental quality, Li-Grining, and Coley 2006).  Whatever the impetus, the two 
30:735:63451:28:28:72:523:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies (food subsidy and general subsidy) for child care differ in this respect.  It is also the 
30:736:63551:28:27:72:507:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:case that if the general child care subsidy were set optimally, an additional child care food 
30:737:63645:27:28:72:522:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy would be inefficient.10 If the general subsidy is too low, it would be more efficient to 
30:738:63742:28:27:72:521:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase it than to have a separate food subsidy (unless perhaps the food subsidy’s nutritional 
30:739:63838:27:28:72:535:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:training and menu requirements are effective in increasing the nutritional quality of food, which 
30:740:63936:28:28:72:239:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:our results suggest they may be).   
30:741:63972:28:27:108:542:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:State child care regulations often include nutritional standards that states use to attempt to 
30:742:64067:27:28:72:518:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:improve nutrition in licensed settings.  In a review of state regulations Sara E. Benjamin and 
30:743:64162:28:27:72:514:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:colleagues (2009) found that 10 states’ regulations for centers and 27 states’ regulations for 
30:744:64257:27:28:72:492:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:homes included none of the standards recommended by the National Health and Safety 
30:745:64340:28:28:72:492:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Performance Standards.  A related review found that fewer than 10 states limited sugar 
30:746:64427:28:27:72:499:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sweetened beverages and foods of low nutritional value in child care licensing standards

30:749:64589:8:17:72:519:116:49:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:10 CCDF reimbursement rates are set by states.  Federal guidelines require states to regularly conduct 
30:750:64692:17:13:71:542:99:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:market rate surveys and recommend that reimbursement rates be 75th percentile of market rates.  The most 
30:751:64797:13:13:71:522:86:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:recent state plans indicate that half the states set their reimbursement rates below this benchmark, and 
30:752:64902:13:0:71:527:73:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:rates range from the 10th to the 85th percentile (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2009).  
31:753:65053:0:28:108:538:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, the CACFP eligibility and benefit rules result in some undesirable efficiency and 
31:754:65143:28:27:71:519:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equity properties because equity criteria (especially poverty reduction) would require greater 
31:755:65238:27:28:71:526:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:targeting of poor children and less reliance on provider characteristics, and because efficiency 
31:756:65335:28:28:71:530:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would be enhanced either by using direct, cash child care subsidies (possibly quality-adjusted), 
31:757:65432:28:27:71:515:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by increasing nutritional assistance through the Food Stamps or WIC programs, or by states 
31:758:65523:27:28:71:530:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increasing the nutritional requirements in child care licensing standards.  Still, political support 
31:759:65624:28:27:71:534:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may be greater for a nutritional subsidy than a cash subsidy, or for a subsidy to child care rather 
31:760:65724:27:28:71:445:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than one that would also benefit poor families that care for children at home.  
31:761:65804:28:28:107:516:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We are left with the conclusion that the structure of the CACFP program most likely 
31:762:65888:28:28:71:328:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reflects a compromise among multiple goals such as: 
31:763:65940:28:29:89:330:427:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f3:A: provide nutritional assistance to poor children 
31:764:65989:29:28:89:351:398:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f3:A: promote employment among low-income families 
31:765:66035:28:28:89:521:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f3:A: support care providers who have low incomes or who serve low-income communities 
31:766:66116:28:28:89:355:342:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f3:A: provide greater support to higher quality child care 
31:767:66170:28:28:71:490:314:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Different individuals will attach different weights to each of these goals. More explicit 
31:768:66260:28:27:71:517:286:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consideration and agreement about any or a subset of these goals might lead to an assistance 
31:769:66353:27:28:71:509:259:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:program that achieved distributional objectives more efficiently. The results for child food 
31:770:66446:28:27:71:542:231:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and healthy weight that we present provide some evidence that the first (nutritional) 
31:771:66544:27:28:71:530:204:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:goal may be met to some degree (although additional research is needed to replicate this result, 
31:772:66641:28:28:71:521:176:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ideally with a stronger causal design).  The evidence on program coverage we present should 
31:773:66733:28:27:71:511:148:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:help policymakers and analysts understand who is and is not being served by CACFP, and, 
31:774:66821:27:0:71:507:121:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, to suggest the trade-offs in attempting to reach the full range of possible goals.

45:1406:106413:27:28:71:538:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research has found that nearly three-quarters of Tier I providers are determined eligible based on 
45:1407:106512:28:28:72:538:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:local school data (Gordon et al. 2008).  We merged National Center for Education Statistics data

46:1412:107031:0:28:72:537:704:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:size, we approximated provider eligibility based on whether the provider’s income was above or
