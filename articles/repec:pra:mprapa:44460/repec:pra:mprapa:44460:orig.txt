2:31:617:12:12:122:536:461:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Argentina  for  different  typologies  of  property  crimes  and  crimes  against  person.  We 
2:32:712:12:12:122:533:449:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:employ  a  panel  of  Argentinean  regions  over  the  years  2000-2008.  Our  econometric

2:34:893:12:11:122:536:425:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The results give evidence that unemployment has a positive and significant effect on total 
2:35:984:11:12:122:533:414:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and property crimes but its impact depends on the typology of the offense. However it has 
2:36:1074:12:12:122:533:402:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:no  effect  on  crimes  against  person.  The  importance and  the  sign  of  Income  per  capita 
2:37:1172:12:12:122:533:390:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:depend on the typology of the crime.  Income inequality proved to be less important when 
2:38:1261:12:12:122:533:378:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:explaining property crimes and crimes against person. The deterrence effects proxied by

2:45:1630:12:12:122:533:294:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:utiliza   un   panel   de   provincias   argentinas   en   el   período   2000-2008.      El   método

2:48:1911:12:12:122:533:259:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:y su impacto depende de la tipología del delito. Sin embargo no tiene ningún efecto sobre

3:61:2484:12:12:105:108:691:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7: 
3:62:2484:12:12:105:533:679:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Since  the  seminal  work  by  Becker  (1968)  that  provided  the  first  economic  theory  of  crime, 
3:63:2588:12:12:105:533:667:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:many  works  have  been  devoted  to  the  study  of  criminal  behavior.  His  paper  explains  how 
3:64:2689:12:12:105:536:655:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:changes  in  the  probability  and  severity  of  punishment  can  alter  the  individual’s  decision  to 
3:65:2795:12:12:105:533:643:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:commit  crime.  Later,  Ehrlich  (1973)  extended  the  Becker’s  model  by  considering  how 
3:66:2889:12:12:105:533:631:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:individuals divide  their  time between  legal  and  illegal  activities. If legal  income opportunities 
3:67:2994:12:12:105:533:619:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:are  scarce  relative  to  the  potential  benefits  of  crime,  people  allocate  more  time  to  illegal 
3:68:3101:12:11:105:304:607:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:activities and crime is more likely to occur.

3:105:5695:12:12:105:533:168:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:was not until the seminal paper of Gary Becker in 1968 that the first models of economics of

4:117:6476:12:12:105:533:680:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:macroeconomic  effect  of  environment  which  generates  an  atmosphere  prone  to  crime, 
4:118:6568:12:12:105:533:668:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:measured  by  variables  such  as  the  unemployment  rate,  income  per  capita,  income  growth, 
4:119:6667:12:12:105:374:656:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:inequality in income distribution, education, among others. 
4:120:6727:12:12:105:108:644:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
4:121:6727:12:12:105:533:632:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:As  discussed  in  Cantor  and    Land  (1985)  there  is  a controversy  regarding  the  relationship 
4:122:6830:12:11:105:533:620:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:between economic growth and crime. There are two different types of effect: motivation effect 
4:123:6924:11:12:105:533:609:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and  opportunity  effect.  The  first  one  refers  to  the  incentive  to  commit  crime  based  on  bad 
4:124:7030:12:12:105:533:597:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:economic  conditions.  Hence,  during  recessions,  individuals  increase  crime  participation  in 
4:125:7130:12:12:105:533:585:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:order to increase their income. The second one works in the opposite way: the opportunities 
4:126:7222:12:12:105:533:573:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:to  commit  crime  increase  along  with  the  economic  performance2.  (See  Dettoto  and  Otranto 
4:127:7322:12:12:105:140:561:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:2011).  
4:128:7330:12:12:105:108:549:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
4:129:7330:12:12:105:533:537:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:It  is  worth  noting  that  the  impact  of  opportunity  and  motivational  effect  can  be  different 
4:130:7435:12:11:105:533:525:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:depending  on  the  crime  typology  under  study.  For  instance,  property  crimes  can  be  more 
4:131:7535:11:12:105:535:514:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:affected by motivation effects that imply a negative correlation with the economic fluctuations. 
4:132:7632:12:12:105:108:502:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
4:133:7632:12:12:105:533:490:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:So the expected sign of GDP per capita and its growth is ambiguous. In this context, it could 
4:134:7726:12:12:105:533:478:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:be more appropriate the use of relative deprivation indicators (GINI coefficient). The effect of 
4:135:7823:12:12:105:533:466:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f8:inequality on crime is expected to be negative, since as Adam Smith noted “The affluence of 
4:136:7915:12:12:105:533:454:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted 
4:137:8009:12:12:105:275:442:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:by envy, to invade his possessions”3

4:139:8045:12:12:105:533:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:There are numerous studies on the relationship between crime and inequality. Many of these 
4:140:8136:12:11:105:533:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:studies find that relative income impacts on crime (see Fajnzylber et al., 2002, Brush, 2007; 
4:141:8230:11:12:105:533:395:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Choe,  2008,  Cerro  and  Meloni,  2001). However  other  works  fail  to  find  a  robust  effect  of 
4:142:8331:12:12:105:346:383:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:inequality on crime (for instance, Neumayer, 2004).

4:146:8575:12:12:105:533:335:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Unemployment, as it limits the rate of return of legal activities, is expected to increase illegal 
4:147:8674:12:11:105:533:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:activities.  However,  studies  on  the  relationship  between  crime  and  unemployment  conclude 
4:148:8773:11:12:105:533:312:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:that  the  effect  of  unemployment  on  crime  is  ambiguous and appears  to be very  sensitive to 
4:149:8873:12:12:105:533:300:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:econometric  specification.  Freeman  (1994)  and  Imrohoroglu  et  al  (2001)  research  support 
4:150:8971:12:12:105:533:288:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:this finding. Freeman (1994) and Maciandaro (1999) set that the effect of job market on crime 
4:151:9065:12:12:105:533:276:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:may  be  studied  through  time  series,  cross  section  and  economic  characteristic  across 
4:152:9161:12:12:105:534:264:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:people.  Depending  on  the  type  of  study  performed  it  is  likely  to  obtain  different  results  (for 
4:153:9271:12:12:105:536:252:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:instance, Witt et al (1998), Marselli and Vannini (2000). For Argentina, Cerro and Rodriguez

4:158:9603:12:12:105:528:192:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:endogeneity  of  the  probability  of  arrest,  GDP  pc,  and  education  have  a  positive  effect  on 
4:159:9707:12:11:105:369:180:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:criminal activities, while unemployment is not significant.  
4:160:9768:11:12:105:533:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The expected signs of deterrence variables are negative since they represent a cost to those 
4:161:9861:12:12:105:533:157:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:who  commit  crimes.  Therefore, as  the  rate  of  sentence and  conviction  increases,  the  crime 
4:162:9962:12:12:105:533:145:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:rate is expected to decrease, ceteris paribus. This effect is well documented for the US and 
4:163:10055:12:18:105:533:133:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Europe (Levitt, 1998; Edmark, 2005; Entorf and Spengler, 2000). For Argentina, Di Tella and

5:191:12120:12:12:105:533:442:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Argentina  is  a  country  characterized  by  huge  volatility  in  its  economic  activity  and  in  its 
5:192:12226:12:12:105:533:430:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:judicial system. Analyzing the rate of crime in Argentina, we can identify different periods, that 
5:193:12325:12:12:105:533:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:lead  us  think  that  deterrence  and  macroeconomic  effect  are  both  very  important  to  explain 
5:194:12428:12:11:105:139:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:crime.  
5:195:12436:11:12:105:108:395:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
5:196:12436:12:12:105:533:383:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:At the beginning of the 80’s, Argentina crime rate was very low. The deterrence effect might 
5:197:12529:12:12:105:533:371:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:have  been  strong, given  that  the  country  was  under a  Military  Government  regime,  and  the 
5:198:12630:12:12:105:288:359:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Constitutional Rights were not in force.

5:200:12672:12:12:105:533:335:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In 1983, with the upcoming of democracy, important modifications took place in the Criminal 
5:201:12764:12:11:105:533:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Code (especially to laws 11179, 23050 and 23057 and in 1984 the law 23077 was enacted) 
5:202:12851:11:12:105:533:312:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and in the Criminal Code Procedures (law 2372)  that implied considerable reductions in the 
5:203:12943:12:12:105:533:300:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:punishment  to  criminal  activities.  Consequently  with  these  modifications  we  see  sustained 
5:204:13043:12:12:105:232:288:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:increases in the crime rate.

5:206:13072:12:12:105:533:264:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Despite  the  huge  economic  recovery  after  2001 crisis,  the  crime  rate  keeps high,  and even 
5:207:13173:12:12:105:533:252:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:increasing in  the  last  years4. We  conjecture  that a  decreasing  deterrence effect  might  have 
5:208:13274:12:12:105:534:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:been  responsible,  partially,  for  that.  Even  thought  since  1984  there  were  no  considerable 
5:209:13376:12:12:105:533:228:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:modifications  in  the  Criminal Code,  a  new  jurisprudential  wave  upsurge,  which  aims  to  limit

5:212:13534:12:12:105:533:192:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:According  to official  statistics, the reported crime rate in Argentina increased 312.6 % in the 
5:213:13632:12:11:105:533:180:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:period  that  span  from  1980  to  2008,  i.e.,  it  increased  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  5.2%. 
5:214:13738:11:12:105:533:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:However the growth rate was not smooth during the whole period. During the two deep crises

5:216:13930:12:12:105:526:145:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:faster, and reached peaks of 202 crimes per 10000 inhabitants in 1989 and of 358 in 2002.

12:586:26269:12:12:105:477:195:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:increase along with the economic performance. (see Dettoto and Otranto 2011).

12:588:26348:12:12:105:533:171:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:It  is  worth  noting  that  the  impact  of  opportunity  and  motivational  effect  can  be  different 
12:589:26453:12:12:105:533:159:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:depending  on  the  crime  typology  under  study.  For  instance,  property  crimes  can  be  more 
12:590:26553:12:12:105:535:147:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:affected by motivation effects that imply a negative correlation with the economic fluctuations.

12:592:26650:11:12:105:536:124:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We can also include other variables that measure socio economic conditions such as level of 
12:593:26742:12:12:105:533:112:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:education  and  mortality  rates.  These variables differ  significantly  among provinces,  but  they 
12:594:26844:12:12:105:433:100:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:do no vary much over time, so they can be captured by the fixed effect.

13:611:27539:12:12:105:533:549:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:From  an  econometric  perspective,  there  might  be  several  methodological  problems  which 
13:612:27635:12:12:105:533:537:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:might arise in estimating these empirical models. First using a panel data approach, it is well 
13:613:27731:12:11:105:533:525:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:known  that  OLS  coefficients  are  biased  as  they  ignore  the  presence  of  unobservable 
13:614:27826:11:12:105:534:514:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:individual effects. Second, we also include lagged values of crime rate, in this context, OLS 
13:615:27920:12:12:105:533:502:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:results  in  inconsistent  estimates.  Third,  it  is  very  unlikely  that  our  regressors  are  strictly 
13:616:28028:12:12:105:533:490:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:exogenous:   the   relationship   between   crime   and   its   socioeconomic   factors   is   often 
13:617:28129:12:12:105:533:478:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:characterized by two way causality. Fourth, crime rates are measured with error which might 
13:618:28221:12:12:105:225:466:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:lead to biased estimates.  
13:619:28248:12:12:105:108:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
13:620:28248:12:12:105:533:442:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: Here we opt for the ‘system’ Generalized Method of Moments estimator (henceforth, ‘system 
13:621:28339:12:12:105:533:430:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:GMM’) proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995) . This estimator is designed for dynamic panel 
13:622:28430:12:12:105:533:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:data  models.  The  Arellano  and  Bond  estimator  can  perform  poorly  if  the  autoregressive 
13:623:28528:12:11:105:533:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:parameters are too large or the ratio of the variance of the panel-level effect to the variance 
13:624:28624:11:12:105:533:395:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of idiosyncratic error is too large. Building on the work of Arellano and Bover (1995), Blundell 
13:625:28721:12:12:105:533:383:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and Bond (1998) developed a system estimator that uses additional moment conditions. (see 
13:626:28811:12:12:105:533:371:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Bond 2002). This estimator is designed for datasets with many panels and few periods. This 
13:627:28902:12:12:105:533:359:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:method assumes that there is no autocorrelation in the idiosyncratic  errors and requires the 
13:628:28996:12:12:105:536:347:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:initial condition that the panel-level effects be uncorrelated with the first difference of the first

13:634:29434:12:12:105:533:276:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:hypothesis  of  second  order  autocorrelation  so  as  to  conclude  that  lagged  values  of  the 
13:635:29534:12:12:105:533:264:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:endogenous variables are valid instruments). Finally,  we report the p-values of the standard 
13:636:29628:12:12:105:533:252:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions (the null hypothesis is that the instruments used by

17:694:35671:12:12:105:505:680:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The  results  obtained  for  Property  Crime  Rate  as  dependent  variable  is  shown  in 
17:695:35762:12:12:105:508:668:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Column 2, Table 4. The main difference with the results obtained for the total crime rate 
17:696:35852:12:12:105:505:656:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:is  that  the  coefficient  of  Unemployment  Rate  becomes  larger  (it  comes  from  0.076  to 
17:697:35949:12:12:105:505:644:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:0.157), while GDP pc and Gini coefficient are not significant. For property crime rates, 
17:698:36038:12:12:105:505:632:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:unemployment  is  twice  as  important  as  for  total  crime  rates  explanation,  while  the 
17:699:36133:12:11:105:505:620:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:difference  in  economic  activity  and/or  differences in  income  distribution  are  less 
17:700:36225:11:12:105:505:609:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:important.  On  the  other  hand  GDP  growth  is  negative  and  significant,  meaning  that 
17:701:36319:12:12:105:505:597:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:motivation  effect  dominates  opportunity  effect  as  expected.  The  inertia  effect  is  also 
17:702:36417:12:12:105:179:585:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:very significant. 
17:703:36435:12:12:105:505:573:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The  results  of  Sargan  and  Arellano-Bond  tests  are  similar  to  those  obtained  for  the 
17:704:36532:12:12:105:505:561:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:former  model,  so  the  same  comment  applies:  the  instruments  are  correct  and 
17:705:36618:12:12:105:384:549:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:autocorrelation AR(1) is not a problem for GMM estimations.

17:709:36731:12:12:105:505:502:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The  results  for  these  typologies  of  crimes  as  dependent  variables  are  presented  in

17:711:36857:12:12:105:108:478:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
17:712:36857:12:12:105:505:466:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:First, for  property crimes, results are very  robust to the period considered; magnitude, 
17:713:36948:12:12:105:504:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:sign   and   significance   of   the   parameters   estimated   are   almost   identical   when 
17:714:37044:12:12:105:349:442:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:considered both periods, 1990-2008 and 2000-2008. 
17:715:37094:12:12:105:108:430:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
17:716:37094:12:12:105:505:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Second,  the  inertia  effect  measured  by  the  lagged  dependent  variables  is  far  smaller 
17:717:37191:12:11:105:505:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:than  in  aggregate  property  crime,  with  a  value  of  0.13,  0.229  and  0.036  for  theft, 
17:718:37288:11:12:105:505:395:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:robberies  and  other  crimes  respectively,  probably  since  more  disaggregate  type  of 
17:719:37380:12:12:105:444:383:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:crimes are better explained by socio economic and deterrence variables.  
17:720:37453:12:12:105:108:371:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
17:721:37453:12:12:105:505:359:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Third,  GDP  growth  coefficient is  positive and  significant in  the case  of theft and  other 
17:722:37550:12:12:105:505:347:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:crimes,  indicating  that  the  opportunity  effect  dominates  over  motivation  effect.  For 
17:723:37645:12:12:105:484:335:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:robberies, that coefficient becomes negative and significant, as in property crimes. 
17:724:37730:12:11:105:108:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
17:725:37730:11:12:105:508:312:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Fourth,  unemployment  rate  is  significant  and  positive  both  for  theft  and  robberies. 
17:726:37825:12:12:105:505:300:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Notice  that  the  effect  of  unemployment  on  crime  is twice  as  much  as  in  theft,  with  a 
17:727:37925:12:12:105:297:288:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:value of 0.127, than in robberies ( 0,059). 
17:728:37969:12:12:105:108:276:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
17:729:37969:12:12:105:505:264:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Gini  coefficient,  which  is  a  measure  of  income  distribution,  is  positive  for  the  three 
17:730:38069:12:12:105:505:252:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:types of property crimes considered, and significant for thefts and robberies, indicating 
17:731:38159:12:12:105:505:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:that  the  worst  income  distribution,  the  higher  property  crimes  will  be.  The  effect  is 
17:732:38258:12:12:105:505:228:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:greater  for  theft  than  for  robberies:  a  deterioration  of  10%  in  income  distribution  will 
17:733:38360:12:12:105:508:216:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:increase  thefts  in  11%,  while  robberies  4.87%.  This  fact  jointly  with  the  coefficient  of 
17:734:38462:12:12:105:505:204:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:unemployment  seems  to  indicate  that  socio  economic conditions  are  more  important 
17:735:38552:12:12:105:505:192:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:for  theft  than  for  robberies,  possibly  because  those  who  commit  thefts  are  eventual 
17:736:38648:12:11:105:496:180:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:thieves, less specialized and consequently more dependent on economic conditions. 
17:737:38730:11:12:105:108:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
17:738:38730:12:12:105:505:157:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Deterrence effect, measured by arrest and sentence rate, is significant and negative for 
17:739:38819:12:12:105:508:145:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:both  theft and  robbery,  being  the effect  of  arrest stronger  than  the  effect  of  sentence. 
17:740:38919:12:12:105:505:133:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:These  results  point  to  the  relevance  of  both  police  and  judicial  performance  in  the 
17:741:39016:12:12:105:200:121:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:deterrence of crime.

17:743:39037:12:12:105:505:97:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:For  theft,  robberies  and  other  property  crimes  estimations,  the  results  of  Sargan  and 
17:744:39135:12:11:105:505:85:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Arellano-Bond  tests  indicates  that  the  instruments are  correct  and  autocorrelation 
17:745:39226:11:0:105:313:74:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:AR(1) is not a problem for GMM estimations.

18:751:39389:12:12:105:505:656:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:presented in Table 5, first column. The dependent variable lagged once is capturing the 
18:752:39477:12:12:105:316:644:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:inertia effect, and it is positive and significant.

18:754:39528:12:11:105:505:620:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:GDP  pc  has  a  positive  and  significant  effect,  possibly  since    crimes  against  person 
18:755:39625:11:12:105:505:609:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:include  traffic  fatalities,  whose  participation  has  increased  pari  pasu  with  the  huge 
18:756:39722:12:12:105:505:597:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:increase in fleet. At the same time, the increase in fleet has been higher in regions with 
18:757:39813:12:12:105:505:585:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:higher  GDP  pc.  GDP  growth  is  also  positive  and  significant.  A  similar  explanation 
18:758:39907:12:12:105:505:573:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:holds,  but  GDP  growth  is  measuring  mainly  the  effect  on  time.  Unemployment,  Gini 
18:759:40000:12:12:105:341:561:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:coefficient and cycle are not statistically significant.

18:767:40169:12:12:105:505:466:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Murder  has  a very low  participation in  crime against persons, just 0.8%, but generally 
18:768:40260:12:12:105:505:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:are much sounded crimes due to its severity. Results are presented in table 4, second

18:771:40364:12:12:105:505:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We  find  that  unemployment  rate  is  not  significant  in  the  explanation  of  murder.  The 
18:772:40461:12:11:105:505:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:deterrence  effect,  measured  by  the  probability  of  arrest  and  sentence,  is  always

18:776:40679:12:12:105:505:359:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:murder,  meaning  that  murder  behaves  contracyclically,  ie,  it  increases  in  recessions 
18:777:40774:12:12:105:505:347:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and   decreases   in  expansion,   consistently   with   what we   observed   in   Graph  4. 
18:778:40867:12:12:105:505:335:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Additionally it increases in regions with lower GDP pc, indicating that murder is related

18:788:41206:12:12:105:505:216:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This paper examines the effect of socioeconomic variables on crime aggregate and for 
18:789:41291:12:12:105:505:204:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:different  typologies  of  crime  in  Argentina  over  the  period  1980-2008  and  subperiods. 
18:790:41387:12:12:105:505:192:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:For that purpose we use regional data at province level and estimate a dynamic panel 
18:791:41472:12:11:105:505:180:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:data  model  by  using  the  Generalized  Method  of  Moments  (GMM)  developed  by 
18:792:41556:11:12:105:357:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Arellano and Bover (1995), Blundell and Bond (1998).

18:794:41610:12:12:105:505:145:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We found that socio economic effect is very  important in explaining crime. The impact 
18:795:41697:12:12:105:505:133:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and  the  significance  of  the  different  explanatory  variables  depend  on  the  category  of 
18:796:41795:12:12:105:136:121:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:crime.

18:799:41850:7:15:105:502:84:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:8 In this case, sentence rate is measured as the ratio between sentence and crimes against person, since we 
18:800:41958:15:0:105:205:69:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:do not have data of arrest. 
19:801:41988:0:12:105:505:716:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We  analyzed  total  crime  rate,  property  crime  rate: composed  by  theft,  robberies  and

19:803:42174:12:12:105:505:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:accounted  for  different  categories  of  crime  in  order  to  avoid  the  aggregation  bias 
19:804:42269:12:12:105:217:680:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:(Cherry and List, 2002). 
19:805:42294:12:12:105:108:668:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
19:806:42294:12:12:105:505:656:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The inertia effect, measured by the lagged dependent variable, is always positive and 
19:807:42380:12:12:105:505:644:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:significant,  but  the  magnitude  depends  on  the  categories of  crime. It indicates  that an 
19:808:42477:12:12:105:474:632:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:increase in the rate of crime today will increase the crime rate in the next period. 
19:809:42562:12:11:105:108:620:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
19:810:42562:11:12:105:505:609:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:GDP per capita has a positive effect on total and property crime, but it is not significant 
19:811:42654:12:12:105:505:597:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:in the last case. It indicates that those provinces with higher GDP per capita presents 
19:812:42742:12:12:105:505:585:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:better  opportunities  for  those  committing  crimes,  increasing  the  crime  rate,  so  the 
19:813:42837:12:12:105:505:573:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:opportunity  effect  dominates  over  motivation  effect  across  provinces.  The  effect  of 
19:814:42931:12:12:105:505:561:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:GDP pc is also positive on crimes against person, possibly because this crime includes 
19:815:43018:12:12:105:505:549:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:traffic fatalities that have been increasing with the increase in fleet, especially in those 
19:816:43111:12:12:105:505:537:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:provinces  with  higher  GDP  pc.  The  sign  of  this  variable  in  the  case  of  murder  is 
19:817:43207:12:11:105:498:525:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:negative; indicating that those regions with lower GDP pc have higher rate of murder. 
19:818:43293:11:12:105:108:514:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
19:819:43293:12:12:105:508:502:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:GDP  growth  captures  the  effect  of  economic  growth  on  crime  rates,effect.  It  is 
19:820:43384:12:12:105:505:490:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:negatively  associated  to property  crimes and  robberies,  but positively  with  theft, other 
19:821:43480:12:12:105:505:478:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:property  crimes  and  crimes  against  person.  In  the former  motivation  effect dominates 
19:822:43574:12:12:105:505:466:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:over  opportunity  effect  along  time,  as  expected.  The  reverse  is  true  for  theft.  In  the 
19:823:43675:12:12:105:505:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:case  of  crime  against  persons  it  may  be  capturing  (similar  to  GDP  pc)  the  positive 
19:824:43772:12:12:105:505:442:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:association  between  GDP  growth  and  traffic  fatalities  growth,  mainly  due  to  fleet 
19:825:43865:12:12:105:142:430:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:growth. 
19:826:43873:12:12:105:108:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
19:827:43873:12:11:105:505:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:On the other hand, unemployment rate, that may be interpreted as the opportunity cost 
19:828:43959:11:12:105:505:395:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of being in legal rather than illegal activities, is always positive and significant (with the 
19:829:44054:12:12:105:505:383:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:sole exception of other property crimes) in total and property crimes, indicating that the 
19:830:44145:12:12:105:505:371:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:higher  the  unemployment  rate  is,  ie  the  less  the  opportunity  cost  of  being  in  illegal 
19:831:44245:12:12:105:505:359:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:activities, the higher the crime rate will be, as expected.  The magnitude of the effect on 
19:832:44337:12:12:105:505:347:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:crime depends on the typology of crime. It varies from 0.059 to 0.158, being higher for 
19:833:44425:12:12:105:505:335:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:property  crime  rate  and  theft  than  for  other  type  of  crimes.  Thefts  depend  more  on 
19:834:44522:12:11:105:505:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:motivation than on opportunities. In crimes against person and murder this coefficient is 
19:835:44612:11:12:105:174:312:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:not significant. 
19:836:44629:12:12:105:108:300:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
19:837:44629:12:12:105:505:288:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, is always  positive, but not always 
19:838:44718:12:12:105:505:276:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:significant,  meaning  that  those  provinces  with  worst  income  distribution  have  higher 
19:839:44813:12:12:105:423:264:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:rates of crime, both for property crime and for crimes against person.

19:842:44974:12:12:105:505:228:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:negative  and  significance,  indicating  that  is  a  cost  for  those  who  commit  crimes.  The 
19:843:45073:12:12:105:505:216:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:higher  the  arrest  rate  is, that  depends  on  policy  performance,  and  the  sentence  rate, 
19:844:45171:12:12:105:398:204:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:that depends on judicial performance, the less is the crime rate.

19:846:45237:12:11:105:505:180:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In conclusion: a) Socio Economic Variables are very important in explaining crimes, but 
19:847:45325:11:12:105:505:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:their  sign  and  magnitude  depend  on  the  typology  of crime.  Surprisingly  murder  also 
19:848:45419:12:12:105:505:157:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:depends  on  socio  economic  conditions.  b)  Deterrence  effect is  always  significant  and 
19:849:45514:12:12:105:314:145:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:negative, independently on the type of crime.
