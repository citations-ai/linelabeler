2:31:465:12:13:82:85:375:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7: 
2:32:465:13:12:82:515:362:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:After an impressive 12 point reduction in Peruvian monetary poverty, questions have been raised 
2:33:561:12:13:82:512:350:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:about  the  extent  in  which  these  figures  mask  deprivation  in  several  other  aspects  critical  for 
2:34:670:13:13:82:513:337:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:human development. We propose using the Alkire-Foster multidimensional headcount to address 
2:35:762:13:12:82:513:324:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:this  issue,  and  devise  a  simple  comparison  framework  to  measure  the  tension  between  the 
2:36:863:12:13:82:513:312:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:incidence of monetary poverty and the overall level of deprivation based on the multidimensional 
2:37:960:13:12:82:513:299:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measure.  We  select  six  dimensions  and  their  respective  indicators  for  the  Peruvian  case,  and 
2:38:1066:12:13:82:513:287:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:apply  this  framework  using  data  for  2004  and  2008. Results  indicate  that  we  now  face  a  larger 
2:39:1175:13:13:82:513:274:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:risk  of  classifying  as  non-poor individuals  who  still  endure  significant  deprivation  if  we  rely  on 
2:40:1287:13:12:82:512:261:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the conventional monetary dimension. In addition, inter and intraregional comparisons show that 
2:41:1383:12:13:82:513:249:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:deprivations  endured  by  the  multidimensional  poor  are  similar  across  regions  and  concentrated 
2:42:1488:13:13:82:513:236:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on the health and dwelling conditions dimensions, in particular, on the lack of adequate water and 
2:43:1587:13:13:82:501:223:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sanitation services. This last result reveals an opportunity to focalize public investment efforts.

3:50:1748:0:15:82:297:755:16:g_d0_f6:16:g_d0_f6:1. Introduction and motivation 
3:51:1779:15:13:82:85:740:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
3:52:1779:13:14:82:462:727:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Official poverty figures in Peru reveal an impressive reduction of more than 12 
3:53:1859:14:14:82:469:713:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:percentage points in four years. In fact, the incidence of moderate (as opposed to 
3:54:1942:14:14:82:498:699:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:extreme) poverty1 fell from 48.6% in 2004 down to 36.2% in 2008. While government 
3:55:2024:14:14:82:510:685:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:officials rushed to praise the achievements of social programs, others, more sceptic about 
3:56:2115:14:13:82:477:671:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the effectiveness of social policy interventions, highlighted the equally impressive 
3:57:2200:13:14:82:475:658:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:economic expansion experienced between those years (per capita GDP grew at an 
3:58:2278:14:14:82:194:644:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:average rate of 7.1%).  
3:59:2302:14:14:82:85:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
3:60:2302:14:14:82:478:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It is not difficult to observe a sharp decline in monetary poverty indexes while the 
3:61:2387:14:13:82:499:602:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:economy is booming. In fact, the poverty-to-growth elasticity of -0.44% implicit in the 
3:62:2475:13:14:82:511:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:figures above is not strange for Peruvian standards, and we have reached figures close to 
3:63:2565:14:14:82:507:575:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:-0.60% in previous expansionary episodes (see Loayza and Polastri, 2004). As argued in 
3:64:2652:14:14:82:487:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Yamada and Castro (2007), however, these improvements will only be temporary if 
3:65:2732:14:14:82:494:547:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:social policies have not delivered a minimum set of assets to guarantee larger and less 
3:66:2820:14:13:82:329:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:volatile consumption paths at the household level2. 
3:67:2872:13:14:82:85:520:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
3:68:2872:14:14:82:471:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Confronted with this evidence, a natural question is whether our recent economic 
3:69:2953:14:14:82:495:492:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:expansion has been accompanied by this delivery or if we have reasons to believe that 
3:70:3039:14:14:82:456:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:monetary poverty figures mask deprivation in other aspects critical for human 
3:71:3117:14:13:82:447:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:development. We believe adopting a multidimensional approach for poverty 
3:72:3190:13:14:82:496:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:measurement can be of great aid to attempt an answer to this question in formal terms. 
3:73:3277:14:14:82:497:437:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Recent trends of other social indicators (e.g. calorie intake3) warn us against excessive 
3:74:3367:14:14:82:473:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:optimism about the evolution of poverty, however, a consolidated measure is still 
3:75:3449:14:14:82:482:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:missing and here is where a multidimensional indicator can play an important role. 
3:76:3532:14:13:82:85:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
3:77:3532:13:14:82:503:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Broad consensus now exists regarding the need to account for more than one dimension 
3:78:3617:14:14:82:502:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:or attribute when trying to proxy a person’s well-being and/or development capability.  
3:79:3705:14:14:82:498:354:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:An immediate implication of this is that “poverty” (understood as the lack of this well-
3:80:3793:14:14:82:510:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:being or ability to develop) is also better represented as a multidimensional phenomenon. 
3:81:3883:14:13:82:502:326:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Conceptual and empirical contributions on this direction can be found in the writings of 
3:82:3972:13:14:82:164:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:several authors4. 
3:83:3990:14:14:82:85:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
3:84:3990:14:14:82:447:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As recognized in Battiston, et al. (2009), and despite extensive literature on 
3:85:4069:14:14:82:493:271:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional poverty measurement, the majority of research efforts on poverty in 
3:86:4154:14:13:82:469:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) focus solely on the income or monetary 
3:87:4231:13:16:82:489:244:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimension. More on the side of policymaking, however, the Unsatisfied Basic Needs 
3:88:4313:16:8:82:228:228:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
3:89:4371:8:11:82:440:220:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:1 Measured using a national monetary poverty line based on a basic consumption bundle. 
3:90:4458:11:16:82:500:209:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:2 As documented by these authors, the Peruvian economic recovery experienced between 1991 and 1997 
3:91:4557:16:12:82:511:193:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:was accompanied by a significant reduction in monetary poverty incidence from 54.2% to 46.4%. The mild 
3:92:4659:12:11:82:507:181:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:recession experienced between 1998 and 2001, however, wiped away these achievements and poverty was 
3:93:4759:11:7:82:276:170:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:again as high as 54.5% by the end of year 2001. 
3:94:4807:7:16:82:512:163:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:3 According to the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Estadistica (INEI), the percentage of individuals living in 
3:95:4917:16:12:82:496:147:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:households with a calorie intake below its specific requirement shifted from 28% to 31% between 2007 
3:96:5018:12:7:82:124:135:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and 2008. 
3:97:5028:7:16:82:511:128:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:4 See, for example, Sen (1976), Chakravarty (1983), Atkinson (1987), Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984); 
3:98:5133:16:12:82:507:112:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and Duclos and Araar (2006) for a complete survey on the different approaches for poverty measurement. 
3:99:5235:12:0:82:84:100:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: 
4:100:5236:0:14:82:504:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(UBN) approach has provided an important basis for a multidimensional understanding 
4:101:5320:14:14:82:481:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of poverty. This approach uses information on dwelling conditions (non-precarious 
4:102:5402:14:14:82:478:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:materials and non-crowded household; UBNs 1 and 2), access to sanitary services 
4:103:5482:14:13:82:504:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(UBN3), and the educational status of children and the household head (UBNs 4 and 5). 
4:104:5568:13:14:82:493:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It fails, however, to combine this information in a unique index and, instead, relies on 
4:105:5657:14:14:82:484:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:separate indicators measuring the proportion of households unable to meet a certain 
4:106:5741:14:14:82:168:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:number of needs. 
4:107:5758:14:14:82:85:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
4:108:5758:14:13:82:497:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Peru is not an exception in terms of the focus of research: attempts to measure poverty 
4:109:5846:13:14:82:481:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:aside from the conventional monetary poverty line indicator are scarce. Monge and 
4:110:5928:14:14:82:492:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Ravina (2003) built a subjective measure based on the Subjective Poverty Line (SPL) 
4:111:6012:14:14:82:483:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:method described in Kapteyn, et al., (1985). The SPL method allows to identify the 
4:112:6094:14:14:82:483:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:minimum income the household head believes needs for subsistence. If the income 
4:113:6174:14:13:82:496:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:perceived is less than this minimum, household members are identified as subjectively 
4:114:6260:13:14:82:495:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poor. Their results showed significant differences (of up to 30 percentage points) with 
4:115:6348:14:14:82:256:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:respect to the monetary headcount.

4:119:6552:13:14:82:491:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:the 2006 version of our living-standards survey (the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares -
4:120:6635:14:14:82:489:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ENAHO). Based on their results, these authors concluded that political participation, 
4:121:6721:14:14:82:480:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:education and health conditions have a significant effect on households’ subjective

4:125:6902:14:14:82:488:414:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:been yet attempted for Peru. Battiston, et al. (2009), documents studies for Uruguay, 
4:126:6988:14:14:82:495:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia, and even their very comprehensive cross-country study 
4:127:7073:14:14:82:466:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:does not include Peru5. In addition, and despite its widespread use in other LAC 
4:128:7154:14:13:82:490:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:countries, the UBN approach is not broadly acknowledged as a “poverty” measure in 
4:129:7236:13:14:82:494:359:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Peru. Thus, both academic and policy debates around the matter focus on our national 
4:130:7321:14:14:82:319:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:extreme and moderate monetary poverty indices. 
4:131:7368:14:14:82:85:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
4:132:7368:14:14:82:503:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Given the above, three distinct (but related) issues motivate this paper. The first one has 
4:133:7460:14:13:82:486:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to do with the scepticism surrounding the recent decline in Peruvian official poverty 
4:134:7546:13:14:82:498:290:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:figures6. The second one is the availability of information via an extremely rich living-
4:135:7635:14:14:82:513:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:standards survey and the fact that, despite this, multidimensional poverty measurement is 
4:136:7725:14:14:82:512:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:an unexplored topic in Peru. Finally, the third one is the recent work by Alkire and Foster 
4:137:7817:14:14:82:502:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(see Alkire and Foster, 2008) on multidimensional poverty measures, which provides a 
4:138:7902:14:13:82:508:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:simple yet insightful approach for identifying the poor. We believe this methodology not 
4:139:7991:13:14:82:510:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:only provides a formal framework to address our concerns regarding the recent evolution 
4:140:8079:14:14:82:470:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of monetary poverty, but can also become a useful tool for social policy design.  
4:141:8161:14:24:82:85:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
4:142:8161:24:7:82:228:169:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
4:143:8219:7:16:82:500:162:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:5 The authors build several multidimensional poverty measures using comparable data from El Salvador, 
4:144:8321:16:12:82:494:146:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina for the period 1992-2006. They found that the first four 
4:145:8423:12:11:82:478:134:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:countries experienced significant reductions in multidimensional poverty regardless of the measure 
4:146:8522:11:12:82:491:123:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:considered. Uruguay experienced only a small reduction while Argentina’s estimates remained almost 
4:147:8621:12:7:82:120:111:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:stagnant. 
4:148:8631:7:16:82:509:104:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:6 As already discussed, more than doubts about consumption figures or poverty lines, questions arise about 
4:149:8738:16:0:82:342:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f9:the extent in which the latter suffice to reflect deprivation levels. 
5:150:8808:0:14:82:495:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The rest of the document is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the Alkire-
5:151:8895:14:14:82:515:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Foster identification approach and briefly discuss its properties and contributions towards 
5:152:8987:14:14:82:506:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a multidimensional view for poverty measurement. We also present a simple framework 
5:153:9071:14:13:82:494:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to compare the monetary poverty line measure against the proposed multidimensional 
5:154:9154:13:14:82:495:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:headcount. Following the controversy motivating this paper, we seek to evaluate up to 
5:155:9240:14:14:82:485:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:what extent the poverty line indicator tends to over or understate the overall level of 
5:156:9328:14:14:82:503:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation in terms of the dimensions considered for the multidimensional measure. In 
5:157:9415:14:14:82:487:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:section 3, we select dimensions, indicators and their respective cut-off values for the 
5:158:9503:14:13:82:498:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Peruvian case. With this, we build the multidimensional headcount indicator and apply 
5:159:9589:13:14:82:484:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the comparison framework described in section 2 using data for 2004 and 2008. We 
5:160:9670:14:14:82:446:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:further make inter and intraregional comparisons between the monetary and 
5:161:9744:14:14:82:506:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional headcounts, and assess deprivations among the multidimensional poor 
5:162:9829:14:14:82:491:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in order to illustrate how this approach can aid policy design. Finally, in section 4 we 
5:163:9918:14:13:82:453:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:summarize our main findings and suggest some avenues for further research.

5:168:10022:13:14:82:384:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:2.1 The Alkire-Foster dual cut-off method of identification 
5:169:10082:14:14:82:85:493:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
5:170:10082:14:14:82:494:479:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As discussed in Alkire and Foster (2008), poverty measurement relies on two distinct 
5:171:10167:14:13:82:499:465:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:steps: identification and aggregation. The first has to do with answering “who is poor”, 
5:172:10256:13:14:82:485:452:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:while the latter focuses on determining “how many are poor” and “how poor are the 
5:173:10338:14:14:82:503:438:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poor”. The abovementioned authors focus on the issue of identification and devise what 
5:174:10425:14:14:82:246:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:they call a “dual cut-off” method. 
5:175:10460:14:13:82:85:410:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
5:176:10460:13:17:82:503:397:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As suggested by its name, this method consists of two steps: (i) given a population of n 
5:177:10548:17:19:82:508:380:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individuals, a set of d dimensions, and a cut-off value for each dimension();1,..,jzjd=, 
5:178:10637:19:14:82:510:361:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identify those dimensions in which each individual is deprived; and (ii) count the number 
5:179:10727:14:14:82:471:347:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of deprivations for each individual and identify as “poor” those whose number of 
5:180:10808:14:14:82:508:333:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivations equals or exceeds a specific cut-off value (k). With this, the authors propose 
5:181:10900:14:14:82:504:319:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a class of identifying functions where the “union approach” (which requires deprivation 
5:182:10988:14:13:82:510:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in all dimensions to classify an individual as poor; k = d) and the “intersection approach” 
5:183:11080:13:14:82:503:292:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(which requires deprivation in any single dimension to classify someone as poor; k = 1) 
5:184:11168:14:14:82:170:278:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are special cases.  
5:185:11188:14:14:82:85:264:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
5:186:11188:14:14:82:494:250:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:At the aggregation stage, the authors propose a family of poverty measures associated 
5:187:11274:14:15:82:492:236:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with those of the FGT class developed by Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984). Their 
5:188:11357:15:18:82:502:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:benchmark measure, thus, is a headcount ratio()Hq  n=, where q refers to the number 
5:189:11441:18:14:82:499:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of poor identified using the dual cut-off method. Our study will focus on this particular 
5:190:11531:14:14:82:487:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:methodology and, especially, on the implications of using the identification function 
5:191:11617:14:14:82:234:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:proposed by Alkire and Foster. 
5:192:11648:14:13:82:85:161:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
5:193:11648:13:14:82:506:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As discussed by the authors, their dual cut-off approach has several desirable properties. 
5:194:11739:14:14:82:504:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It is both “poverty focused” and “deprivation focused”. This first property is also shared 
5:195:11830:14:14:82:484:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:by unidimensional methods (such as the monetary poverty line) and implies that the 
5:196:11913:14:14:82:512:106:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:result provided by the identification function does not vary if a non-poor person increases 
5:197:12005:14:0:82:502:92:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:an achievement. The second property, however, successfully distinguishes the dual cut-
6:198:12092:0:14:82:510:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:off approach from identification under a unidimensional view. It implies that increases in 
6:199:12183:14:14:82:514:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:non-deprived dimensions do not change a poverty status and this, as we will be discussed 
6:200:12272:14:14:82:481:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:later, can have important implications for social policy design7. Another important 
6:201:12356:14:13:82:493:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:property for social policy evaluation (not shared by methods as the monetary poverty 
6:202:12441:13:14:82:506:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:line) is that it allows us to combine cardinal and ordinal data. The possibility of working 
6:203:12533:14:14:82:497:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with ordinal data is important since the delivery of social services is usually accounted 
6:204:12623:14:14:82:177:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for dichotomically. 
6:205:12643:14:14:82:88:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:  
6:206:12645:14:13:82:503:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It is worth mentioning that the last two properties discussed above depend, crucially, on 
6:207:12735:13:14:82:488:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the fact that identification occurs before aggregation. If we are working with several 
6:208:12822:14:14:82:506:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimensions, this statement might seem quite strange: how can we determine who is poor 
6:209:12908:14:14:82:489:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:before aggregating across dimensions? In fact, Alkire and Foster do not propose this, 
6:210:12994:14:14:82:504:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:what they propose is to start by identifying deprivations and then aggregating to identify 
6:211:13085:14:13:82:498:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:the poor. The distinction between the concepts of “deprived” and “poor” is critical and 
6:212:13173:13:14:82:297:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:lies at the core of their dual cut-off method.  
6:213:13221:14:14:82:85:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
6:214:13221:14:14:82:482:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We believe the above is an important contribution at the conceptual level. In fact, it 
6:215:13308:14:14:82:498:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:suggests that the distinction between a unidimensional and a multidimensional view of 
6:216:13394:14:13:82:506:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty does not only rely on the number of dimensions considered, but must also factor 
6:217:13482:13:14:82:508:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in the timing of the aggregation stage. For instance, one could argue that most monetary 
6:218:13571:14:14:82:504:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty lines are multidimensional indicators in the sense that they consider a bundle of 
6:219:13661:14:14:82:499:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:goods. However, it is clear that in all these cases aggregation within individuals occurs 
6:220:13751:14:14:82:458:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:before any meaningful process of identification: only after a single measure of 
6:221:13831:14:13:82:507:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:consumption is obtained, identification of the poor occurs based on a predetermined cut-
6:222:13919:13:14:82:504:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:off value. Under the multidimensional view proposed by Alkire and Foster, on the other 
6:223:14006:14:14:82:483:414:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:hand, aggregation within individuals occurs after the identification of deprivations.

6:228:14180:14:14:82:494:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In this section we develop a simple framework to compare the results obtained for the 
6:229:14266:14:14:82:470:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional headcount ratio (H) against the conventional monetary poverty 
6:230:14345:14:14:82:496:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:measure (PL). In particular, we are interested in determining up to what extent the PL 
6:231:14431:14:13:82:503:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:indicator provides sufficient evidence regarding the level of deprivation (in terms of the 
6:232:14522:13:14:82:511:290:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimensions considered for the multidimensional measure) or if it presents a potential bias

6:236:14731:14:19:82:506:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:set of attributes or assets that play an important role in human development, that we lack

6:242:15293:17:15:82:470:150:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:person i is deprived. An important property satisfied by this indicator ()0MHA= is dimensional 
6:243:15388:15:12:82:501:135:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:monotonicity, which implies that the indicator is sensitive to the degree of deprivation of the poor (e.g. it 
6:244:15498:12:11:82:511:123:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:will fall if a deprivation is removed from someone poor). Since our analysis will be based on the headcount 
6:245:15606:11:12:82:509:112:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:ratio, we will not discuss all the properties considered by Alkire and Foster when analysing all their family 
6:246:15716:12:0:82:500:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:of poverty measures. Instead, we focus on those satisfied by their “dual cut-off” identification function.  
7:247:15823:0:14:82:482:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:prior information or specific criteria to regard any one of them more important than 
7:248:15908:14:14:82:491:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:another, and that they share some (but not a perfect) degree of complementarity. This 
7:249:15994:14:14:82:508:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:implies that, in principle, we would prefer to discard extreme approaches when deciding 
7:250:16082:14:13:82:478:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:which extent of deprivation is required to classify an individual as “poor”. In other 
7:251:16168:13:14:82:456:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:words, and since no single asset can be univocally understood as essential nor 
7:252:16247:14:14:82:456:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:substitutable, we prefer to stay away from both the “intersection” and “union” 
7:253:16326:14:14:82:145:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:approaches.

7:256:16425:13:14:82:498:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the potential biases of the latter will be based on determining up to what extent the PL 
7:257:16513:14:14:82:338:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:measure resembles any of these extreme approaches.

7:259:16564:14:14:82:493:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Let us start analyzing the behavior of H with respect to k. In principle, one can expect 
7:260:16653:14:13:82:504:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that the larger the cut-off value, the smaller the value for H. In fact, increasing the value 
7:261:16747:13:14:82:510:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for k implies moving towards an “intersection approach”. As it becomes more difficult to 
7:262:16836:14:14:82:487:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:find individuals deprived in more dimensions, the poverty count should fall as k gets 
7:263:16922:14:14:82:476:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:larger. On the other hand, moving towards k = 1 implies moving towards a “union 
7:264:17002:14:14:82:497:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:approach”. Finding someone deprived of at least one dimension is easier and, thus, the 
7:265:17089:14:13:82:213:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty count should rise.

8:283:17547:14:14:82:503:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Under this scenario, the use of a multidimensional indicator to measure deprivation will 
8:284:17636:14:14:82:493:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be of little relevance. Under a more general setting, however, one can expect function 
8:285:17723:14:13:82:463:717:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:H(k) to exhibit a negative slope or, in terms of what is depicted in Graph 1, that 
8:286:17806:13:17:82:491:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional poverty incidence for k = 1 will be larger than its counterpart under

8:289:17905:14:14:82:497:656:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:If we want to compare H and LP indicators, we need to start by asking ourselves if the 
8:290:17992:14:14:82:504:642:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:latter is or not an element of the former. Is this is true, it implies that there exists a value 
8:291:18089:14:14:82:489:628:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for k between 1 and d for which both indicators will intersect. To see this, notice that 
8:292:18178:14:15:82:497:614:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:when k = 1, all of those deprived in the monetary dimension (and, thus, poor under the 
8:293:18265:15:18:82:511:599:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:PL measure) are also poor under a multidimensional perspective()UHPL≥. Conversely, 
8:294:18348:18:16:82:500:581:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:when k = d, all of those classified as poor according to the H measure are also deprived

8:297:18471:14:14:82:452:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:With this in mind, we argue that the value of k where our H indicator and the 
8:298:18549:14:13:82:478:519:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:conventional PL indicator intersect (k*) can be informative of the potential tension 
8:299:18634:13:14:82:511:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:between the identification as “poor” according to the PL indicator and the overall level of 
8:300:18726:14:14:82:511:492:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation in the dimensions considered. For example, let us assume the extreme case in 
8:301:18815:14:17:82:482:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:which *kd=. This implies that the PL measure is consistent with an “intersection” 
8:302:18897:17:17:82:503:461:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:approach ()IPLH= and suggests that this measure tends to underestimate the level of 
8:303:18981:17:14:82:473:444:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation: the percentage of poor for a given monetary poverty line can only be 
8:304:19063:14:14:82:510:430:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:replicated if we assume that to be poor under a multidimensional perspective you have to 
8:305:19152:14:14:82:499:416:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be deprived of all possible assets. To the extent in which the attributes selected comply 
8:306:19242:14:13:82:489:402:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with the characteristics discussed above, it can be argued that we do not need to wait 
8:307:19329:13:14:82:367:389:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:until a person is deprived of all of them to call her “poor”.

8:309:19392:14:14:82:498:361:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:At the other side of the spectrum, a similar reasoning can be applied to support the fact 
8:310:19482:14:14:82:479:347:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that the PL measure tends to overstate the level of deprivation if k* = 1. Under this 
8:311:19568:14:16:82:480:333:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:scenario, the PL indicator is consistent with deprivation in one or more dimensions 
8:312:19652:16:17:83:510:317:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:()UHPL= and this means that measuring poverty using only the monetary dimension is 
8:313:19735:17:14:82:493:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:equivalent to identifying as poor even those who have access to the majority of assets

8:316:19834:14:14:82:496:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As already discussed, the slope of the H(k) function is informative of the relevance of  
8:317:19923:14:13:82:498:244:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:considering several dimensions for poverty measurement: a flat slope will indicate that 
8:318:20011:13:14:82:494:231:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:little information in added to the analysis by introducing an additional dimension. We 
8:319:20098:14:14:82:511:217:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:believe this should be factored in when comparing the H and PL indicators. Consider, for 
8:320:20187:14:14:82:513:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:example, a situation where k* is very close to d and the slope of the H(k) function is close 
8:321:20280:14:14:82:512:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to zero. According to the above discussion, the first piece of information will suggest that 
8:322:20373:14:13:82:509:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the PL indicator tends to understate the degree of deprivation. If we consider the fact that 
8:323:20466:13:14:82:511:162:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:H(k) is almost flat, however, we will need to reconsider this statement since little poverty 
8:324:20559:14:14:82:512:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:increase is observed if we move towards k = 1. In other words, we cannot say that the PL 
8:325:20647:14:14:82:490:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:measure is not sufficient to reflect the level of deprivation in terms of the dimensions 
8:326:20736:14:14:82:497:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:considered if PL is among these dimensions and adding more of them does not change 
8:327:20819:14:13:82:187:106:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:our poverty measure.

9:329:20841:0:17:82:513:756:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Considering the above, we propose comparing the differences()UHPL− and ()IPL    H− 
9:330:20923:17:14:82:497:739:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to account for the potential tension between the incidence of monetary poverty and the

9:332:21097:16:18:82:463:709:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:implies evaluating distances A and B. In fact, ()UAHPL=− and measures the 
9:333:21171:18:16:82:475:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:proportion of individuals deprived in one or more dimensions but not deprived in 
9:334:21252:16:18:82:480:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:monetary terms. On the other hand, ()IBPL    H=− and measures the proportion of 
9:335:21332:18:14:82:508:657:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individuals deprived in the monetary dimension but not deprived in all of them. As such, 
9:336:21421:14:14:82:489:643:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:both measures refer to the group of individuals deprived in 1 up to 1d− dimensions,

9:338:21591:13:14:82:505:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:those who do not (considered within B) (please refer to Appendix 1 for a detailed graph 
9:339:21679:14:14:82:188:602:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on the sets involved).

9:341:21702:14:14:82:504:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:From Graph 1 it is easy to see how (for a given slope) the larger the difference between 
9:342:21791:14:13:82:509:560:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:distances A and B, the closer will k* be to d. In terms of the prior discussion, this implies 
9:343:21885:13:14:82:498:547:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that the PL indicator tends to understate the level of deprivation. If we now refer to the 
9:344:21976:14:14:82:492:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sets described in the previous paragraph, a large positive difference between A and B 
9:345:22061:14:14:82:486:519:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:implies that the majority of individuals deprived in 1 to 1d− dimensions are able to 
9:346:22146:14:14:82:503:505:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:surpass the monetary poverty line. Consequently, classifying as poor only those who do 
9:347:22233:14:14:82:511:491:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:not (i.e. using the LP indicator to measure poverty) implies leaving behind a considerable 
9:348:22324:14:14:82:508:477:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:proportion of these individuals and introducing a potential downward bias in our poverty

9:351:22425:13:14:82:500:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:At the other side of the spectrum, as k* gets close to 1, B will eventually surpass A, and 
9:352:22516:14:14:82:459:422:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:this will reveal an increasing risk of introducing an upward bias in our poverty 
9:353:22597:14:14:82:505:408:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:assessment if it is solely based on the incidence of monetary poverty. Since the majority 
9:354:22687:14:14:82:488:394:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of individuals deprived in 1 to 1d− dimensions are not able to surpass the monetary 
9:355:22771:14:14:82:514:380:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty line, using this measure to identify the poor will imply classifying as such a large

9:379:23735:13:14:82:489:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:discussion above, if we rely on the PL indicator for poverty measurement, the risk of 
9:380:23821:14:14:82:488:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:classifying as non-poor individuals who still endure considerable deprivation will be

9:382:23990:15:0:82:309:91:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:situation will occur as %Bgrows towards one. 
10:383:24036:0:13:82:494:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:None of these situations is desirable in terms of policy design. As %A grows towards 
10:384:24121:13:14:82:503:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:one, the PL indicator “looses power” to reject the status of “non-poor”: while we can be 
10:385:24210:14:14:82:502:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sure that those classified as poor are surely in need, we cannot say that those deemed as 
10:386:24300:14:14:82:482:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:non-poor no longer suffer considerable deprivation. A situation like this can lead to 
10:387:24386:14:14:82:497:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:under-coverage problems if social programs are targeted using the PL measure. On the 
10:388:24471:14:14:82:503:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other hand, leakage problems will arise as %B grows towards one and the PL indicator 
10:389:24556:14:14:82:483:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is still used as the prime targeting tool. Under these circumstances, the PL indicator

10:391:24734:14:13:82:487:647:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:large endowment of assets but we cannot assure that those classified as poor do not.

10:394:24903:14:14:82:488:606:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:believe is important to stress that this is not intended as a tool to determine if the PL 
10:395:24992:14:14:82:509:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:indicator under of overestimates some underlying “true level” of poverty. For a given set 
10:396:25082:14:13:82:501:578:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of dimensions that reflect a broadened concept of poverty, our intention is to determine 
10:397:25171:13:14:82:468:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:up to what extent the PL indicator tends to under or overstate the overall level of 
10:398:25255:14:14:82:501:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation, and to use this information to assess the potential risks of relying solely on 
10:399:25347:14:14:82:499:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the monetary dimension for poverty analysis. Our assessment is done in relative terms, 
10:400:25434:14:14:82:459:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and the measure we propose relies on the fact that the assets considered for the

10:408:25685:13:14:82:85:410:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
10:409:25685:14:14:82:511:396:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In this section, we present and discuss a set of attributes to reflect a broadened concept of 
10:410:25779:14:14:82:484:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty. For this, we depart from a rather standard set of aspects involved in human 
10:411:25864:14:14:82:506:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:development: nutrition, education, health, and housing conditions. We acknowledge that 
10:412:25951:14:13:82:452:354:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:several pages could be written discussing the possible interactions and causal 
10:413:26030:13:14:82:496:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:relationships between these dimensions, and that several other classifications could be 
10:414:26118:14:14:82:508:327:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:proposed8. This, however, is not our intention. We simply want to select a reasonable set 
10:415:26208:14:14:82:490:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of aspects which enjoy of minimum consensus regarding their importance for human 
10:416:26289:14:14:82:504:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:development in order to: (i) test drive the Alkire-Foster identification methodology; and 
10:417:26379:14:13:82:504:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(ii) compare these results against those obtained when identification is solely based on a

10:420:26494:14:14:82:507:244:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The question of whether we have selected too many or too few aspects to reflect poverty 
10:421:26582:14:14:82:488:230:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:will never be free of controversy. To appease our minds we could argue that the four 
10:422:26667:14:13:82:498:216:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:aspects selected are closely related to five of the eight Millennium Development Goals 
10:423:26754:13:14:82:512:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(MDGs)9, and that these enjoy a broad consensus. Battistón, et al. (2009), also rely on the 
10:424:26846:14:14:82:479:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Alkire-Foster multidimensional approach and consider a similar set of dimensions, 
10:425:26928:14:17:82:499:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:although no direct indicators for health or nutrition were proposed, and those related to

10:427:27076:8:16:82:499:150:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:8 For instance, one could find reasons to classify nutrition within health or argue that housing conditions 
10:428:27184:16:11:82:474:134:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:are more on the side of determinants than outcomes, and have a different order of exogeneity than 
10:429:27282:11:7:82:126:123:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:education.

10:431:27392:16:12:82:503:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(MDG 2), reduce child mortality (MDG 4), improve maternal health (MDG 5), and ensure environmental 
10:432:27491:12:0:82:185:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:sustainability (MDG 7).   
11:433:27519:0:14:82:484:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:housing conditions were each considered as a specific dimension10. The dimensions 
11:434:27601:14:14:82:512:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:chosen are also closely related to the “needs” considered under the UBN approach which, 
11:435:27689:14:14:82:512:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:as already discussed, is widely used in Latin America to reflect several aspects of poverty 
11:436:27781:14:13:82:255:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other than the monetary dimension. 
11:437:27816:13:14:82:85:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
11:438:27816:14:14:82:492:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:If controversy can arise when selecting dimensions, even more can be expected when

11:440:27989:14:14:82:468:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:case, three critical elements came into play: (i) if the indicator reflects a relevant 
11:441:28076:14:13:82:501:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:achievement within the chosen dimension; (ii) how well does it reflect an asset than we 
11:442:28164:13:14:82:468:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:can require social policies to deliver; and (iii) the availability of information in a

11:505:29322:14:13:82:503:186:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The table above summarizes the dimensions, indicators, and proposed cut-off values or 
11:506:29408:13:14:82:505:173:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:criteria for identifying the poor according to the Alkire-Foster approach. The reader will 
11:507:29499:14:14:82:511:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:notice that we have also included a monetary dimension directly captured by the standard 
11:508:29588:14:14:82:491:145:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty line (PL) indicator. As in Battistón, et al. (2009), we seek to complement our 
11:509:29675:14:19:82:468:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:direct “basic needs” indicators with an “indirect measure” of deprivation such as 
11:510:29757:19:8:82:228:112:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
11:511:29815:8:16:82:493:104:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:10 As will be discussed soon, we propose integrating several housing conditions indicators into a single 
11:512:29919:16:0:82:128:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f9:dimension. 
12:513:29931:0:14:82:498:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:household per-capita expenditure. More importantly, however, the inclusion of the PL 
12:514:30015:14:14:82:511:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:criterion will ease comparability between the results obtained by using only this indicator 
12:515:30107:14:14:82:392:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and the use of a multidimensional approach to identify the poor. 
12:516:30172:14:13:82:85:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
12:517:30172:13:14:82:512:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The reader will also notice that we have considered two different achievements that could 
12:518:30262:14:14:82:496:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be easily grouped within a single educational dimension: one related to access to basic 
12:519:30350:14:14:82:476:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:education by children, and a second one related to the household head educational 
12:520:30432:14:14:82:506:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:attainment. Although both are related to human capital, the first one has more to do with 
12:521:30522:14:13:82:481:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the current investment flow while the latter measures the available stock within the 
12:522:30607:13:14:82:504:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:household. In fact, educational attainment of children determines the household’s future 
12:523:30696:14:14:82:485:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:consumption path, while that of the parents is behind the current consumption path. 
12:524:30780:14:14:82:85:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
12:525:30780:14:14:82:464:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Given this, the second education indicator might seem redundant as we are also 
12:526:30859:14:13:82:447:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:considering the monetary dimension which is based on household per capita 
12:527:30933:13:14:82:490:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:consumption. However, its inclusion seeks to reflect household’s vulnerability rather 
12:528:31019:14:14:82:487:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:than its consumption level11. We decided to work with the household head’s literacy 
12:529:31103:14:14:82:467:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:condition because this reflects a minimum standard in cognitive skills and, quite 
12:530:31185:14:14:82:491:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:importantly, because its status is responsive to contemporaneous policy intervention. 
12:531:31271:14:13:82:85:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
12:532:31271:13:14:82:512:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:All the information used to build the indicators proposed was obtained from the Encuesta 
12:533:31360:14:14:82:455:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) for years 2004 and 2008. This survey retains 
12:534:31433:14:14:82:510:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:representativeness down to the regional level and is the basis for poverty measurement in 
12:535:31523:14:14:82:501:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Peru. Although most of the indicators are quite standard in any LSMS, some of the cut-
12:536:31609:14:13:82:270:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:off criteria deserve further discussion.  
12:537:31651:13:14:82:85:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
12:538:31651:14:14:82:474:414:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The nutrition indicator is built comparing the specific calorie requirement of each 
12:539:31735:14:14:82:464:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:household against its effective calorie intake. The former is based on household 
12:540:31816:14:14:82:508:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:members’ age, gender and physical activity (Herrera, 2001). The later is calculated using 
12:541:31906:14:13:82:502:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:calorie equivalences for each of the goods consumed by the household12. Regarding the 
12:542:31992:13:14:82:488:359:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:health dimension, the reason for not attending a health establishment was labelled as 
12:543:32078:14:14:82:493:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:“insufficient resources” if the respondent reported “insufficient money” or “excessive 
12:544:32165:14:14:82:490:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:distance to health establishment”. Adequate water source, on the other hand, requires 
12:545:32251:14:14:82:485:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:access to a public tap connected to a water-network (or better) in the urban area or a 
12:546:32338:14:13:82:494:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:water-well (or better) in the rural domain. An adequate sewage service implies a flush 
12:547:32425:13:14:82:483:290:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:toilet connected to a sewage network or septic tank if the household is located in an 
12:548:32511:14:14:82:510:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:urban area, or a pit latrine (or better) if it is rural. Precarious materials, on the other hand, 
12:549:32609:14:14:82:492:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:refer to household walls made of straw, or made of stone and mud or wood combined 
12:550:32691:14:14:82:511:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with a soil floor, or households improvised at locations inadequate for human habitation. 
12:551:32781:14:13:82:483:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A non-crowded house requires an average of three or less people per room. Finally, 
12:552:32864:13:14:82:489:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:monetary poverty lines are computed for each of the eight geographical domains and 
12:553:32947:14:26:82:403:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:updated each year by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INEI). 
12:554:33014:26:8:82:228:181:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
12:555:33072:8:16:82:477:173:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:11 Several studies (e.g. Castro, 2008) have shown that household head’s educational attainment is a 
12:556:33172:16:7:82:500:157:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:significant determinant of the vulnerability of consumption with respect to idiosyncratic income shocks. 
12:557:33277:7:16:82:469:150:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:12 As the Peruvian extreme poverty line is measured in terms of food intake, one could argue that 
12:558:33375:16:11:82:503:134:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:household identification as extreme poor or non-extreme poor could suffice to measure deprivation in the 
12:559:33480:11:12:82:506:123:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:nutrition dimension. The extreme poverty line, however, is based on food consumption of a representative 
12:560:33585:12:11:82:491:111:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:household while the measure we propose considers the specific composition and calorie needs of each 
12:561:33685:11:12:82:494:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:household. A shortcoming, however, is that it does not account for the way in which food is distributed 
12:562:33789:12:0:82:189:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:within the household unit. 
13:563:33818:0:14:82:507:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A quick comparison of the extent of deprivation from each of the dimensions considered 
13:564:33905:14:14:82:457:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:between 2004 and 2008, already provides some insight regarding the potential 
13:565:33982:14:14:82:475:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:differences between the standard unidimensional measure and a multidimensional 
13:566:34061:14:13:82:461:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:approach based on the indicators proposed. In fact, and while the percentage of 
13:567:34141:13:14:82:480:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:households deprived in the monetary dimension (which is equivalent to the official 
13:568:34224:14:14:82:502:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty figure in Peru) has fallen considerably, the rest of indicators have not improved 
13:569:34314:14:14:82:510:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:at a similar rate. A reasonable prior, thus, is that our multidimensional poverty headcount 
13:570:34406:14:14:82:498:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:will not exhibit the same decline as the monetary poverty measure. In what follows we 
13:571:34492:14:13:82:451:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:apply our comparison framework to address this issue in more formal terms.

13:577:34763:13:14:82:489:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:inspection reveals that the reduction in the level of the PL indicator that has not been 
13:578:34852:14:14:82:469:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:accompanied by a similar shift in the H(k) function and, thus, the value of k* has 
13:579:34935:14:14:82:497:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:increased. According to our discussion above, this provides a first piece of evidence to 
13:580:35024:14:14:82:490:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:support the fact that the PL indicator now exhibits a larger tendency to understate the

14:637:35960:17:14:82:500:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:definitions provided above. An important result emerges regarding the tension between 
14:638:36046:14:13:82:499:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the incidence of monetary poverty and the overall degree of deprivation in terms of the 
14:639:36134:13:14:82:468:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimensions considered. While the “size” of this tension has remained practically 
14:640:36215:14:14:82:491:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:unchanged between 2004 and 2008, results provided by the PL indicator have shifted 
14:641:36298:14:14:82:461:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:from a tendency to overstate to a tendency to underestimate the overall level of 
14:642:36379:14:14:82:512:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation of the Peruvian population. Put in terms of the discussion above, and contrary 
14:643:36470:14:13:82:487:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to what happened in 2004, more than half of the individuals deprived in 1 to 5 of the 
14:644:36556:13:14:82:493:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimensions considered are now able to surpass the monetary poverty line. Thus, if we 
14:645:36641:14:14:82:503:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:continue relying on the poverty line indicator for identification purposes, we now face a 
14:646:36731:14:14:82:459:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:larger risk of classifying as non-poor individuals who still endure considerable 
14:647:36812:14:14:82:146:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation.

14:649:36826:13:14:82:504:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In terms of the motivation of this analysis, the results discussed above should suffice to 
14:650:36917:14:0:82:480:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:warn us against excessive optimism regarding the recent evolution of the monetary 
15:651:37001:0:14:82:480:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:poverty indicator. The expansion in consumption levels that has allowed a 12 point 
15:652:37084:14:14:82:470:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reduction in the incidence of monetary poverty in the last five years has not been 
15:653:37167:14:14:82:512:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:accompanied by increases in other achievements crucial for human development. While a 
15:654:37253:14:13:82:502:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:simple inspection of deprivation levels from these assets could have shed some light on 
15:655:37341:13:14:82:492:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the matter, we believe a multidimensional approach for poverty measurement and the 
15:656:37424:14:14:82:506:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identification method exploited above have provided a formal framework to address this 
15:657:37511:14:14:82:112:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:issue.

15:661:37541:14:14:82:501:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The advantages of the multidimensional approach are not limited to contributing with a 
15:662:37628:14:14:82:487:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dose of formality in discussions like the above. We believe poverty measures should 
15:663:37712:14:14:82:501:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:convey information regarding the effectiveness of social policies, and the Alkire-Foster 
15:664:37801:14:13:82:510:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identification method exhibits a series of desirable features to track the provision of basic 
15:665:37895:13:14:82:476:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:public services. In particular, it is “deprivation focused” and allows us to combine 
15:666:37980:14:14:82:210:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cardinal and ordinal data.  
15:667:38008:14:14:82:85:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
15:668:38008:14:14:82:501:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As already discussed, the latter is particularly useful to build an aggregate measure that 
15:669:38099:14:13:82:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:conveys information regarding access to basic services which are usually measured on a 
15:670:38186:13:14:82:486:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:binary (yes or no) basis. The first property, on the other hand, is especially desirable 
15:671:38275:14:14:82:499:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:when using the indicator to focalize interventions, since it creates incentives to provide 
15:672:38366:14:14:82:461:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:those assets from which the poor are deprived up to the point of removing such 
15:673:38445:14:14:82:476:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation. Put it in other terms, the policy maker would not be able to provoke a 
15:674:38529:14:13:82:491:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:significant reduction in the multidimensional headcount ratio (H) unless it focuses on 
15:675:38616:13:14:82:453:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:guaranteeing increases in those dimensions in which the poor are deprived13. 
15:676:38693:14:14:82:85:414:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
15:677:38693:14:14:82:498:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:To illustrate the above, in what follows, we further discuss the differences between the 
15:678:38782:14:14:82:491:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:monetary poverty headcount and the multidimensional indicator for a pre-established 
15:679:38866:14:13:82:506:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:value of k. In particular, we are interested in making inter and intraregional comparisons 
15:680:38957:13:14:82:494:359:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in order to determine: (i) if differences between PL and H measures are homogeneous 
15:681:39041:14:14:82:479:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:between regions; and (ii) what are the reasons that explain these differences within 
15:682:39126:14:14:82:123:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:regions. 
15:683:39135:14:14:82:85:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
15:684:39135:14:13:82:465:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The dimensional cut-off value chosen for this assessment is two. Discussing the 
15:685:39215:13:14:82:495:290:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:appropriateness of such value is beyond the scope of this exercise. As discussed in the 
15:686:39303:14:14:82:498:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:previous section, we do not seek to uncover a “true” incidence of poverty and compare 
15:687:39389:14:14:82:516:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:this value against official figures. Our previous analysis was conducted in relative terms14 
15:688:39481:14:14:82:492:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and for a given set of attributes, and we have intentionally avoided prioritizing any of 
15:689:39570:14:13:82:485:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:them. At this stage, however, the analysis requires us to select a dimensional cut-off 
15:690:39657:13:14:82:491:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:value and it is difficult to do so without loosing a considerable degree of impartiality. 
15:691:39747:14:14:82:494:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Thus, and while we claim that the main objective of this exercise is to illustrate how a 
15:692:39836:14:32:82:503:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional approach can aid policy design, we also argue that classifying as poor 
15:693:39924:32:8:82:228:161:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
15:694:39982:8:7:82:250:153:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:13 The dimension adjusted headcount ratio 
15:695:40024:7:12:264:484:146:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:0M (discussed in a previous note), measures the depth of 
15:696:40081:12:11:82:508:134:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:deprivation and, as such, will fall as poor persons are deprived in less dimensions. The headcount ratio, on 
15:697:40190:11:12:82:486:123:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the other hand, will only fall if enough deprivations are removed from the poor so as to be below the 
15:698:40292:12:7:82:203:111:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:dimensional cut-off value (k). 
15:699:40323:7:16:82:504:104:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:14 Note that our previous discussion has focused on the evolution of our comparative measures and not on 
15:700:40427:16:0:82:155:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:their level values.

16:702:40531:14:14:82:306:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:development is not an unreasonable standard.

16:706:40749:14:14:82:496:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:this, their multidimensional headcount for El Salvador in year 2006 was close to 65%, 
16:707:40835:14:14:82:487:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Mexico and Brazil followed behind with indices around 40% and 25%, respectively, 
16:708:40916:14:14:82:451:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:while Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were at the bottom of their ranking with 
16:709:40992:14:13:82:477:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional poverty figures below 10%. As shown in the table above, with a 
16:710:41072:13:14:82:512:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimensional cut-off value of two, Peru’s multidimensional poverty headcount is 56.2% in 
16:711:41160:14:14:82:496:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:year 2008. This places Peru below El Salvador but ahead Mexico and Brazil, a similar 
16:712:41245:14:14:82:478:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:relative position as that obtained if we compare monetary poverty figures for these

18:788:43168:0:14:82:474:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Graph 4 provides more detail on interregional differences and reveals that the PL 
18:789:43249:14:14:82:501:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:indicator is below the multidimensional headcount ratio across all regions. Differences, 
18:790:43338:14:14:82:482:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:however, rage from 34.4 percentage points (in Ucayali) to 7.1 percentage points (in 
18:791:43422:14:13:82:506:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Apurimac). Combined with the poverty maps, this evidence reveals that the incidence of 
18:792:43509:13:14:82:478:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional poverty is (like its monetary counterpart) concentrated on Peru’s 
18:793:43592:14:14:82:495:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:southern highlands. However, and unlike the monetary measure, the multidimensional 
18:794:43675:14:14:82:512:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:indicator uncovers significant levels of deprivation affecting the northern Amazon area.

18:796:43766:14:13:82:497:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:On an interregional basis, our multidimensional measure instructs the policy maker to

18:798:43937:14:14:82:509:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deprivation throughout the country. An intraregional analysis, however, could reveal that 
18:799:44027:14:14:82:503:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the specific focus of these concerns should differ across regions. This is not particularly 
18:800:44119:14:14:82:472:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:true in our case since in all regions, except Moquegua, the health and/or dwelling 
18:801:44202:14:13:82:492:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:conditions dimensions are among the top two in terms of the incidence of deprivation 
18:802:44287:13:14:82:504:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:among the multidimensional poor (see Table 4). This means that a significant impact on 
18:803:44374:14:14:82:478:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the incidence of multidimensional poverty across most regions could be attained if

19:839:45804:14:14:82:480:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Dwelling conditions is a particularly interesting dimension since nearly 76% of the 
19:840:45888:14:14:82:503:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional poor (at the national level) are deprived from it. A closer look reveals 
19:841:45978:14:13:82:480:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that most of this deprivation status is due to the lack of access to an adequate water

19:847:46232:14:14:82:85:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
19:848:46232:14:14:82:491:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In this analysis we have pursued two main objectives. First, we wanted to address the 
19:849:46318:14:13:82:499:602:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:apparent controversy between the recent evolution of monetary poverty figures and the 
19:850:46404:13:14:82:428:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:levels of deprivation of the Peruvian population. For this, we relied on a 
19:851:46479:14:14:82:494:575:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional approach for poverty measurement and, in particular, on the Alkire-
19:852:46563:14:14:82:477:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Foster identification methodology. Based on this, we devised a simple comparison 
19:853:46644:14:14:82:494:547:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:framework to measure the tension between the incidence of monetary poverty and the 
19:854:46727:14:13:82:504:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:overall level of deprivation in terms of a set of basic attributes for human development. 
19:855:46817:13:14:82:503:520:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:After choosing dimensions, indicators and cut-off values for the Peruvian case, we built 
19:856:46906:14:14:82:479:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the Alkire-Foster multidimensional poverty headcount and applied the comparison 
19:857:46986:14:14:82:495:492:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:framework proposed, using data for years 2004 and 2008. Our results indicate that the 
19:858:47072:14:14:82:511:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:recent 12 point reduction in the incidence of monetary poverty has not been accompanied 
19:859:47160:14:13:82:495:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:by increased access to other assets important for individuals’ well-being and ability to 
19:860:47249:13:14:82:482:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:develop. Nowadays (and contrary to what happened in 2004), more than half of the 
19:861:47330:14:14:82:469:437:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individuals deprived in 1 to 5 of the 6 dimensions considered are able to pass the 
19:862:47413:14:14:82:511:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:monetary poverty line. An immediate implication is that we currently face a larger risk of 
19:863:47504:14:14:82:493:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:classifying as non-poor individuals who still endure significant deprivation if we only 
19:864:47592:14:13:82:502:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:rely on the monetary dimension for identification purposes. According to 2008 figures, 
19:865:47679:13:14:82:479:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:39% of individuals lacking one third or more of the attributes considered would be 
19:866:47762:14:14:82:504:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:classified as non-poor according to the monetary poverty line. This proportion was only 
19:867:47850:14:14:82:173:354:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:26% in year 2004. 
19:868:47868:14:14:82:85:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
19:869:47868:14:13:82:500:326:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Our second objective was to illustrate how the multidimensional measure proposed can 
19:870:47953:13:14:82:502:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:aid policy design by providing correct incentives to focalize interventions. For this, and 
19:871:48044:14:14:82:486:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in similar fashion as in a recent regional study relying on the same methodology, we 
19:872:48129:14:14:82:512:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:decided to classify as multidimensional poor those individuals deprived in two or more of 
19:873:48219:14:14:82:459:271:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the dimensions considered. Inter and intraregional comparisons made with this 
19:874:48297:14:13:82:442:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identification criterion uncovered several results worth highlighting: (i) the 
19:875:48376:13:14:82:490:244:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional headcount is larger than or equal to the poverty line indicator in all 
19:876:48464:14:14:82:499:230:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:regions; (ii) like its monetary counterpart, the incidence of multidimensional poverty is 
19:877:48554:14:14:82:484:216:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:concentrated on Peru’s southern highlands; (iii) unlike its monetary counterpart, the 
19:878:48640:14:14:82:496:202:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multidimensional indicator uncovers significant deprivation in the northern Amazon;  
19:879:48725:14:13:82:494:188:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(iv) deprivations endured by the multidimensional poor are similar across regions and 
19:880:48811:13:14:82:495:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:concentrated on the health and dwelling conditions dimensions; and (v) at the national 
19:881:48898:14:14:82:461:161:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:level, 76% of the multidimensional poor are deprived in the dwelling condition 
19:882:48977:14:14:82:477:147:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dimension, 74% of these lack an adequate water supply and 52% lack an adequate 
19:883:49056:14:21:82:163:133:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sewage service.  
19:884:49073:21:8:82:228:112:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
19:885:49131:8:16:82:491:104:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:15 In addition, 51.8% lack an adequate sewage service, 25.2% live in a crowded household, and 18.8% 
19:886:49231:16:0:82:203:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:inhabit a precarious dwelling. 
20:887:49264:0:14:82:85:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
20:888:49264:14:14:82:483:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:These last two results have an important policy implication: to achieve a significant 
20:889:49350:14:14:82:500:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reduction in our multidimensional poverty headcount across most regions (and, thus, at 
20:890:49437:14:13:82:495:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the national level), policymakers should focus on the provision of improved water and 
20:891:49523:13:14:82:504:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sanitation services. At the national level, this finding is not at odds with results obtained 
20:892:49617:14:14:82:511:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for several other LAC countries (see Battistón, et al., 2009). Within Peru, the fact that the 
20:893:49711:14:14:82:487:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:main contributor to multidimensional poverty is similar across regions should not be 
20:894:49796:14:14:82:515:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:overlooked as it represents an important opportunity to focalize public investment efforts. 
20:895:49888:14:13:82:85:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
20:896:49888:13:14:82:474:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Finally, further research efforts on the matter could focus on the use of weights to 
20:897:49973:14:14:82:497:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:account for dimensions with different degrees of importance. Alkire and Foster (2008) 
20:898:50059:14:14:82:484:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:discuss how to implement a weighted sum of deprivations, while subjective poverty 
20:899:50141:14:14:82:491:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:measures could be used to estimate these weights. More along the lines of exploiting 
20:900:50226:14:13:82:468:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:these tools to focalize policy interventions, an important extension for education 
20:901:50309:13:14:82:508:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:indicators in Peru would be to account for quality via the results of national standardized 
20:902:50401:14:14:82:489:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tests. The prime challenge to accomplish this, is to match test results with children’s 
20:903:50489:14:14:82:306:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:household characteristics found in our LSMS.
