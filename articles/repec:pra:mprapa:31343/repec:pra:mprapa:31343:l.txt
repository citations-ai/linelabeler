2:23:645:11:11:148:449:544:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:We construct an overlapping generations model in which parents vote on the 
2:24:720:11:11:148:448:533:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:tax rate that determines publicly provided education and offspring choose their 
2:25:800:11:11:148:451:522:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:effort  in  learning  activities.  The  technology  governing  the  accumulation  of  
2:26:886:11:11:148:451:511:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:human  capital  allows  these  decisions  to  be  strategic  complements.  In  the  
2:27:970:11:11:148:448:500:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:presence of coordination failure, indeterminacy and, possibly, growth volatility 
2:28:1051:11:11:148:449:489:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:emerge.  This  indeterminacy  can  be  eliminated  by  an  institutional  mechanism  
2:29:1136:11:11:148:448:478:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:that commits to a minimum level of public education provision. Given that, in 
2:30:1214:11:11:148:450:467:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:the  latter  case,  the  economy  moves  along  a  uniquely  determined  balanced  
2:31:1297:11:11:148:450:456:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:growth  path,  we  argue  that  such  structural  differences  can  account  for  the  
2:32:1384:11:17:148:346:445:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:negative correlation between volatility and growth.

3:49:1899:0:23:87:192:722:243:g_d0_f8:243:g_d0_f8:C:1   Introduction 
3:50:1916:23:19:87:511:699:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Investment in formal education is one of the most important intergenerational transfers. It is 
3:51:2011:19:20:87:511:680:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:considered  as  a  key  factor  of  economic  growth  and  income  distribution.  Several  aspects  of  
3:52:2115:20:20:87:511:660:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:this  investment  have  been  analysed  in  the  literature.  For  example,  Glomm  and  Ravikumar  
3:53:2215:20:19:87:514:640:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:(1992)  examine  the  effects  of  public  and  private  education  on  long-run  growth  and  
3:54:2310:19:20:87:514:621:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:inequality.  Bénabou  (1996)  considers  how  the  growth  performance  of  an  economy  is  
3:55:2403:20:20:87:515:601:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:influenced   by   the   degree   of   decentralization   of   government   funding   for   education.   
3:56:2507:20:19:87:511:581:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Blankenau and Simpson (2004) show conditions under which the effect of public education 
3:57:2595:19:20:87:510:562:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:spending on growth may be non-monotonic. Cremer and Pestieau (2006) study the design of 
3:58:2683:20:20:87:511:542:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:optimal  education  policy.  Finally,  Kempf  and  Moizeau  (2009)  investigate  the  link  between  
3:59:2784:20:19:87:512:522:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:social  segmentation,  inequality  and  growth  in  an  environment  where  education  is  a  club  
3:60:2884:19:20:87:118:503:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:good.  
3:61:2891:20:20:87:511:483:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     This  paper  complements  the  existing  literature  by  highlighting  the  fact  that,  unlike  the  
3:62:2998:20:20:87:515:463:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:production   of   physical   capital,   the   education   process   involves   the   decisions   of   two   
3:63:3106:20:19:87:513:443:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:consecutive  generations,  parents  and  children.  The  first  generation,  parents/tax  payers,  
3:64:3205:19:20:87:511:424:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:provides the resources for education (e.g., teachers’ salaries, buildings, equipment, etc.) and 
3:65:3301:20:20:87:511:404:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  second,  children/students,  the  time  and  effort  that  are  necessary  to  absorb  knowledge.  
3:66:3405:20:19:87:510:384:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Moreover, insofar as the actions by one generation affect the outcome for the other, one of 
3:67:3497:19:20:87:511:365:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  important  characteristics  that  may  affect  each  generation’s  decisions  and  actions  is  its  
3:68:3603:20:20:87:510:345:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:reflection of how the other will decide and act. Put differently, the education process entails 
3:69:3699:20:19:87:514:325:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  coordination  of  the  decisions  made  by  two  generations,  which  may  be  strategic  
3:70:3794:19:20:87:298:306:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:complements (see, Cooper and John 1988).1    
3:71:3839:20:20:87:510:286:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     The idea that there may be a coordination game inherent in the accumulation of human 
3:72:3928:20:19:87:511:266:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:capital seems particularly relevant in the case of public education, where decisions are often 
3:73:4023:19:20:87:512:247:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:made  collectively  by  a  large  number  of  individuals  through  voting.  More  specifically,  the  
3:74:4126:20:20:87:511:227:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:voters’ support towards public investment for education may depend on the extent to which 
3:75:4216:20:20:87:511:207:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the younger generation will provide the learning effort necessary for allowing them to ‘reap’ 
3:76:4310:20:19:87:514:187:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  benefits  associated  with  more  widely  spread  and  qualitatively  improved  education  
3:77:4406:19:27:87:511:168:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:services.  Nevertheless,  the  return  to  the  young  generation’s  learning  effort  may  be  partially  
3:78:4513:27:9:87:230:141:136:Times:136:Times:C:                                                 
3:79:4561:9:13:87:511:132:40:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:1  Strategic  complementarity  “implies  that  an  increase  in  the  action  of  all  agents  except  agent  i  increases  the  
3:80:4690:13:11:87:510:119:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:marginal return to agent i’s action” (Cooper and John, 1988; p. 445). Hence agent i will respond by raising her 
3:81:4802:11:0:87:138:108:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:activity level. 
4:82:4819:0:20:87:512:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:determined  by  the  qualitative  characteristics  of  the  education  sector  –  characteristics  that  
4:83:4924:20:20:87:512:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:depend  on  public  investment.  One  expects  that  such  cross-generational  interactions  will  
4:84:5023:20:19:87:511:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:have important repercussions for human capital accumulation and, consequently, economic 
4:85:5111:19:20:87:512:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth.  Nevertheless,  the  aforementioned  literature  on  public  education  and  growth  has  
4:86:5209:20:20:87:511:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:largely neglected the strategic complementarities that are inherent to decisions of coexisting 
4:87:5304:20:19:87:510:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:cohorts of agents with different objectives – decisions which jointly determine the formation 
4:88:5398:19:20:87:171:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:of human capital.  
4:89:5417:20:20:87:513:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     Our  analysis  builds  upon  an  overlapping  generations  model  in  which  the  engine  of  
4:90:5516:20:20:87:511:568:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth  is  the  accumulation  of  human  capital.  The  actions  of  both  young  (offspring)  and  
4:91:5617:20:19:87:510:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:adults (parents) affect the formation of human capital. In particular, the parents vote on the 
4:92:5712:19:20:87:510:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:tax rate that determines the revenue available to the government for the provision of public 
4:93:5805:20:20:87:511:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:education,  while  the  offspring  decide  on  the  effort  they  devote  towards  learning  activities.  
4:94:5911:20:19:87:513:489:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:The  technology  governing  the  evolution  of  human  capital  allows  these  decisions  to  be  
4:95:6009:19:20:87:512:470:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:strategic  complements.  Specifically,  in  equilibrium,  the  effort  devoted  by  the  young  is  an  
4:96:6113:20:20:87:513:450:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:increasing  function  of  the  tax  rate  chosen  by  parents  which,  by  itself,  is  an  increasing  
4:97:6217:20:19:87:279:430:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:function of the offspring’s learning effort. 
4:98:6262:19:20:87:510:411:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     First, we show that a coordination failure may arise and multiple equilibria emerge. These 
4:99:6358:20:20:87:511:391:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:equilibria  are  Pareto-ranked.  They  include  an  equilibrium  in  which  both  cohorts  choose  no  
4:100:6461:20:19:87:511:371:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:provision  (i.e.,  no  effort  by  offspring  and  a  zero  tax  rate  chosen  by  parents),  and  equilibria  
4:101:6572:19:20:87:510:352:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:entailing positive effort by the young and a positive tax rate by the adult voters.  Thus, as in 
4:102:6669:20:20:87:510:332:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Redding (1996) and Palivos (2001) among others, our paper provides an explanation for the 
4:103:6759:20:20:87:512:312:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:persistent  disparities  in  the  world  distribution  of  incomes  and  growth  rates,  which  differs  
4:104:6864:20:19:87:511:292:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:from the “path dependence” hypothesis – a hypothesis that has been criticized on the basis 
4:105:6955:19:20:87:511:273:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:that  many  industrialized  countries  did  not  happen  to  be  rich  at  the  initial  stages  of  their  
4:106:7063:20:20:87:510:253:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:development and yet the managed to cross the threshold level. 2 Why is it that currently poor

4:109:7306:20:20:87:512:194:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:coordination  offers  support  for  some  type  of  government  intervention  (be  it  in  terms  of  
4:110:7408:20:33:87:512:174:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:economic  policy  or  a  more  structural/institutional  reform)  that  is  designed  to  induce  the

4:112:7559:9:13:87:510:132:40:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:2 Examples of path-dependent multiple equilibria are provided in the analyses of Azariadis and Drazen (1990), 
4:113:7669:13:11:87:512:119:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:Galor  and  Zeira  (1993),  Ceroni  (2001)  and  Chakraborty  (2004)  among  others.  For  evidence  regarding  the

5:116:7975:20:20:87:512:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:subsequently  consider  an  institutional  reform  that  could  induce  the  selection  of  the  “high  
5:117:8079:20:19:87:514:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth/high  welfare”  equilibrium.  In  particular,  we  show  that  the  commitment  to  a  
5:118:8173:19:20:87:517:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:sufficiently   high   tax   can   achieve   this   objective   and,   therefore,   eliminate   growth   
5:119:8277:20:20:87:156:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:indeterminacy. 
5:120:8292:20:19:87:511:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          In  addition  to  the  above,  we  are  able  to  show  that  one  of  the  most  pervasive  empirical  
5:121:8406:19:20:87:512:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:regularities  in  macroeconomic  data,  the  negative  relation  between  output  growth  and  its  
5:122:8506:20:20:87:510:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:volatility, can be attributed to the intergenerational complementarities as well as to the public 
5:123:8604:20:20:87:514:568:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:sector’s  institutional  arrangements.3  The  explanation  we  offer  works  as  follows.  The  
5:124:8700:20:19:87:511:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:existence  of  multiple  growth  equilibria  possesses  an  additional  explanatory  power  when  it  
5:125:8802:19:20:87:511:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:comes to the overall macroeconomic performance. In a dynamic setting, there is nothing to 
5:126:8892:20:20:87:510:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:preclude the possibility that in some periods agents may choose actions associated with high 
5:127:8985:20:19:87:511:489:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth while in other periods they may choose actions associated with low growth. Periods 
5:128:9075:19:20:87:511:470:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:of strong economic activity may be followed by periods of weak economic activity and vice 
5:129:9165:20:20:87:513:450:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:versa,  depending  on  how  some  agents  expect  others  to  behave  and  act.  Thus,  growth  
5:130:9261:20:19:87:513:430:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:indeterminacy  is  inherently  linked  with  the  idea  of  growth  volatility.  We  show  that  the  
5:131:9363:19:20:87:511:411:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:average  growth  rate  in  this  case  is  lower  compared  to  the  uniquely  determined  growth  rate  
5:132:9468:20:20:87:445:391:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:that emerges in the presence of a minimum commitment to public education.   
5:133:9544:20:19:87:510:371:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     By providing an alternative suggestion, our analysis may be viewed as complementary to a 
5:134:9638:19:20:87:511:352:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:series  of  theoretical  papers  that  employ  stochastic  growth  models  in  order  to  examine  the  
5:135:9742:20:20:87:511:332:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:impact of public policy on the growth-volatility nexus (e.g., Turnovsky, 2000; Blackburn and 
5:136:9835:20:19:87:510:312:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Pelloni, 2004; Chatterjee et al., 2004; Varvarigos, 2007). In these models, exogenous variations 
5:137:9932:19:20:87:512:293:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:in  policy  parameters  cause  changes  in  both  the  average  growth  rate  and  its  volatility.  In  
5:138:10037:20:20:87:510:273:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:contrast, we attribute this relation to the structural characteristics pertaining to the endogenous 
5:139:10136:20:20:87:232:253:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:determination of public policy.  
5:140:10169:20:19:87:510:233:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     The implications from our model share some similarities with those in the interesting and 
5:141:10264:19:20:87:512:214:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:important,  but  largely  neglected,  paper  of  Glomm  and  Ravikumar  (1995).  They  also  show  
5:142:10363:20:20:87:512:194:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:that  the  presence  of  endogenously  determined  public  spending  may  generate,  rather  than  
5:143:10462:20:19:87:510:174:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:eliminate, equilibrium indeterminacy, sending thus a cautionary message regarding the role of 
5:144:10556:19:25:87:511:155:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:public  policy.  Nevertheless,  there  are  also  significant  differences  between  their  analysis  and  
5:145:10663:25:8:87:230:130:136:Times:136:Times:C:                                                 
5:146:10711:8:14:87:511:122:40:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:3  Evidence  on  the  negative  relation  between  output  growth  and  its  volatility  is  provided  by  Turnovsky  and  
5:147:10834:14:0:87:429:108:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:Chattopadhyay (2003), Hnatkovska and Loayza (2005) and Badinger (2010) among others. 
6:148:10920:0:20:87:511:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:ours. Firstly, they do not examine the relation between growth and volatility as we do in this 
6:149:11015:20:20:87:512:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:paper.  Secondly,  the  mechanism  leading  to  their  result  is  different  as  it  rests  on  the  ideas  
6:150:11124:20:19:87:510:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:that, (i) the young generation’s education effort depends on the expectation of the future tax 
6:151:11219:19:20:87:511:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:rate that will be chosen by the same generation when it becomes old, and (ii) the chosen tax 
6:152:11312:20:20:87:511:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:rate  depends  on  aggregate  human  capital  due  to  the  fact  that  the  ‘warm  glow’  argument  in  
6:153:11417:20:19:87:510:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the utility function is introduced with CRRA coefficient which is different in comparison to 
6:154:11510:19:20:87:512:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  one  attached  to  the  remaining  utility  arguments;  therefore,  their  result  is  not  due  to  
6:155:11616:20:20:87:510:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:strategic complementarities in the decision making process of two distinct cohorts of agents. 
6:156:11710:20:20:87:512:568:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Put  differently,  we  find  multiple  equilibria  even  with  simple  functional  forms  that  imply  
6:157:11813:20:19:87:512:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:uniqueness  in  their  model.  Moreover,  equilibria  cannot  be  Pareto  ranked  in  their  model,  
6:158:11914:19:20:87:511:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:whereas,  in  our  case,  the  high-growth  equilibrium  yields  higher  welfare.  Finally,  when  their  
6:159:12020:20:20:87:511:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:parameter values allow multiple equilibria, they find an inverse relation between the tax rate 
6:160:12115:20:19:87:514:489:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:and  income.  In  contrast,  our  model  shows  that  the  high-growth  equilibrium  actually  
6:161:12210:19:20:87:282:470:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:corresponds to the relatively high tax rate.  
6:162:12256:20:20:87:512:450:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          Although  this  last  result  appears  to  be  in  contrast  to  conventional  wisdom,  it  is  not  
6:163:12367:20:19:87:514:430:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:completely  at  odds  with  existing  empirical  evidence,  especially  when  considering  the  
6:164:12463:19:20:87:512:411:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:productive  use  of  tax  receipts  in  our  model.  While  many  analyses  are  unable  to  derive  a  
6:165:12567:20:20:87:513:391:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:decisive  conclusion  on  the  growth  effects  of  taxation  and  public  spending  –  see  Myles  
6:166:12667:20:19:87:511:371:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:(2000), Agell et al. (2006) and Bania et al.  (2007)  for  example  –  when  econometric  methods  
6:167:12766:19:20:87:510:352:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:account for the productive use of public spending (infrastructure investment, education etc.) 
6:168:12860:20:20:87:513:332:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:then  there  is  supportive  evidence  of  positive  effects  from  taxation/public  spending  to  
6:169:12959:20:20:87:510:312:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:economic growth (e.g., Mofidi and Stone, 1990; Pereira, 1998; Kneller et al., 1998; Cohen and 
6:170:13053:20:19:87:511:292:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Paul, 2004). In fact, in his survey of the relevant literature, Poot (2000) claims that “the most 
6:171:13151:19:20:87:511:273:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:conclusive results in the literature relate to the positive impact of education expenditures on 
6:172:13247:20:20:87:512:253:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth”  (Poot,  2000;  p.  516)  –  thus,  providing  further  support  on  this  element  of  our  
6:173:13348:20:19:87:142:233:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:results.        
6:174:13364:19:20:87:510:214:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the general set-up of the 
6:175:13462:20:20:87:510:194:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:model. Section 3 establishes the existence of multiple equilibria and analyzes its implications. 
6:176:13559:20:19:87:511:174:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Section  4  shows  that  growth  indeterminacy  can  be  eliminated  with  partial  commitment  on  
6:177:13659:19:20:87:511:155:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:behalf of the government. Section 5 examines the same issue under alternative arrangements 
6:178:13750:20:20:87:362:135:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:regarding the agents’ timing of choices. Section 6 concludes.

7:180:13813:0:23:87:240:722:243:g_d0_f8:243:g_d0_f8:C:2   The Basic Structure 
7:181:13837:23:19:87:511:699:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:We consider an overlapping generations economy in which time is discrete and indexed by 
7:182:13925:19:22:104:513:680:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:A:0,1, 2...t=.  Each  period,  a  cohort  of  unit  mass  is  born.  Agents  within  the  cohort  are  
7:183:14026:22:19:87:510:658:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:identical and live for two periods. They are ‘young’ (or ‘offspring’) in the first period of their 
7:184:14125:19:20:87:510:639:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:lifetime and ‘old adults’ (or ‘parents’) in the second. All agents are endowed with one unit of 
7:185:14221:20:20:87:513:619:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:time  in  each  period.  The  young  allocate  it  between  activities  that  augment  their  human  
7:186:14322:20:19:87:513:599:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:capital  (e.g.,  formal  schooling)  and  leisure.  The  old,  on  other  hand,  supply  their  time,  
7:187:14425:19:20:87:514:580:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:combined  with  their  human  capital  (determining  knowledge,  efficiency  and  expertise),  
7:188:14520:20:20:87:511:560:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:inelastically  to  firms  in  exchange  for  the  prevailing  market  wage.  Adults  are  also  ‘voters’  in  
7:189:14630:20:20:87:511:540:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  sense  that  they  cast  a  vote  on  their  preferred  tax  rate  that  the  government  imposes  on  
7:190:14738:20:19:87:510:520:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:their labour income. Their disposable income (i.e., the residual after taxation) finances their 
7:191:14834:19:20:87:513:501:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:consumption.  The  revenues  collected  by  the  government  are  utilised  so  as  to  finance  
7:192:14931:20:20:87:514:481:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:activities  that  support  the  qualitative  characteristics  of  education  (e.g.,  the  quality  of  
7:193:15034:20:19:87:516:461:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:schools/colleges/universities,   scholarships,   research   and   teaching   support   etc.)   and,

7:199:15544:22:20:87:513:323:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:implicitly  assume  that  children’s  consumption  is  incorporated  into  the  consumption  of  
7:200:15641:20:20:87:511:303:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:parents.  The  last  term  of  the  utility  function  indicates  that  parents  are  imperfectly  altruistic

10:302:21890:0:21:87:511:726:137:g_d0_f6:137:g_d0_f6:B:chooses the amount of resources that will be allocated to public education by casting a vote 
10:303:21983:21:23:87:511:705:137:g_d0_f6:137:g_d0_f6:B:on the preferred tax rate tτ. At the same time, the child chooses the amount of her time, or 
10:304:22076:23:22:87:512:682:137:g_d0_f6:137:g_d0_f6:B:equivalently  her  effort,  te,  that  she  will  devote  on  schooling.  Nevertheless,  when  deciding  
10:305:22181:22:20:87:510:660:137:g_d0_f6:137:g_d0_f6:B:her choice variable, each player takes the action of the other player as given. If we substitute

10:359:23115:47:21:87:510:345:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     These results merit some discussion. First of all, we see that corner solutions are possible 
10:360:23213:21:22:87:512:324:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:and,  as  a  result,  0tteτ==  is  an  equilibrium.  Evidently,  this  is  due  to  the  effect  of  the  
10:361:23319:22:22:87:510:302:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:composite term γ which stems, mainly, from the presence of the parameter v. The intuition 
10:362:23409:22:26:87:510:280:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:is that, as long as 0v>, the marginal utility has a finite upper bound for zero values of te or 
10:363:23505:26:20:93:515:254:45:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f6:A:tτ.   Therefore,   such   choices   are   possible   due   to   the   fact   that   utility   may   become   
10:364:23614:20:19:87:512:234:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:monotonically  decreasing  in  these  arguments.  Secondly,  as  indicated  in  (11),  children  will  
10:365:23717:19:20:87:511:215:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:devote a positive level of effort or time in schooling only if they expect a minimum level of 
10:366:23811:20:20:87:513:195:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:resources  allocated  to  public  education.  Moreover,  if  positive,  the  effort  on  schooling  
10:367:23911:20:19:87:512:175:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:depends  negatively  on  v, the  fraction  of  human  capital  transferred  to  the  next  generation  
10:368:24014:19:22:87:510:156:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:without any effort, and positively on the efficiency of the schooling system (φ) and the wage 
10:369:24108:22:20:87:511:134:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:rate (A) (see equation 9). Thirdly, parents behave analogously (see equations 10 and 11). In 
10:370:24200:20:0:87:511:114:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:particular,  they  require  a  minimum  level  of  effort  from  the students,  before  they  decide  to  
11:371:24306:0:20:87:512:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:allocate  a  positive  fraction  of  the  existing  resources  on  public  education.  This  fraction,  if  
11:372:24414:20:22:87:392:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:positive, depends also negatively on v and positively on φ and A.  
11:373:24481:22:23:87:511:684:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          As  indicated  above,  additional  interior  solutions  with  both  te  and  tτ  being  positive  are  
11:374:24594:23:19:87:514:661:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:possible  as  well,  meaning  that  the  model  may  actually  admit  multiple  equilibria.  The  
11:375:24692:19:20:87:512:642:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:underlying  cause  of  multiple  equilibria  in  this  framework  is  the  strategic  complementarity  
11:376:24795:20:20:87:510:622:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:between the decisions of the two groups, which mutually reinforce one another (see Cooper 
11:377:24885:20:19:87:511:602:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:and  John,  1988).  More  specifically,  as  it  can  be  seen  form  equations  (9)  and  (10),  a  higher  
11:378:24994:19:20:87:510:583:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:activity by one cohort of agents induces the other cohort to increase its activity as well. Once 
11:379:25091:20:21:87:510:563:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:more, the presence of the parameter v (which implies a positive γ) is responsible for these 
11:380:25183:21:23:87:510:542:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:effects. We can clearly see that when 0v= (0γ=), both solutions become invariant to each 
11:381:25272:23:22:87:510:519:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:other. The intuition is that, for 0v=, the marginal utilities of both te and tτ depend only on 
11:382:25367:22:20:87:513:497:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  relative  weights  of  the  utility  arguments  that  they  ultimately  affect  (in  this  case,  the  
11:383:25475:20:23:87:512:477:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:arguments  are  equally  weighted).  When  0v>,  however,  the  marginal  utility  of  te (tτ)  is  
11:384:25575:23:23:87:513:454:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:increasing  in  tτ (te).  Following  increases  in  these  variables,  individuals  will  restore  the  
11:385:25679:23:20:87:514:431:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:equilibrium  by  taking  the  appropriate  action  so  as  to  reduce  their  marginal  utility  –  
11:386:25779:20:23:87:512:411:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:something  they  can  do  with  an  increase  in  te (tτ)  .  In  terms  of  intuition,  a  higher  tax  rate  
11:387:25890:23:19:87:510:388:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:implies an increase in publicly provided education, therefore an increase in the benefits from 
11:388:25985:19:20:87:510:369:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:devoting effort towards human capital accumulation. Similarly, a greater education effort by 
11:389:26078:20:20:87:512:349:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  young  increases  their  parents’  marginal  utility  benefit  of  foregoing  consumption  and  
11:390:26179:20:20:87:511:329:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:choosing a higher tax rate, a benefit that is due to the presence of the ‘warm-glow’ element 
11:391:26272:20:166:87:183:309:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:in their preferences.

12:447:27135:20:20:87:510:327:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:The next step of our analysis is to examine whether the multiplicity of equilibria rests upon 
12:448:27229:20:19:87:511:307:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the presence of a coordination failure in the decision making process by the young and the 
12:449:27320:19:20:87:512:288:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:old.  In  contrast  to  Glomm  and  Ravikumar  (1995)  and  Palivos  (2001),  whose  frameworks  
12:450:27417:20:20:87:512:268:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:involve  trade-offs  that  do  not  allow,  in  general,  the  Pareto  ranking  of  equilibria,  we  can  
12:451:27523:20:19:87:231:248:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:establish such ranking through

12:453:27555:20:20:87:342:209:136:g_d0_f8:136:g_d0_f7:C:Lemma 1. The three equilibria are ranked in the Pareto sense.  
12:454:27617:20:19:87:90:189:136:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f7:C: 
12:455:27617:19:20:87:511:170:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     To complete the characterisation of the different equilibria, we need to address the issue 
12:456:27713:20:16:87:512:150:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:of  their  stability.  In  other  words,  we  need  to  consider  whether  small  perturbations  in  the  
12:457:27819:16:10:87:230:134:136:Times:136:Times:C:                                                 
12:458:27867:10:16:87:511:124:40:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:8  The  equality  between  the  equilibrium  values  of  te  and  tτ  follows  from  the  equal  weights  in  the  three  
12:459:27989:16:0:87:467:108:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:arguments in the utility function (equation 1). For further details, see Palivos and Varvarigos (2009).  
13:460:28096:0:20:87:511:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:neighbourhood of each set of equilibrium choices will leave these choices unaffected or not. 
13:461:28189:20:20:87:510:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:As it is known from the analysis of Cooper and John (1988), not all possible equilibria of a 
13:462:28282:20:20:87:511:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:coordination  game  are  unresponsive  to  such  perturbations,  as  one  of  them  may  be  locally  
13:463:28384:20:22:87:513:666:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:unstable.  In  our  model,  such  an  equilibrium  is  represented  by  the  point  {, }LLeτ.  This  
13:464:28485:22:22:87:514:644:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:becomes  evident  from  the  fact  that  /0Leγ∂∂>  and  /0Lτγ∂∂>  –  results  that  are  
13:465:28574:22:19:87:513:622:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:completely  at  odds  with  the  nature  of  the  best-response  functions  in  (9)  and  (10).  If  
13:466:28675:19:21:87:513:603:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:anything,  we  would  expect  that  both  cohorts  choose  lower  values  when  the  composite  
13:467:28771:21:21:87:510:582:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:parameter  term  γ  is  higher,  as  they  actually  do  at  {, }HHeτ.  Thus,  the  point  {, }LLeτ 
13:468:28870:21:20:87:512:561:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:represents  nothing  else  but  a  threshold  which,  in  conjunction  with  agents’  expectations  of  
13:469:28974:20:22:87:510:541:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:how others will act, determines which of the two stable equilibria – i.e., {0, 0} or {, }HHeτ – 
13:470:29070:22:22:87:510:519:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:will prevail. For example, consider that each cohort makes a choice x, where ,xeτ=. If one 
13:471:29161:22:22:87:510:497:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:cohort  expects  the  other  to  choose  Lxx< (Lxx>),  then  it  will  choose  0  (Hx). 
13:472:29249:22:22:87:511:475:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Anticipating  this,  the  other  cohort  will  choose  0Lx< (HLxx>),  thus  verifying  the  initial

13:476:29395:21:20:87:510:391:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:As we have seen, when decisions by the young and the old within a given period are strategic 
13:477:29488:20:19:87:510:371:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:complements, and in the presence of a coordination failure, the model can generate multiple 
13:478:29580:19:20:87:512:352:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:equilibria.  Moreover,  what  is  particularly  interesting  with  our  analysis  is  the  idea  of  output  
13:479:29689:20:23:87:511:332:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth  indeterminacy  that  arises  because  any  of  the  two  equilibria  can  prevail:  for  a  given  
13:480:29796:23:20:98:511:309:45:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f6:A:tH, next period’s human capital (which, in equilibrium, satisfies 11tthH++=) can take more 
13:481:29887:20:20:87:511:289:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:than one possible values. The indeterminacy of equlibria, which, as argued intuitively above 
13:482:29980:20:19:87:510:269:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f7:B:and shown formally in Sections 4 and 5 below, emerges because of the endogenous determination 
13:483:30074:19:20:87:361:250:136:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f6:B:of public policy, has the following two additional implications.  
13:484:30140:20:23:87:511:230:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     Firstly, it results in indeterminacy of the growth rate of output and human capital, since

13:486:30332:18:8:87:230:189:136:Times:136:Times:C:                                                 
13:487:30380:8:15:87:510:181:40:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:9 Notice that this notion of instability differs from the one applied in variables that display an explicit dynamic 
13:488:30496:15:14:87:510:166:95:g_d0_f6:94:g_d0_f6:F:pattern. More formally, let ()ttefτ=and Φ()ttτe= denote the best-response function of the children and the 
13:489:30603:14:14:87:510:152:94:g_d0_f6:94:g_d0_f6:F:parents, respectively, when    ,0.tteτ> A (Nash) equilibrium is said to be stable if, starting from any point in its 
13:490:30720:14:13:87:510:138:94:g_d0_f6:94:g_d0_f6:F:neighbourhood, the adjustment process in which players take turns myopically playing a best response to each 
13:491:30829:13:15:87:510:125:94:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:other’s  current  strategies  converges  to  the  equilibrium.  This  requires  that  1(Φ),f−′′<  which,  using  (9)  and  
13:492:30952:15:0:87:390:110:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:(10), is equivalent to 1/ 4.τ>Hence, {, }LLeτis unstable and {, }HHeτis stable.  
14:493:31035:0:20:87:513:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:illustrates  the  stylised  fact  of  ‘club’  convergence,  without  resorting  to  the  problematic  
14:494:31137:20:20:87:510:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:scenario in which growth/development paths depend on initial conditions or endowments – 
14:495:31225:20:19:87:512:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:problematic  in  the  sense  that  the  suggestion  that  some  countries  are  currently  rich  simply  
14:496:31330:19:20:87:511:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:because they happened to be rich before does not appear to be historically  accurate.  Other  
14:497:31424:20:20:87:510:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:analyses that arrive to similar conclusions, but under different settings, are those of Redding 
14:498:31520:20:19:87:511:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:(1996)  and  Palivos  (2001).  In  the  former,  strategic  complementarities  between  workers  and  
14:499:31622:19:20:87:512:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:entrepreneurs  imply  that,  over  some  range  of  parameter  values,  multiple  growth  equilibria  
14:500:31724:20:20:87:512:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:may  emerge.  In  the  latter,  the  complementarities  generated  by  the  existence  of  family-size  
14:501:31828:20:20:87:512:568:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:norms  imply  indeterminate  fertility  choices  and,  given  the  trade-off  between  child-rearing  
14:502:31930:20:19:87:337:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f8:B:and educational attainment, multiple growth equilibria. 
14:503:31985:19:20:87:511:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     The second significant implication of indeterminacy is that the growth rate of output may 
14:504:32080:20:21:87:512:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:not  settle  down  to  a  balanced  growth  path,  instead  its  behaviour  may  display  a  periodic  
14:505:32183:21:23:87:512:488:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:pattern.  In  fact,  any  of  the  two  equilibria  {}0, 0  and  {},HHeτ  may  prevail  during  each  
14:506:32285:23:21:87:383:465:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:distinct period [0,    )t∈∞.10 We can formalise this argument with

14:512:32577:20:20:87:512:342:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          The  idea  of  volatile  growth  is  absent  from  the  analysis  of  Redding  (1996)  because  he  
14:513:32687:20:19:87:512:322:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:employs  a  framework  in  which  the  economy  terminates  at  the  end  of  the  second  period,  
14:514:32787:19:20:87:511:303:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:implying  that  interactions  among  agents  occur  only  once:  consequently,  multiple  equilibria  
14:515:32889:20:20:87:510:283:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:cannot be considered as a sign of periodic fluctuations in economic activity. In this respect, 
14:516:32984:20:19:87:511:263:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:our framework shares more similarities with the analysis of Palivos (2001) in the sense that 
14:517:33077:19:23:87:511:244:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:both employ full-fledged dynamic settings which allow interactions between agents to occur

14:519:33216:8:14:87:510:213:40:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:10  An  important  feature  that  leads  to  the  emergence  of  multiple  equilibria  is  the  assumption  that  individuals  
14:520:33343:14:11:87:510:199:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:decide optimally on how much time or effort they devote towards learning activities. Some may argue that the 
14:521:33452:11:11:87:511:188:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:introduction  of  compulsory  schooling  may  invalidate  this  idea,  in  which  case  multiple  equilibria  (and  growth  
14:522:33576:11:11:87:510:177:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:volatility)  disappear.  However,  there  are  strong  arguments  against  this  conjecture.  First,  even  if  attendance  to  
14:523:33704:11:12:87:511:166:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:some basic education (schooling) is mandatory, there are always elements in the education system that are not 
14:524:33814:12:13:87:510:154:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:compulsory (e.g., higher education). Second, even if someone interprets te in the narrow sense of  ‘schooling’ 
14:525:33925:13:11:87:511:141:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:(which we do not), there are still qualitative characteristics that justify our approach: although individuals may 
14:526:34040:11:11:87:510:130:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:have to spend a fixed amount of time at school, how much effort they are going to devote during their studies 
14:527:34150:11:11:87:511:119:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:is  an  element  of  their  own  decision  making  process.  The  large  differences  in  performance  among  pupils  is  
14:528:34272:11:0:87:513:108:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:certainly not an outcome related solely to innate abilities, therefore the element of personal effort is still crucial.   
15:529:34396:0:20:87:513:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:at  every  distinct  period.  Like  we  do  in  this  paper,  he  recognises  that  multiplicity  and  
15:530:34499:20:20:87:513:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:indeterminacy  are  sources  of  growth  volatility.  In  a  framework  which  is  closer  to  ours,  
15:531:34601:20:19:87:512:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Glomm  and  Ravikumar  (1995)  also  discuss  the  possibility  of  cycles  due  to  the  presence  of  
15:532:34705:19:20:87:511:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:multiple equilibria. In their model, these arise (under some parameter specifications) because 
15:533:34800:20:20:87:512:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  future  tax  rate,  which  depends  on  future  income,  affects  current  education  decisions  
15:534:34902:20:19:87:478:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:which, partially, determine future income due to the accumulation of human capital.    
15:535:34989:19:20:87:514:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     Notwithstanding  these  common  equilibrium  implications,  our  particular  framework  
15:536:35082:20:20:87:513:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:offers  new  dimensions  in  two  different  respects:  firstly,  in  the  type  of  interactions  that  
15:537:35187:20:20:87:510:568:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:generate these effects and, secondly, in the implications for public policy. The latter issue is 
15:538:35284:20:19:87:510:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:particularly pertinent, that is why we discuss it and analyse it formally in the subsequent part 
15:539:35381:19:20:87:149:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:of our paper. 
15:540:35395:20:23:87:90:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:

15:542:35436:23:20:87:515:463:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Given   that   the   equilibria   are   Pareto-ranked,   there   is   a   clear   scope   for   government   
15:543:35545:20:21:87:512:443:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:intervention  that  will  induce  the  selection  of  the  “high  growth/high  welfare”  equilibrium,  
15:544:35648:21:22:87:511:422:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:represented  by  the  pair  {},HHeτ.  Nevertheless,  the  preceding  analysis  has  shown  that  the  
15:545:35750:22:20:87:512:400:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:underlying  source  of  indeterminacy  and,  therefore,  growth  volatility  is inherently  linked  to  
15:546:35853:20:20:87:510:380:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the endogenous determination of public policy itself. For this reason, it may be instructive to 
15:547:35949:20:19:87:514:360:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:seek  a  more  institutional-oriented  arrangement  that  could  act  as  the  desired  selection  
15:548:36048:19:20:87:150:341:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:mechanism.   
15:549:36061:20:20:87:511:321:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          As  it  will  transpire  from  the  following  analysis,  such  an  institutional  mechanism  exists.  
15:550:36174:20:19:87:513:301:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Suppose  that,  irrespective  of  the  choices  made  by  voters  (which  may  approximate  the

15:552:36367:20:22:87:512:262:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:fraction       (0, 1)s∈  of  the  economy’s  output  for  public  education  expenditures.  Given  the  
15:553:36471:22:19:87:513:240:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:other  assumptions  of  the  model,  s  is  also  the  minimum  tax  rate  that  adults  will  pay  
15:554:36571:19:20:87:510:221:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:irrespective of their choices. However, they may choose to vote for a tax rate which is higher 
15:555:36666:20:23:87:510:201:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:than s. Denoting this incremental tax (i.e., the increment over s) that adults may vote for by

16:573:37223:20:20:87:513:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:a  certain  fraction  of  GDP  or  of  tax  revenue  towards  education  spending  is  not  just  a

16:575:37421:19:20:87:514:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:actually  implemented.  For  example,  Section  8  of  Article  XVI  of  the  California  state

16:627:39020:20:20:87:511:164:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:will  replicate  the  “high  growth/high  welfare”  equilibrium  which  we  derived  in  a  preceding

17:629:39191:0:20:87:512:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:      This  result  is  quite  intuitive.  A  sufficiently  high s  will  induce  the  young  to  choose  a  
17:630:39300:20:20:87:510:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:relatively high effort towards learning activities. The adult voters recognise this and respond

17:649:40721:20:19:87:512:179:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:question  worth  pursuing.  This  strand  of  literature  was  further  stimulated  by  an  increasing  
17:650:40825:19:20:87:511:160:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:number  of  empirical  analyses  (see  footnote  3)  showing  that  growth  rates  are  significantly  –

18:662:41468:19:20:87:510:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:models  such  as  those  of  Turnovsky  (2000),  Blackburn  and  Pelloni  (2004),  Chatterjee  et  al., 
18:663:41572:20:20:87:512:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:(2004)    and  Varvarigos  (2007),  the  decisions  governing  the  formation  of  the  reproducible

18:665:41769:19:20:87:512:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:stochastic  shocks,  therefore  the  average  growth  rate  is  affected  by  the  volatility  of  these  
18:666:41875:20:20:87:511:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f7:B:shocks.  Using  such  frameworks,  the  authors  have  examined  how  exogenous  variations  in  policy  
18:667:41980:20:20:87:379:568:136:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f6:B:parameters affect both the average growth rate and its volatility.    
18:668:42050:20:19:87:510:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     Our analysis can be viewed as providing an alternative suggestion – mainly, the idea that 
18:669:42145:19:20:87:511:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:both differences in growth rates and the incidence of growth volatility are inherently linked 
18:670:42239:20:20:87:512:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:to  the  structural  characteristics  of  endogenously  determined  economic  policy.  On  the  one  hand,  
18:671:42347:20:19:87:513:489:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth  volatility  is  an  outcome  related  to  the  manner  through  which  public  policy  is  
18:672:42446:19:20:87:513:470:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:endogenously  determined;  on  the  other  hand,  such  volatility  may  be  eradicated  by  an  
18:673:42543:20:20:87:510:450:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:institutional mechanism that commits some fraction of the economy’s output towards public 
18:674:42633:20:19:87:409:430:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:education spending. We outline the main implication from this idea in

18:678:42921:20:23:87:432:351:136:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f7:C:in which a minimum commitment eliminates these fluctuations. That is, ˆ()   ()tEηEη<-.

18:680:43008:19:20:87:512:309:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          Contrary  to  the  existing  literature,  our  model  does  not  rely  on  exogenously  introduced  
18:681:43118:20:20:87:511:289:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:random shocks so as to generate growth volatility. Rather, it is the intrinsic uncertainty that 
18:682:43214:20:19:87:511:269:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:is  inherent  in  strategically  complement  decisions,  when  these  are  subjected  to  coordination  
18:683:43318:19:20:87:510:250:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:failure, which is responsible for growth volatility.11 When the structural characteristics of the

18:689:43905:11:11:87:510:163:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:competitive  firms  set  prices  one  period  in  advance.  Given  that  the  decisions  by  firms  within  the  industry  are  
18:690:44033:11:11:87:510:152:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:strategic  complements,  each  one  faces  extrinsic  uncertainty  concerning  its  competitors’  actions  –  uncertainty  
18:691:44156:11:11:87:512:141:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:which  can  be  self-fulfilling  and,  thus,  lead  to  sunspot  equilibria.  They  show  that,  under  certain  parameter  
18:692:44280:11:11:87:509:130:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:restrictions, the mean growth rate of an economy perturbed by sunspot shocks is lower than the growth rate of 
18:693:44390:11:11:87:304:119:95:g_d0_f6:95:g_d0_f6:F:an economy in which sunspot shocks do not emerge.

19:697:44641:20:19:87:467:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:volatility – may be attributed to issues pertaining to the field of public economics.    
19:698:44730:19:20:87:513:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          What  needs  to  be  stressed  at  this  point  is  that  although  we  provide  an  alternative  
19:699:44838:20:20:87:510:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:explanation to that of the aforementioned analyses of stochastic endogenous growth, we do 
19:700:44928:20:19:87:511:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:not view these different suggestions as being mutually exclusive. Rather, we view our result 
19:701:45021:19:20:87:512:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:as  complementary  to  existing  ones  given  that  nothing  precludes  the  possibility  that  the

19:704:45326:20:19:87:510:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:answer on which type of framework is more appropriate in identifying the underlying forces

19:706:45505:20:20:87:512:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:existing  empirical  studies  have  actually  shown  that  models  including  coordination  failures

22:858:51488:20:19:87:511:565:136:g_d0_f8:136:g_d0_f7:C:Proposition 6. There is a negative correlation between volatility and growth, in the sense that the growth

22:860:51718:21:22:87:309:525:136:g_d0_f7:136:g_d0_f7:C:which such fluctuations are absent. That is, ˆtηη<- t∀.

22:862:51776:20:19:87:511:483:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:          Once  more,  the  intuition  for  this  outcome  is  related  to  the  fact  that,  in  the  absence  of

22:867:52196:23:22:87:195:381:243:g_d0_f8:243:g_d0_f8:C:6   Conclusions  
22:868:52213:22:20:87:511:359:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:In the preceding analysis, we have sought to analyse the implications from the fact that the 
22:869:52306:20:20:87:512:339:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:education  process  entails  coordination  of  the  decisions  made  by  distinct  generations  of  
22:870:52406:20:20:87:512:319:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:agents.  Among  other  results,  we  offered  a  novel  explanation  for  the,  empirically  observed,  
22:871:52510:20:19:87:511:299:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:negative correlation between volatility and growth. In particular, we argued that this may be 
22:872:52604:19:20:87:511:280:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:due to the structural characteristics of the endogenous determination of public policy when 
22:873:52696:20:20:87:512:260:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:this  affects  the  accumulation  of  a  growth  promoting  factor  –  in  our  case,  human  capital.  
22:874:52800:20:19:87:510:240:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Furthermore, our framework lies in the class of models that are able to explain convergence 
22:875:52892:19:20:87:510:221:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:in ‘growth clubs’ without resorting to the idea of differences in initial conditions. In terms of 
22:876:52990:20:20:87:513:201:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:policy  implications,  our  analysis  suggests  that  a  credible  policy  of  commitment  towards  
22:877:53090:20:19:87:510:181:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:growth promoting factors (such as education in our particular framework) could lead to both 
22:878:53182:19:20:87:513:162:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:an  increase  in  output  growth  and,  as  an  added  benefit,  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  
22:879:53285:20:0:87:181:142:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:aggregate variability. 
23:880:53310:0:20:87:511:726:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     As mentioned in the Introduction the intergenerational complementarities identified and 
23:881:53403:20:20:87:515:706:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:analyzed   in   this   paper   seem   particularly   relevant   in   the   case   of   public   education.   
23:882:53512:20:19:87:510:686:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Nevertheless, in Palivos and Varvarigos (2010) we analyze the case of private education in a 
23:883:53605:19:20:87:511:667:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:similar framework. There we show that in the case of private education there exists also an 
23:884:53697:20:20:87:512:647:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:intergenerational  externality,  since  when  the  young  decide  how  much  effort  to  devote  on  
23:885:53798:20:19:87:511:627:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:education, they realise that this decision will affect their future spending on their children’s 
23:886:53895:19:20:87:511:608:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:education.  Therefore,  the  parents’  learning  effort  depends  on  their  children’s  effort,  which  
23:887:54000:20:20:87:511:588:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:also  depends  on  their  own  children’s  effort  and  so  on  ad  infinitum.  In  the  end,  because  of  
23:888:54108:20:20:87:514:568:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:the  existence  of  indirect  effects,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  decisions  made  by  two  
23:889:54208:20:19:87:513:548:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:consecutive  generations  are  strategic  complements.  Moreover,  the  additional  channel  of  
23:890:54305:19:20:87:513:529:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:interaction  generates  rich  dynamics  that  may  lead  to  periodic  as  well  as  aperiodic  (i.e.,  
23:891:54409:20:20:87:510:509:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:chaotic) equilibria. Finally, in such a framework, the scope for Pareto-improving government 
23:892:54502:20:19:87:218:489:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:intervention is limited.          
23:893:54536:19:20:87:510:470:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:     Recently there has been a growing literature on the determination and the implications of 
23:894:54631:20:20:87:511:450:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:public funding of education through voting (see Bearse et al. 2005, de la Croix and Doepke 
23:895:54722:20:19:87:512:430:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:2009  and  the  references  therein).  In  this  literature  there  is  some  form  of  heterogeneity,  
23:896:54826:19:20:87:514:411:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:which  makes  voting  non-trivial.  In  addition,  the  parent’s  utility  typically  depends  on  
23:897:54925:20:20:87:513:391:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:spending  on  her  own  consumption  and  on  her  children’s  education.  Nevertheless,  the  
23:898:55020:20:19:87:510:371:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:alternative specification, which is often used in the literature and adopted here, where some 
23:899:55114:19:20:87:510:352:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:variant of the human capital of the children (be it the income or the services generated from 
23:900:55208:20:20:87:513:332:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:it)  enters  the  parental  utility  is  equally  plausible.  The  implications  of  this  specification,  
23:901:55315:20:19:87:514:312:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:especially   in   the   presence   of   the   aforementioned  intergenerational  complementarities,  
23:902:55416:19:20:87:511:293:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:though  interesting  and  potentially  significant,  remain  largely  unexplored.  We  view  this  as  a  
23:903:55522:20:20:87:234:273:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:fruitful avenue for future work.

23:908:55589:22:19:87:511:164:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:First,  notice  that  the  origin  is  an  equilibrium,  since  it  lies  on  both  best  response  functions.  
23:909:55701:19:21:87:511:145:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Moreover,  the  best  response  function  of  the  children,  described  by  equation  (9),  is  upward  
23:910:55806:21:0:87:511:124:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:sloping  and  concave  for  tτγ>,  while  that  of  the  parents,  equation  (10),  is  upward  sloping  
24:911:55913:0:22:87:511:725:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:and convex when solved in terms of te. Hence, the two curves can intersect at most twice. 
24:912:56003:22:28:87:488:703:136:g_d0_f6:136:g_d0_f6:B:Next, substitute (10) in (9) and manipulate algebraically to derive the quadratic equation
