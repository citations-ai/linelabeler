2:27:1163:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study the recent episode of bank failures and provide simple facts to better understand who acquires
2:28:1266:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:failed banks and which forces drive the losses that the FDIC realizes from these sales. We document
2:29:1365:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:three distinct forces related to the allocation of failed banks to potential acquirers. First, a geographically
2:30:1476:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:proximate bank is significantly more likely to acquire a failed bank: only 15% of acquirers do not
2:31:1574:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:have branches within the state. Sales are more local in regions with more soft information. Second,
2:32:1673:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:a failed bank is more likely to be purchased by a bank that has a similar loan portfolio and that offers
2:33:1777:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:similar services, highlighting the role of failed banks’ asset specificity. Third, low capitalization of
2:34:1881:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:potential acquirers decreases their ability to acquire a failed bank and potentially distorts failed bank
2:35:1986:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:allocation. The results are robust to restricting the data to actual bidders, confirming that they are not
2:36:2092:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:driven by auction eligibility criteria imposed by the FDIC. We relate these forces to FDIC losses from
2:37:2194:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:failed bank sales. We organize these facts using the fire sales framework of Shleifer and Vishny (1992).
2:38:2298:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:Our findings speak to recent policies that are predicated on the idea that a bank’s ability to lend is
2:39:2400:14:42:72:498:420:12:Times:12:Times:embodied in its collection of assets and employees and cannot be easily replaced or sold.

3:59:2862:0:17:72:151:722:144:Times:144:Times:I. Introduction 
3:60:2878:17:18:72:75:705:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:61:2878:18:17:72:544:687:144:Times:144:Times:The  great  recession  and  its  aftermath  saw  an  unprecedented  number  of  banks  being  taken  into  
3:62:2985:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:receivership  by  the  FDIC  and  then  sold  at  auctions.  These  failures  impose  substantial  costs  on  
3:63:3095:17:17:71:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:the FDIC: the average cost of a sold failed bank from 2007 to 2013 was approximately 28% of 
3:64:3187:17:18:72:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:the  failed  bank’s  assets.  The  resolution  of  bank  failures  led  to  Deposit  Insurance  Fund  costs  of  
3:65:3300:18:17:72:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:approximately $90 billion, leaving the fund with a negative balance of almost $21 billion at the 
3:66:3397:17:17:72:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:height of the crisis in 2009 (Davison and Carreon, 2010). Small and medium-sized banks, which 
3:67:3491:17:17:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:are typically sold at FDIC auctions, have also been large beneficiaries of government programs 
3:68:3586:17:18:71:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:during the same period.1 For example, the Treasury department does not expect to recover all of 
3:69:3682:18:17:72:544:549:144:Times:144:Times:the $791 million of TARP funds that were awarded to 26 failed banks in our sample (Office of 
3:70:3775:17:17:72:545:532:144:Times:144:Times:the  Special  Inspector  General  for  the  Troubled  Asset  Relief  Program,  2014).  In  spite  of  the  
3:71:3882:17:17:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:importance of failed bank resolutions during the recent crisis, little is known about the forces that 
3:72:3984:17:18:72:489:498:144:Times:144:Times:affect sales of failed banks since the S&L crisis (James and Wier, 1987; James, 1991). 
3:73:4071:18:17:72:75:480:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:74:4071:17:17:72:543:463:144:Times:144:Times:The goal of this paper is to study the recent episode of bank failures and provide simple facts that 
3:75:4172:17:17:72:542:446:144:Times:144:Times:allow us to understand who acquires failed banks and which forces drive the losses that the FDIC 
3:76:4269:17:18:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:realizes  from  these  sales.  We  document  three  distinct  forces  that  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  
3:77:4382:18:17:72:545:411:144:Times:144:Times:banks  to  potential  acquirers:  the  distance  of  a  potential  acquirer  from  the  failed  bank,  the  
3:78:4490:17:17:72:544:394:144:Times:144:Times:similarity of the business of a potential acquirer to that of the failed bank, and the capitalization 
3:79:4592:17:17:72:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  potential  acquirer.  We  show  that  these  forces  are  also  related  to  the  losses  the  FDIC  
3:80:4702:17:18:72:544:360:144:Times:144:Times:realized from bank failures. We conclude by interpreting these facts within the fire sales setting 
3:81:4801:18:17:72:225:342:144:Times:144:Times:of Shleifer and Vishny (1992).  
3:82:4833:17:17:72:75:325:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:83:4833:17:17:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:The first fact we document is that local banks are by far the most likely acquirers of failed banks. 
3:84:4934:17:18:72:544:291:144:Times:144:Times:We  find  striking  results:  only  about  15  percent  of  failed  banks  are  sold  to  a  bank  that  does  not  
3:85:5050:18:17:72:543:273:144:Times:144:Times:currently have branches within the same state, and more than one-third of failed banks are sold to 
3:86:5149:17:17:72:546:256:144:Times:144:Times:a  bank  that  has  at  least  one  branch  in  the  same  zip  code.  Formally  stated,  we  find  that  a  
3:87:5258:17:17:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:geographically proximate bank is significantly more likely to acquire a failed bank. This result is 
3:88:5358:17:18:72:544:222:144:Times:144:Times:robust  to  the  inclusion  of  failed  bank  fixed  effects  and  potential  acquirer/quarter  fixed  effects.  
3:89:5471:18:17:72:543:204:144:Times:144:Times:This implies that this effect is identified not by the inherent quality of the failed bank or of the 
3:90:5572:17:17:72:545:187:144:Times:144:Times:acquirer,  but  rather  by  the  relative  distance  between  the  failed  banks’  and  acquirers’  branch  
3:91:5680:17:17:72:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:networks.  Consistent  with  the  idea  that  soft  information  deteriorates  with  geographic  distance,  
3:92:5788:17:18:72:543:153:144:Times:144:Times:we  find  that  in  regions  with  more  soft  information,  acquisitions  of  failed  banks  by  local  banks  
3:93:5900:18:17:72:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:are more likely. Our evidence is not consistent with the idea that information technology and the 
3:94:5998:17:17:72:542:118:144:Times:144:Times:integration in banking markets have allowed geographically distant banks to acquire failed banks 
3:95:6095:17:25:72:165:101:144:Times:144:Times:(Cochrane, 2013).  
3:96:6114:25:8:72:218:76:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
3:97:6174:8:17:72:543:68:42:g_d0_f4:100:Times:1 State chartered banks, which constitute 65% of failed banks in our sample, received approximately $50 billion of 
3:98:6289:17:0:71:388:51:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:TARP funds to help them absorb liquidity shortfalls during the financial crisis. 
4:99:6373:0:17:72:75:722:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:100:6373:17:18:72:544:705:144:Times:144:Times:We also uncover a second force that affects the allocation of failed banks to potential acquirers: 
4:101:6472:18:17:72:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:differences in banks’ specializations. Some failed banks focus more on consumer lending, others 
4:102:6568:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:on mortgages, still others on commercial loans. We find that failed banks are significantly more 
4:103:6665:17:17:72:545:653:144:Times:144:Times:likely  to  be  sold  to  potential  acquirers  whose  portfolios  of  loans  have  a  similar  composition,  
4:104:6775:17:18:72:545:636:144:Times:144:Times:whether  on  the  dimension  of  residential  real  estate  loans,  commercial  and  industrial  loans,  
4:105:6880:18:17:72:545:618:144:Times:144:Times:consumer  loans,  or  commercial  real  estate  (CRE)  loans.  Banks  also  differ  in  the  services  they  
4:106:6989:17:17:72:544:601:144:Times:144:Times:offer, with some banks providing insurance and brokerage services while other banks do not. A 
4:107:7083:17:17:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank is more likely to be acquired by a bank that offers similar services. Failed bank and 
4:108:7181:17:18:72:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:acquirer/quarter  fixed  effects  ensure  that  these  results  are  not  driven  by  inherent  characteristics  
4:109:7294:18:17:72:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  failed  bank  or  potential  acquirer;  rather,  it  is  the  relative  similarity  between  the  portfolio  
4:110:7412:17:17:72:544:532:144:Times:144:Times:composition  and  services  offered  by  potential  acquirers  and  a  given  failed  bank  that  explains  
4:111:7520:17:17:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:who  is  most  likely  to  acquire  it.  The  effects  we  document  are  economically  meaningful.  For  
4:112:7626:17:18:72:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:instance,  the  likelihood  of  acquisition  declines  by  a  third  of  the  mean  if  a  potential  acquirer’s  
4:113:7740:18:17:72:478:480:144:Times:144:Times:CRE portfolio share distance from the failed bank differs by one standard deviation. 
4:114:7825:17:17:71:74:463:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:115:7825:17:17:71:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:The third force that affects who acquires a failed bank is the capitalization of potential acquirers. 
4:116:7927:17:18:71:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:We  draw  on  the  insight  from  Shleifer  and  Vishny  (1992)  that  in  auctions  of  distressed  assets  
4:117:8036:18:17:71:543:411:144:Times:144:Times:potential buyers may be distressed as well, and therefore unable to purchase the assets. We show 
4:118:8133:17:17:71:546:394:144:Times:144:Times:a  monotonic  relationship  between  the  capitalization  of  potential  local  acquirers  and  their  
4:119:8236:17:17:71:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:propensity  to  acquire  failed  banks:  the  20%  best  capitalized  local  buyers  acquire  over  30%  of  
4:120:8345:17:18:72:522:360:144:Times:144:Times:failed banks, while the 20% worst capitalized local buyers acquire only 10% of failed banks.  
4:121:8439:18:17:72:75:342:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:122:8439:17:17:72:545:325:144:Times:144:Times:Next  we  examine  how  these  forces  interact  with  each  other  to  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  
4:123:8548:17:17:72:545:308:144:Times:144:Times:banks.  We  want  to  understand  whether  capitalization  of  potential  acquirers  affects  how  failed  
4:124:8655:17:18:72:544:291:144:Times:144:Times:banks  are  allocated  along  the  dimension  of  distance  and  business  similarity.  The  notion  is  that  
4:125:8766:18:17:72:543:273:144:Times:144:Times:even though local banks are the most likely acquirers  of  a  failed  bank,  they  may  not  be  able  to  
4:126:8873:17:17:72:543:256:144:Times:144:Times:take advantage of their higher valuations if they are distressed. Failed banks would then be sold 
4:127:8971:17:17:72:545:239:144:Times:144:Times:to  distant  banks  that  are  better  capitalized  even  if  distant  banks  value  the  failed  banks  less.  
4:128:9083:17:18:72:544:222:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, low capitalization of potential acquirers in related businesses may prevent the sale of 
4:129:9182:18:17:72:319:204:144:Times:144:Times:the failed bank to these otherwise likely acquirers.  
4:130:9236:17:17:72:75:187:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:131:9236:17:17:72:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:Consider local potential acquirers, defined as being within 100 miles of the failed bank. If their 
4:132:9335:17:18:72:549:153:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization   is   at   the   median,   the   probability   of   acquisition   declines   with   distance   
4:133:9446:18:17:72:544:135:144:Times:144:Times:approximately  35%  faster  than  if  the  capitalization  of  local  bidders  is  one  standard  deviation  
4:134:9555:17:17:72:544:118:144:Times:144:Times:below the median. Similarly, local potential acquirers in related lines of business are most likely 
4:135:9655:17:17:72:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:to acquire a failed bank if they are well capitalized. However, low capitalization of these buyers 
4:136:9754:17:18:72:544:84:144:Times:144:Times:forces the sale of a failed bank to acquirers that are in less related lines of  business.  As  before,  
4:137:9859:18:0:72:545:66:144:Times:144:Times:we  obtain  these  results  after  accounting  for  failed  bank  and  acquirer/quarter  fixed  effects,  
5:138:9968:0:17:72:547:722:144:Times:144:Times:implying  that  these  results  are  not  driven  by  inherent  failed  bank  or  potential  acquirer  
5:139:10071:17:18:72:544:705:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics.  Overall,  these  results  suggest  that  the  three  forces  that  affect  the  allocation  of  
5:140:10185:18:17:72:280:687:144:Times:144:Times:failed banks interact in a meaningful way.  
5:141:10229:17:17:72:75:670:144:Times:144:Times: 
5:142:10229:17:17:72:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:There  are  two  broad  channels  that  can  explain  the  results  on  failed  bank  allocation.  Under  the  
5:143:10340:17:18:71:542:636:144:Times:144:Times:first alternative, failed bank allocation is driven by choices of potential acquirers: a bank acquires 
5:144:10443:18:17:71:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:a  failed  bank  because  it  chooses  to  bid  more  for  the  failed  bank  than  other  potential  acquirers,  
5:145:10557:17:17:71:545:601:144:Times:144:Times:which  either  bid  less  or  choose  not  to  participate  in  the  bidding  process.  Under  the  second  
5:146:10665:17:17:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:alternative, the FDIC chooses which banks are allowed to bid in an auction through its eligibility 
5:147:10764:17:18:71:544:567:144:Times:144:Times:criteria,  and  it  is  these  criteria  that  affect  failed  bank  allocation.  To  separate  these  alternatives,  
5:148:10882:18:17:71:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:we compile the list of actual bidders of each failed bank in our sample. We show that our results 
5:149:10980:17:17:71:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:persist even when we constrain our sample to the actual acquirers that have been approved by the 
5:150:11077:17:17:71:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:FDIC and thus satisfy the eligibility criteria. Therefore, our results are unlikely to be driven by 
5:151:11177:17:18:71:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:FDIC eligibility criteria. We reach the same conclusion when we directly impose FDIC criteria 
5:152:11271:18:17:71:296:480:144:Times:144:Times:on the set of potential acquirers in our sample. 
5:153:11320:17:17:71:74:463:144:Times:144:Times: 
5:154:11320:17:17:71:544:446:144:Times:144:Times:The  sale  of  failed  banks  results  in  substantial  costs  to  the  FDIC.  We  show  that  the  costs  to  the  
5:155:11436:17:18:71:546:429:144:Times:144:Times:FDIC  depend  on  the  composition  of  potential  acquirers  for  a  failed  bank,  and  that  this  
5:156:11538:18:17:71:543:411:144:Times:144:Times:composition is related to the forces we describe above. The results described above suggest that 
5:157:11635:17:17:71:544:394:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers  located  close  to  the  failed  bank  and  that  are  in  similar  lines  of  business  are  
5:158:11751:17:17:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:most likely to purchase a failed bank, if they are well capitalized. If their capitalization is low, on 
5:159:11855:17:18:71:542:360:144:Times:144:Times:the other hand, then the failed bank has to be sold to another bank, which presumably values the 
5:160:11952:18:17:71:543:342:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank less. We show that lower capitalization of potential acquirers best suited to purchase 
5:161:12051:17:17:71:544:325:144:Times:144:Times:a  failed  bank  results  in  significantly  higher  cost  of  resolution  for  the  FDIC.  The  20%  of  failed  
5:162:12165:17:17:71:548:308:144:Times:144:Times:banks   with   the   highest   share   of   well-capitalized   local   bidders   have   resolution   costs   of   
5:163:12279:17:18:71:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:approximately 25% of assets. For the lowest quintile, the costs are over 33% of assets. This is a 
5:164:12377:18:17:71:544:273:144:Times:144:Times:large  change  relative  to  a  standard  deviation  of  resolution  costs  of  12%.  We  show  that  these  
5:165:12486:17:17:71:543:256:144:Times:144:Times:results are also robust to accounting for fixed effects of the quarter and the state where the failed 
5:166:12588:17:17:71:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:bank is located, which implies that macroeconomic conditions and regional characteristics of the 
5:167:12685:17:18:71:254:222:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank do not drive our findings. 
5:168:12724:18:17:71:74:204:144:Times:144:Times: 
5:169:12724:17:17:71:544:187:144:Times:144:Times:One possible concern with the last set of results is that the capitalization of local acquirers may 
5:170:12824:17:17:71:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:be  low  because  they  were  exposed  to  the  same  negative  local  shock  as  the  failed  bank.  The  
5:171:12931:17:18:71:543:153:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization of local potential acquirers could then proxy for the severity of regional shocks that 
5:172:13033:18:17:71:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:impact the failed bank. Such a correlated shock would cause both higher costs to the FDIC and 
5:173:13127:17:17:71:543:118:144:Times:144:Times:low  capitalization  of  local  potential  buyers.  We  address  this  concern  by  exploiting  variation  in  
5:174:13238:17:17:71:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization of local buyers that is plausibly exogenous to the regional economic environment 
5:175:13334:17:18:71:544:84:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  failed  bank.  Because  different  parts  of  the  U.S.  were  exposed  to  different  price  declines  
5:176:13447:18:0:71:545:66:144:Times:144:Times:after  2006,  we  establish  that  the  geographic  portfolio  of  a  bank  influences  the  losses  a  bank  
6:177:13560:0:17:72:543:722:144:Times:144:Times:suffers in the aftermath. We then exploit losses that potential acquirers incur due to house price 
6:178:13659:17:18:72:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:drops in regions outside the failed bank’s operational area to instrument for the capitalization of 
6:179:13759:18:17:72:545:687:144:Times:144:Times:local  acquirers.  Since  we  focus  only  on  losses  incurred  outside  the  region  of  the  failed  bank,  
6:180:13870:17:17:72:546:670:144:Times:144:Times:these  losses  are  by  construction  unrelated  to  local  economic  conditions.  The  instrumental  
6:181:13972:17:17:72:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:variable  results  confirm  our  findings.  Last,  we  provide  several  tests  to  ensure  our  results  are  
6:182:14083:17:18:72:545:636:144:Times:144:Times:robust  to  alternative  ways  of  measuring  FDIC  resolution  costs,  and  to  heterogeneity  in  bid  
6:183:14188:18:17:72:150:618:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics.  
6:184:14206:17:17:72:75:601:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:185:14206:17:17:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:We  interpret  the  facts  we  document  within  the  fire  sales  setting  of  Shleifer  and  Vishny  (1992).  
6:186:14318:17:18:72:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:Our first set of results shows that potential acquirers that are located close to a failed bank, and 
6:187:14419:18:17:72:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:that are in similar lines of business, are most likely to purchase it. These acquirers are best suited 
6:188:14522:17:17:72:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:to acquire a failed bank from the perspective of its assets. However, if the capitalization of these 
6:189:14623:17:17:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers  is  low,  then  the  bank  is  sold  to  an  acquirer  that  is  more  distant,  and  whose  business  
6:190:14737:17:18:72:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:lines  are  less  similar,  but  that  is  better  capitalized.  The  latter  values  the  bank  less,  so  the  failed  
6:191:14858:18:17:72:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:bank is not allocated to the best user. By relating these forces to costs of the resolution, we are 
6:192:14958:17:17:72:544:463:144:Times:144:Times:able  to  quantify  the  costs  of  fire  sales  to  the  FDIC.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  sources  of  FDIC  
6:193:15072:17:17:72:545:446:144:Times:144:Times:costs,  which  have  been  measured  in  the  literature  (James,  1991),  we  find  fire  sales  to  be  a  
6:194:15181:17:18:72:256:429:144:Times:144:Times:substantial component of FDIC costs. 
6:195:15218:18:17:72:75:411:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:196:15218:17:17:72:543:394:144:Times:144:Times:Our results are relevant to the current policy debate of whether and how to support the banking 
6:197:15314:17:17:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:system after negative shocks. Supporting the banking system is broadly based on the notion that 
6:198:15410:17:18:72:545:360:144:Times:144:Times:a  bank  is  special,  and  its  ability  to  lend  is  embodied  in  its  collection  of  assets  and  clients’  
6:199:15524:18:17:72:543:342:144:Times:144:Times:relationships with its employees, which may not be easily or quickly replaced. Opponents argue 
6:200:15619:17:17:72:544:325:144:Times:144:Times:that  even  if  a  particular  bank  is  not  easily  replaced,  failed  banks  can  be  sold  efficiently  and  
6:201:15732:17:17:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:swiftly  to  a  large  pool  of  available  banks  in  the  system.  Therefore  bank  support  is  not  needed.  
6:202:15845:17:18:72:545:291:144:Times:144:Times:The  argument  rests  on  the  premise  that  deregulation  and  information  technology  have  made  
6:203:15947:18:17:72:544:273:144:Times:144:Times:selling  banks  efficient.  Our  facts  suggest  that  fire  sales  of  failed  banks  misallocate  bank  assets  
6:204:16061:17:17:72:547:256:144:Times:144:Times:and  employees,  and  provide  an  opportunity  to  measure  some  of  these  costs.  Therefore,  
6:205:16159:17:17:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:policymakers have to weigh the costs of fire sales against costs of supporting banks outright.

6:207:16255:18:17:72:544:204:144:Times:144:Times:Our  paper  is  related  to  several  strands  of  literature.  First,  it  is  most  directly  related  to  the  bank  
6:208:16375:17:17:72:545:187:144:Times:144:Times:failures  literature.  The  literature  has  mostly  studied  the  S&L  crisis  (James  and  Wier,  1987;  
6:209:16482:17:17:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:James, 1991) with a focus on the characteristics of the failed banks or the method the FDIC uses 
6:210:16579:17:18:72:544:153:144:Times:144:Times:to  dispose  them.  We  focus  on  the  allocation  of  the  failed  bank  to  potential  acquirers,  exploring  
6:211:16692:18:17:72:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:the match between the failed bank and the potential acquirer as a key determinant of failed bank 
6:212:16789:17:17:72:545:118:144:Times:144:Times:allocation  and  the  losses  borne  by  the  FDIC.  Our  facts  speak  to  the  literature  that  examines  
6:213:16898:17:17:72:545:101:144:Times:144:Times:whether  government  should  bail  out  failed  banks  when  the  best  users  of  assets  are  liquidity  
6:214:17005:17:18:72:481:84:144:Times:144:Times:constrained (Acharya and Yorulmazer, 2008; Acharya, Shin and Yorulmazer, 2010). 
6:215:17085:18:0:72:75:66:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:216:17088:0:17:72:546:722:144:Times:144:Times:We  also  contribute  to  the  literature  on  relationship  banking  and  the  importance  of  soft  
7:217:17190:17:18:72:545:705:144:Times:144:Times:information  in  loan  production.  The  literature  suggests  that  relationships  add  value  because  
7:218:17295:18:17:72:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:banks have information about borrowers (e.g., Diamond, 1984; James, 1987). The literature also 
7:219:17390:17:17:72:544:670:144:Times:144:Times:argues  that  relationships  increase  the  availability  of  credit  and  reduce  interest  rates  on  loans,  
7:220:17502:17:17:72:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:especially for small firms (e.g., Berger and Udell, 1995; Petersen and Rajan, 2002). Other work 
7:221:17598:17:18:72:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:suggests  that  deregulation  and  technological  change  brought  significant  changes  in  the  banking  
7:222:17705:18:17:72:546:618:144:Times:144:Times:system  (e.g.,  Kroszner  and  Strahan,  1999),  but  small  banks  may  be  able  to  maintain  the  
7:223:17807:17:17:72:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:advantages they gain from relationship banking in the wake of these changes (e.g., Berger et al., 
7:224:17905:17:17:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:1998; Berger et al., 2005). A related recent strand of literature has argued that despite significant 
7:225:18007:17:18:72:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:improvements in financial innovation over the past few years, such as securitization, the location 
7:226:18106:18:17:72:545:549:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  branch  network  still  matters  for  a  bank’s  investment  decisions  (Gilje,  Loutskina  and  
7:227:18212:17:17:72:545:532:144:Times:144:Times:Strahan,  2013).  Our  paper  contributes  to  this  work  by  arguing  that  these  dimensions  play  a  
7:228:18318:17:17:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:critical  role  in  the  allocation  of  failed  banks:  the  information  embedded  in  relationships  is  still  
7:229:18433:17:18:72:533:498:144:Times:144:Times:relevant and must be taken into account when analyzing the effects of bank mergers or failures.

7:231:18529:17:17:72:546:463:144:Times:144:Times:The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  In  Section  II  we  discuss  the  institutional  
7:232:18635:17:17:72:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:background. In Section III we present our data sources. Section IV provides descriptive statistics. 
7:233:18735:17:18:72:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:Sections  V  and  VI  outline  the  main  empirical  results.  Section  VII  discusses  our  findings  in  the  
7:234:18847:18:17:72:470:411:144:Times:144:Times:context of the Shleifer and Vishny (1992) framework, and Section VIII concludes. 
7:235:18928:17:17:72:75:394:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:236:18928:17:17:72:220:377:144:Times:144:Times:II. Institutional Background 
7:237:18957:17:18:72:75:360:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:238:18957:18:17:72:545:342:144:Times:144:Times:Federal  and  state  banking  regulators  regularly  monitor  the  financial  condition  of  depository  
7:239:19062:17:17:71:545:325:144:Times:144:Times:institutions  to  limit  the  risks  of  individual  bank  failures.  If  the  banking  institution  becomes  
7:240:19172:17:17:71:544:308:144:Times:144:Times:critically  undercapitalized,  the  primary  regulator  of  the  depository  institution  will  initiate  the  
7:241:19283:17:18:71:545:291:144:Times:144:Times:resolution  activities  by  sending  a  failing  bank  letter  to  the  FDIC.2  The  FDIC  contacts  the  
7:242:19389:18:17:72:544:273:144:Times:144:Times:management  of  the  failing  depository  institution  and  engages  a  third-party  financial  advisor  to  
7:243:19498:17:17:72:547:256:144:Times:144:Times:compile  initial  information  and  perform  an  asset  valuation  review.  The  financial  advisor  
7:244:19599:17:17:72:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:identifies  a  sample  of  assets  and  estimates  a  loss  factor  in  each  asset  category.  The  FDIC  uses  
7:245:19712:17:18:72:543:222:144:Times:144:Times:these estimates to set the reservation value on the subsequent sale of the assets of the depository 
7:246:19812:18:17:72:307:204:144:Times:144:Times:institution, and chooses the resolution structure.  
7:247:19864:17:17:72:75:187:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:248:19864:17:17:72:547:170:144:Times:144:Times:During  the  recent  financial  crisis,  the  FDIC  chose  the  Purchase  and  Assumption  (P&A)  
7:249:19962:17:18:72:544:153:144:Times:144:Times:transaction  as  the  resolution  method  in  the  great  majority  of  receivership  cases  (roughly  95%).  
7:250:20072:18:17:72:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:Accordingly, we will focus on such transactions in our analysis. In a P&A transaction, the FDIC

8:259:20739:17:17:72:542:670:144:Times:144:Times:After the FDIC gathers financial information and chooses a resolution method, it starts marketing 
8:260:20837:17:17:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:the failed depository institution to a pool of potential buyers that had previously expressed their 
8:261:20937:17:18:72:546:636:144:Times:144:Times:interest  in  bidding  for  failed  institutions.  To  receive  regulatory  approval  to  bid  in  a  P&A  
8:262:21044:18:17:72:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:transaction, the potential bidder must be a chartered financial institution or an investor group that

8:264:21252:17:17:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, the financial institution must be well capitalized and possess a CAMELS rating of 1

8:272:21869:17:17:71:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:documents  suggest  that  the  due  diligence  period  is  merely  four  to  six  days  for  a  team  of  six  to  
8:273:21984:17:18:71:496:429:144:Times:144:Times:eight people, which is severely compressed relative to a typical merger and acquisition.

8:275:22074:17:17:71:545:394:144:Times:144:Times:The  bidding  generally  starts  twelve  to  fifteen  days  before  the  scheduled  closing  of  the  failed  
8:276:22184:17:17:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:bank.  The  bidders  can  place  one  or  more  sealed  bids  for  the  failed  bank.  The  Federal  Deposit  
8:277:22294:17:18:71:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 mandates the FDIC to choose the bid 
8:278:22385:18:17:71:544:342:144:Times:144:Times:that  is  least  costly  to  the  Deposit  Insurance  Fund  (DIF).  To  meet  this  requirement,  the  FDIC  
8:279:22494:17:17:71:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:evaluates all submitted bids using its proprietary least-cost test model and selects the bid whose 
8:280:22593:17:17:71:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:terms entail the least estimated cost for the DIF if those costs are below the reservation value set

8:283:22707:17:17:71:542:256:144:Times:144:Times:When a failing depository institution enters receivership, the claims of the insured depositors are 
8:284:22807:17:17:71:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:transferred  to  the  FDIC,  which  is  subrogated  to  the  claims  of  depositors.  The  FDIC  subrogated  
8:285:22916:17:18:71:544:222:144:Times:144:Times:claim  has  a  first  lien  on  the  proceeds  of  the  receivership.  The  DIF  took  a  loss  on  most  bank  
8:286:23028:18:17:71:542:204:144:Times:144:Times:failures that occurred during the recent financial crisis, suggesting that the receivership proceeds 
8:287:23129:17:17:71:544:187:144:Times:144:Times:do  not  cover  the  FDIC’s  subrogated  claim  and  that  the  FDIC  is  the  residual  claimant  in  most  
8:288:23238:17:17:71:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:receiverships (Hynes and Walt, 2010). Since the beginning of 2008, the DIF lost approximately 
8:289:23332:17:18:71:543:153:144:Times:144:Times:$90 billion due to depository institution failures. The fund reached a negative balance during the 
8:290:23431:18:17:71:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:third quarter of 2009 but has since recovered and stood at $33 billion as of December 31, 2012, 
8:291:23527:17:17:71:543:118:144:Times:144:Times:which corresponded to 0.45% of the total insured deposits in the system (Davison and Carreon, 
8:292:23621:17:17:71:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:2010). The FDIC answered to the large losses on its DIF by raising deposit insurance premiums 
8:293:23715:17:18:71:470:84:144:Times:144:Times:and collecting a special assessment of 5 basis points on all depository institutions.

9:300:24127:17:18:72:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:the  P&A  transaction  as  the  resolution  method  in  467  receiverships.3  In  the  remaining  25  cases,  
9:301:24237:18:17:72:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:there  were  either  no  interested  bidders  or  the  bids  fell  below  the  FDIC’s  reservation  value,  and  
9:302:24350:17:17:72:544:601:144:Times:144:Times:consequently  the  FDIC  opted  for  liquidating  the  estate  of  the  failed  bank  and  paying  off  the  
9:303:24459:17:17:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:insured depositors. We exclude these cases because there is no data on cost of resolution that is

9:306:24568:17:17:72:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:As stated above, the FDICIA mandates the FDIC to choose the least costly option to the DIF. To 
9:307:24663:17:17:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:comply  with  that  mandate,  the  FDIC  estimates  the  cost  of  each  bid  for  the  failed  bank  using  a  
9:308:24775:17:18:72:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:proprietary  algorithm,  and  selects  the  bid  with  the  lowest  estimated  cost.  The  estimated  cost  of  
9:309:24887:18:17:72:542:480:144:Times:144:Times:resolution associated with each P&A transaction is disclosed by the FDIC and is also available in

9:316:25416:17:18:72:544:360:144:Times:144:Times:structure, and asset composition of each commercial and savings bank. To construct the primary 
9:317:25511:18:17:72:543:342:144:Times:144:Times:sample we exclude from the analysis (i) six P&A deals in which the FDIC marketed several bank 
9:318:25605:17:17:72:540:325:144:Times:144:Times:subsidiaries  of  a  single  holding  company  in  the  same  resolution  process;  (ii)  the  government-
9:319:25711:17:17:72:545:308:144:Times:144:Times:assisted  deals  involving  Washington  Mutual  Bank  and  the  IndyMac  Federal  Savings  Bank,  
9:320:25809:17:18:72:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:because their complexity required a special resolution method involving direct negotiation with 
9:321:25905:18:17:72:545:273:144:Times:144:Times:the  interested  bidders;  and  (iii)  the  resolution  process  of  the  Independent  Bankers’  Bank  of  
9:322:26012:17:17:72:543:256:144:Times:144:Times:Springfield, which required the creation of a bridge bank that was later sold to another Bankers’

9:325:26185:18:17:72:543:204:144:Times:144:Times:Bank location data for each commercial and savings bank come from the Summary of Deposits 
9:326:26275:17:17:72:543:187:144:Times:144:Times:(SOD) database provided by the FDIC. This database contains information on the geographical 
9:327:26367:17:17:72:546:170:144:Times:144:Times:coordinates,  location,  and  deposits  of  each  branch  of  every  commercial  and  savings  bank  
9:328:26468:17:18:72:545:153:144:Times:144:Times:operating  in  the  United  States.  We  complement  the  SOD  dataset  by  assigning  latitudes  and  
9:329:26571:18:17:72:545:135:144:Times:144:Times:longitudes  to  each  branch  address  whenever  geographical  coordinate  data  are  missing.  We  
9:330:26671:17:17:72:545:118:144:Times:144:Times:geocode  branch  addresses  into  coordinates  via  Google  Geocoding.  We  compute  measures  of

9:333:26925:8:16:72:544:79:42:Times:100:Times:3  We  restrict  our  analysis  to  this  period  since  we  do  not  have  detailed  data  on  transactions  prior  to  2007.  Note,  
9:334:27060:16:12:72:539:63:100:Times:100:Times:however, that the transactions before this period correspond to a tiny fraction relative to those observed in the post-
9:335:27179:12:0:72:125:51:100:Times:100:Times:2007 period. 
10:336:27195:0:17:72:543:722:144:Times:144:Times:and savings banks operating the United States in the year prior to the bank failure. We calculate 
10:337:27293:17:18:72:546:705:144:Times:144:Times:geographical  distance  between  banks  using  two  metrics.  First,  we  construct  a  variable  that  
10:338:27397:18:17:72:545:687:144:Times:144:Times:captures  the  average  geodetic  distance  between  all  branch  pairs.  Second,  we  create  a  set  of  
10:339:27504:17:17:72:544:670:144:Times:144:Times:indicator  variables  that  take  the  value  of  1  if  a  commercial  or  savings  bank  has  at  least  one  
10:340:27616:17:17:72:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:branch  in  the  same  zip  code  as  any  of  the  branches  of  the  failed  bank.  We  also  compute  the  
10:341:27726:17:18:71:257:636:144:Times:144:Times:indicator at the county and state level.

10:345:27794:17:18:71:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:The  period  from  2007  to  2013,  which  we  study,  saw  an  unprecedented  number  of  banks  being  
10:346:27899:18:17:72:544:549:144:Times:144:Times:taken  into  receivership  by  the  FDIC  and  then  sold  at  auctions.  This  fact  can  be  clearly  seen  in  
10:347:28013:17:17:72:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:Figure  1,  which  shows  the  number  of  bank  failures  from  1994  onward.  From  1994  to  2006  the  
10:348:28120:17:17:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:average  annual  number  of  bank  failures  is  five,  and  does  not  exceed  fifteen.  In  contrast,  2010  
10:349:28231:17:17:72:245:498:144:Times:144:Times:saw a peak of bank failures at 157.  
10:350:28268:17:16:72:75:481:121:Times:121:Times: 
10:351:28268:16:18:72:544:465:144:Times:144:Times:These  bank  failures  impose  substantial  costs  on  the  FDIC.  Figure  2A  shows  the  distribution  of  
10:352:28377:18:17:72:543:447:144:Times:144:Times:resolution costs and the size of failed banks that were sold during our sample. The median failed 
10:353:28475:17:17:72:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:bank’s  assets  are  $211  million,  with  a  significant  dispersion  (standard  deviation  of  $2  billion).  
10:354:28587:17:17:72:543:413:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, the costs of resolution in the sample are relatively large, with a median of $55 million 
10:355:28687:17:18:72:542:396:144:Times:144:Times:and standard deviation of $765 million. Figure 2B shows that resolution costs are sizable relative 
10:356:28786:18:17:72:544:378:144:Times:144:Times:to the assets of the failed bank: the median resolution cost from 2007 to 2013 was 28% of total 
10:357:28882:17:17:72:196:361:144:Times:144:Times:assets of the failed bank.

10:359:28910:17:18:72:545:327:144:Times:144:Times:Table  1  presents  descriptive  statistics  of  key  variables  used  in  our  analysis  for  failed  banks  
10:360:29020:18:17:72:545:309:144:Times:144:Times:(Panel  A),  their  acquirers  (Panel  B),  and  their  potential  acquirers,  i.e.  banks  that  did  not  fail  
10:361:29134:17:17:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:(Panel  C)  over  the  sample  period.  Failed  banks  tend  to  be  smaller,  experience  higher  losses  on  
10:362:29245:17:17:72:544:275:144:Times:144:Times:their  loan  portfolio,  and  have  worse  financial  health  relative  to  acquirers  or  potential  acquirers.  
10:363:29359:17:18:72:545:258:144:Times:144:Times:All  banks  tilt  their  lending  to  real  estate,  which  constitutes  more  than  60%  of  their  asset  
10:364:29467:18:17:72:545:240:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio.  These  patterns  also  emerge  if  we  stratify  the  sample  yearly  rather  than  pooling  the  
10:365:29577:17:17:72:543:223:144:Times:144:Times:sample.  Relative  to  other  banks,  eventual  acquirers  tend  to  be  larger  and  have  a  slightly  larger  
10:366:29690:17:17:72:401:206:144:Times:144:Times:residential and commercial real estate tilt in their loan composition.

10:368:29762:18:17:72:545:171:144:Times:144:Times:Most  interestingly,  acquiring  banks  tend  to  be  located  closer  to  failed  banks  relative  to  other  
10:369:29873:17:17:72:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:potential acquirers. The average distance between the eventual acquirer and a failed bank is 200 
10:370:29970:17:17:72:546:137:144:Times:144:Times:miles,  rather  than  900  miles  for  other  potential  acquirers.  The  loan  portfolios  of  eventual  
10:371:30076:17:18:72:544:120:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers  are  also  more  similar  to  those  of  the  failed  bank  than  are  portfolios  of  other  potential  
10:372:30192:18:17:71:543:102:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers. The average share of CRE loans for an eventual acquirer differs from that of the failed 
10:373:30291:17:0:71:543:85:144:Times:144:Times:bank  it  acquired  by  18  percentage  points  (pp).  For  potential  acquirers,  this  difference  is  35  pp.  
11:374:30408:0:17:72:545:722:144:Times:144:Times:These  patterns  will  be  fundamental  to  the  facts  that  we  will  robustly  establish  in  our  main

11:377:30526:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:We also note some additional key statistics of failed banks and eventual acquirers in our sample. 
11:378:30624:17:17:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:At the time of the failure, failed banks assets average $759 million, with a standard deviation of 
11:379:30723:17:18:72:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:$2.441 billion. These banks are largely state chartered (65%), and 5% are part of a bank holding 
11:380:30820:18:17:71:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:company  holding  more  than  one  commercial  and  savings  bank.  The  assets  of  acquirers  in  the  
11:381:30925:17:17:71:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:sample average $11.275 billion; 55% of acquirers are state chartered and 26% are organized as a 
11:382:31021:17:17:71:212:584:144:Times:144:Times:multibank holding company.

11:384:31048:18:17:71:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:In Table 2 we formally present some of these same inferences by estimating a logit of the event

11:392:31648:21:19:72:543:382:144:Times:144:Times:at time t, and 0 if not. We account for characteristics of failed banks by including a plethora of 
11:393:31747:19:22:72:543:363:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank characteristics,itX, and potential acquirer characteristic ,jtX, as discussed in notes to 
11:394:31849:22:21:72:545:341:144:Times:144:Times:Table  2.  We  also  include  quarter  fixed  effects,t,  to  account  for  any  macro  movements.  The  
11:395:31955:21:17:71:545:320:144:Times:144:Times:results  from  this  analysis  mirror  the  descriptive  statics  in  Table  1  (Panels  B  and  C).  The

11:397:32173:17:17:71:543:286:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics in an economically meaningful way. For instance, a standard deviation increase in

12:412:32876:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:We  begin  our  main  analysis  by  asking  whether  geographic  proximity  of  a  potential  acquirer  to  
12:413:32984:17:18:72:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:the failed bank increases the probability of an acquisition. One could imagine that the proximity 
12:414:33082:18:17:72:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  potential  acquirer  does not play a role. As Cochrane (2013) contends, failed banks could 
12:415:33182:17:17:72:343:670:144:Times:144:Times:be “swiftly bought up by other banks even out of state.”

12:417:33239:17:18:72:545:636:144:Times:144:Times:A  simple  cut  of  the  raw  data  in  Figure  3  suggests  that  failed  banks  are  rarely  sold  to  distant  
12:418:33353:18:17:72:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:banks. In Figure 3A we sort potential acquirers into 20 bins, which contain an equal number of 
12:419:33448:17:17:72:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:potential acquirers, sorted by the average distance of their branch networks to that of the failed 
12:420:33547:17:17:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:bank.  More  than  60%  of  failed  banks  during  the  sample  period  are  acquired  by  the  5%  of  
12:421:33651:17:18:71:542:567:144:Times:144:Times:potential acquirers that are located closest to the failed bank. The distance of the branch networks 
12:422:33752:18:17:71:544:549:144:Times:144:Times:of  these  potential  acquirers  from  the  branch  network  of  the  failed  bank  is  less  than  196  miles.  
12:423:33865:17:17:71:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:The results are also striking if we restrict the sample to the 5% of closest potential acquirers, as 
12:424:33966:17:17:71:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:in  Figure  3B.  The  potential  acquirers  with  an  average  branch  network  distance  of  less  than  21  
12:425:34076:17:18:71:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:miles,  which  represent  the  0.25%  closest  potential  acquirers,  acquire  over  12%  of  failed  banks.  
12:426:34186:18:17:71:544:480:144:Times:144:Times:The patterns are similar when we use an alternative metric of distance in Appendix Figure A.1. 
12:427:34281:17:17:71:544:463:144:Times:144:Times:These  figures  clearly  show  that  most  failed  banks  are  sold  very  locally,  and  that  the  share  of  
12:428:34393:17:17:71:279:446:144:Times:144:Times:banks sold declines quickly with distance.

12:436:34822:19:22:72:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:dependent  variable  ijty  is  a  dummy  variable,  with  1  indicating  that  potential  bidder  j  acquired  
12:437:34933:22:22:72:542:256:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank i at time t, and 0 if not. The dependent variable of interest is ijtd, which measures the 
12:438:35035:22:17:71:543:234:144:Times:144:Times:average distance of the branch network of the potential acquirer from the branch network of the 
12:439:35131:17:18:71:546:217:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank.  We  control  for  characteristics  of  a  potential  acquirer,  such  as  its  asset  size,  
12:440:35239:18:22:71:304:199:144:Times:144:Times:composition of loans, and capitalization in jtX.

12:443:35401:21:17:72:546:137:144:Times:144:Times:our  results  are  driven  by  the  distance  between  the  failed  bank  and  the  acquirer,  not  the  
12:444:35506:17:17:72:544:120:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics of the bank being sold. One concern could be that failed banks that are far away 
12:445:35603:17:18:72:544:103:144:Times:144:Times:from  potential  acquirers  also  have  worse  assets,  or  assets  that  are  very  specific.  Alternatively,  
12:446:35715:18:19:72:543:85:144:Times:144:Times:states’ regulation or regulators may affect which types of banks are located in a given state (see 
12:447:35814:19:0:72:532:66:144:Times:173:g_d0_f6:Agarwal et al. 2014), as well as the distance to potential acquirers. Failed bank fixed effectsit
13:448:35916:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:control  for  these  alternatives.  Moreover,  failed  bank  fixed  effects  subsume  any  time  variation,  
13:449:36025:17:18:72:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:such as aggregate trends in bank sales, since the failure happens at one point in time, as well as 
13:450:36124:18:17:72:544:687:144:Times:144:Times:between-state variation. The variation in our estimates therefore comes from within failed bank 
13:451:36220:17:17:71:545:670:144:Times:144:Times:differences  in  geographic  proximity  of  potential  acquirers  to  the  failed  bank.  We  cluster  the  
13:452:36328:17:17:71:390:653:144:Times:144:Times:standard errors at the level of the failed bank’s state headquarters.

13:454:36398:18:18:71:546:618:144:Times:144:Times:Table  3A  presents  the  results  and  confirms  the  intuition  from  Figure  3.  The  coefficient  on  
13:455:36504:18:20:71:544:600:144:Times:144:Times:distance,1,  is  negative  and  statistically  significant.  Potential  acquirers  that  are  located  farther  
13:456:36617:20:18:72:545:580:144:Times:144:Times:from  a  failed  bank  have  a  lower  probability  of  acquiring  it.  This  estimate  is  economically  
13:457:36723:18:17:72:545:562:144:Times:144:Times:meaningful.  The  average  marginal  effect  of  a  100-mile  increase  in  the  distance  between  the  
13:458:36828:17:17:72:544:545:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank’s  and  potential  acquirer’s  branch  networks  is  to  reduce  the  expected  probability  of  
13:459:36938:17:17:72:543:528:144:Times:144:Times:acquisition  by  3  pp.  The  effect  of  distance  is  stronger  conditional  on  being  located  close  to  the  
13:460:37053:17:18:72:544:511:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank: a 100-mile increase in distance reduces the likelihood of acquisition by 13.6 pp for 
13:461:37151:18:17:72:544:493:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers  within  100  miles  of  the  failed  bank,  but  only  0.25  pp  for  potential  acquirers

13:464:37304:17:18:72:544:442:144:Times:144:Times:Next,  we  perform  a  serious  of  robustness  checks  to  further  confirm  that  failed  banks  are  sold  
13:465:37414:18:17:72:543:424:144:Times:144:Times:very  locally.  To  better  understand  the  effect  of  distance,  we  restrict  our  subsample  to  acquirers  
13:466:37527:17:17:72:545:407:144:Times:144:Times:whose  branches  are  within  a  200-mile  radius.  In  unreported  tests  we  find  that  the  effect  of  
13:467:37635:17:17:72:543:390:144:Times:144:Times:distance  persists  when  we  restrict  ourselves  to  the  subsample  of  these  more  plausible  potential  
13:468:37745:17:20:72:544:373:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers.  To  ensure  that  our  results  are  not  driven  by  unobserved  characteristics  of  potential  
13:469:37855:20:21:72:539:353:144:Times:121:g_d0_f2:acquirers, we include acquirer/quarter fixed effects jtand estimate the following specification:

13:472:37989:31:18:72:544:280:144:Times:144:Times:All  failed  bank  and  acquirer  factors  are  subsumed  in  fixed  effects.  The  remaining  variation  we  
13:473:38099:18:17:72:543:262:144:Times:144:Times:exploit is the interaction between the characteristics of the potential acquirer and the failed bank 
13:474:38200:17:17:72:543:245:144:Times:144:Times:and the relative distance between them. Because of the acquirer/quarter fixed effects, the sample 
13:475:38298:17:17:72:544:228:144:Times:144:Times:of  potential  acquirers  in  these  conditional  logit  tests  is  limited  to  banks  that  acquired  a  failed  
13:476:38413:17:18:72:543:211:144:Times:144:Times:bank in the same quarter in which that failure occurred. In spite of this very limited sample, our 
13:477:38512:18:17:72:532:193:144:Times:144:Times:results in columns 2 and 3 are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the baseline estimates.

13:479:38612:17:17:72:544:159:144:Times:144:Times:Because  banks  had  substantial  exposures  to  the  real  estate  sector,  we  explore  how  house  price  
13:480:38721:17:18:72:544:142:144:Times:144:Times:dynamics faced by the failed bank shape the effect of distance (see Keys et al., 2012). In Table 
13:481:38818:18:17:72:547:124:144:Times:144:Times:3B  we  stratify  the  sample  based  on  whether  the  failed  bank  is  in  a  coastal  area,  which  
13:482:38922:17:17:72:545:107:144:Times:144:Times:experienced  larger  boom-bust  house  price  cycles  during  the  last  decade.  Alternatively,  we  
13:483:39024:17:17:72:544:90:144:Times:144:Times:stratify  directly  based  on  house  price  growth  experienced  in  the  failed  bank  region.  The  results  
13:484:39136:17:18:72:544:73:144:Times:144:Times:presented  in  columns  1  to  4  show  that  in  each  of  these  subsamples,  distant  banks  have  a  lower  
13:485:39248:18:0:72:543:55:144:Times:144:Times:probability of purchasing a failed bank. The estimated coefficients also suggest that the effect of 
14:486:39352:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:distance  is  slightly  less  pronounced  if  failed  banks  are  located  in  coastal  states  or  operating  in  
14:487:39467:17:18:72:539:705:144:Times:144:Times:areas that had experienced high house price growth between 2001 and 2006. For instance, a 100-
14:488:39561:18:17:71:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:mile  increase  in  distance  reduces  the  likelihood  of  acquisition  by  2.6  and  3.1  pp  in  coastal  and  
14:489:39675:17:17:71:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:noncoastal states, respectively. Similarly, a 100-mile increase in distance reduces the likelihood 
14:490:39774:17:17:71:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:of acquisition by 2.3 and 3.5 pp for failed banks located in areas with high and low house price 
14:491:39871:17:18:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:growth,  respectively.  In  Table  3C  we  assess  whether  these  effects  vary  based  on  failed  banks’  
14:492:39980:18:17:71:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:specialization.  We  stratify  failed  banks  based  on  the  percentage  of  CRE,  Residential,  and  C&I  
14:493:40088:17:17:71:544:601:144:Times:144:Times:loans  held  by  the  failed  bank.  The  results  of  Table  3C  show  that  the  effects  of  distance  are  
14:494:40199:17:17:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:present across all subsamples, although the sales are most local for failed banks with a low share 
14:495:40298:17:18:71:142:567:144:Times:144:Times:of CRE loans. 
14:496:40312:18:17:71:74:549:144:Times:144:Times: 
14:497:40312:17:17:71:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:There are several potential reasons why failed banks sales are local. A large literature has studied 
14:498:40413:17:17:71:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:how  the  transmission  of  soft  information  within  banks  deteriorates  with  geographic  distance  
14:499:40517:17:18:71:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:(Stein, 2002; Petersen and Rajan, 2002). A distant potential acquirer will not be able to operate 
14:500:40615:18:17:71:544:480:144:Times:144:Times:the  acquired  failed  bank  very  efficiently  because  of  the  loss  in  soft  information.  Nearby  banks  
14:501:40726:17:17:71:543:463:144:Times:144:Times:might also be better able to exploit economies of scale, such as lower overhead, easier servicing 
14:502:40824:17:17:71:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:of  branches  and  joint  ATMs,  or  greater  market  power  (Akkus,  Cookson,  and  Hortacsu,  2014).  
14:503:40928:17:18:71:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:Next we explore the conjecture that the effect of distance in failed bank acquisitions is related to 
14:504:41029:18:17:71:176:411:144:Times:144:Times:soft information loss.

14:506:41052:17:17:71:299:377:144:Times:144:Times:V.A.2 Does Distance Reflect Soft Information? 
14:507:41097:17:18:71:74:360:144:Times:144:Times: 
14:508:41097:18:17:71:543:342:144:Times:144:Times:If soft information deteriorates with distance, an acquisition by a local bank would be especially 
14:509:41196:17:17:71:545:325:144:Times:144:Times:valuable  in  the  sale  of  failed  banks  with  an  important  soft  information  component.  Because  
14:510:41301:17:17:71:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:banks in our sample had substantial exposures to the real estate sector, we exploit variation in the 
14:511:41402:17:18:71:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:amount of soft information about real estate values. We do so by measuring the quality of hard 
14:512:41497:18:17:71:544:273:144:Times:144:Times:information  contained  in  public  tax  assessments  of  real  estate  values  following  Garmaise  and  
14:513:41603:17:17:71:166:256:144:Times:144:Times:Moskowitz (2004). 
14:514:41621:17:17:71:74:239:144:Times:144:Times: 
14:515:41621:17:18:71:547:222:144:Times:144:Times:Property  tax  authorities  periodically  evaluate  the  quality  of  property  assessments  in  their  
14:516:41725:18:17:71:545:204:144:Times:144:Times:jurisdictions.  The  most  popular  measure  of  assessment  quality  is  the  coefficient  of  dispersion  
14:517:41833:17:17:71:542:187:144:Times:144:Times:used by Garmaise and Moskowitz (2004). The central input is the ratio between the market value 
14:518:41928:17:17:71:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:of  properties  recently  sold  and  their  assessed  value,  which  is  frequently  determined  by  statute.  
14:519:42039:17:18:71:544:153:144:Times:144:Times:Suppose  that  the  assessed  value  is  legislated  at  33%  of  market  value.  If  assessments  measure  
14:520:42147:18:17:71:544:135:144:Times:144:Times:market  values  perfectly,  then  the  ratios  of  assessed  values  to  market  value  are  the  same  for  all  
14:521:42261:17:17:71:544:118:144:Times:144:Times:assessed  properties,  33%.  Outside  investors  can  then  rely  on  the  hard  information  collected  by  
14:522:42370:17:17:71:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:the tax authorities to closely track the market value of a property. Consider the opposite situation 
14:523:42471:17:18:71:544:84:144:Times:144:Times:in which the ratios are dispersed—some assessed values are 10% of the actual value, others are 
14:524:42566:18:0:71:543:66:144:Times:144:Times:50%. Then the assessed values provide little information to outside investors. The coefficient of 
15:525:42668:0:17:72:543:722:144:Times:144:Times:dispersion (COD) formally measures how dispersed the ratios are.5 When public assessments are 
15:526:42762:17:18:71:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:less accurate, the measure is larger and investors have to rely on soft information about local real 
15:527:42863:18:17:71:343:687:144:Times:144:Times:estate market conditions rather than public assessments.

15:536:43464:22:23:72:544:497:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers  and  the  amount  of  soft  information  in  the  local  market,  iijjdCOD,  with  the  
15:537:43574:23:22:71:549:474:144:Times:144:Times:corresponding   coefficient   of   interest2.   As   in   other   specifications,   we   also   include

15:539:43781:22:17:72:164:430:144:Times:144:Times:state headquarters. 
15:540:43801:17:17:72:75:413:144:Times:144:Times: 
15:541:43801:17:17:72:542:396:144:Times:144:Times:The results are presented in Table 4. In column 1 we use a dummy variable to capture the degree 
15:542:43897:17:18:72:544:379:144:Times:144:Times:of  soft  information  in  a  failed  bank’s  portfolio.  Specifically,  we  use  an  indicator  that  takes  a  
15:543:44010:18:19:71:543:361:144:Times:144:Times:value of 1 if the failed bank is in an above-median COD area (High COD) and 0 otherwise. The 
15:544:44102:19:21:71:545:342:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient  on  distance1  is  negative  and  statistically  significant,  which  indicates  that  distant  
15:545:44212:21:17:72:546:321:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers  are  less  likely  to  acquire  failed  banks  even  in  markets  with  less  soft  
15:546:44318:17:17:72:548:304:144:Times:144:Times:information.   More   importantly,   as   the   interaction   term   reveals,   local   soft   information   
15:547:44427:17:17:72:542:287:144:Times:144:Times:significantly increases the advantage of local banks. If we compare areas with above-median soft 
15:548:44524:17:18:72:544:270:144:Times:144:Times:information  to  those  below  median,  we  find  that  the  coefficient  of  distance  increases  over  50  
15:549:44633:18:17:72:545:252:144:Times:144:Times:percent.  For  potential  acquirers  within  100  miles  of  the  failed  bank,  a  100-mile  increase  in  
15:550:44741:17:17:72:543:235:144:Times:144:Times:distance reduces the likelihood of acquisition by  17.6  pp  in  high-COD  areas,  whereas  the  same  
15:551:44844:17:17:72:543:218:144:Times:144:Times:increase in low-COD areas reduces the likelihood of acquisition by just 11.4 pp. The incremental 
15:552:44941:17:18:72:544:201:144:Times:144:Times:effect  of  COD  on  the  marginal  effect  of  distance  rapidly  disappears  as  we  move  farther  away  
15:553:45049:18:17:72:544:183:144:Times:144:Times:from the failed bank. For potential acquirers within 300 miles from the failed bank, a 100-mile 
15:554:45145:17:17:72:543:166:144:Times:144:Times:increase in distance reduces the likelihood of acquisition by 7.4 pp in high-COD areas, whereas 
15:555:45241:17:17:72:544:149:144:Times:144:Times:the same increase in low-COD areas reduces the likelihood of acquisition by 6.5 pp. We obtain 
15:556:45335:17:18:72:474:132:144:Times:144:Times:similar inferences when we use a continuous measure of COD in column 2 instead.

16:565:45757:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:Garmaise  and  Moskowitz  (2004)  make  a  strong  case  that  COD  measures  plausibly  exogenous  
16:566:45857:17:18:72:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:variation in soft information.6 Even if that were not the case, the variation we use to identify our 
16:567:45958:18:17:72:545:687:144:Times:144:Times:effect  is  based  on  the  interaction  between  COD  and  distance  between  a  bank  and  a  potential  
16:568:46065:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:acquirer. Because we include both failed bank and acquirer/quarter fixed effects these results are 
16:569:46164:17:17:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:not driven by the fact that banks or potential acquirers are different in areas of high rather than 
16:570:46264:17:18:72:545:636:144:Times:144:Times:low  COD.  To  generate  our  results,  areas  with  high  administrative  mismeasurement  would  be  
16:571:46366:18:17:72:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:areas  in  which  local  banks  are  a  relatively  better  match  for  the  failed  bank  in  that  area  and  a  
16:572:46481:17:17:72:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:relatively worse match for distant failed banks on dimensions that are not related to distance or 
16:573:46579:17:17:72:547:584:144:Times:144:Times:soft  information.  In  areas  with  little  administrative  mismeasurement,  the  result  would  be  
16:574:46681:17:18:72:404:567:144:Times:144:Times:reversed. We think this alternative, while possible, may be unlikely.  
16:575:46752:18:17:72:75:549:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:576:46752:17:17:72:544:532:144:Times:144:Times:We  also  use  alternative  measures  of  soft  information.  Following  Granja  (2013)  and  Agarwal  et  
16:577:46859:17:17:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:al.  (2014),  we  measure  whether  the  failed  bank  was  publicly  traded  before  failure  and  whether  
16:578:46968:17:18:72:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:the  failed  bank  is  large  relative  to  the  sample  of  failed  banks.  The  idea  behind  these  proxies  is  
16:579:47084:18:17:72:545:480:144:Times:144:Times:that  public  information  is  more  readily  available  for  these  banks.  Therefore  soft  and  local  
16:580:47190:17:17:72:544:463:144:Times:144:Times:information  play  a  larger  role  in  acquiring  private  and  smaller  banks,  which  should  provide  an  
16:581:47300:17:17:72:544:446:144:Times:144:Times:advantage to local potential acquirers. We confirm this conjecture in columns 3 and 4 of Table 4.  
16:582:47399:17:18:72:75:429:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:583:47399:18:17:72:545:411:144:Times:144:Times:Overall,  these  results  paint  a  clear  picture.  Failed  banks  are  generally  acquired  by  very  local  
16:584:47510:17:17:72:544:394:144:Times:144:Times:banks and are rarely sold out of state. This effect is robust to failed bank and potential acquirer 
16:585:47610:17:17:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:fixed effects, and is present across regions that saw different housing boom-bust cycles over the 
16:586:47708:17:18:72:545:360:144:Times:144:Times:last  decade  as  well  as  among  failed  banks  with  different  specializations.  These  effects  are  
16:587:47814:18:17:72:546:342:144:Times:144:Times:exacerbated  for  banks  in  areas  with  more  soft  information.  These  results  suggest  that  the  
16:588:47918:17:17:72:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:valuations of potential acquirers differ, with local banks valuing failed banks more, especially in 
16:589:48018:17:17:72:257:308:144:Times:144:Times:areas with pervasive soft information.

16:591:48057:18:17:72:238:273:144:Times:144:Times:V.B The Role of Asset Specificity 
16:592:48090:17:17:72:75:256:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:593:48090:17:17:72:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:In Section V.A.1, we showed that geographic proximity of a potential acquirer to the failed bank 
16:594:48187:17:18:72:542:222:144:Times:144:Times:increases the probability of an acquisition. Next, we examine whether asset specificity affects the 
16:595:48287:18:17:72:544:204:144:Times:144:Times:allocation  of  failed  banks  to  potential  acquirers.  Some  failed  banks  focus  more  on  consumer  
16:596:48393:17:17:72:543:187:144:Times:144:Times:lending, others on mortgages, still others on commercial loans. Banks also differ in the services 
16:597:48491:17:17:72:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:they  offer,  with  some  banks  providing  insurance  and  brokerage  services  while  other  banks  do  
16:598:48597:17:18:72:544:153:144:Times:144:Times:not.  Given  that  banks  specialize  in  different  types  of  loans,  their  assets  and  human  capital  are  
16:599:48710:18:17:72:544:135:144:Times:144:Times:likely  specialized  as  well.  It  is  possible  that  the  potential  acquirer  best  suited  to  deploy  these  
16:600:48825:17:17:71:252:118:144:Times:144:Times:assets is specialized in a similar way.

16:603:48925:8:16:72:543:79:42:Times:100:Times:6  They  control  for  the  level  of  heterogeneity  in  local  properties  and  the  house  price  growth  rate  in  the  region.  The  
16:604:49063:16:12:72:543:63:100:Times:100:Times:authors  also  find  that  property  age  and  COD  have  a  strong  positive  correlation,  which  allays  concerns  of  selective  
16:605:49196:12:0:72:388:51:100:Times:100:Times:offering of properties with shorter income histories in regions with high COD. 
17:606:49279:0:17:72:542:722:144:Times:144:Times:There are substantial differences in the portfolio composition of failed banks. The average failed 
17:607:49378:17:18:72:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:bank’s portfolio comprises 58% CRE loans, but there are large differences between failed banks, 
17:608:49474:18:17:72:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:with a 20 pp standard deviation. For residential loans the mean is 24% and standard deviation is 
17:609:49571:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:18 pp (Table 1). As mentioned earlier, these substantial differences in portfolios are not unusual 
17:610:49670:17:17:72:397:653:144:Times:144:Times:and are also observed in the potential bidders and actual acquirers.  
17:611:49740:17:18:72:75:636:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:612:49740:18:17:72:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:One simple way to examine whether failed banks are more likely to be acquired by banks with 
17:613:49832:17:17:71:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:similar portfolios is to compute the correlation between the portfolios of the failed bank and the 
17:614:49931:17:17:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:acquirer. The correlation between the share of CRE loans of acquirers and failed banks is 0.295, 
17:615:50028:17:18:71:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:which shows that failed banks are sold to acquirers with similar portfolios. This relationship can 
17:616:50127:18:17:71:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:also be seen in Figure 4A: we sort potential acquirers on their portfolio distance from the failed 
17:617:50226:17:17:71:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:bank  and  group  them  into  quintiles.  We  then  plot  the  share  of  failed  banks  (as  a  percentage  of  
17:618:50339:17:17:71:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:total  failed  banks  in  our  sample)  that  were  acquired  by  potential  acquirers  in  different  quintiles  
17:619:50453:17:18:71:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:for  the  CRE  portfolio  distance  metric.  Approximately  33%  of  failed  banks  are  acquired  by  the  
17:620:50561:18:17:71:547:480:144:Times:144:Times:20%  of  potential  acquirers  with  the  most  similar  share  of  CRE  loans  in  their  portfolio.  
17:621:50664:17:17:71:543:463:144:Times:144:Times:Conversely, fewer than 5% of failed banks are acquired by the 20% of potential acquirers whose 
17:622:50759:17:17:71:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:CRE portfolio shares are most dissimilar. A parallel pattern is presented in Figure 4B when we 
17:623:50854:17:18:71:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:sort  potential  acquirers  by  their  residential  loan  portfolio  share.  These  simple  cuts  of  raw  data  
17:624:50967:18:17:71:544:411:144:Times:144:Times:suggest  that  failed  banks  are  acquired  by  banks  with  similar  portfolios.  The  results  with  other  
17:625:51078:17:17:71:545:394:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio  metrics  are  similar,  though  substantially  weaker.  This  is  reasonable:  as  mentioned  
17:626:51183:17:17:71:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:earlier,  most  banks  in  our  sample  have  their  asset  holdings  in  commercial  and  residential  real  
17:627:51293:17:18:71:104:360:144:Times:144:Times:estate.

17:635:51745:21:18:71:542:202:144:Times:144:Times:measures the absolute difference in the loan portfolio composition between the failed bank and a 
17:636:51842:18:22:71:548:184:144:Times:144:Times:potential   acquirer.   For   example,   in   the   first   specificationijtportfolio distancemeasures   the   
17:637:51953:22:20:71:543:162:144:Times:144:Times:absolute difference between the portfolio shares of residential mortgages. As before, we control 
17:638:52050:20:22:71:544:142:144:Times:144:Times:for the failed bank fixed effectit and the potential acquirer/quarter fixed effect jt. Therefore 
17:639:52149:22:19:72:544:120:144:Times:144:Times:our results are not driven by portfolio composition of failed banks or potential acquirers but the 
17:640:52248:19:21:71:544:101:144:Times:144:Times:interaction  of  the  two.  We  also  directly  control  for  geographic  distance,  ijtd,  to  make  sure  our  
17:641:52361:21:17:72:546:80:144:Times:144:Times:results  are  not  driven  by  the  correlation  between  business  similarity  and  geographic  proximity.    
17:642:52472:17:0:72:462:63:144:Times:144:Times:We cluster the standard errors at the level of the failed bank’s state headquarters. 
18:643:52561:0:17:72:547:722:144:Times:144:Times:Table  5A  presents  the  results.  We  measure  the  distance  in  portfolios  using  five  different  
18:644:52665:17:18:72:544:705:144:Times:144:Times:specifications.  We  compute  the  absolute  difference  in  the  share  of  residential,  commercial  and  
18:645:52773:18:17:71:546:687:144:Times:144:Times:industrial,  consumer,  and  CRE  loans.  We  test  different  measures  of  asset  specificity  first  
18:646:52877:17:17:71:545:670:144:Times:144:Times:individually  and  then  simultaneously.  All  coefficients  are  negative,  suggesting  that  potential  
18:647:52983:17:17:71:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers whose portfolio composition differs from the failed bank are less likely to acquire the 
18:648:53081:17:18:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank. Because banks are likely similar on several portfolio dimensions simultaneously, it 
18:649:53178:18:17:71:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:is difficult to separately identify the effects of different portfolio categories; i.e., the measures are 
18:650:53284:17:17:72:545:601:144:Times:144:Times:nearly  multi-collinear.  The  last  specification  shows  that,  while  the  signs  on  all  the  portfolio  
18:651:53394:17:17:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:distance  metrics  are  maintained  when  the  measures  are  included  simultaneously,  the  only  
18:652:53494:17:18:72:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant coefficient is on CRE loans. Accordingly, we will focus on CRE loans as 
18:653:53592:18:17:72:299:549:144:Times:144:Times:the metric of portfolio distance in our analysis. 
18:654:53642:17:17:72:75:532:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:655:53642:17:17:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:These  effects  are  also  economically  large:  a  one-standard-deviation  increase  in  the  absolute  
18:656:53747:17:18:72:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:difference  between  the  residential  loan  portfolio  shares  of  potential  acquirers  and  failed  banks  
18:657:53857:18:17:72:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:reduces the likelihood of acquisition by 8.8 pp, whereas a one-standard-deviation increase in the 
18:658:53955:17:17:72:544:463:144:Times:144:Times:absolute difference of CRE loan portfolio shares reduces the expected probability of acquisition 
18:659:54052:17:17:72:544:446:144:Times:144:Times:by  9.7  pp.  Not  surprisingly,  given  the  large  exposure  of  banks  in  our  sample  to  real  estate,  the  
18:660:54167:17:18:72:545:429:144:Times:144:Times:effect  of  a  change  in  the  portfolio  distances  of  C&I  or  consumer  loans  is  less  important.  A  
18:661:54276:18:17:72:547:411:144:Times:144:Times:standard-deviation  increase  in  the  absolute  difference  between  the  C&I  or  consumer  loan  
18:662:54376:17:17:72:545:394:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio  shares  reduces  the  likelihood  of  acquisition  by  6.4  and  2.6  pp,  respectively,  and  the  
18:663:54487:17:17:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:results are not statistically significant. These findings suggest that different dimensions of asset 
18:664:54588:17:18:72:380:360:144:Times:144:Times:specificity play an important role in who acquires failed banks.  
18:665:54654:18:17:72:75:342:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:666:54654:17:17:72:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:Next, we examine whether the similarity in financial services provided by the potential acquirer 
18:667:54751:17:17:72:544:308:144:Times:144:Times:and  the  failed  bank  affects  acquisition  probabilities.  Banks  provide  several  different  services,  
18:668:54860:17:18:72:544:291:144:Times:144:Times:organized in fiduciary and custodian businesses and insurance, brokerage, and lease businesses. 
18:669:54956:18:17:72:542:273:144:Times:144:Times:One would expect that a bank that has experience in insurance would be better able to manage a 
18:670:55051:17:17:72:546:256:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank  that  also  provides  insurance  services  than  would  a  potential  acquirer  with  no  
18:671:55155:17:17:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:insurance business. Therefore a potential acquirer’s valuation of a failed bank should increase if 
18:672:55254:17:18:72:372:222:144:Times:144:Times:they operate similar businesses in terms of financial services.  
18:673:55319:18:17:72:75:204:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:674:55319:17:17:72:544:187:144:Times:144:Times:Table  5B  presents  the  results  in  which  we  estimate  the  specification  from  above,  but  examine  
18:675:55427:17:17:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:whether the potential acquirer and failed bank provide the same services. Again, the failed bank 
18:676:55524:17:18:72:543:153:144:Times:144:Times:and  potential  acquirer  fixed  effects  absorb the direct effect that providing services by the failed 
18:677:55629:18:17:72:544:135:144:Times:144:Times:bank  or  a  potential  acquirer  would  have  on  the  probability  of  acquisition.  The  coefficients  are  
18:678:55740:17:17:72:543:118:144:Times:144:Times:positive for all services when these are included separately as well as together, suggesting that if 
18:679:55841:17:17:72:544:101:144:Times:144:Times:a  failed  bank  provides  a  service,  such  as  insurance,  then  a  potential  acquirer  that  provides  the  
18:680:55954:17:18:72:544:84:144:Times:144:Times:service  is  more  likely  to  acquire  it.  These  effects  are  economically  meaningful.  For  instance,  if  
18:681:56067:18:0:72:545:66:144:Times:144:Times:both  the  failed  bank  and  the  potential  acquirer  offer  insurance  activities,  the  likelihood  of  
19:682:56179:0:17:72:545:722:144:Times:144:Times:acquisition  increases  by  4.1  pp,  which  is  large  compared  with  the  conditional  mean  of  5%.  
19:683:56284:17:18:72:544:705:144:Times:144:Times:Overall, the results of this section suggest asset specificity plays an important role in how failed 
19:684:56385:18:17:72:170:687:144:Times:144:Times:banks are allocated.

19:687:56460:17:18:72:75:636:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:688:56460:18:17:72:545:618:144:Times:144:Times:The  third  force  that  may  affect  who  acquires  a  failed  bank  is  the  capitalization  of  potential  
19:689:56570:17:17:72:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers. We draw on the insight from Shleifer and Vishny (1992) that in auctions of distressed 
19:690:56667:17:17:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:assets  potential  buyers  may  be  distressed  as  well,  and  may  therefore  be  unable  to  purchase  the  
19:691:56778:17:18:72:109:567:144:Times:144:Times:assets.  
19:692:56787:18:17:72:75:549:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:693:56787:17:17:72:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:A simple cut of the raw data in Figure 5A suggests that capitalization of potential acquirers is an 
19:694:56887:17:17:72:546:515:144:Times:144:Times:important  factor  in  failed  bank  acquisitions.  We  sort  local  potential  acquirers  into  quintiles  
19:695:56995:17:18:72:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:according to their capitalization. The 20% best capitalized potential acquirers obtain over 30% of 
19:696:57094:18:17:72:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:failed banks that go to local acquirers, while the 20% worst capitalized acquirers obtain 10% of 
19:697:57191:17:17:72:544:463:144:Times:144:Times:failed  banks.  Next,  we  sharpen  the  analysis  by  restricting  the  sample  to  the  most  likely  buyers:  
19:698:57304:17:17:72:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:local potential acquirers that have the highest portfolio composition overlap with the failed bank 
19:699:57403:17:18:72:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:based  on  CRE.  We  again  sort  potential  acquirers  into  quintiles  on  capitalization  and  show  the  
19:700:57512:18:17:72:543:411:144:Times:144:Times:share of failed banks acquired for each quintile in Figure 5B. The potential acquirers in the best 
19:701:57611:17:17:72:544:394:144:Times:144:Times:capitalized  quintile  acquire  over  25%  of  failed  banks  in  this  sample,  while  the  least  capitalized  
19:702:57724:17:17:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:quintile  acquires  approximately  9%  of  failed  banks.  These  simple  cuts  of  the  data  suggest  that  
19:703:57834:17:18:72:544:360:144:Times:144:Times:the  capitalization  of  potential  acquirers  may  play  an  important  role  in  the  allocation  of  failed

20:723:59263:18:17:72:545:653:144:Times:144:Times:bank.  Since  local  banks  are  much  more  likely  to  acquire  a  failed  bank,  we  re-estimate  the

20:730:59673:17:17:72:544:533:144:Times:144:Times:We  have  documented  three  distinct  forces  that  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  banks  to  potential  
20:731:59785:17:17:72:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers: the distance of a potential acquirer to the failed bank, the relatedness of the business of 
20:732:59888:17:18:72:545:499:144:Times:144:Times:a  potential  acquirer  to  that  of  the  failed  bank,  and  the  capitalization  of  the  potential  acquirer.  
20:733:60003:18:17:72:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:Next  we  examine  how  these  forces  interact  with  each  other.  We  want  to  understand  whether  
20:734:60107:17:17:72:543:464:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization  of  potential  acquirers  affects  how  failed  banks  are  allocated  along  dimensions  of  
20:735:60217:17:17:72:545:447:144:Times:144:Times:geographic  distance  and  business  similarity.  The  idea  is  that  local  banks  are  the  most  likely  
20:736:60326:17:18:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers of a failed bank, but they may not be able to take advantage of their higher valuations if 
20:737:60427:18:17:72:543:412:144:Times:144:Times:they  are  distressed.  Failed  banks  would  then  be  sold  to  distant  banks  that  are  better  capitalized  
20:738:60541:17:17:72:546:395:144:Times:144:Times:even  if  distant  banks  value  the  failed  banks  less.  Similarly,  low  capitalization  of  potential  
20:739:60649:17:17:72:544:378:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers in related businesses may prevent the sale of the failed bank to these otherwise likely 
20:740:60747:17:18:72:122:361:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers.

20:742:60758:17:17:72:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:We  estimate  whether  in  areas  with  less  well-capitalized  local  acquirers  failed  banks  are  sold  to  
20:743:60870:17:17:71:548:309:144:Times:144:Times:relatively   more   distant   potential   acquirers.   We   estimate   the   following   conditional   logit

20:749:61166:24:22:72:542:189:144:Times:144:Times:We include failed bank, it, and potential acquirer/quarter,jt, fixed effects. Therefore we study 
20:750:61265:22:18:71:542:167:144:Times:144:Times:the effect that the capitalization of other local potential acquirers has on the effect of distance for

21:758:61933:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:We use two measures of local banks’ capitalization: The first is the median capitalization of local 
21:759:62033:17:17:72:546:653:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers,  with  local  potential  acquirers  defined  as  banks  whose  branch  network  
21:760:62135:17:18:71:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:overlaps  in  at  least  one  zip  code  with  the  branch  network  of  the  failed  bank.  The  second  is  the  
21:761:62250:18:17:71:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:share of local potential acquirers that are “well capitalized.” We define a local potential acquirer 
21:762:62351:17:17:71:545:601:144:Times:144:Times:as  well  capitalized  if  its  Tier  1  capital  ratio  is  above  the  median  Tier  1  capital  ratio  of  all  
21:763:62466:17:17:71:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:potential  local  acquirers  (across  all  failed  banks  in  that  quarter).  The  results  are  presented  in  
21:764:62579:17:18:71:546:567:144:Times:144:Times:columns  3  to  6  of  Table  6.  The  results  confirm  that  if  local  potential  acquirers  are  poorly  
21:765:62688:18:17:71:544:549:144:Times:144:Times:capitalized,  distance  to  the  failed  bank  is  less  of  an  impediment  to  acquiring  it.  This  result  is  
21:766:62803:17:17:71:544:532:144:Times:144:Times:robust  to  different  measures  of  local  capitalization.  Consider  local  potential  acquirers,  located  
21:767:62913:17:17:71:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:within  100  miles  of  the  failed  bank.  If  their  capitalization  is  at  the  median,  the  probability  of  
21:768:63028:17:18:71:545:498:144:Times:144:Times:acquisition  declines  with  distance  approximately  35%  faster  than  if  the  capitalization  of  local  
21:769:63137:18:17:71:544:480:144:Times:144:Times:bidders  is  one  standard  deviation  below  the  median.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  idea  
21:770:63247:17:17:71:544:463:144:Times:144:Times:that  nonlocal  banks  are  more  likely  to  acquire  a  failed  institution  when  local  banks  are  poorly  
21:771:63359:17:17:71:132:446:144:Times:144:Times:capitalized.  
21:772:63373:17:18:71:74:429:144:Times:144:Times: 
21:773:63373:18:17:71:546:411:144:Times:144:Times:Capitalization  of  potential  acquirers  also  affects  the  allocation  of  failed  banks  along  the  
21:774:63478:17:17:71:543:394:144:Times:144:Times:dimension of asset similarity. If potential acquirers whose asset portfolios are similar to those of 
21:775:63579:17:17:71:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:the failed bank are distressed, they might not be able to take advantage of their higher valuations. 
21:776:63680:17:18:71:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:Failed  banks  would  then  be  sold  to  banks  whose  asset  portfolios  are  not  as  similar.  Results  in  
21:777:63792:18:17:71:544:342:144:Times:144:Times:Table  6  confirm  that  if  potential  acquirers  with  similar  asset  portfolios  are  poorly  capitalized,  
21:778:63904:17:17:71:516:325:144:Times:144:Times:then the failed bank is more likely to be sold to potential acquirers with less asset similarity.

21:780:64002:17:18:71:545:291:144:Times:144:Times:Overall,  these  results  suggest  that  the  three  forces  that  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  banks  
21:781:64113:18:17:71:543:273:144:Times:144:Times:interact in a meaningful way. Local potential acquirers in related lines of business are most likely 
21:782:64214:17:17:71:543:256:144:Times:144:Times:to acquire a failed bank if they are well capitalized. However, low capitalization of these buyers 
21:783:64313:17:17:71:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:forces the sale of a field bank to more distant acquirers that are in less related lines of business.

21:786:64508:17:17:71:74:187:144:Times:144:Times: 
21:787:64508:17:17:71:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:There are two broad channels that can explain our results. First, failed bank allocation is driven 
21:788:64607:17:18:71:544:153:144:Times:144:Times:by  the  choices  of  potential  acquirers:  a  bank  acquires  a  failed  bank  because  it  chooses  to  bid  
21:789:64719:18:17:71:544:135:144:Times:144:Times:more  for  the  failed  bank  than  other  potential  acquirers,  which  either  bid  less  or  choose  not  to  
21:790:64832:17:17:71:544:118:144:Times:144:Times:participate  in  the  bidding  process.  Alternatively,  as  we  briefly  describe  in  Section  II,  the  FDIC  
21:791:64945:17:17:71:544:101:144:Times:144:Times:chooses  which  banks  are  allowed  to  bid  in  an  auction  through  its  eligibility  criteria,  and  it  is  
21:792:65059:17:0:71:544:84:144:Times:144:Times:these  criteria  that  effectively  determine  failed  bank  allocation.  Both  alternatives  are  intriguing,  
22:793:65175:0:17:72:543:722:144:Times:144:Times:and  both  may  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  banks.  Nevertheless,  we  attempt  to  disentangle  the  
22:794:65286:17:18:71:488:705:144:Times:144:Times:two channels below, allowing for a cleaner interpretation of our results in Section VII. 
22:795:65375:18:17:71:74:687:144:Times:144:Times: 
22:796:65375:17:17:71:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:The FDIC follows a two-step process: first, it restricts which bidders are eligible to bid in failed 
22:797:65476:17:17:71:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:bank  auctions;  second,  from  the  eligible  bids  it  chooses  the  one  that  minimizes  the  cost  of  the  
22:798:65589:17:18:71:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank  resolution  to  the  Deposit  Insurance  Fund.  To  be  allowed  to  bid  in  a  failed  bank  
22:799:65698:18:17:71:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:auction,  a  potential  acquirer  must  have  an  adequate  Community  and  Reinvestment  Act  (CRA)  
22:800:65800:17:17:71:542:601:144:Times:144:Times:record, a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2, and a Federal Reserve Bank Holding Company (BHC) rating 
22:801:65891:17:17:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:of 1 or 2. Its total assets must exceed two times the size of the failed bank if it is located in the 
22:802:65993:17:18:71:544:567:144:Times:144:Times:same  state,  four  times  the  size  of  the  failed  bank  if  it  is  located  in  a  contiguous  state,  and  five  
22:803:66113:18:17:71:409:549:144:Times:144:Times:times the size of the failed bank if it is located in a nonadjacent state.7

22:806:66294:17:18:72:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:criteria, we conduct two sets of tests. The first set of tests estimates our previous regressions on a 
22:807:66397:18:17:71:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:sample in which we directly account for eligibility criteria imposed by the FDIC. The second set 
22:808:66494:17:17:71:540:463:144:Times:144:Times:of  results  re-estimates  our  regression  on  a  sample  of  actual  bidders,  whose  eligibility  is  self-
22:809:66604:17:17:71:268:446:144:Times:144:Times:evident from their being allowed to bid.

22:811:66646:18:17:71:543:411:144:Times:144:Times:The  first  set  of  tests  start  by  re-estimating  the  main  results  on  distance  and  asset  specificity  for  
22:812:66764:17:17:71:543:394:144:Times:144:Times:the subset of potential acquirers that are eligible to bid according to the FDIC criteria described 
22:813:66864:17:17:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:above.  We  present  the  results  in  Table  7.8  In  columns  1  and  2  we  replicate  specifications  from  
22:814:66976:17:18:72:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 and Table 5, in which we control for failed bank and acquirer/quarter fixed effects. We 
22:815:67072:18:17:72:545:342:144:Times:144:Times:explicitly  impose  the  relative  size  criterion  on  the  sample.  We  do  not  have  information  on  
22:816:67178:17:17:72:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:CAMELS, CRA record, or the FED BHC rating of banks. Because we use acquirer/quarter fixed 
22:817:67268:17:17:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:effects  in  a  fixed  effect  logit,  however,  these  regressions only use data from potential acquirers 
22:818:67375:17:18:72:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:that have bid at least once in any given quarter. This implies that the institutions that are a part of 
22:819:67479:18:17:71:545:273:144:Times:144:Times:these  regressions  must  have  CRA,  CAMELS,  and  FED  BHC  ratings  that  satisfy  the  FDIC  
22:820:67576:17:17:71:540:256:144:Times:144:Times:criteria  in  the  quarter  they  were  allowed  to  bid.  In  fact,  any  FDIC  criteria  that  are  acquirer-
22:821:67687:17:17:71:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:specific are accounted for by potential acquirer/quarter fixed effects. Note that the size eligibility 
22:822:67790:17:18:71:544:222:144:Times:144:Times:criteria  are  relative  to  the  size  of  the  failed  bank,  and  are  therefore  not  absorbed  and  must  be  
22:823:67905:18:17:71:543:204:144:Times:144:Times:directly  imposed.  Imposing  these  criteria  significantly  decreases  the  number  of  observations  of  
22:824:68013:17:17:71:546:187:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers,  from  approximately  9,000  to  approximately  5,000  observations.  While  
22:825:68112:17:17:71:546:170:144:Times:144:Times:noisier,  the  results  in  these  two  columns  are  very  similar  quantitatively  to  those  in  the  
22:826:68217:17:18:71:174:153:144:Times:144:Times:unrestricted sample.

22:831:68447:7:17:72:543:68:42:g_d0_f4:100:Times:8 We find that there seems to be some discretion in how these rules are imposed by the FDIC. Approximately 25% 
22:832:68558:17:0:71:316:51:100:Times:100:Times:of the winning bidders do not strictly meet the size criterion. 
23:833:68626:0:17:72:545:722:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  next  column,  we  test  the  capitalization  result  for  the  sample  of  eligible  bidders.  As  in  
23:834:68739:17:18:71:544:705:144:Times:144:Times:Table  6,  these  regressions  are  not  estimated  with  acquirer/quarter  fixed  effects.  Again,  even  
23:835:68846:18:17:71:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:though the number of observations drops significantly, to 763,000 from 3 million, our results are 
23:836:68944:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:similar: better capitalized banks are more likely to acquire a failed bank. In columns 4 and 5 we 
23:837:69042:17:17:72:545:653:144:Times:144:Times:show  that  the  results  from  Table  6,  interacting  local  capitalization  of  potential  acquirers  and  
23:838:69152:17:18:71:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:distance, also remain unchanged once we constrain ourselves to the sample of eligible potential

23:842:69368:17:18:71:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:eligible to bid on a given failed bank—the actual bidders. We compile the list of actual bidders 
23:843:69465:18:17:72:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:using information on the auction of each failed bank in our sample. Estimating the results on this 
23:844:69564:17:17:72:544:532:144:Times:144:Times:sample  eliminates  concerns  about  FDIC  eligibility  since  the  sample  now  consists  of  potential  
23:845:69670:17:17:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers  that  were  allowed  to  bid  by  the  FDIC.  These  specifications  do  not  include  potential  
23:846:69779:17:18:71:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:acquirer/quarter  fixed  effects  due  to  very  few  cases  where  the  same  acquirer  bid  for  different  
23:847:69889:18:17:71:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:targets  in  the  same  quarter.  Even  though  the  sample  of  potential  acquirers  is  severely  restricted  
23:848:70002:17:17:72:543:463:144:Times:144:Times:and reduced to 943 observations, the results in columns 6–10 of Table 7 show that our inferences 
23:849:70099:17:17:72:251:446:144:Times:144:Times:from earlier tables remain the same.  
23:850:70137:17:18:72:75:429:144:Times:144:Times: 
23:851:70137:18:17:72:544:411:144:Times:144:Times:Restricting  the  results  to  actual  bidders  yields  quantitatively  very  similar  results  to  those  in  the  
23:852:70253:17:17:72:544:394:144:Times:144:Times:unrestricted  sample.  The  only  exception  is  the  effect  of  distance,  which  is  substantially  smaller  
23:853:70365:17:17:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:among  actual  bidders  relative  to  all  potential  acquirers.  We  already  impose  the  FDIC  distance  
23:854:70473:17:18:72:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:criteria directly when we estimate the results in columns 1–5, and we find a large distance effect, 
23:855:70573:18:17:72:543:342:144:Times:144:Times:similar to that of the unrestricted sample. This suggests that the decline in the effect of distance is 
23:856:70677:17:17:72:545:325:144:Times:144:Times:not  driven  by  FDIC  criteria,  but  rather  that  far-off  banks  choose  not  to  bid  in  the  first  place.  
23:857:70792:17:17:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:Jointly, these results confirm that our previous results are robust to eligibility criteria imposed by 
23:858:70895:17:18:72:126:291:144:Times:144:Times:the FDIC.

23:861:70947:17:17:72:75:239:144:Times:144:Times: 
23:862:70947:17:18:72:543:222:144:Times:144:Times:As we describe in Section IV, there are substantial costs that the FDIC incurs in selling a failed 
23:863:71046:18:17:72:543:204:144:Times:144:Times:bank, and these costs differ significantly across failed banks. We next explore the link between 
23:864:71143:17:17:72:510:187:144:Times:144:Times:the forces that affect the allocation of failed banks and the costs of these sales to the FDIC. 
23:865:71239:17:17:72:75:170:144:Times:144:Times: 
23:866:71239:17:18:72:545:153:144:Times:144:Times:Our  previous  analysis  is  at  the  level  of  the  potential  acquirer–failed  bank  pair,  showing  that  
23:867:71349:18:17:72:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:potential acquirers are most likely to purchase a failed bank if they are located close to the failed 
23:868:71451:17:17:72:545:118:144:Times:144:Times:bank,  are  in  similar  lines  of  business,  and  are  well  capitalized.  Because  banks  are  sold  in  
23:869:71559:17:17:72:545:101:144:Times:144:Times:auctions,  our  results  imply  that  such  potential  acquirers  are  willing  to  pay  the  most  for  failed  
23:870:71672:17:18:72:543:84:144:Times:144:Times:banks. The costs to the FDIC then might depend on the composition of potential acquirers for a 
23:871:71767:18:0:72:543:66:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank, and how this composition is related to the forces we describe above. A simple cut of 
24:872:71869:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:the  data  presented  in  Figure  6A  suggests  that  there  is  a  link  between  the  capitalizations  of  the  
24:873:71983:17:18:72:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:pool of local potential acquirers and the cost to the FDIC. For each bank we compute the share of 
24:874:72081:18:17:72:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:well-capitalized potential acquirers and sort failed banks into quintiles according to this measure. 
24:875:72182:17:17:72:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:The 20% of failed banks with the highest share of well-capitalized local potential acquirers have 
24:876:72280:17:17:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:resolution costs of approximately 25% of assets. For the lowest quintile, the costs are over 33% 
24:877:72377:17:18:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:of assets. This is a large change relative to a standard deviation of resolution costs of 12%. We 
24:878:72475:18:17:71:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:obtain  similar  inferences  if  we  sort  banks  based  on  the  other  capitalization  ratio  in  Figure  6B.  
24:879:72588:17:17:71:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:These  simple  plots  suggest  that  the  forces  that  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  banks  to  potential  
24:880:72703:17:17:71:325:584:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers have a substantial impact on FDIC losses.

24:882:72756:18:17:71:542:549:144:Times:144:Times:As in Figure 6, we study the link between the capitalizations of the pool of local bidders and the 
24:883:72855:17:17:71:450:532:144:Times:144:Times:cost to the FDIC, but we do so by estimating the following linear regressions:

24:894:73706:20:18:71:543:317:144:Times:144:Times:failed bank characteristics such as size, portfolio composition, and capitalization prior to failure. 
24:895:73808:18:17:71:462:299:144:Times:144:Times:We cluster the standard errors at the level of the failed bank’s state headquarters.

24:897:73893:17:17:71:543:265:144:Times:144:Times:The results are presented in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8A. As in Section V.D we measure local 
24:898:73986:17:18:71:543:248:144:Times:144:Times:banks’ capitalization as the median capitalization of banks whose branch network overlaps in at 
24:899:74082:18:17:71:543:230:144:Times:144:Times:least one zip code with the branch network of the failed bank, or by the share of local banks that 
24:900:74181:17:17:71:544:213:144:Times:144:Times:are well capitalized. The results are robust to perturbations of these definitions. The magnitudes 
24:901:74280:17:17:71:545:196:144:Times:144:Times:are  also  substantial.  A  one-standard-deviation  increase  in  the  median  capitalization  of  local  
24:902:74386:17:18:71:544:179:144:Times:144:Times:banks  reduces  the  estimated  cost  of  resolution  by  2.3  pp  of  the  assets  of  the  failed  bank.  This  
24:903:74500:18:17:71:539:161:144:Times:144:Times:represents approximately 19% of the standard deviation in the cost of resolution of failed banks.

24:905:74599:17:17:71:542:127:144:Times:144:Times:The last four columns try to tighten the link between the forces that affect the allocation of failed 
24:906:74701:17:18:71:543:110:144:Times:144:Times:banks  and  the  costs  to  the  FDIC.  Potential  acquirers  located  close  to  the  failed  bank  that  are  in  
24:907:74817:18:17:71:543:92:144:Times:144:Times:similar lines of business are most likely to purchase a failed bank, if they are well capitalized. If 
24:908:74919:17:17:71:543:75:144:Times:144:Times:their  capitalization  is  low,  however,  then  the  failed  bank  has  to  be  sold  to  another  bank,  which  
24:909:75033:17:0:71:544:58:144:Times:144:Times:presumably  values  the  failed  bank  less.  We  test  this  conjecture  in  columns  3  and  4,  measuring  
25:910:75147:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:similarity  based  on  the  distance  of  CRE  loan  portfolios  between  the  failed  bank  and  potential  
25:911:75256:17:18:72:546:705:144:Times:144:Times:local  acquirers.  A  one-standard-deviation  decrease  in  the  median  capitalization  of  the  local  
25:912:75361:18:17:71:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers with similar loan portfolios increases the costs of resolution by 1.15 pp, or almost 10% 
25:913:75460:17:17:71:544:670:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  standard  deviation.  These  effects  are  less  pronounced  but  still  relevant  when  we  analyze  
25:914:75571:17:17:71:547:653:144:Times:144:Times:difference  in  the  portfolio  shares  of  other  loan  types.  These  findings  suggest  that  lower  
25:915:75675:17:18:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization of potential acquirers best suited to purchase a failed bank results in a significantly 
25:916:75778:18:17:71:259:618:144:Times:144:Times:higher cost of resolution for the FDIC.

25:918:75818:17:17:71:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:In the previous section we also found that in areas with more soft information local banks have 
25:919:75914:17:18:71:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:an advantage in acquiring a failed bank. We explore whether soft information is related to costs 
25:920:76011:18:17:71:338:549:144:Times:144:Times:of resolution by estimating the following specification: 
25:921:76068:17:18:71:74:532:144:Times:144:Times:

25:923:76109:31:22:72:543:483:144:Times:144:Times:in which, as in section V.A.2, ijsCODis the coefficient of dispersion that measures the amount of 
25:924:76206:22:17:71:542:461:144:Times:144:Times:soft information in a market. We also proxy for soft information by considering whether the bank 
25:925:76303:17:18:71:544:444:144:Times:144:Times:is  publicly  traded  or  not.  The  results  in  columns  5  and  6  suggest  that,  all  else  equal,  a  higher  
25:926:76419:18:17:71:543:426:144:Times:144:Times:degree of soft information significantly exacerbates the cost of resolution. The cost of resolution 
25:927:76519:17:17:71:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:of  failed  banks  that  are  publicly  traded  is  3.74  pp  lower  than  that  of  non-publicly-traded  failed  
25:928:76633:17:17:71:544:392:144:Times:144:Times:banks.  This  is  in  line  with  Granja  (2013),  who  argues  that  the  effect  of  being  publicly  traded  
25:929:76745:17:18:71:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:partially  stems  from  the  greater  information  transparency  of  publicly  traded  banks.  Moreover,  
25:930:76851:18:17:71:546:357:144:Times:144:Times:bank  failures  in  areas  with  little  soft  information  (low  COD)  are  2.2  pp  less  costly.  Our  
25:931:76957:17:17:71:544:340:144:Times:144:Times:inferences  survive  in  the  last  two  columns  when  we  include  the  capitalization  variables  along  
25:932:77065:17:17:71:543:323:144:Times:144:Times:with the proxy for soft information.9 Overall, the findings of this section suggest that the forces 
25:933:77165:17:17:72:543:306:144:Times:144:Times:that affect the allocation of failed banks are also linked with substantial costs of failed bank sales 
25:934:77268:17:18:71:137:289:144:Times:144:Times:to the FDIC.

25:938:77317:17:18:71:544:220:144:Times:144:Times:One possible concern with the last set of results is that the capitalization of local acquirers may 
25:939:77417:18:17:72:544:202:144:Times:144:Times:be  low  because  they  were  exposed  to  the  same  negative  local  shock  as  the  failed  bank.  The  
25:940:77524:17:17:71:543:185:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization of local potential acquirers could then proxy for the severity of regional shocks to 
25:941:77624:17:17:71:543:168:144:Times:144:Times:the failed bank, lowering its value. Such a correlated shock would cause higher cost to the FDIC 
25:942:77721:17:18:71:543:151:144:Times:144:Times:when local potential buyers are poorly capitalized. We already condition on state fixed effects in 
25:943:77820:18:17:71:543:133:144:Times:144:Times:the specification above, so for such shocks to affect our results, they would have to be at a more 
25:944:77919:17:17:71:200:116:144:Times:144:Times:local level, such as MSA.

25:947:78006:8:0:72:484:56:42:Times:100:Times:9 The findings are similar with COD as a proxy for soft information. We omit these results for brevity. 
26:948:78114:0:17:72:546:722:144:Times:144:Times:We  address  this  concern  by  exploiting  variation  in  capitalization  of  local  buyers  that  is  
26:949:78218:17:18:72:542:705:144:Times:144:Times:exogenous to the regional economic environment of the failed bank. Because regions of the U.S. 
26:950:78313:18:17:72:542:687:144:Times:144:Times:were exposed to different house price declines after 2006, the geographic portfolio of a bank may 
26:951:78411:17:17:72:544:670:144:Times:144:Times:influence  the  losses  a  bank  suffered  in  the  aftermath.  We  exploit  losses  that  potential  acquirers  
26:952:78524:17:17:72:545:653:144:Times:144:Times:incur  due  to  house  price  drops  in  regions  outside  the  region  of  failed  bank  operations  to  
26:953:78630:17:18:72:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:instrument for the capitalization of local acquirers. This instrument likely satisfies the exclusion 
26:954:78731:18:17:72:204:618:144:Times:144:Times:restriction by construction.

26:956:78760:17:17:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:We  first  compute  the  exposure  of  each  potential  acquirer  to  house  price  declines  outside  of  the  
26:957:78872:17:18:71:544:567:144:Times:144:Times:regions  in  which  the  failed  bank  operates.  For  each  potential  acquirer–failed  bank  pair  in  our  
26:958:78982:18:17:71:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:sample, we compute a house price index from the first quarter of 2006 to bank failure. We weigh 
26:959:79078:17:17:71:543:532:144:Times:144:Times:the  change  in  the  MSA  house  price  index10  by  the  level  of  deposits  of  the  potential  acquirer  in

27:1007:81899:17:17:72:543:576:144:Times:144:Times:we also compute the instrumented capitalization of local potential acquirers whose share of CRE 
27:1008:81995:17:17:72:543:559:144:Times:144:Times:loans  is  closest  to  the  failed  bank.  Our  instrumented  results  again  mirror  those  from  the  simple  
27:1009:82108:17:18:72:228:542:144:Times:144:Times:OLS specification in Table 8A.

27:1011:82140:17:17:72:546:507:144:Times:144:Times:One  concern  with  the  instrumental  variable  may  be  that  the  house  price  changes  in  MSAs  
27:1012:82242:17:17:72:543:490:144:Times:144:Times:without failed bank branches are still correlated with house price changes in MSAs in which the 
27:1013:82338:17:19:72:544:473:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank  operates,  because  of  the  proximity  of  the  regions.  Note  that  this  concern  should  be  
27:1014:82450:19:20:71:543:454:144:Times:144:Times:mitigated to some extent since we directly account for the state fixed effectsin the regression, 
27:1015:82548:20:17:72:544:434:144:Times:144:Times:which  controls  for  any  such  correlation  between  MSAs  in  the  same  state.  Nevertheless,  as  a  
27:1016:82654:17:18:72:543:417:144:Times:144:Times:robustness check, we estimate our regressions constructing the IV to exclude MSAs in which the 
27:1017:82749:18:17:72:545:399:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank  operates  as  well  as  MSAs  contiguous  to  failed  bank  operations.  The  results  in  
27:1018:82854:17:17:72:543:382:144:Times:144:Times:columns 3 and 4 reveal similar findings. In the last specification (columns 5 and 6) we exclude

27:1026:83396:17:17:71:543:244:144:Times:144:Times:that takes the value of 1 if the deal was for all loans and deposits of the failed bank, an indicator 
27:1027:83498:17:17:71:543:227:144:Times:144:Times:variable that takes the value of 1 if the deal was for no loan but all deposits of the failed bank, an 
27:1028:83601:17:18:71:543:210:144:Times:144:Times:indicator  variable  that  assumes  the  value  of  1  if  the  deal  was  for  no  loans  and  only  the  insured  
27:1029:83717:18:17:71:545:192:144:Times:144:Times:deposits  of  the  failed  bank,  an  indicator  variable  that  takes  the  value  of  1  if  the  transaction  
27:1030:83830:17:17:71:543:175:144:Times:144:Times:includes a loss share agreement, and a variable that indicates the loss share percentage in the first 
27:1031:83932:17:17:71:544:158:144:Times:144:Times:tranche  of  the  loss  share  agreement.  We  also  include  a  control  for  the  number  of  bids  in  each  
27:1032:84044:17:18:71:543:141:144:Times:144:Times:P&A transaction. We present the results in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8C, and we find our results 
27:1033:84140:18:17:71:305:123:144:Times:144:Times:are robust to the inclusion of bid characteristics.

28:1040:84538:0:17:72:543:722:144:Times:144:Times:Next, we use an alternative measure of the costs of resolution of a failed bank. Instead of the cost 
28:1041:84639:17:18:71:545:705:144:Times:144:Times:estimates  provided  by  the  FDIC,  we  can  measure  the  actual  premia  or  discounts  offered  for  
28:1042:84744:18:17:71:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:assets and deposits of the bank by the winning bidder. Bidders can offer to acquire the assets of 
28:1043:84842:17:17:71:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:the failed bank at a discount but also to pay a premium for the deposits of the failed bank (both 
28:1044:84940:17:17:71:545:653:144:Times:144:Times:as  a  percentage  of  the  failed  bank’s  assets).  We  take  the  difference  in  the  discount  and  the  
28:1045:85050:17:18:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:premium to obtain a net discount offered by the bidder on the failed banks’ assets and liabilities. 
28:1046:85150:18:17:71:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:We again control for other bid characteristics. The results presented in columns 3 and 4 of Table 
28:1047:85248:17:17:71:543:601:144:Times:144:Times:8C show that the results with this alternative measure are quantitatively very similar, suggesting 
28:1048:85347:17:17:72:460:584:144:Times:144:Times:that the asset discount and deposit premium are primary inputs into FDIC costs.

28:1050:85428:18:17:72:386:549:144:Times:144:Times:VII. Discussion and Interpretation: Fire Sales of Failed Banks 
28:1051:85491:17:17:72:75:532:144:Times:144:Times: 
28:1052:85491:17:17:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:In this section we interpret the facts that we have documented within the framework of fire sales 
28:1053:85589:17:18:72:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:(Shleifer and Vishny, 1992). The insight from Shleifer and Vishny (1992) is that in auctions of 
28:1054:85685:18:17:72:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:distressed assets, potential buyers with the highest valuations may be distressed and are therefore 
28:1055:85785:17:17:72:543:463:144:Times:144:Times:unable to purchase the assets. Auctions of failed banks in our sample are plausibly subject to fire 
28:1056:85885:17:17:72:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:sales. Because of bank run fears, auctions are swift, and bidding generally starts twelve to fifteen 
28:1057:85986:17:18:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:days before the scheduled closing of the failed bank. Moreover, because most of these auctions 
28:1058:86081:18:17:72:540:411:144:Times:144:Times:occurred  during  the  great  recession  and  its  aftermath,  several  banks  that  might  have  been  high-
28:1059:86190:17:17:72:287:394:144:Times:144:Times:value acquirers were themselves distressed.  
28:1060:86235:17:17:72:75:377:144:Times:144:Times: 
28:1061:86235:17:18:72:545:360:144:Times:144:Times:For  fire  sales  to  affect  the  allocation  of  failed  banks  two  conditions  have  to  be  met.  First,  
28:1062:86346:18:17:72:543:342:144:Times:144:Times:potential acquirers must differ in their ability to use the failed bank. If all potential acquirers can 
28:1063:86450:17:17:72:545:325:144:Times:144:Times:use  the  failed  bank  in  the  same  way,  then  the  fire  sale  cannot  affect  the  allocation.  In  other  
28:1064:86563:17:17:72:547:308:144:Times:144:Times:words,   failed   banks   have   to   exhibit   asset   specificity   for   fire   sales   to   have   meaningful   
28:1065:86679:17:18:72:542:291:144:Times:144:Times:consequences for allocation. Second, the best users of failed banks must be distressed themselves 
28:1066:86777:18:17:72:539:273:144:Times:144:Times:and  therefore  unable  to  purchase  the  failed  bank.  The  failed  bank  is  then  purchased  by  well-
28:1067:86884:17:17:72:354:256:144:Times:144:Times:capitalized acquirers that are less effective at operating it.  
28:1068:86948:17:17:72:75:239:144:Times:144:Times: 
28:1069:86948:17:18:72:545:222:144:Times:144:Times:Our  first  set  of  results  in  Section  V  examines  the  probability  that  a  given  potential  acquirer  
28:1070:87059:18:17:72:544:204:144:Times:144:Times:purchases  a  failed  bank.  Because  failed  banks  are  sold  at  auctions,  potential  acquirers  whose  
28:1071:87167:17:17:72:543:187:144:Times:144:Times:willingness  to  pay  is  higher  are  more  likely  to  win  the  auction.  Conversely,  if  certain  potential  
28:1072:87281:17:17:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers  are  more  likely  to  acquire  a  given  failed  bank,  we  conclude  that  they  value  the  bank  
28:1073:87393:17:18:72:546:153:144:Times:144:Times:more  than  other  potential  acquirers.  We  first  show  that  there  are  two  forces  that  generate  
28:1074:87499:18:17:72:545:135:144:Times:144:Times:different  valuations  for  a  failed  bank  among  potential  acquirers.  First,  geographically  closer  
28:1075:87606:17:17:72:543:118:144:Times:144:Times:potential acquirers are more likely to acquire a failed bank, and the effect of distance seems to be 
28:1076:87707:17:17:72:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:related to the deterioration of soft information with distance. These results suggest that potential 
28:1077:87808:17:18:72:545:84:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers’  valuations  of  failed  banks,  on  average,  decline  with  distance.  Second,  we  find  that  
28:1078:87917:18:0:72:544:66:144:Times:144:Times:potential  acquirers  that  are  in  similar  lines  of  business  as  the  failed  bank  are  more  likely  to  
29:1079:88034:0:17:72:544:722:144:Times:144:Times:purchase  a  failed  bank,  suggesting  higher  valuation  by  these  acquirers.  These  results  establish

29:1081:88241:18:17:72:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:that are geographically close to the failed bank and in similar lines of business are best suited to 
29:1082:88342:17:17:72:431:670:144:Times:144:Times:acquire a failed bank from the perspective of the assets of the failed bank.

29:1085:88532:18:17:72:542:618:144:Times:144:Times:acquirers with highest valuations also purchase the failed bank. We show that acquirers with low 
29:1086:88629:17:17:72:544:601:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization, likely distressed themselves, have a lower probability of acquiring a failed bank. 
29:1087:88728:17:17:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, we examine how the capitalization of the potential acquirers best suited to purchase a 
29:1088:88825:17:18:72:544:567:144:Times:144:Times:failed  bank  affects  auction  outcomes:  when  local  banks  and  banks  that  are  in  similar  lines  of

29:1091:89152:17:17:71:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:that  lower  capitalization  of  potential  acquirers  that  are  best  suited  to  purchase  a  failed  bank  
29:1092:89263:17:18:71:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:results  in  failed  banks’  allocation  to  less  suitable  acquirers.  Fire  sales  introduce  distortions  into

29:1104:90124:17:18:72:75:283:144:Times:144:Times: 
29:1105:90124:18:17:72:544:265:144:Times:144:Times:In  this  paper  we  provide  simple  facts  that  aid  our  understanding  of  failed  bank  sales.  Despite  
29:1106:90235:17:17:72:543:248:144:Times:144:Times:deregulation and progress in information technology, failed bank sales in the great recession and 
29:1107:90333:17:17:72:544:231:144:Times:144:Times:its  aftermath  remain  very  local:  fewer  than  15%  of  failed  banks  are  sold  to  banks  that  do  not  
29:1108:90445:17:18:72:544:214:144:Times:144:Times:currently  have  branches  within  the  same  state  as  the  failed  bank.  In  addition,  failed  banks  are  
29:1109:90557:18:17:72:543:196:144:Times:144:Times:more likely to be acquired by banks with similar loan portfolios and in similar lines of business. 
29:1110:90656:17:17:72:544:179:144:Times:144:Times:These  two  effects  interact  with  the  capitalization  of  potential  acquirers.  Poor  capitalization  of  
29:1111:90767:17:17:72:543:162:144:Times:144:Times:nearby acquirers in similar lines of business distorts the allocation of failed banks, which are sold 
29:1112:90869:17:18:72:543:145:144:Times:144:Times:to less similar banks located farther from the failed bank. The results are robust to restricting the 
29:1113:90971:18:17:72:544:127:144:Times:144:Times:data to actual bidders, confirming that they are not driven by auction eligibility criteria imposed 
29:1114:91071:17:17:72:544:110:144:Times:144:Times:by  the  FDIC.    We  link  facts  on  banking  allocation  to  the  costs  to  the  FDIC  of  selling  a  failed  
29:1115:91186:17:17:72:546:93:144:Times:144:Times:bank.  When  a  failed  bank’s  most  likely  acquirers  are  poorly  capitalized  the  FDIC  incurs  
29:1116:91288:17:18:72:202:76:144:Times:144:Times:significantly higher costs.  
29:1117:91317:18:0:72:75:58:144:Times:144:Times: 
30:1118:91321:0:17:72:543:722:144:Times:144:Times:These facts can be organized using the fire sales framework of Shleifer and Vishny (1992). Local 
30:1119:91418:17:18:71:543:705:144:Times:144:Times:banks in similar lines of business have the highest valuation for a failed bank. However, if they 
30:1120:91516:18:17:71:542:687:144:Times:144:Times:are distressed as well, then the failed bank has to be sold to a bank whose valuation is lower, but 
30:1121:91616:17:17:71:543:670:144:Times:144:Times:which is well capitalized. The failed bank is then sold at a larger discount, imposing higher costs 
30:1122:91716:17:17:71:190:653:144:Times:144:Times:on the seller, the FDIC.  
30:1123:91742:17:18:71:74:636:144:Times:144:Times: 
30:1124:91742:18:17:71:543:618:144:Times:144:Times:Selling failed banks is one of the procedures that have been proposed to ensure the functioning of 
30:1125:91841:17:17:71:545:601:144:Times:144:Times:the  banking  system  after  negative  shocks.  This  approach  is  particularly  appealing  because  it  
30:1126:91947:17:17:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:keeps the bank in place, potentially preserving the value embodied in the collection of assets and 
30:1127:92046:17:18:71:545:567:144:Times:144:Times:in  relationships  between  bank  employees  and  clients,  which  may  not  be  easily  or  quickly  
30:1128:92148:18:17:71:544:549:144:Times:144:Times:replaced.  Our  facts  suggest  that  the  selling  process  is  not  frictionless,  imposing  its  own  costs.  
30:1129:92261:17:17:72:545:532:144:Times:144:Times:These  costs  have  to  be  weighed  by  policy  makers  and  regulators  against  the  costs  of  other  
30:1130:92367:17:17:72:217:515:144:Times:144:Times:methods of supporting banks.
