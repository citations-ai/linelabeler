2:31:1716:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We study a market for funding real investment in which valuation creates information on which adverse
2:32:1817:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:selection can occur. Unlike in previous models, higher amounts of valuation are associated with lower
2:33:1918:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:market prices and so greater returns to valuation, and this strategic complementarity in the capacity
2:34:2019:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to do valuation generates multiple equilibria. In this region, the equilibrium without valuation is always
2:35:2125:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:more efficient despite funding projects that valuation would reveal as unprofitable. Valuation equilibria
2:36:2230:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:look like credit crunches. A large investor can ensure the efficient equilibrium only if it can precommit
2:37:2335:14:42:72:335:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to a price and, for some parameters, only if subsidized.

3:51:2679:0:33:80:193:686:209:g_d0_f2:209:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:52:2694:33:22:80:533:653:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Most real investment — buying a house, starting or expanding afirm, or maintaining a business
3:53:2787:22:22:80:533:631:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in bad times — relies on externalfinancing, a transfer of resources today for a claim on uncertain
3:54:2885:22:22:80:534:609:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:resources in the future. Not only is externalfinancing critical for much economic investment,
3:55:2978:22:22:80:533:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:but markets for externalfinance seem to be fragile. History is replete withfinancial panics both
3:56:3074:22:21:80:492:565:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:small and large in which the costs of funding rise and the volume of funding collapses.
3:57:3161:21:22:97:533:544:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we present a theoretical model of a market for the externalfinancing of real
3:58:3252:22:22:80:533:522:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investment in which different levels of funding and asset prices arise from different levels of
3:59:3347:22:22:80:534:500:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation by market participants.  In our setting, valuation has an externality — it produces
3:60:3440:22:22:80:534:478:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:private information on which adverse selection can occur.1More valuation worsens the pool of
3:61:3532:22:22:80:534:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assets purchased by unsophisticated investors,which lowers the price they are willing to pay,
3:62:3625:22:22:80:534:434:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which lowers the price that sophisticated investors have to pay for good assets, which makes
3:63:3717:22:22:80:533:412:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation more profitable. This price externality generates strategic complementarities in the
3:64:3811:22:22:80:533:390:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:capacity to do valuation that lead to multiple equilibria. A move from an equilibrium without
3:65:3904:22:22:80:533:368:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation to an equilibrium with valuation has many features of a credit crunch: valuation
3:66:3994:22:22:80:534:346:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibria have lower prices/higher interest rate spreads, lower levels of investment and trade,
3:67:4090:22:22:80:389:324:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:no investment by uninformed investors, and profitable valuation.
3:68:4154:22:22:97:534:302:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The private benefits to valuation exceed its social benefits so that the equilibrium without
3:69:4246:22:21:80:533:280:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation is always more efficient than the equilibrium with valuation when both are possible.
3:70:4340:21:22:80:533:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Further, there are parameters for which the equilibrium is unique and involves valuation, and
3:71:4433:22:22:80:533:237:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:yet funding all projects without valuation would be more efficient. In terms of policy, to ensure
3:72:4530:22:22:80:533:215:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the efficient outcome requires not just a large, unsophisticated investor, but one with the ability
3:73:4629:22:22:80:534:193:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to commit to a price ex ante and, when the more efficient outcome is not an equilibrium, a price
3:74:4725:22:22:80:118:171:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:subsidy.
3:75:4733:22:16:97:533:149:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Specifically, we consider a rational expectations model of a competitive market in which
3:76:4821:16:15:92:534:133:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:1As we discuss, this channel is different from that in Dang (2008) and Glode, Green, and Lowery (2012) both
3:77:4928:15:11:80:533:118:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:technically — valuation in our model is information about the joint surplus from trade — and economically — the
3:78:5039:11:0:80:322:107:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:externality in our model operates through the market price.
4:79:5099:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:risk neutral real investors with projects to fund originate and sell assets at prices above their
4:80:5196:22:22:80:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:reservation value, and risk neutralfinancial investors compete to buy these assets given afixed
4:81:5291:22:22:80:537:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:opportunity cost of capital. Sellers’ projects/assets are ex ante identical but ex post payoffsare
4:82:5389:22:22:80:213:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:heterogeneous across assets.
4:83:5417:22:22:97:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:There are two types of buyers.Unsophisticatedfinancial investors are competitive price-
4:84:5504:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:takers who buy assets at their expected present discounted values.Sophisticatedfinancial in-
4:85:5596:22:22:80:533:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:vestors invest ex ante in capacity to perform valuation and can commit to valuing before buying
4:86:5691:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:any assets (modeled as an ex ante choice of available funds). Valuation capacity is costly and
4:87:5785:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:limited in aggregate. The use of a unit of valuation capacity provides a signal of the quality of
4:88:5882:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:an asset. Conditional on a good signal, an asset is worth more than the reservation value in
4:89:5974:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:expectation; conditional on a bad signal, it is not. Valuation is unobservable and nonverifiable,
4:90:6071:22:22:80:533:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and all sellers are anonymous in the sense that the never-valued asset is indistinguishable from
4:91:6167:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the previously-valued asset to every seller except the one that performed the valuation. This
4:92:6260:22:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assumption is critical (and discussed in sections 5.3.2 and 6). Thus a sophisticated investor who
4:93:6357:22:22:80:533:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:values an asset, observes a bad signal of the future payoff, and does not buy it decreases the
4:94:6451:22:22:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:average quality of the pool of assets for other investors, which lowers the equilibrium price paid
4:95:6549:22:22:80:534:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:by unsophisticated investors and raises the profitability of valuation. This externality makes
4:96:6643:22:22:80:245:313:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:valuation a strategic complement.2
4:97:6677:22:22:97:533:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f6:There is a range of parameters over which the market has multiple equilibria. In apool-
4:98:6764:22:22:80:533:269:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:ing  equilibriumno asset is valued, all assets are sold, and because investors with unlimited
4:99:6857:22:22:80:534:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:capital compete to purchase assets, prices are high. In avaluation equilibriumsophisticated
4:100:6948:22:21:80:534:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors invest in valuation capacity, value as many assets as they can, and only good assets
4:101:7042:21:22:80:533:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:are sold/funded. In this valuation equilibrium, because sellers compete for limited buyers with
4:102:7137:22:22:80:534:182:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation capacity, prices are low. The multiplicity is due to the strategic complementarity. The
4:103:7234:22:16:80:534:160:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:more assets are valued, the lower the average quality of unvalued assets. If the average quality
4:104:7330:16:15:92:534:144:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:2In the language of Hellwig and Veldkamp (2009), the choice of the technology to uncover information is a
4:105:7435:15:11:80:533:129:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:strategic complement, but information is a strategic substitute, in that sophisticated investors want different
4:106:7546:11:0:80:342:118:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:information from each other (information about different assets).
5:107:7612:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:falls below the seller’s reservation value, unsophisticated investors leave the market, and only
5:108:7708:22:22:80:350:664:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:assets that are valued and found to be good are traded.3
5:109:7764:22:22:97:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A pooling equilibrium has the features of a credit boom in which market volume and prices
5:110:7853:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:are high while the valuation equilibrium has the features of a credit crunch in which market
5:111:7945:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:volume and prices are low. A switch from a poolingequilibrium to a pure valuation equilibrium,
5:112:8039:22:22:80:533:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which we call avaluation  run, has many of the features of a credit crunch or asset market
5:113:8129:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:panic.4In such a switch in equilibrium, volume falls because sellers with assets that would
5:114:8220:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:have been sold in the pooling equilibrium are unable to get evaluated and so are unable to
5:115:8310:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sell in the valuation equilibrium. Prices fall because sellers lose market power to sophisticated
5:116:8407:21:22:80:533:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors: unsophisticated investors that would have competed to to buy assets in the pooling
5:117:8500:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium are unwilling to buy and so sellers compete for limited valuation.  Sophisticated
5:118:8593:22:22:80:533:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors earn excess rents.5Further, there is aflight to quality in two senses: only good
5:119:8683:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assets are traded/funded, and unsophisticatedinvestors leave the market and hold their funds
5:120:8775:22:22:80:533:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:elsewhere.  Finally, because of the multiple equilibria, this shift neednot be tied directly to
5:121:8870:22:22:80:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:changes in fundamentals, although changes in fundamentals can bring about the possibility of
5:122:8962:22:22:80:328:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:collapse and/or make collapse ultimately inevitable.
5:123:9014:22:22:97:534:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In this region of multiple equilibria, the benefit of valuation is not funding bad projects,
5:124:9106:22:22:80:534:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:yet the socially efficient outcome is the pooling equilibrium with no valuation.6This follows
5:125:9199:22:22:80:533:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:from the fact that the problem of the social planner choosing whether to invest in valuation
5:126:9291:22:22:80:534:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:capacity is (almost) the same as the problem of a single sophisticated investor expecting a
5:127:9382:22:16:80:533:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pooling equilibrium choosing whether to investin a unit of valuation capacity. Both problems
5:128:9474:16:14:92:533:231:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:3Over a different region of parameters, the market can either be in a pooling equilibrium or a mixed equilibrium
5:129:9586:14:11:80:533:217:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:with low prices but in which sophisticated investors value as many assets as they can, buy/fund only the good
5:130:9695:11:7:80:466:206:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:ones, and unsophisticated investors buy/fund both the rejected assets andthe un-valued assets.
5:131:9789:7:15:92:534:199:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:4In a bank run agents protect themselves by withdrawing funds because they expect others to do so and funds
5:132:9896:15:11:80:534:184:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:are not lent to one bank; in our model, sophisticated agents protect themselves by investing in valuation capacity
5:133:10010:11:7:80:421:173:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:because they expect others to do so and funds are not lent to many distinct entities.
5:134:10095:7:15:92:534:166:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:5While we do not model what happens to assets once sold, in mapping to the real world, all investors potentially
5:135:10207:15:7:80:362:151:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:have mark-to-market losses on asset holdings due to the price decline.
5:136:10277:7:15:92:534:144:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:6In this sense, our paper contributes to the literatureon the value of private information (Angeletos and

5:138:10485:11:0:80:286:118:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:an excellent and broad discussion of this literature.

6:140:10634:22:22:80:533:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:or conditionally on the outcome of valuation. Thisresult implies that switches in equilibria of
6:141:10729:22:22:80:350:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the kind just described — valuation runs — are inefficient.
6:142:10788:22:22:97:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:More strikingly, funding all assets without valuation is more efficient even in some regions
6:143:10880:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:where the market delivers only the valuation equilibrium. This follows from the fact that a seller
6:144:10978:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with an asset that is valued and found to be bad can sell to an unsophisticated investor at a
6:145:11071:22:22:80:533:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:high price in a hypothesized pooling equilibrium. Thus, the unsophisticated investors bear the
6:146:11165:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:downside risk of valuation rather than the sophisticated investor or seller associated with the
6:147:11260:22:21:80:533:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:asset to be valued. Sophisticated agents ignore this externality and choose to invest in valuation
6:148:11358:21:22:80:533:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:technology in regions where the social planner, internalizing this externality, would prefer all
6:149:11454:22:22:80:237:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:funding occur without valuation.
6:150:11486:22:22:97:533:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Canpolicycorrectinefficient market outcomes? First, subsidizing trade or lowering inter-
6:151:11574:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:est rates is counterproductive, in that it actually increases the region in which the valuation
6:152:11669:22:22:80:533:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibria is the only equilibrium and the region in which it is a possible equilibrium. Second,
6:153:11765:22:22:80:533:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:subsidizing the payout of bad assets reduces the region in which valuation in equilibrium is
6:154:11857:22:22:80:533:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:possible by reducing the economic return to separating the good from the bad. Third, a tax on
6:155:11950:22:22:80:452:335:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:valuation capacity can ensure the pooling equilibrium wherever it is efficient.7
6:156:12030:22:22:97:533:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:More interestingly, because the pooling equilibrium is more efficient, a large unsophisticated
6:157:12124:22:22:80:538:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investorcanensurethepoolingequilibriumwhereitexistsifithastheabilitytocommitto
6:158:12202:22:22:80:533:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:purchase at the pooling price before sophisticatedinvestors invest in the capacity to do valuation.
6:159:12301:22:22:80:533:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Further, there exists a subsidy for purchases such that if the large investor commits to purchase
6:160:12398:22:21:80:533:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:at a high enough price, the economy would be in a pooling equilibrium wherever a pooling
6:161:12486:21:22:80:534:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium would be more efficient.  That said, this policy could potentially be detrimental
6:162:12579:22:22:80:534:182:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:if the policy were misapplied so that the large investor did not deter valuation and instead
6:163:12671:22:22:80:324:160:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:purchased previously-rejected assets at high prices.
6:164:12723:22:16:97:534:138:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Finally, one might consider policy changes to the model environment to make valuation ob-
6:165:12812:16:15:92:534:122:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:7It is important to note that the model omits many benefits of valuation, most notably that valuation might
6:166:12919:15:0:80:316:107:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:reveal information about the aggregate payoffof all assets.
7:167:12979:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:servable. Such a change would eliminate the valuation externality and make all market equilibria
7:168:13075:22:22:80:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:efficient. However, the incentive of the paired sophisticated investor and seller with a bad asset
7:169:13173:22:22:80:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is to hide both the fact of and the outcome of valuation suggesting that such a policy might be
7:170:13268:22:22:80:156:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:hard to achieve.
7:171:13284:22:22:97:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In our model, markets can produce too much information. Most previous work on information
7:172:13373:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:acquisition and the trading and pricing offinancial assets assumes that the information acquired
7:173:13469:22:22:80:538:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:either reveals information that was previouslyprivateandsosolvesproblemsofasymmetric
7:174:13553:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:information, or alternatively reveals information that is common across assets and revealed by
7:175:13647:22:21:80:533:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:trade and prices. These modeling assumptions each imply that if anything there is too little
7:176:13739:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:information produced from a social perspective. In contrast, our key modeling choice is that
7:177:13831:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation creates private information about a payoffthat is common across agents but unique
7:178:13922:22:22:80:533:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to the particular asset. In our paper, by creating private information before trade, valuation
7:179:14016:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:can cause adverse selection and market collapse, following the insights of Akerlof (1970) and
7:180:14109:22:22:80:166:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Hirshleifer (1971).
7:181:14128:22:22:97:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:While previous papers have argued that valuation can be a strategic complement, lead to
7:182:14215:22:22:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:breakdowns in trade, and have negative consequences for efficiency, our mechanism is theoreti-
7:183:14309:22:22:80:534:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:cally and economically novel. Dang (2008) models trade as a bargaining game in which there is a
7:184:14404:22:22:80:533:313:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:fixed gain to trade and valuation provides private information about common value. In contrast,
7:185:14499:22:22:80:533:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in our model valuation provides private information about the gains from bilateral trade. As
7:186:14591:22:22:80:534:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a result, in Dang (2008), valuation is a strategic complement because more information about
7:187:14683:22:21:80:533:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the common value on one side of the transaction worsens the winners curse on the other side.
7:188:14775:21:22:80:534:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In contrast, in our model, valuation is a strategic complement because more valuation in the
7:189:14867:22:22:80:534:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market lowers the market price which increases the private gains from valuation (and trade for
7:190:14961:22:22:80:534:182:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a project known to be good). Unlike in Dang (2008), informed investors always trade when
7:191:15049:22:22:80:385:160:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:efficient and more valuation in the market lowers market prices.
7:192:15113:22:0:97:534:138:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Secondly, and more importantly, our model includes a reason that valuation is good: it can
8:193:15204:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:reveal that a project is not worth funding.8Thus, valuation can be socially and privately efficient,
8:194:15304:22:22:80:533:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and our results on the social inefficiency of information are non-trivial. These differences have
8:195:15401:22:22:80:350:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:important implications for policy, discussed in Section 6.
8:196:15459:22:22:97:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Our work is similarly differentiated from Glode, Green, and Lowery (2012), which models
8:197:15546:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market booms and freezes as driven by variation in the volatility of the common value of the
8:198:15638:22:22:80:533:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:asset relative to the gains from trade following the choice of valuation capacity. Similarly, Dang,
8:199:15737:22:22:80:533:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Gorton, and Holmstrom (2009) extends the analysis of Dang (2008) to consider how to design
8:200:15827:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a security to maintain maximum liquidity in a secondary market.9We keep the security design
8:201:15918:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:problem here simple citing reasons of moral hazard and lack of funds/collateral.  But more
8:202:16008:21:22:80:533:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:generally, the differences between these models and ours suggest that our mechanism is more
8:203:16099:22:22:80:432:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:applicable to originating assets rather than trading in secondary markets.
8:204:16173:22:22:97:534:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Finally, and most closely related to our paper, the contemporaneous paper Bolton, Santos,
8:205:16262:22:22:80:533:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and Scheinkman (2011) studies an exernality similar to ours in a model in which agents choose
8:206:16355:22:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:whether to become sophisticated, and then compete with unsophisticated exchanges. Unlike
8:207:16443:22:22:80:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in our model, sellers know their type and take unobserved actions leading to a moral hazard
8:208:16534:22:22:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:problem, and sophisticated buyers screen with contracts, so that the policy implications of the
8:209:16629:22:22:80:533:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:two setups differ. And Bolton, Santos, and Scheinkman (2011) focusses on a different substantive
8:210:16725:22:22:80:360:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:application, the size of thefinancial sector in the long run.
8:211:16786:22:22:97:534:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Our model omits many elements present in other theories of credit crunches; in what markets
8:212:16877:22:22:80:534:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:or under what circumstances is our model likely to apply? All markets have valuation, and every
8:213:16972:22:21:80:533:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:asset is valued up to some point, and then pooled with observationally equivalent assets. What
8:214:17066:21:16:80:533:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:distinguishes our theory is that buyers are unable to screen previously-valued projects and
8:215:17157:16:11:92:513:210:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:8If in our setting there were always gains from trade as in Dang (2008) then trade would never collapse.
8:216:17261:11:15:92:534:199:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:9Two other papers on security design are worth noting. Marin and Rahi (2000) considers security design and
8:217:17367:15:11:80:534:184:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:shows how the optimality of complete vs. incomplete markets (complete vs. incomplete revelation of private
8:218:17473:11:11:80:534:173:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:information) depends on the costs of adverse selection on private information relative to the costs of reduced ex
8:219:17586:11:11:80:534:162:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:ante insurance. And Pagano and Volpin (2012) consider security design and then a later equilibrium in which trade
8:220:17699:11:11:80:533:151:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:occurs in a noisy rational expectations equilibrium so that information can get rents. While the model exhibits
8:221:17810:11:11:80:533:140:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:an externality from valuation, it does not generate multiplicity of equilibrium (beyond those always possible in
8:222:17922:11:11:80:534:129:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:noisy rational expectations equilibria (Breon-Drish (2011))), nor is there a role for commitment and so optimal

9:225:18148:22:22:80:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:businesses and households, and some over-the-counter markets where prices are effectively set
9:226:18241:22:22:80:250:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:by second-price sealed bid auctions.
9:227:18277:22:22:97:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We see three situations where our model may prove useful in understanding credit crunches.
9:228:18367:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:First, in new markets there is little record on the performance of new types of assets and the
9:229:18461:22:22:80:533:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investment associated with them. Valuation beyond a certain point is impossible and, condi-
9:230:18552:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:tional on certain characteristics, all real investment is funded. As the performance of different
9:231:18649:22:22:80:533:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assets/investments is observed, valuation costs may decline over time, and as valuation costs
9:232:18742:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:decline, the collapse to the valuation equilibrium becomes possible and ultimately inevitable. In
9:233:18839:21:22:80:533:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:this case, the precursors to collapse are the two main factors identified by Kindleberger (2000):
9:234:18936:22:22:80:534:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:credit — worsened by leverage which is not present in the model — and displacement — a new
9:235:19026:22:22:80:534:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:technology or investment opportunity. Second, in markets where initially all assets are good,
9:236:19119:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the market is automatically in a pooling equilibrium because there is no information to uncover
9:237:19214:22:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with valuation. But since there is no incentive to produce assets of higher quality along the
9:238:19307:22:22:80:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:un-valued dimension, the share of good assets may naturally decline over time, which again
9:239:19397:22:22:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:makes a collapse to the valuation equilibrium possible and possibly inevitable. Third, the size
9:240:19492:22:22:80:533:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the region of multiplicity is monotonically increasing in the probability of a good signal from
9:241:19590:22:22:80:534:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation. Thus our model is most relevant when bad signals are rare. All three situations are
9:242:19684:22:22:80:534:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:elements of the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crash and thefinancial crisis more generally (see
9:243:19777:22:22:80:533:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Gorton (2010)).10Of course, for our model to capture aspects of a widespreadfinancial crisis, it
9:244:19873:22:22:80:533:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:must be that one market is particularly important — like the mortgage market — or equilibrium
9:245:19966:22:13:80:290:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:selection must be correlated across markets.
9:246:20010:13:15:89:534:212:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:10It is also possible that our model may prove useful in undertanding high-frequency patterns where there is
9:247:20118:15:0:80:534:197:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:evidence that informed traders can ‘cream skim’ the best deals (Seppi (1990) Easley, Kiefer, and O’Hara (1996)).

10:249:20240:33:22:80:534:653:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:This section describes our model.  We discuss the importance of key assumptions in Section
10:250:20330:22:22:80:105:631:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:5.3.2.
10:251:20336:22:22:97:534:609:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:There are a unit mass of risk-neutral sellers (real investors) seeking to sell a risky claim to
10:252:20431:22:22:80:534:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a real investment to a large number of competitive risk-neutralfinancial investors each with
10:253:20523:22:21:80:534:565:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:access to unlimited funds at constant gross interest rateR>1. First, a subset of investors
10:254:20613:21:22:80:534:544:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:choose whether to become sophisticated and then the market opens and sellers approach buyers
10:255:20705:22:22:80:241:522:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:until they sell as described below.
10:256:20740:22:22:97:533:500:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Each seller has one project/asset offixed size, has no funds, has a reservation price of1,
10:257:20830:22:22:80:533:478:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and must sell all the asset or none of it. If sold, the asset pays out a random amountDin

10:259:21012:22:22:80:171:434:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:expectation,E[D].
10:260:21029:22:22:97:534:412:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Sellers are anonymous: within the period a seller turned away from one investor is able to
10:261:21119:22:22:80:534:390:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:go to another investor and appear indistinguishable from any other seller.  This assumption
10:262:21210:22:22:80:534:368:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:provides a static analog to a continuous process with valued projects indistinguishable from new
10:263:21306:22:22:80:419:346:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:entrants. We discussion a foundation for this structure in Appendix C.
10:264:21376:22:22:97:534:324:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:If a paired seller and investor have a joint surplus (relative to their outside options) the
10:265:21468:22:22:80:533:302:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:agreed upon price gives the entire surplus to the investor.  That is, the investor has all the
10:266:21562:22:21:80:323:280:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:bargaining power in a Nash bargaining situation.11
10:267:21612:21:22:97:534:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:There are two types of investors. Unsophisticated investors cannot do valuation and have
10:268:21700:22:22:80:533:237:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:aflexible amount of funds. Sophisticated investors must choose at the beginning of the period
10:269:21793:22:22:80:533:215:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(before any buying or selling) both how much capital to raise to purchase assets (ffor funds)
10:270:21886:22:22:80:538:193:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and how much valuation technology to acquire (hfor human capital).12Thecostofaunitof

10:272:22061:17:14:89:534:154:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:11This for simplicity. What is important is that the informed buyer can get some of the returns to a positive
10:273:22170:14:8:80:168:140:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:signal from valuation.
10:274:22192:8:14:89:534:132:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:12The choice of funding capacity will be shown to be a device that allows buyers to commit to buy only after
10:275:22300:14:7:80:120:118:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:valuation.
10:276:22310:7:0:89:534:111:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:13The limit can be due to a limited number of people with the ability to do valuation.  An alternative as-
11:277:22417:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We denote the aggregate amounts of funding and valuation capacity byFandHrespectively,
11:278:22503:22:40:80:414:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and the aggregate constraint on total valuation capacity by ̄χ<1,so

11:280:22579:39:22:80:533:585:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:One unit of valuation technology allows the valuation of one asset which reveals additional
11:281:22670:22:22:80:533:563:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:information about the payoffof that particular asset. The information is binary, and the expected

11:284:22946:22:40:80:519:497:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:anyone doing valuation.14A good asset is worth investing in/buying and a bad asset is not:

11:286:23043:39:40:80:400:418:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The population share of assets that are good, isλ∈(0,1),sothat

11:288:23122:40:22:80:533:338:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The outcome of valuation is observed by both the investor and seller, but is not observable
11:289:23213:22:22:80:533:316:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:by other investors or sellers.  Investors are not anonymous: market participants can observe
11:290:23305:22:21:80:482:294:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:available funds, investment in valuation technology, and the prices of transactions.15
11:291:23391:21:22:97:533:273:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:To summarize,first, sophisticated investors choose funds and valuation technology, then the
11:292:23482:22:22:80:533:251:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market opens. Each seller approaches a buyer/investor and either sells or repeats the process by
11:293:23578:22:21:80:533:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:continuing to another buyer. Unsophisticated investors act competitively to buy/fund assets,
11:294:23670:21:11:80:534:208:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:sumption with the same implications is that there is a limit on the amount offinancial capital available to the
11:295:23781:11:11:80:534:197:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:sophisticated investors. That is, the aggregate constraint on valuation could be due to limits-to-arbitrage rather
11:296:23895:11:7:80:254:186:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:than a technological or resource constraint.
11:297:23939:7:15:89:533:179:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:14An interesting paper with a similar approach to information but a different structure and implications is
11:298:24046:15:10:80:533:164:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:Broecker (1990) in which valuation is costless but noisy, and correlated across lenders.  In equilibrium, the
11:299:24155:10:11:80:534:154:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:winners curse from noisy valuation interacts with the adverse selection problem to generate an equilibrium with
11:300:24266:11:8:80:289:143:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:a continuum of interest rates across different banks.
11:301:24319:8:14:89:534:135:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:15An equivalent assumption is that buyers are anonymous and that all agent knows the amount of valuation
11:302:24423:14:0:80:271:121:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:capacity in the market when it opens for trade.
12:303:24471:0:22:80:525:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and sophisticated investors use their funds and valuation technology to value and buy assets.
12:304:24564:22:22:97:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:An equilibrium is a mass of valuation capacity purchased, a mass of projects sold, a mar-
12:305:24653:22:22:80:534:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:ket price, such that all agents are optimizing. Sophisticated investors maximize profits byfirst
12:306:24749:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:choosing valuation capacity and funding capacity taking as given their own future behavior, the
12:307:24844:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:strategies of other sophisticated investors, and the price that will be available from unsophisti-
12:308:24942:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:cated investors. Subsequently, sophisticated investors use funds and valuation technology and
12:309:25035:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:choose prices taking as given the strategies ofother agents and the price available from unso-
12:310:25129:22:22:80:533:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:phisticated investors. Sellers do the same for their choices of what investors to approach and at
12:311:25226:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:what prices to sell. Unsophisticated investors take the share of good projects as given and com-
12:312:25322:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pete with each other to buy these projects. We assume that indifferent agents trade. Finally, we
12:313:25418:22:22:80:534:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assume that investors randomize across equivalent sellers and sellers randomize across equivalent
12:314:25515:22:22:80:527:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors and a law of large numbers allows us toignore uncertainty from this randomization.
12:315:25607:22:46:97:508:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The next section derives value functions and the following section describes equilibria.

12:321:26115:22:22:80:190:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:analysis of this section.

12:324:26318:38:29:80:245:175:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:3.1  Sophisticated investors
12:325:26346:29:22:80:533:146:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Considerfirst a sophisticated buyer/investor matched with an asset that it has valued. The
12:326:26436:22:22:80:533:124:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:potential buyer values the asset atDg/RorDb/R, and the seller has three options besides
12:327:26523:22:0:80:533:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:selling:i)go to another sophisticated investor;ii)go to an unsophisticated investor;iii)keep
13:328:26617:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:theassetandget1. The buyer buys the asset as long as the value of the asset is greater than
13:329:26708:22:22:80:497:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the largest of these three outside options at a price equal to this largest outside option.
13:330:26799:22:22:97:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:First note that if the asset was found to be bad, there is no price at which this asset is
13:331:26889:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:purchased since the last outside option — keeping the asset — gives greater value than the value
13:332:26985:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the asset (Db/R−1<0). If the asset was found to be good, leaving this seller destroys the
13:333:27077:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:value of the good information the seller and buyer share. Because valuation capacity is always
13:334:27171:22:22:80:533:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:insufficient to value all assets and because sellers are anonymous and valuation is nonverifiable,
13:335:27269:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sophisticated investors do not compete for valued assets and do not bid prices above the better
13:336:27364:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the other two options.16Thus, provided the sophisticated investorihas sufficient funds, an

13:345:27701:22:33:80:308:365:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Summarizing this we have the following lemma.
13:346:27746:33:22:80:444:332:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f6:Lemma 1A sophisticated investor matched with an asset that it has valued

13:353:27925:34:22:97:534:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:It is now useful to partially characterizePU. Since unsophisticated investors compete to
13:354:28013:22:22:80:533:232:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:fund projects, they set prices equal to the present discounted value of dividends. When there is
13:355:28109:22:22:80:533:210:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:no valuation, this impliesPU=E[D]/R. When there is valuation, good projects are removed
13:356:28196:22:22:80:397:188:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:from this pool, and we claim (verified below) thatPU<E[D]/R.
13:357:28256:22:22:97:534:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Next, we turn to the question of the choice of funds by the sophisticated investor. If no
13:358:28345:22:16:80:533:144:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation capacity is purchased, then we assume zero funds are chosen.17If valuation capacity
13:359:28438:16:15:89:534:128:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:16It is straightforward to confirm that there is surplus:PU<Dg/Ror unsophisticated investors lose money,
13:360:28542:15:7:80:201:113:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:so thatPg<Dg/Rforλ<1.
13:361:28563:7:0:89:534:106:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:17While it is possible that a sophisticated investor that does not invest in valuation capacity mimics an unso-
14:362:28676:0:22:80:533:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is positive, sophisticated investorichooses funds equal to the cost of purchasing all the good
14:363:28770:22:22:80:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assets it wouldfind using all its valuation capacity when only un-valued sellers approach it, which
14:364:28869:22:22:80:534:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:isPgλhi.18It buys no bad assets and no assets without valuation. Why? If the sophisticated
14:365:28959:22:22:80:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:buyer chose less than this amount of funds, costly valuation capacity would go to waste. If it
14:366:29053:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:had funds to spare after funding good projects, it could buy some assets without valuation or
14:367:29146:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:buy some bad assets. Buying a random un-valuedasset from the population of assets is strictly
14:368:29239:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:preferred whenever some valuation is happening becauseE[D]/R > PU. But then, knowing
14:369:29323:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:this, sellers that have assets that they knoware bad would approach this investor the same
14:370:29413:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:way they might approach an unsophisticated investor and the sophisticated investor would no
14:371:29504:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:longer be drawing a random asset from the population but instead from a pool containing both
14:372:29596:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unvalued assets and those valued and found to be bad.  Thus, a sophisticated investor that
14:373:29686:22:22:80:534:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:chooses funds sufficient to buy unvalued assets would reduce the quality of its pool of applicants
14:374:29784:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and so reduce the efficiency of its use of valuation, and would do so sufficiently as to be not worth
14:375:29885:22:22:80:533:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:doing. These results are summarized in the following lemma, proved in appendix A (following

14:381:30329:22:22:80:446:245:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:capacity. We can now derive the value functions that characterize equilibria.

15:413:31438:22:22:97:534:478:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:It is worth noting that, given our assumptions, investors would like to use contract terms
15:414:31528:22:22:80:533:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to screen assets and save on valuation capacity. This could be done by sophisticated investors
15:415:31622:22:22:80:533:434:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with an ex ante fee, which in the model is ruled out twice. First, we assume that sellers have
15:416:31716:22:22:80:533:412:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:no funds: since no sellers have any funds, an application fee would make no profits and buy no
15:417:31810:22:22:80:534:390:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assets. Second, we assume that after valuation, investors have all the power in the bargaining
15:418:31904:22:21:80:534:368:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:relationship. Given this, after valuation, the best price a seller can hope for is the market price
15:419:32003:21:22:80:533:347:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(or reservation value), meaning that noseller would pay a fee in equilibrium.20An alternative
15:420:32096:22:22:80:533:325:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:screening mechanism would be to allow investors to impose a penalty on the seller whose asset
15:421:32189:22:22:80:533:303:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pays offpoorly — have the seller bear some risk. Two common foundations for the assumption
15:422:32279:22:22:80:534:281:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that the seller must sell all the asset are either moral hazard on the part of the new owner
15:423:32371:22:17:80:533:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(investor) or there being no resources for the investor to collect if the asset turns out to be bad.
15:424:32471:17:15:89:533:242:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:19And this will also be true for more general cost functions as long as cost is not increasing faster than price is
15:425:32586:15:7:80:124:227:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:decreasing.
15:426:32597:7:14:89:536:220:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:20Relaxing both these assumptions and allowing a fee, investors will generallyfind it profitabletochoosemore

18:524:36424:29:22:80:533:301:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We focus on two possible types of equilibria in which investors invest in the valuation technology.
18:525:36523:22:22:80:534:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:First, there is avaluation equilibriumin which sophisticated investors value and buy as many
18:526:36615:22:22:80:533:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:good assets as they can and make profits, and the residual pool of assets is so poor on average
18:527:36710:22:22:80:533:235:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that unsophisticated investors do not buy assets. Second, there is amixed equilibriumin which
18:528:36803:22:22:80:534:213:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sellers sell both with and without valuation. This occurs when the pool of assets remaining
18:529:36894:22:22:80:534:191:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:after sophisticated investors value and purchase is good enough on average that unsophisticated
18:530:36989:22:22:80:533:169:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors purchase these assets. For completeness, we also note that there is also a third type of
18:531:37087:22:0:80:533:147:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium with valuation, also mixed, but argue that it is a knife-edge case and not interesting.

19:552:37820:21:22:80:533:333:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:relative to the gain from valuation, which is the probability that transaction occurs times the

19:555:38102:22:22:80:292:267:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assets are bought by sophisticated investors.
19:556:38147:22:22:97:537:245:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:It is worth noting that in the pooling equilibrium (equation (9)), the benefitofamarginal
19:557:38236:22:22:80:538:223:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unit of valuation is the ability to avoid the unvalued assets that are bad with probability1−λ.In
19:558:38333:22:22:80:534:201:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the valuation equilibrium, there is an additional benefit, the ability to avoid all assets that have
19:559:38433:22:22:80:533:179:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:previously been found to be bad by others. Thus, as the share of good assets in the population

19:562:38711:22:0:80:533:113:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in equilibrium is vanishing. This previews one ofthe results of section 5.2, that valuation can

20:565:38884:29:22:80:534:621:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In the second possible equilibrium with valuation, sophisticated and unsophisticated investors
20:566:38978:22:22:80:533:599:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:both purchase assets.  While as in the valuation equilibrium, sophisticated investors are at

20:568:39165:22:22:80:534:555:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:high that the remaining, unvalued assets still have positive expected net present value and are
20:569:39260:22:22:80:534:533:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:bought without valuation by unsophisticated investors. As above, sophisticated investors have

20:600:39984:15:15:89:534:115:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:21There is a discontinuity (outside our assumed range) atλ=1, where the valuation equilibrium cannot occur

21:604:40302:22:22:80:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:‘scaling’ factor represents the difference between the temptation to purchase valuation when no

21:606:40491:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:purchase valuation (and so prices are lower). The second inequality states that the share of good

21:611:40900:29:22:80:534:466:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:For completeness, we note that there can also exist an equilibrium in which sophisticated in-
21:612:40993:22:22:80:533:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:vestors invest in an intermediate amount of valuation capacity and lower market prices just
21:613:41084:22:21:80:534:422:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:enough to raise profits from investing in a unit of valuation to zero, and unsophisticated in-
21:614:41178:21:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:vestors buy the remaining assets. This equilibrium is a knife-edge case, unstable in the sense
21:615:41272:22:22:80:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that if a sophisticated investor invested in morevaluation capacity, it would reduce the quality
21:616:41368:22:22:80:533:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the assets bought by the unsophisticated investors, valuation would make more profits, and
21:617:41461:22:22:80:533:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:all sophisticated investors would like to have invested in more capacity to do valuation. Simi-
21:618:41556:22:22:80:533:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:larly, a slightly higher share of assets choosingto use unsophisticated investors would raise the
21:619:41653:22:22:80:534:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unsophisticated market price, raisingPS, and all sophisticated investors would prefer not to
21:620:41745:22:22:80:278:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:have invested in capacity to do valuation.
21:621:41787:22:22:97:534:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In Appendix B, we show that this unconstrained mixed equilibrium exists for all parameters

22:629:42268:29:32:80:398:619:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The analysis of the previous section implies the following theorem.

23:665:43697:38:29:80:242:560:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:5.2  Efficiency of equilibria
23:666:43726:29:22:80:534:531:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We define efficiency as maximizing social surplus: the sum of the value functions of the unit
23:667:43819:22:21:80:533:509:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:mass of sellers and all investors who buy assets. We show that in the region of multiplicity, the
23:668:43916:21:22:80:533:488:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:socially efficient outcome is always the pooling equilibrium. More strikingly, there is a region
23:669:44012:22:22:80:534:466:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:where the market delivers only an equilibrium with valuation and in which it would be more
23:670:44102:22:22:80:471:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:efficient to buy/fund all assets without valuation (Pareto superior with transfers).
23:671:44186:22:22:97:534:422:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Consider the parameter set for which the mixed equilibrium exists. Since the pooling equilib-
23:672:44279:22:22:80:534:400:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rium also leads to all assets trading, but without the costs of valuation, the pooling equilibrium
23:673:44377:22:22:80:292:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is more efficient than the mixed equilibrium.
23:674:44422:22:22:97:534:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We next show that the parameter set over which a sophisticated investor would choose to
23:675:44509:22:22:80:534:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:invest in valuation capacity is strictly larger than the parameter set over which a social planner
23:676:44607:22:22:80:534:312:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:would choose to have investment in the valuation technology.  Thus, where the market can
23:677:44695:22:22:80:534:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:deliver either equilibrium, the pooling equilibrium is more efficient.  And in a subset of the
23:678:44789:22:22:80:534:268:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:parameter space where the market delivers onlythe valuation equilibrium, the planner would
23:679:44879:22:22:80:202:246:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:like to prohibit valuation.
23:680:44906:22:21:97:533:224:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:To develop intuition,first assume that ̄χis arbitrarily close to one, so there is no inefficiency
23:681:45003:21:22:80:533:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in the valuation equilibrium from not being able to value all assets. The planner would like to
23:682:45098:22:22:80:533:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:invest in a unit of valuation capacity only if the cost,c, is less than the expected social benefit.
23:683:45198:22:22:80:534:159:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:This benefit is the probability in the population that any given asset is bad (1−λ), times the
23:684:45292:22:0:80:533:137:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:gain from not trading it, which in turn is the reservation value of the seller less the present value
24:685:45395:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the asset (1−Db/R).22Given linearity (and ̄χalmost one), if the planner chooses to value
24:686:45486:22:22:80:533:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:one asset, it would choose to value all assets and so the valuation equilibrium would be more
24:687:45579:22:22:80:120:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:efficient.
24:688:45589:22:22:97:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Now consider a sophisticated investor choosing whether to invest in a unit of valuation or
24:689:45679:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:instead to mimic an unsophisticated investor and buy/fund one asset without valuation. In either
24:690:45775:22:22:80:533:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:case, if the asset is good, the investor buys it at the market priceP. The private cost of valuation
24:691:45875:22:22:80:538:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:capacity is the same as in thesocial planner’s problem,c. The expected private benefitisthe
24:692:45966:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:population probability that an asset is bad — again, as in the social planner’s problem — times

24:695:46251:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the pooling price is greater than or equal to the reservation value (P≥1) for any parameters in
24:696:46346:22:22:80:533:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which the pooling equilibrium exists. Thus, the planner prefers the pooling equilibrium for all
24:697:46441:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:parameter values for which a sophisticated investor acting alone does not undermine it — that

24:699:46616:22:22:97:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Further, for some parameter values for which only the pure valuation equilibrium exists,
24:700:46704:22:22:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:trading all assets without valuation is more efficient. Why? Because valuation allows investors
24:701:46799:22:22:80:534:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to avoid buying/trading bad assets. The cost of buying/trading a bad asset is the effective price
24:702:46896:22:22:80:534:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:paid less the payout, where the effective price is the market price for the sophisticated investor
24:703:46994:22:22:80:533:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:but only the reservation price for the planner.Thus, the existence of transactions without

24:705:47173:22:21:80:534:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which, for some parameters, undermines the existence of the pooling equilibrium where it would
24:706:47267:21:22:80:211:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:otherwise be more efficient.

24:709:47480:22:16:80:533:160:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In the pure valuation equilibrium, since sellers are all at their reservation values, total social

26:784:49794:29:22:80:533:199:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A switch in equilibrium from a pooling to a pure valuation equilibrium exhibits many of the
26:785:49885:22:22:80:534:177:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stylized features of investment crashes.  In particular, the increase in valuation is associated
26:786:49981:22:22:80:534:155:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with:a)Investment collapse:The volume of transactions declines from1to ̄χλas only sellers

27:791:50255:0:22:80:533:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:because in the pooling equilibrium assets are scarce and valuation is not required to invest
27:792:50347:22:22:80:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:without losses, so sellers get high prices and marginal investment earns the opportunity cost of
27:793:50443:22:22:80:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:funds. In the valuation equilibrium, only sophisticated investors purchase assets, sellers compete
27:794:50541:22:22:80:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:for this limited valuation technology, and prices for assets are low as skilled investors earn profits
27:795:50643:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and sellers receive their outside option.c)Nonfundamental volatility:The crash is not driven
27:796:50735:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f6:by fundamentals, but rather could be triggered by any small coordinating event.d)Credit

27:798:50911:22:22:80:533:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unvalued assets (and so some good assets), cannot get sold/funded in the valuation equilibrium.
27:799:51006:22:21:80:533:510:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:e)Flight to quality:Unsophisticated investors leave the market as the chance of buying a bad
27:800:51098:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:asset increases and only good assets trade.f)Profits for sophisticated investors:Sophisticated
27:801:51192:22:22:80:336:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors make profits/valuation capacity earns rents.
27:802:51246:22:22:97:534:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A switch in equilibrium from the pooling to the mixed equilibrium also exhibits many of
27:803:51333:22:22:80:533:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the features of an investment crash.  In this case, the switch in equilibrium also exhibits an
27:804:51427:22:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increase in valuation, a collapse in price (but smaller) not driven by fundamentals, and profits
27:805:51523:22:22:80:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:for sophisticated investors. But trade volume does not decline, there is no credit/funding crunch,
27:806:51621:22:22:80:232:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and there is noflight to quality.
27:807:51654:22:22:97:427:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Importantly, either type of switch in equilibrium is always inefficient.
27:808:51726:22:22:97:534:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:While our model is static, it is straightforward to consider repeated static model in which all
27:809:51821:22:22:80:534:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unsold assets disappear at the end of each period. One might then consider as an application
27:810:51913:22:22:80:533:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the model a new investment opportunity which is expected to be quite profitable but which
27:811:52005:22:21:80:534:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is also initially hard to value along some dimension. Over time, returns are observed the cost of
27:812:52102:21:22:80:533:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation may (exogenously) decline. Similarly, since capital isflowing into the market without
27:813:52197:22:22:80:533:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:careful valuation along this dimension, the quality of new assets may decline along this dimension
27:814:52295:22:22:80:534:182:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:over time. In either case, the market can begin in a region in which it is necessarily in a pooling
27:815:52394:22:22:80:534:160:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium and all assets are traded at high prices. As valuation costs decline or the share of bad
27:816:52494:22:16:80:534:138:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:assets increases, the market may enter a region where a valuation equilibrium is also possible.23
27:817:52591:16:15:89:534:122:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:23As an aside, there is also no higher payment to the sellers of good assets relative to bad assets in the pure
27:818:52702:15:0:80:533:107:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:valuation equilibrium as both receive their reservation values. This result would change if sophisticated investors

28:820:52909:22:22:80:460:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:always inefficient when they occur, although they may be ultimately inevitable.

28:823:53170:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Mankiw (1986), Eisfeldt (2004), Kurlat (2010), Morris and Shin (2012), Philippon and Skreta
28:824:53261:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(2012), and Malherbe (forthcoming).  Our explanation rests on what we believe are the key
28:825:53350:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:features of externalfinance: the opportunity to not undertake the investment and the possibility
28:826:53446:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of acquiring non-verifiable information on the quality of the investment. As such, our explanation
28:827:53544:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is closer to Ruckes (2004) and Dell’Ariccia andMarquez (2006), which both consider how adverse
28:828:53638:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:selection and lending standards leads to contractions of credit in bad times.24The former shows
28:829:53733:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:how the probability that a borrower is of a bad type changes the private value of information

28:831:53916:22:22:80:533:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of information but rather on contract terms (specifically collateral requirements) and how these
28:832:54012:22:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:change in response to exogenous changes in the share of new projects, about which no bank
28:833:54101:22:22:80:533:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:has information, and existing projects, about which some bank has private information.  In
28:834:54191:22:22:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the model, fewer new projects implies a lower share of good projects approaching banks and a
28:835:54283:22:37:80:333:335:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:tightening of lending standards and reduced credit.25
28:836:54336:37:29:80:212:298:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:5.3.2  Key assumptions
28:837:54358:29:22:80:533:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Turning to assumptions,first, it is not essential that valuation capacity be strictly limited, but
28:838:54456:22:22:80:534:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:it must have increasing costs. If the cost of valuation capacity to sophisticated investors were
28:839:54552:22:22:80:534:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increasing in the aggregate amount of valuationpurchased, our results would be qualitatively
28:840:54644:22:22:80:533:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:similar (if increasing ‘enough’) except that the sophisticated investors would not earn rents
28:841:54737:22:20:80:534:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(which instead would presumably accrue to the providers of the valuation capacity). A capacity
28:842:54831:20:7:80:313:161:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:sometimes valued the same asset and competed to buy it.
28:843:54886:7:15:89:534:154:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:24Postdating our paper. Gorton and Ordonez (forthcoming) also draws out new insights forfluctuations in
28:844:54989:15:7:80:298:139:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:informed lending by incorporating secondary markets.
28:845:55041:7:15:89:533:132:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:25Similarly, and postdating our paper, Kurlat (2012) defines a new equilibrium concept in a different model of
28:846:55151:15:11:80:534:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:valuation skill in which increases in volume for sale leads to entry of valuation skill and worse adverse selection
28:847:55266:11:0:80:534:106:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:problems and lower prices, thus rationalizing declines in price associated withfire sales through valuation effects.
29:848:55384:0:22:80:299:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:constraint significantly simplifies the analysis.
29:849:55433:22:22:97:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Second, instead of assuming that valuation capacity is sunk, we could have assumed that the
29:850:55524:22:22:80:534:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unsophisticated investors are small and competitive price takers as in the equilibrium concept in
29:851:55621:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Dubey and Geanakoplos (2002). This would lead to the same regions, would not require that so-
29:852:55714:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:phisticated investors be competitive, but would change the importance of commitment for policy,
29:853:55809:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:discussed next. Without sunk valuation, competition in prices by deep-pocketed unsophisticated
29:854:55903:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors could eliminate the possibility of multiple equilibria (but not change outcomes in the
29:855:55999:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:region in which the valuation equilibrium is unique but funding without valuation more efficient).
29:856:56097:22:21:97:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Third, the assumption that the investor gets all the surplus when matched with a seller
29:857:56184:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:known to be good is important only for the equations that determine where different regions
29:858:56275:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:occur (as long as the investor gets some of the surplus) and for what parties earn rents in the
29:859:56370:22:22:80:534:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation equilibria. This follows because, in equilibria with valuation, sophisticated buyers are
29:860:56468:22:22:80:534:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:making sellers weakly prefer to sell to them, so changing this to a strict condition does not
29:861:56561:22:22:80:534:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:change the qualitative results. What is important for the qualitative results is that investors get
29:862:56660:22:22:80:438:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sufficient surplus to cover the costs of valuation for some parameter values.
29:863:56737:22:22:97:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Two alternative assumptions with the same implications are i) that sophisticated investors
29:864:56827:22:22:80:534:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:post prices at which they are committed to transact if they transact and ii) that sellers after a
29:865:56924:22:22:80:534:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:possible valuation sell through a second-price sealed-bid auction. The proof of thefirst claim
29:866:57018:22:22:80:534:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:follows from the fact that being able to make a take-it-or-leave it offer is equivalent having all the
29:867:57120:22:22:80:533:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:bargaining power in this environment. The proof of the second claim follows from the fact that
29:868:57214:22:21:80:534:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the optimal bid in a second price auction is the private value so that a buyer with information
29:869:57309:21:22:80:394:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that an asset is good wins the auction and pays the market price.
29:870:57374:22:22:97:534:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Fourth, our assumption that a seller turned away from one investor is able to go to another
29:871:57465:22:22:80:534:182:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investor and appear indistinguishable from any other seller is a static analog to what must
29:872:57556:22:22:80:533:160:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:really be a dynamic process with valued projects indistinguishable from new entrants. As a
29:873:57646:22:22:80:534:138:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:more formal foundation, we show in Appendix C that our model has the same implications if we
29:874:57738:22:0:80:533:116:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:instead assume that sellers pursue sequential search but buyers do not know in what order the
30:875:57833:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:seller approaches potential buyers, an information structure borrowed from Zhu (forthcoming).26
30:876:57928:22:22:97:533:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Finally, the fact that valuation is not observed — that a seller with a previously-valued asset
30:877:58023:22:22:80:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is indistinguishable from a seller with a valued and rejected asset — is critical. But as noted, it
30:878:58122:22:22:80:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is also incentive compatible for the buyer-seller pair with a known-bad asset. Further, notice
30:879:58216:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that sophisticated investors prefer equilibria with valuation and unsophisticated investors are

30:881:58401:22:22:80:533:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:ordering makes it suspect that investor groups that self regulate and share information, such as
30:882:58497:22:22:80:461:532:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:through industry-wide credit bureaus, actually share this type of information.27
30:883:58577:22:21:97:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:If the act of valuation were observable, the negative externality from valuation would be
30:884:58666:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:corrected in the current model. Section 6 considers this as a potential regulatory intervention
30:885:58761:22:46:80:494:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and shows that the equilibria of this alternative model are unique and always efficient.

30:890:59139:22:22:80:534:323:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:private information and is solved as a rational expectation equilibrium, it is worth emphasizing
30:891:59235:22:22:80:423:301:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that this section studies optimal policy in the model not the real world.
30:892:59308:22:22:97:533:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:To begin, why does the market not deliver the more efficient equilibrium? Thefirst answer
30:893:59397:22:22:80:534:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is that valuation has social costs greater than its private benefits — it creates information on
30:894:59493:22:22:80:533:235:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which adverse selection can occur. Thus afirst approach to optimal policy is to tax valuation
30:895:59586:22:22:80:223:213:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:or eliminate adverse selection.
30:896:59617:22:16:97:533:191:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:One optimal policy is to tax units of valuation capacity with tax,τ, so that the use of
30:897:59704:16:15:89:534:175:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:26To be clear, implicit in this assumption is the inability of sellers with unvalued projects to commit to delay
30:898:59816:15:7:80:313:160:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:sale as in Guerrieri and Shimer (2012) and Chang (2011).
30:899:59872:7:14:89:534:153:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:27It seems more likely that credit bureaus, like ratings agencies, simply segment assets into markets, each of
30:900:59982:14:11:80:533:139:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:which is either in a pooling equilibrium or valuation equilibrium where buyers do or do not investigate beyond
30:901:60092:11:11:80:533:128:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:the credit check. It is notable that credit bureaus typically do not reveal the identity of those who conduct credit
30:902:60208:11:11:80:533:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:checks and so do not reveal the purpose of the check (something that an unsophisticated investor wouldfind
30:903:60314:11:0:80:110:106:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:useful).
31:904:60324:0:48:80:405:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation is deterred where it is inefficient, which is anyτsuch that

31:928:60782:22:22:80:136:525:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:valuation.28

31:930:60891:22:22:80:533:481:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the use of valuation when privately efficient while eliminating its social loss. Such a policy is
31:931:60988:22:22:80:533:459:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:at odds with the assumptions of the model and not straightforward to implement given agent’s

31:933:61174:22:22:80:534:415:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and rejected assets would remain unsold.  Unvalued assets would be sold to unsophisticated
31:934:61264:22:22:80:534:393:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors at the pooling equilibrium price (iff≥1). And unvalued sellers would only approach
31:935:61356:22:22:80:534:371:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sophisticated investors if the expected value of their outside options after valuation were at least
31:936:61456:22:22:80:533:349:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equal to the price available without valuation, which cannot happen unless either sophisticated
31:937:61551:22:22:80:534:327:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors pay fees to unvalued sellers prior to valuation or sophisticated sellers can commit to

31:939:61742:22:39:80:464:283:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:would post the minimum price to attract unvalued assets, which isPgsuch that

31:945:61950:14:11:80:533:208:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:markets where insurance cannot be predicated on testing. And auctioneers as market makers may not make items

32:985:63081:22:22:80:534:223:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:There is a larger region in which the pooling equilibrium exists, determined by equation (9) with

33:993:63642:0:22:80:237:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:covers the same region as before.
33:994:63675:22:22:97:533:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Three results follow.  First, with observed valuation and without anonymity, the market
33:995:63762:22:22:80:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium is always efficient; there are no externalities and no regions of multiplicity.30Second,
33:996:63862:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:some valuation is efficient for a larger set of parameters than in the original model with anonymity
33:997:63962:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:because valued assets that are found to be bad are not traded, and do not reduce the average
33:998:64054:22:22:80:534:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:quality of assets remaining after valuation. Finally, there are strict efficiency benefits to making
33:999:64154:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation observable and eliminating anonymityif and only if original market equilibrium has
33:1000:64246:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation and unvalued assets are worth selling/funding (in Figure 3, any region with valuation

33:1003:64421:12:17:446:483:506:65:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:Dg−Db).
33:1004:64428:17:22:97:533:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Whether such a policy is optimal of course depends on its cost to implement. Further, such
33:1005:64518:22:22:80:534:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a policy is not incentive compatible given only lack of anonymity. Sophisticated investors and
33:1006:64612:22:22:80:509:445:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:assets found to be bad have a joint incentive to hide the fact that a valuation was done.31
33:1007:64703:22:22:97:533:423:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The second answer to why the market does not deliver the more efficient equilibrium is that
33:1008:64794:22:22:80:533:401:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unsophisticated agents do not have the ability to commit to purchase at high prices (they do not
33:1009:64890:22:22:80:534:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:compete in contracts with commitment). If unsophisticated investors had commitment, a large
33:1010:64981:22:17:80:534:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f8:unsophisticated investor could post a price equal to the price in the pooling equilibrium,P=

33:1012:65084:9:18:106:534:331:65:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:R, which would ensure that the market is in the pooling equilibrium wherever it exists
33:1013:65170:18:22:80:534:313:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:as a market equilibrium. This result follows from the efficiency of the pooling equilibrium.32
33:1014:65264:22:22:80:534:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Thus, if private agents were unable and the government were able, the government could commit
33:1015:65357:22:22:80:534:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to purchase at the pooling equilibrium price. Oralternately, the government could commit to
33:1016:65448:22:22:80:437:247:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:insure all mortgages at the ex ante fair price for the pooling equilibrium.33
33:1017:65525:22:21:97:534:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:However, the ability of a large unsophisticated investor to commit does not ensure that
33:1018:65612:21:16:80:533:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation is not used outside the region of multiplicity where the efficient outcomes still involves
33:1019:65712:16:11:89:302:188:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:30This follows from similar arguments to section 5.2.
33:1020:65765:11:15:89:533:177:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:31Sorkin (2009) describes several episodes during the USfinancial crisis of commercial banks valuing an invest-
33:1021:65876:15:11:80:533:162:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:ment bank for purchase in which both parties, but especially the investment bank, tried to keep secret the fact
33:1022:65987:11:7:80:206:151:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:that a valuation was occurring.

33:1024:66116:15:7:80:496:129:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:possible, so that no sophisticated investors would invest in valuation and the multiplicity is eliminated.
33:1025:66222:7:15:89:534:122:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:33It is not sufficient to insure the mortgages at an ex post fair price, since then sophisticated investors can do
33:1026:66336:15:0:80:371:107:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:valuation, insure only the bad assets, and destroy the insurance scheme.

34:1047:67123:22:22:80:533:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:are inefficient for a wider range of parameters than whenλis lower.  And a large investor
34:1048:67212:22:22:80:534:409:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with commitment and a subsidy that funds a largefraction at high prices can keep others from
34:1049:67304:22:22:80:533:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investing in valuation capacity and so optimally ensure the efficient equilibrium. One might then
34:1050:67401:22:21:80:534:365:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:interpret the demise of these institutions as due to their committing to purchase at the expected
34:1051:67498:21:22:80:533:344:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:present discounted value of a random (unvalued) mortgage withλtoo low to support this as
34:1052:67586:22:22:80:534:322:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a pooling equilibrium price. In this case, the commitment to purchase (or insure) mortgages
34:1053:67677:22:22:80:533:300:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assuming no adverse selection when the market actually has valuation and adverse selection is
34:1054:67770:22:22:80:534:278:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:extremely costly to the government (or GSE). It is also worth noting that, as with some other
34:1055:67863:22:22:80:534:256:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:mechanisms to eliminate adverse selection, there are incentives to undermine this policy: in the
34:1056:67959:22:22:80:533:234:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pooling equilibrium, unsophisticated investors earns no rents, while in the valuation equilibrium,
34:1057:68057:22:22:80:253:212:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sophisticated investors make profits.
34:1058:68094:22:22:97:534:190:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:This policy is related to securitization and shares some insights with the literature on how
34:1059:68186:22:22:80:533:168:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:informed issuers destroy information to create a pooling equilibrium (Gorton and Pennacchi

35:1083:68948:22:22:97:534:368:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We conclude by considering two policies in which the government changes parameters of the
35:1084:69037:22:21:80:116:346:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market.
35:1085:69044:21:22:97:534:325:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:First, cutting the interest rate is counterproductive. The set of (other) parameters for which
35:1086:69138:22:22:80:533:303:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibria with valuation are possible with a lower interest rate covers that with a higher interest
35:1087:69238:22:22:80:533:281:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rate. In contrast, raising the interest rate can held reduce valuation. These effects work by
35:1088:69331:22:18:80:533:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:changing the present value of the information gathered by valuation, which is proportional to

35:1090:69429:8:18:93:533:233:65:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:Rwithout changing its cost. Figure 4 shows how raising the interest rate (fromR=1.10,
35:1091:69514:18:22:80:533:215:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:dotted lines toR=1.11, solid lines) reduces the size of region of multiplicity and the size of
35:1092:69608:22:22:80:534:193:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the region in which valuation can occur in conjunction with pooling. Note that the policy also
35:1093:69702:22:22:80:324:171:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increases the region in which no investment occurs.
35:1094:69753:22:22:97:533:149:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Second, policies which reduce the difference in payoffs across assets of different quality reduce
35:1095:69850:22:22:80:533:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the size of the regions in which equilibria with valuation are possible. Such policies reduce the
35:1096:69947:22:0:80:534:105:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:incentive to do valuation by reducing the benefits to separating the good from the bad. Figure

36:1139:71233:22:0:80:534:120:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to a tax on valuation, in practice this solution blunts any incentives to buy good assets in other

37:1141:71392:22:22:97:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:How do the optimality of these policies contrast with those if the information friction were
37:1142:71484:22:22:80:533:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of the type in Dang (2008) or Glode, Green, and Lowery (2012)?  In both of these papers,
37:1143:71572:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:outlawing valuation achieves thefirst best since valuation has no social benefit. In our model,
37:1144:71667:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the optimality of valuation depends on the cost of valuation since valuation can have social
37:1145:71759:22:22:80:533:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:benefits. Publicizing that a valuation was performed does nothing to improve the outcomes in
37:1146:71851:22:22:80:534:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Dang (2008) or Glode, Green, and Lowery (2012), as agents in these models make the correct
37:1147:71941:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:inference about whomever they are facing. Finally, in these papers committing to purchase at
37:1148:72033:22:21:80:534:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the uninformed expected value of the asset is generically extremely costly. Agents still have
37:1149:72126:21:22:80:534:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the incentive to value the asset and transact only when valuable to them. The only way to
37:1150:72215:22:22:80:533:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:eliminate inefficiency in these other models, absent banning valuation, is to make public the
37:1151:72308:22:46:80:278:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:private information about common value.
37:1152:72347:46:32:80:197:399:209:g_d0_f2:209:g_d0_f2:7Conclusion
37:1153:72358:32:22:80:534:367:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In this paper we have considered a model in which valuation creates private information about
37:1154:72451:22:22:80:533:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the payofffrom a new investment opportunity and in which the rents of this information are
37:1155:72541:22:22:80:534:323:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:captured by the informed buyer. We show thepossibility of multiple equilibria with different
37:1156:72633:22:22:80:534:301:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:levels of valuation and rank these equilibria by efficiency. Where equilibria without valuation
37:1157:72728:22:22:80:534:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:exist, valuation is always socially inefficient, and where equilibria without valuation do not exist,
37:1158:72829:22:22:80:534:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation can still be less efficient than selling/funding without valuation. This result stands in
37:1159:72928:22:22:80:533:235:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:contrast to most research onfinancial markets which studies the discovery of information that
37:1160:73021:22:22:80:533:213:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is common to a class of assets and is transmitted by actions through prices. In our model, too
37:1161:73115:22:22:80:533:191:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:much information is created because it createsasymmetric information and causes problems
37:1162:73203:22:22:80:533:169:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of adverse selection, while in the canonical model information tends to be under-produced and
37:1163:73296:22:14:80:188:147:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:markets learn too late.
37:1164:73319:14:14:89:534:133:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:34Although, if the tax and subsidy plan were explicitly balanced budget and orthogonal to the mean payoff,
37:1165:73425:14:0:80:522:119:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:then such a policy could avoid diminishing the incentive to collect information about asset-class wide payoffs.

41:1245:78186:34:22:97:534:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Proof: Valuation cannot be slack since it is costly ex ante.  Thus sophisticated investors
41:1246:78276:22:22:80:533:531:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:choose funds at least sufficient to buy all assets found to be good when using all their valuation
41:1247:78374:22:21:80:121:509:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:capacity.
41:1248:78383:21:22:97:534:488:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Suppose that a sophisticated investor bought more assets than its capacity to do valuation.
41:1249:78474:22:22:80:533:466:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In this case, any seller going to this investor would have a positive probability of selling without
41:1250:78574:22:22:80:533:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valuation at a price equal to its outside option.  Thus this sophisticated investor, would be
41:1251:78667:22:22:80:534:422:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:approached by sellers with previously-valued assets that they know to be bad as well as by
41:1252:78757:22:22:80:533:400:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sellers that do not know the quality of their assets. Thus the share of good assets would be
41:1253:78849:22:22:80:534:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the same as for unsophisticated investors, the market share of good assets. Since this sector
41:1254:78942:22:22:80:534:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is competitive, any purchases without valuation would not make profits.  At the same time
41:1255:79031:22:22:80:534:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the existence of such purchases reduces the share of sellers with good assets that approach the
41:1256:79126:22:22:80:534:312:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sophisticated investor, so that a unit of valuation is less likely to uncover a good asset. Thus,
41:1257:79223:22:22:80:533:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:buying only conditional on a good valuation, which would keep known-bad assets away, is more
41:1258:79315:22:22:80:129:268:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:profitable.
41:1259:79326:22:22:97:534:246:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A sophisticated investor with funds greater than its valuation capacity can not commit to
41:1260:79415:22:21:80:533:224:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:value all assets before funding and not use these additional funds.  If there is valuation in
41:1261:79508:21:22:80:533:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium, then the share of good assets in the market for funding without valuation is less
41:1262:79602:22:22:80:533:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:than that in the population. Thus, if only unvalued assets approached the sophisticated investor,
41:1263:79699:22:22:80:534:159:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the investor wouldfind it profitable to fund without valuation at a price equal to the expected
41:1264:79794:22:22:80:534:137:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:value of the unvalued asset sold to the unsophisticated investors (or1if the unsophisticated

42:1314:80716:0:49:314:322:212:121:g_d0_f12:121:g_d0_f12:¶
42:1315:80717:49:21:97:534:163:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Thefirst inequality is a strict inequality version of thefirst condition for the pooling equilib-
42:1316:80814:21:22:80:533:142:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rium (equation (9)) and implies that valuation must be costly enough that not all sophisticated
42:1317:80909:22:0:80:533:120:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors choose to do valuation. The second inequality is the same as the second inequality
43:1318:81003:0:22:80:534:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:for the mixed equilibrium, and so is the reverse of a ‘scaled up’ (by11−λχ) version of thefirst
43:1319:81098:22:22:80:533:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:inequality for the pooling equilibrium. Thefinal inequality is a strict inequality version of the
43:1320:81195:22:22:80:367:642:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:first condition for the valuation equilibrium (equation (10)).
43:1321:81257:22:22:97:534:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:It is straightforward to verify three properties. First, there is only oneH∗is unique and
43:1322:81346:22:22:80:533:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:thus that there is at most one unconstrained mixed equilibrium for any parameter configuration.
43:1323:81441:22:22:80:533:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Second the union of the two regions of multiplicity described in Proposition 2 defines the region
43:1324:81538:22:22:80:533:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in which the unconstrained mixed equilibrium exists. And third, following the logic of the mixed
43:1325:81634:22:22:80:534:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equilibrium, wherever the unconstrained mixed equilibrium exists, it is less efficient than the
43:1326:81729:22:34:80:176:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pooling equilibrium.
43:1327:81749:34:33:80:475:476:209:g_d0_f2:209:g_d0_f2:C  Equilibrium with sequential search as in Zhu (2013)
43:1328:81803:33:22:80:533:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The trading structure of Zhu (2013) is designed to capture transactions in over-the-counter
43:1329:81894:22:21:80:534:421:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:markets. This structure adapts easily to our environment and delivers the same equilibrium
43:1330:81984:21:22:80:254:400:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:conditions as our main assumptions.
43:1331:82019:22:22:97:534:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In Zhu (2013), each seller has one unit of an indivisible asset she wishes to sell and approaches
43:1332:82116:22:22:80:534:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:randomly chosen buyers sequentially. When a seller approaches a buyer, the buyer quotes a
43:1333:82205:22:22:80:534:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:price.  The seller can accept the price, in which case the asset is sold at that price to that
43:1334:82299:22:22:80:534:312:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:buyer.  The seller can proceed to the next buyer and get another quote.  Or the seller can
43:1335:82389:22:22:80:534:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:return to a previous buyer for another quote. Buyers do not observe negotiations elsewhere in
43:1336:82482:22:22:80:533:268:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the market. Thus buyers face “contact-order uncertainty — uncertainty regarding the order in
43:1337:82574:22:22:80:534:246:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which the competing buyers are visited by the seller.” Zhu (2013) analyzes a situation in which
43:1338:82669:22:22:80:534:224:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:buyers have noisy signals of fundamental value and shows among other things that contact-order
43:1339:82763:22:22:80:534:202:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:uncertainty leads to lower quotes due to adverse selection: any seller that a buyer observes may
43:1340:82859:22:22:80:534:180:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:have been to previous buyers and been offered only low prices implying that their noisy signals
43:1341:82954:22:21:80:533:158:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of value were low. Thus a buyer — unsure whether it is seeing a seller who has been looked at
43:1342:83047:21:22:80:534:137:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:by other buyersfirst or a seller who has not been — offers a price well below that implied by its
43:1343:83144:22:0:80:358:115:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:own noisy signal of asset value to avoid the winners curse.
44:1344:83205:0:22:97:533:686:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:This OTC structure delivers the same equilibrium conditions as ourmodel. Sophisticated
44:1345:83291:22:22:80:534:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:investors value assets and quote the market price to good projects and reject bad projects.
44:1346:83382:22:22:80:534:642:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Unsophisticated investors approached by sellersare unsure whether the asset has been previously
44:1347:83477:22:22:80:533:620:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:valued and found to be low value or whether it has not. As a result, they quote prices equal
44:1348:83569:22:22:80:534:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to the expected present value derived in the paper. The maximum of this and the reservation
44:1349:83660:22:0:80:487:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:value of one determines the observed market price, as in the main body of the paper.
