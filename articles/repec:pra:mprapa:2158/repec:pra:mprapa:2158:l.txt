2:25:434:16:17:90:93:485:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B: 
2:26:434:17:17:90:522:468:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Standard textbook economic theory quite generally assumes the neo-
2:27:500:17:17:90:526:451:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:classical economic model, which is a static model of unregulated free 
2:28:570:17:17:90:526:434:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:markets. Every western government in our era believes implicitly in a 
2:29:640:17:17:90:527:417:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:free market with “springs,” where imbalances are only of short term 
2:30:708:17:17:90:529:400:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:nature.  The  model  postulates  the  nonempirical  idea  of  utility  and  
2:31:784:17:17:90:531:383:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:assumes   stable   equilibrium,   a   notion   that   goes   back   over   two   
2:32:865:17:17:90:458:366:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:hundred years to Adam Smith’s famous “Invisible Hand”.  
2:33:921:17:17:90:93:349:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B: 
2:34:921:17:17:90:535:332:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:The    standard,    reigning    theory    of    free    markets    asserts    that    
2:35:1007:17:17:90:530:315:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:individually  selfish  behavior  can  lead  collectively  to  the  greatest  
2:36:1084:17:17:90:529:298:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:benefit  of  society.  Modern  dynamic  approaches,  in  stark  contrast,  
2:37:1159:17:17:89:525:281:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:understand markets as far from equilibrium systems (McCauley,2004; 
2:38:1226:17:17:89:527:264:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Dosi,  2001).  How  did  such  fundamentally  opposing  viewpoints  in  
2:39:1298:17:17:89:525:247:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:teaching arise? We first define the basic elements of market dynamics 
2:40:1368:17:16:89:526:230:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:independently  of  any  particular  model  and  then,  after  surveying  the  
2:41:1446:16:17:89:527:214:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:neo-classical  model  (Varian,  1992,1999)    critically,  we  discuss  in  the  
2:42:1527:17:17:89:525:197:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:other three sections of this article the empirical basis and implications 
2:43:1601:17:17:89:251:180:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:of market disequilibrium. 
2:44:1627:17:17:89:92:163:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B: 
2:45:1627:17:17:89:526:146:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:To  model  a  market  consider  N  agents  who  buy  and  sell  n  assets.  By  
2:46:1707:17:17:89:528:129:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:agents,  we  mean  consumers,  producers,  traders,  etc.  At  any  given  
2:47:1782:17:17:89:529:112:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:time  t  each  agent  holds  quantities  x(t)=(x1,...,xn)  of  the  n  different  
2:48:1864:17:17:89:526:95:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:assets. The price of the assets is denoted by p(t)=(p1,...,pn).  The  basis  
2:49:1941:17:0:90:527:78:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:for  modelling  the  dynamics  of  a  market  of  n  assets  and  N  traders  is  
3:50:2023:0:18:90:525:705:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:the differential equation (or a discrete iterated equation) dp/dt=ε(p,t) 
3:51:2096:18:16:90:527:687:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:where ε(p,t)=D(p,t)-S(p,t)  is  the  excess  demand  calculated  for  all  N  
3:52:2174:16:17:90:527:671:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:agents.  Here,  D  is  the  total  demand  and  S  is  the  total  supply  for  a  
3:53:2257:17:17:90:527:654:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:given  asset  “at  price  p”  (in  reality  there  is  always  a  bid/ask  spread,  
3:54:2341:17:19:90:526:637:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:so by ”p” we mean the price of the last trade). Equilibrium is defined 
3:55:2412:19:16:90:525:618:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:by vanishing excess demand, ε=0. Static models of markets assume a 
3:56:2479:16:17:90:528:602:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:dominant  stable  equilibrium  point.  That  would  require  a  restoring  
3:57:2554:17:17:90:527:585:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:force  pulling  p  back  to  equilibrium, something  like  a  spring  in  the  
3:58:2632:17:17:90:531:568:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:market.  In  other  words,  the  neo-classical  model  provides  not  a  
3:59:2705:17:17:90:527:551:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:completely static market but a trivial dynamic system as opposed to 
3:60:2773:17:17:90:244:534:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:chaotic or complex one.  
3:61:2798:17:17:90:93:517:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B: 
3:62:2798:17:17:90:530:500:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:In  the  neo-classical  approach  one  begins  by  postulating  a  utility  
3:63:2874:17:17:90:530:483:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:function  U(x)  for  each  agent. Utility  maximization  subject  to  an  
3:64:2948:17:17:90:530:466:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:agent’s  budget  constraint  predicts  a  downward  sloping  demand  
3:65:3017:17:17:90:531:449:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:curve  p=f(x)  for  the  standard  case  of  decreasing  returns.  Profit  
3:66:3092:17:17:90:526:432:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:maximization or an initial endowment  is  assumed  in  order  to  obtain  
3:67:3166:17:17:90:526:415:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:an upward sloping neoclassical supply curve p=g(x). These functions 
3:68:3234:17:17:90:528:398:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:must  then  be  inverted  to  obtain  the  demand  and  supply  schedules  
3:69:3309:17:16:90:532:381:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:x=D(p)   and   x=S(p)   required   by   dynamics.   Here,   the   dynamic   
3:70:3385:16:17:90:533:365:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:appoach   to   equilibrium   does   not   represent   trading,   but   only   
3:71:3463:17:17:90:528:348:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:represents  a  “price-adjustment  auction”,  as  was  proposed  by  Leon  
3:72:3537:17:17:90:141:331:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Walras. 
3:73:3545:17:17:90:93:314:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B: 
3:74:3545:17:17:90:525:297:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:The statics of the neo-classical model lies in the assumption that there 
3:75:3618:17:17:90:527:280:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:is  no  trading  at  all  unless  and  until  all  prices  reach  equilibrium,  at  
3:76:3702:17:17:90:527:263:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:which  point  all  sellers  and  buyers  simply  exchange  goods.  In  other  
3:77:3780:17:17:90:529:246:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:words,  the  neo-classical  theory  provides  only  a  model  of  a  pure  
3:78:3855:17:17:90:528:229:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:barter  economy  where  the  economic  efficiency  e=min(S/D,  D/S)  is  
3:79:3928:17:17:90:528:212:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:fixed  artificially  at  100%.  The  meaning  of  the  model  is  that  every  
3:80:4007:17:17:90:529:195:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:agent  who  wants  to  trade  does  so.  There  is  no  excess  demand  or  
3:81:4083:17:17:90:533:178:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:supply,   or   shortage   of   labor   or   goods   and   services,   and   no   
3:82:4164:17:17:90:526:161:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:unemployment. Kenneth Arrow (1958)  has  shown  that  the  condition  
3:83:4233:17:17:90:528:144:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:for  the  mathematical  existence  of  a  neo-classical  equilibrium  is  that  
3:84:4313:17:17:90:529:127:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:all  agents  have  the  same  perfect  information  all  the  way  into  the  
3:85:4391:17:17:90:527:110:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:infinite  future,  and  conform  to  the  same  view  of  the  future.  Money  
3:86:4470:17:16:90:525:93:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:does not and cannot appear: there is no capital accumulation, there is 
3:87:4541:16:0:90:527:77:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:no  demand  for  financial  markets:  the  price  p  in  the  model  is  only  a  
4:88:4623:0:17:90:526:707:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:label (Kirman, 1989). This means that the variable p doesn’t represent 
4:89:4694:17:17:90:526:690:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:any physical or informational quantity. It doesn’t represent a piece of 
4:90:4766:17:17:90:529:673:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:paper  or  a  piece  of  metal,  bits  in  computer  memory,  or  even  an  
4:91:4842:17:17:90:526:656:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:unspoken obligation to pay something at a later time. In other words, 
4:92:4912:17:17:90:438:639:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:it represents no aspect that is characteristic of “money”. 
4:93:4971:17:17:90:97:622:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:  
4:94:4973:17:17:90:527:605:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:The  first  econophysicist,  M.F.M.  Osborne  (1977),  tried  hard  to  make  
4:95:5051:17:17:90:529:588:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:sense  of  textbook  economic  theory,  and  consequently  pointed  out  
4:96:5124:17:17:90:525:571:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:that the neo-classical supply-demand curves do not occur empirically 
4:97:5192:17:17:89:527:554:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:in  microeconomic  reality.  He  explained  that  price  as  a  function  of  
4:98:5270:17:17:89:525:537:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:demand  p=f(x)  does  not  exist  mathematically  because  the  observable 
4:99:5344:17:17:89:529:520:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:quantity,  demand  as  a  function  of  price  x=D(p),  is  noninvertible  
4:100:5419:17:17:89:528:503:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:because  it’s  a  step  function.  There’s  a  connection  with  nontrivial  
4:101:5496:17:17:89:527:486:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:dynamics.  Unknown  to  Osborne,  Hamiltonian  models  were  used  in  
4:102:5567:17:17:89:527:469:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:economics  in  applications  to  markets  of  the  theory  of  optimization  
4:103:5644:17:16:89:528:452:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:and  control.  In  a  nonintegrable  Hamiltonian  system  the  analog  of  
4:104:5719:16:17:89:527:436:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Osborne’s  microeconomic  result  is  that  the  canonical  momentum  p  
4:105:5792:17:17:89:527:419:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:=f(q)  does  not  exist  as  a  function  of  generalized  coordinate  q.  This  
4:106:5873:17:17:89:526:402:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:was  first  noted  by  Einstein  in  1917  in  the  context  of  explaining  why  
4:107:5955:17:17:89:527:385:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:the  three  body  problem  and  mixing  systems  are  not  susceptible  to  
4:108:6031:17:17:89:525:368:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules (McCauley, 1997). That explains

5:145:8460:17:17:89:529:385:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:approach  as  well.  The  neo-classical  notion  of  expected  utility  was  
5:146:8537:17:17:89:527:368:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:invented  by  D.  Bernoulli  in  an  attempt  to  resolve  the  St.  Petersburg  
5:147:8618:17:17:89:526:351:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Paradox.  Expected  utility  was  later  used  by  John  von  Neumann  and  
5:148:8694:17:17:89:528:334:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Oscar  Morgenstern  to  formulate  the  theory  of  cooperative  games.  
5:149:8767:17:17:89:526:317:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Much later still came a class of neo-classical equilibrium models with

5:151:8919:17:17:89:525:283:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:assumes that sellers know more than buyers. From this standpoint an 
5:152:8987:17:17:89:527:266:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:equilibrium  based  on  expected  utility  maximization  is  predicted  in  
5:153:9063:17:17:89:526:249:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:the “Lemon Trap Model” invented by George Ackerlof (1984), which 
5:154:9128:17:17:89:530:232:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:was  used  later  by  Paul  Krugman  (2000)  to  discuss  the  idea  of  
5:155:9201:17:17:89:525:215:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Keynesian liquidity traps. But there is no dynamics in the asymmetric 
5:156:9271:17:17:89:527:198:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:information  model,  and  there  is  also  no  empirical  evidence  for  the  
5:157:9349:17:17:89:532:181:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:equilibrium   predicted   by   the   model.   The   model   does   take   a   
5:158:9427:17:16:89:528:164:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:qualitative  step  in  the  right  direction  by  avoiding  the  completely  
5:159:9504:16:17:89:527:148:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:unrealistic  assumption  of  perfect  information  and  infinite  foresight

6:163:9681:0:17:90:526:707:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Von Neumann and Morgenstern’s original game theoretic results are 
6:164:9747:17:17:90:530:690:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:effectively  confined  to  two  players.  Three  or  more  players  were  
6:165:9821:17:17:90:525:673:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:treated only in a mean field approximation, which is unrealistic. John 
6:166:9892:17:17:90:526:656:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Nash  later  discovered  a  class  of  neo-classical  equilibria  not  included  
6:167:9973:17:17:90:527:639:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:by  von  Neumann  and  Morgenstern  in  game  theory,  whereby  agents  
6:168:10045:17:17:90:528:622:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:exhibit  selfish  behavior  and  are  supposed  to  have  no  regrets  after  
6:169:10123:17:17:90:527:605:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:playing  the  game.  Nash’s  aim  was  to  model  Adam  Smith’s  Invisible  
6:170:10199:17:17:90:527:588:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Hand.  However,  there  is  no  empirical  evidence  for  Nash  equilibria.  
6:171:10276:17:17:90:527:571:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Nash  equilibria  require  “defection”  rather  than  “cooperation”  in  the  
6:172:10354:17:17:90:526:554:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:prisoner’s dilemma, e.g., and in other noncooperative games. In order 
6:173:10424:17:17:90:527:537:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:to  make  an  empirical  test,  good  statistics  are  required,  but  when  the

6:175:10585:17:17:90:528:503:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:prisoner’s  dilemma,  then  the  agents  tend  to  cooperate  rather  than  
6:176:10661:17:17:90:530:486:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:defect.  This  was  first  shown  by  the  famous  Dresser  experiment.  Von    
6:177:10741:17:17:90:530:469:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:Neumann  later  abandoned  game  theory  as  a  tool  for  social  and

6:198:11962:16:17:90:526:118:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:produced by Herbert Scarf (). He constructed a model utility whereby

7:204:12411:17:17:90:528:656:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:that  excess  demand  functions  that  disobey  Arrow’s  restrictions  will

10:321:19798:17:17:90:527:639:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:stationarity.    Adam  Smith’s  Invisible  Hand  is  apparently  completely

10:326:20044:17:17:90:531:554:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:due   to   the   limitations   of   finite   precision   in   measurement.   The   
10:327:20127:17:17:90:527:537:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:nonuniqueness  occurs  in  the  following  way.  E.g.,  there  are  infinitely  
10:328:20207:17:17:90:530:520:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:many  different  Markov  models  that  generate  the  observed  time

10:330:20355:17:17:90:528:486:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:been  shown  that those  models  cannot  be  distinguished  from  each

10:332:20500:17:16:89:527:452:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:hundred  years. The  greater  problem  is  how  to  model  nonfinancial

10:337:20792:17:17:90:526:368:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:anticipated from recent experience in nonlinear dynamics, where if a 
10:338:20861:17:17:90:527:351:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:chaotic system has a generating partition then the partition (and not 
10:339:20931:17:17:90:528:334:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:statistics)  characterizes  the  dynamical  model  (Gunaratne,  1990).  To

10:341:21074:17:17:90:530:300:194:g_d0_f7:194:g_d0_f7:B:series,  then  the  generating  partition  must  be  extracted  to  within
