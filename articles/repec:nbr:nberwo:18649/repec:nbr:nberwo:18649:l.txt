2:28:1387:28:14:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:This paper examines the effects of policies that increase the number of students who take the first course
2:29:1493:14:14:71:539:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in algebra in 8th grade, rather than waiting until 9th grade. Extending previous research that focused
2:30:1595:14:14:71:539:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:on the Charlotte-Mecklenberg school system, we use data for the 10 largest districts in North Carolina.
2:31:1698:14:14:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We identify the effects of accelerating the timetable for taking algebra by using data on multiple cohorts
2:32:1804:14:14:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:grouped by decile of prior achievement and exploiting the fact that policy-induced shifts in the timing
2:33:1907:14:14:71:539:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:of algebra occur at different times in different districts to different deciles of students. The expanded
2:34:2012:14:14:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:data make it possible to examine heterogeneity across students in the effect of taking algebra early.
2:35:2113:14:14:71:538:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We find negative effects among students in the bottom 60% of the prior achievement distribution.
2:36:2209:14:42:71:364:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:In addition, we find other sources of heterogeneity in effects.

3:63:2754:28:27:71:519:579:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: During the past few decades, many states and school districts have been aggressively 
3:64:2839:27:28:71:533:552:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:pushing more 8th graders to take algebra, a course that historically has been offered primarily to 
3:65:2938:28:28:72:530:524:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:high school students in the United States.  Although it has always been common for some high-
3:66:3031:28:27:72:532:496:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:ability math students to take algebra by 8th grade, between 1996 and 2008, the percentage of 13 
3:67:3127:27:28:72:516:469:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:year olds taking algebra increased from 16% to 30% (Rampey et al. 2009) and by far higher 
3:68:3217:28:27:72:514:441:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:percentages in some areas.  The reasons for this push for algebra by 8th grade include a new 
3:69:3310:27:28:71:540:414:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:focus on STEM courses and the recognition that algebra serves as a gateway course to the higher 
3:70:3406:28:28:72:523:386:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:level math courses needed for college and other careers.  It has also become an issue of social 
3:71:3502:28:27:72:525:358:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:justice, based on concerns that some groups are being unfairly denied access to early algebra.  
3:72:3598:27:28:72:510:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The policy remains controversial: critics argue that evidence for a causal impact of algebra 
3:73:3691:28:27:72:497:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:timing on later outcomes is slight, and that some students struggle if placed in advanced 
3:74:3781:27:28:72:328:276:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:coursework before they are ready (Loveless, 2008).   
3:75:3834:28:28:72:524:248:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: In a prior paper based on data mainly from a single North Carolina district (Clotfelter, 
3:76:3923:28:27:72:532:220:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Ladd, and Vigdor 2012, hereafter CLV 2012), we documented that some of the concerns raised 
3:77:4014:27:28:72:526:193:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:by critics appear to be valid. In particular we found that in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district, 
3:78:4112:28:27:72:521:165:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:which had pursued a well-documented policy to place more students into early algebra in the 
3:79:4204:27:18:72:512:138:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2003 and 2004 school years and then subsequently retracted that policy, students who were

4:85:4630:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:pushed to take algebra by 8th grade performed less well in subsequent math courses, especially 
4:86:4725:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:geometry, as they progressed through high school.  Our prior work is limited, however, because 
4:87:4820:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:our estimated effects are local to those students actually affected by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg 
4:88:4917:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy shift.  In the current paper, we circumvent that limitation by extending the analysis to 10 
4:89:5016:28:28:72:221:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:large North Carolina districts.  
4:90:5049:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: This expansion allows us to enrich the analysis and explore a wider range of effects. In 
4:91:5138:27:28:72:529:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:particular we are able to estimate effects for high-performing students – who were not affected 
4:92:5234:28:27:72:507:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg policy shift – and to examine heterogeneous impacts by the 
4:93:5322:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:student’s race, and by the income and education status of the student’s parents.  Following the 
4:94:5418:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:same methodology as in the earlier paper, we identify the effects of accelerating algebra by using 
4:95:5517:28:27:72:494:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:data on multiple cohorts of students disaggregated by their prior math achievement and 
4:96:5604:27:28:72:499:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:exploiting the fact that shifts in algebra timing typically apply only to students in certain 
4:97:5698:28:27:72:537:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:segments of the math achievement distribution, and occur in different years in different districts. 
4:98:5798:27:28:72:522:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:With the use of instrumental variables based on the inferred policy changes by district we are 
4:99:5893:28:27:71:515:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:able to isolate the causal effects of the policy interventions on a number of subsequent math 
4:100:5987:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes.  As in our previous paper, we find that the overall effect of taking algebra by 8th grade 
4:101:6087:28:28:72:534:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:is to increase the probability  that students will pass Algebra I by 10th grade, but to depress their 
4:102:6189:28:27:72:526:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performance on the Algebra I test and decrease the likelihood they will pass Geometry by 11th 
4:103:6282:27:28:71:377:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade. In addition, we find significant heterogeneity in effects.  
4:104:6349:28:27:71:541:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: In the next two sections of the paper, we provide the policy context and outline the model 
4:105:6440:27:28:71:539:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:we employ to infer the effects of taking algebra in middle school on several important outcomes. 
4:106:6537:28:28:71:540:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Section III describes our data and the steps we take to trim the sample in an effort to increase our 
4:107:6638:28:0:71:542:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:confidence that our estimates are useful and not subject to omitted variable bias. In section IV we 
5:108:6741:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:present instrumental variables estimates of the causal effect of teaching algebra to middle school 
5:109:6840:27:28:72:507:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students, and in sections V and VI we consider effects on taking calculus and pre-calculus 
5:110:6931:28:27:72:462:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:courses and on repeating Algebra I. Section VII concludes the paper.

5:112:7042:28:28:72:513:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: One of the seemingly most uncomplicated school reforms to take hold in the United 
5:113:7124:28:27:72:529:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:States in the last two decades has been the push to have more 8th graders take algebra, a course 
5:114:7221:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:traditionally taught in high school. Noting the success that other countries have had in teaching 
5:115:7319:28:27:72:541:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the course to students at this age, a chorus of scholars and blue ribbon panels have urged the U.S. 
5:116:7419:27:28:72:535:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to follow suit.2 For some proponents, expanding access to algebra in middle school can help the 
5:117:7515:28:28:72:512:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:country to regain global leadership in STEM training. For others, it is a social justice issue: 
5:118:7611:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:scholar Alan Schoenfeld (1995) called algebra “a new literacy requirement for citizenship, and 
5:119:7706:27:28:72:518:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:civil rights veteran Bob Moses (1995) dubbed it “the new civil right.”3  To proponents, what 
5:120:7799:28:27:72:525:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:makes algebra so important is its “gateway” role: “The earlier a student proceeds successfully 
5:121:7894:27:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:through algebra, and then on to courses such as geometry and algebra II, the more opportunities 
5:122:7990:28:27:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:he or she has for reaching higher level mathematics courses (e.g., trigonometry, precalculus, and 
5:123:8088:27:28:72:512:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:calculus) in high school....” (Walston and McCarroll 2011). This call for algebra in middle 
5:124:8180:28:28:72:418:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:school has been taken up with enthusiasm in many parts of the country. 
5:125:8251:28:27:72:502:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: This push to teach algebra to 8th graders has not been without its critics, however. 
5:126:8336:27:23:72:541:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Naysayers point out the logical problems in drawing causal inferences from observed differences 
5:127:8432:23:7:72:218:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
5:128:8497:7:16:72:519:182:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:2 See, for example, Schoenfeld (1995), Schmidt (2004), and National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008). The 
5:129:8604:16:12:72:527:166:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:panel urged that math courses in elementary and middle school be adjusted to prepare more students to be able to 
5:130:8717:12:11:72:175:154:100:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:take algebra by 8th grade. 
5:131:8743:11:7:72:75:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F: 
5:132:8743:7:16:72:527:136:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:3 Schoenfeld (p. 11, 1995) elaborates: “Algebra today plays the role that reading and writing did in the industrial 
5:133:8859:16:12:71:541:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:age. If one does not have algebra, one cannot understand much of science, statistics, business, or today’s technology. 
5:134:8978:12:11:71:538:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:Thus, algebra has become an academic passport for passage into virtually every avenue of the job market and every 
5:135:9092:11:12:71:525:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:street of schooling. With too few exceptions, students who do not study algebra are therefore relegated to menial 
5:136:9206:12:11:71:528:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:jobs and are unable often even to undertake training programs for jobs in which they might be interested. They are 
5:137:9321:11:0:71:378:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:sorted out of the opportunities to become productive citizens in our society.” 
6:138:9402:0:27:72:526:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:among students who take algebra at varying ages, and have worried that accelerating the math 
6:139:9495:27:28:72:508:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:timetable in this way would create more problems than opportunities for many students ill-
6:140:9585:28:27:72:516:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:equipped to deal with the abstractions of algebra in middle school. Loveless (2008) presents 
6:141:9678:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:NAEP data to show that thousands of 8th graders taking algebra or geometry do not know basic 
6:142:9771:28:28:72:538:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:arithmetic, leaving them unable to profit from these courses and taking up the time and attention 
6:143:9869:28:27:72:501:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of teachers who might otherwise be helping students with stronger math backgrounds. In 
6:144:9956:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor (2012), we examine the effect of one district’s short-lived policy of 
6:145:10054:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:teaching Algebra I to large numbers of its 8th graders. Our findings suggest that at least some of 
6:146:10153:27:28:71:533:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the critics’ concerns are well-founded. We found that, on average, students who were subjected 
6:147:10248:28:28:71:530:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to the push to take algebra earlier in the Charlotte-Mecklenberg school district scored lower on 
6:148:10345:28:27:71:493:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the statewide end-of-course algebra test and were less likely than other similar students 
6:149:10435:27:28:71:405:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:subsequently to pass the follow-on course in geometry by 11th grade. 
6:150:10504:28:27:72:533:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Because it relied on policy changes and data primarily from just one school district, that 
6:151:10595:27:28:72:520:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:study (CLV 2012) left several pressing questions unanswered. Crucially, our research design 
6:152:10687:28:27:72:528:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:limited us to assessing the impact of algebra acceleration for the set of students affected by the 
6:153:10786:27:28:72:535:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy initiative, namely those in the middle of the prior math test score distribution.  That ruled 
6:154:10887:28:28:72:523:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:out, for example, analyzing the effect of the policy change in Charlotte-Mecklenburg on high-
6:155:10980:28:27:72:510:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:achieving students (as defined by being near the top of the 6th grade test score distribution) 
6:156:11075:27:28:72:515:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:because virtually all such students took algebra by 8th grade both before and after the policy 
6:157:11170:28:27:72:521:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:change.   Moreover, the absence of meaningful variation for high-performers implied that we 
6:158:11262:27:28:72:512:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:also had little chance of observing a hypothetical positive impact of early algebra taking on 
6:159:11356:28:28:72:398:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:progression to calculus or other advanced courses in high school.     
6:160:11426:28:0:108:540:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:In the current paper, we combine data for the 10 largest school districts in North Carolina 
7:161:11521:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:over a period of six academic years to infer the effects on students of taking algebra by 8th grade, 
7:162:11622:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:rather than later or never at all.  For all of the districts, we observe significant changes over time 
7:163:11725:28:27:72:535:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the probability that students in at least some deciles of prior math achievement – independent 
7:164:11823:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of measurable characteristics of those students – will take the state’s standard Algebra I course. 
7:165:11922:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We use these temporal variations in probability as an instrument in equations predicting the score 
7:166:12021:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:on the state’s end-of-course test in Algebra I and success in passing Algebra I, Geometry, and 
7:167:12116:27:28:72:535:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra II. As in our previous paper, we find that the broad effect of taking algebra by 8th grade 
7:168:12215:28:27:71:512:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:is to increase the chance that students will pass Algebra I by 10th grade, but to depress their 
7:169:12311:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performance on the Algebra I test and decrease the likelihood they will pass Geometry by 11th 
7:170:12404:28:28:71:514:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade. In addition, we find significant heterogeneity in effects. Supporting the suspicions of 
7:171:12499:28:27:71:526:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Loveless and other skeptics, we find that the effect of early algebra-taking differs by students’ 
7:172:12597:27:28:71:534:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:previous math achievement, with the deleterious effects being the most pronounced for students 
7:173:12692:28:27:71:521:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:with the weakest previous achievement. We also find differences in policy impact by gender, 
7:174:12784:27:28:71:501:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:free lunch eligibility, and parents’ education, some of which differences are unexpected.  
7:175:12875:28:27:71:413:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:II. Model  
7:176:12886:27:28:72:522:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Our objective is to assess the effects of variations in school policies and practices that 
7:177:12977:28:28:72:538:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:manifest themselves in differing rates with which otherwise similar students are assigned to take 
7:178:13075:28:27:72:526:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra I in middle school. That is, we examine the effect on students of changing the timing, 
7:179:13170:27:28:72:520:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:not the content, of the first course in algebra. So far as we know, the content of the Algebra I 
7:180:13267:28:27:72:406:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:course in North Carolina did not change during our period of study.4  
7:181:13337:27:25:72:511:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: We examine three kinds of possible effects on students. The first is on the student’s 
7:182:13423:25:8:72:218:132:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
7:183:13488:8:16:72:541:124:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:4 In 2007, the state changed the scoring and passing standard of the standardized end-of-course test in Algebra I.  the 
7:184:13608:16:11:72:541:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:proportion of students failing the EOC test increased substantially relative to previous years.  To our knowledge, this 
7:185:13728:11:12:72:531:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:change in test scoring did not coincide with a change in curriculum for the course.  In our specifications below we 
7:186:13844:12:11:72:538:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:account for the change in scoring scale and passing standard by defining “passing” the test as scoring above the 20th 
7:187:13961:11:0:71:291:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:percentile, which approximates the pre-2007 standard. 
8:188:14018:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:knowledge of algebra, as indicated by performance on the state’s mandatory test administered to 
8:189:14114:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:all Algebra I students at the completion of the course. By design, this test is intended to assess 
8:190:14213:28:27:72:540:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:understanding of the course material, and we can be confident that students and teachers took the 
8:191:14311:27:28:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:test seriously, since at least a quarter of the course grade must be based on its outcome.  The 
8:192:14407:28:28:72:536:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:second possible effect of taking algebra early is on how well the student succeeds in passing not 
8:193:14505:28:27:72:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:only Algebra I itself, but also the two other basic courses in the state’s mathematics sequence: 
8:194:14602:27:28:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Geometry and Algebra II. The third kind of outcome we examine is whether students took 
8:195:14689:28:27:72:531:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:courses beyond Algebra II, including calculus.  For reasons explained below, our identification 
8:196:14785:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:strategy is not particularly well suited to estimating the impact of algebra timing on calculus-
8:197:14881:28:28:72:512:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taking; instead we offer estimates in the spirit of a “bounds” analysis (Manski, 1990).  This 
8:198:14975:28:27:72:515:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:outcome is important because one of the arguments for moving algebra to 8th grade is that it 
8:199:15068:27:28:72:534:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:opens up for students the opportunity to take more advanced coursework in mathematics during 
8:200:15161:28:27:72:541:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:high school. In CLV (2012), we were unable to examine this last outcome because any effects on 
8:201:15256:27:28:72:505:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:enrollment in math courses beyond Algebra II are most likely concentrated among higher-
8:202:15343:28:27:72:510:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performing students, for whom we observed very little policy variation in our initial single-
8:203:15436:27:28:72:140:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:district study. 
8:204:15452:28:28:72:537:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: In devising our estimation strategy, we have endeavored to produce estimates that reflect 
8:205:15542:28:27:72:539:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:causation, not simply correlation. Logic and experience suggest that, in deciding whether a 7th or 
8:206:15641:27:28:71:519:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:8th grader should be assigned to take algebra rather than another pre-algebra course, a school 
8:207:15736:28:27:72:538:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:may well take numerous student-level factors into consideration, not all of which are reflected in 
8:208:15835:27:28:72:511:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:measures contained in administrative data sets such as the one we use. Thus any attempt to 
8:209:15926:28:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assess the effect of early assignment to algebra based on observational, within-cohort-and-district 
8:210:16026:28:0:71:424:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variation will inevitably be subject to omitted variable, or selection, bias. 
9:211:16107:0:27:72:521:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: To combat that statistical challenge, our estimating models use instrumental variables 
9:212:16194:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:estimation, along the same lines as the model we employed in CLV (2012). The larger number of 
9:213:16288:28:27:72:505:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:districts used in this study means that a wider range of students were subjected to shifts in 
9:214:16382:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra placement policy over time.  As in the initial study, we use this policy-induced variation 
9:215:16481:28:28:72:512:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to assess the impact of algebra timing on student outcomes.  This task is complicated in the 
9:216:16574:28:27:72:506:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:present study by the absence of clear documentation of any official shift in policy in some 
9:217:16666:27:28:71:510:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:districts.  We infer that a policy shift has occurred in those circumstances where the across-
9:218:16760:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:cohort variation in Algebra I placement patterns is too large to be based on random fluctuations 
9:219:16857:27:28:71:284:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in student background characteristics alone. 
9:220:16902:28:28:108:511:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:We begin with data on students from six successive cohorts in the 10 largest school 
9:221:16986:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:districts in North Carolina.  We stratify the sample by student prior achievement, as measured by 
9:222:17084:27:28:72:522:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the student’s average scores on 6th and 7th grade standardized math tests.  We then reduce the 
9:223:17179:28:27:71:536:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:sample, using a procedure outlined below, to those district, cohort, and prior achievement decile 
9:224:17277:27:28:71:433:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:cells that exhibit significant variation in placement patterns across cohorts. 
9:225:17355:28:27:107:540:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:Our model takes the form of conventional instrumental variables estimation. We estimate 
9:226:17443:27:30:71:300:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:several different two-stage models of the form: 
9:227:17491:30:33:107:271:265:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:(1) Tidcs=c + d + s + dcs + idcs 
9:228:17527:33:34:108:320:232:144:g_d0_f6:195:g_d0_f6:A:(2) Yidcs =  c + d + s + β dcs + idcs 
9:229:17567:34:31:72:511:198:144:g_d0_f6:144:Times:B:where Yidcs is the outcome of interest for student i in prior achievement decile d in cohort c 
9:230:17662:31:30:72:520:167:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:enrolled in school district s, d, c, and s are decile, cohort, and school district fixed effects, 
9:231:17763:30:37:72:517:137:195:Times:100:g_d0_f3:C:Tidcs is a treatment indicator, where the treatment is taking Algebra I no later than 8th grade,  
9:232:17861:37:0:87:537:100:64:Times:81:Times:F:dcs, the instrument, is the decile-cohort-school district cell average of the treatment, and dcs 
10:233:17961:0:29:72:505:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:is the predicted value obtained from equation (1)  – and idcs and idcs are independent and 
10:234:18054:29:28:72:513:679:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:identically distributed error terms.  Cohort fixed effects account for policy changes or other 
10:235:18149:28:27:71:535:651:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:contemporaneous effects that had an influence on all students in a cohort across the state, decile 
10:236:18248:27:28:72:519:624:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:fixed effects account for broad differences in outcome trajectories for students with differing 
10:237:18344:28:27:72:510:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:prior achievement, and school district fixed effects account for systematic policy and other 
10:238:18437:27:28:72:512:569:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:differences across districts. By using decile fixed effects rather than a linear control for test 
10:239:18535:28:28:72:542:541:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:score, we are able to account for potentially nonlinear effects of prior achievement on subsequent 
10:240:18634:28:27:72:124:513:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes. 
10:241:18644:27:28:108:535:486:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:In effect, this estimation strategy associates across-cohort/decile/school district variation 
10:242:18738:28:27:72:540:458:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the propensity to take Algebra I by 8th grade with across-cohort/decile/school district variation 
10:243:18839:27:28:71:536:431:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the outcome of interest.  We attribute a positive (or negative) effect to acceleration if students 
10:244:18941:28:28:71:536:403:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:subjected to a higher risk of earlier algebra than others in the same prior achievement decile and

10:246:19128:27:28:71:539:348:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performance in Algebra I, passing that and the two following math courses, taking a math course 
10:247:19224:28:27:71:503:320:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:beyond Algebra II.  We also examine the probability of  repeating Algebra I. Because the 
10:248:19313:27:28:71:514:293:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:identifying variation in algebra timing is at the cohort-by-decile-by-school district level, we 
10:249:19409:28:27:71:243:265:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:cluster standard errors at that level. 
10:250:19448:27:28:107:503:238:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:Equations (1) and (2) highlight a potentially serious criticism of our identification 
10:251:19534:28:28:71:490:210:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:strategy.  By instrumenting for a student’s own placement experience with the average 
10:252:19620:28:27:71:517:182:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:experience of students in her cohort/decile/district cell, we risk replacing an individual-level 
10:253:19717:27:28:71:535:155:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variable that is subject to concerns about unobservable factors with a cell-level average variable 
10:254:19816:28:27:71:523:127:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:that is subject to a different set of concerns about unobserved factors.   For the approach to be 
10:255:19914:27:0:71:542:100:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:successful, we must have some confidence that differences in the cell averages reflect differences 
11:256:20017:0:27:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in placement policy rather than differences in unobserved student characteristics.  In order to 
11:257:20113:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:describe our strategy for attaining this degree of confidence, we must first describe our data in 
11:258:20211:28:32:72:141:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:greater detail. 
11:259:20227:32:18:72:115:621:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:III. Data 
11:260:20236:18:13:72:75:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
11:261:20236:13:28:108:522:590:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:We use student-level data for the 10 largest North Carolina school districts. Shown in 
11:262:20323:28:28:71:506:562:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Figure 1, these districts are: Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Wake (containing Raleigh), Guilford 
11:263:20413:28:27:71:534:534:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(Greensboro), Cumberland (Fayetteville), Winston-Salem/Forsyth, Gaston (Gastonia), Durham, 
11:264:20504:27:28:72:503:507:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Union (Monroe), Johnston (Smithfield), and Cabarrus (Concord). Of these districts, three 
11:265:20593:28:27:72:509:479:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(Gaston, Union, and Cabarrus) contain suburban overflow from Mecklenburg County, and 
11:266:20678:27:28:72:531:452:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Johnston similarly contains some bedroom suburbs adjacent to Wake County. In order to study 
11:267:20770:28:28:72:508:424:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students who experienced different policy regimes regarding the aggressiveness in placing 
11:268:20860:28:27:72:518:396:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students in Algebra I by 8th grade, we use information for six successive cohorts of students, 
11:269:20955:27:28:72:529:369:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:beginning with those who were 7th graders for the first time in the fall of 1999 and ending with 
11:270:21052:28:27:71:522:341:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:those who arrived in 7th grade in the fall of 2004. Students in these cohorts who made normal 
11:271:21146:27:28:72:518:314:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:progress in school would have graduated from high school in the years 2005 to 2010, but we 
11:272:21237:28:27:72:433:286:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:track students whether or not they experienced normal grade progression.   
11:273:21312:27:28:108:474:259:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:Our data represent longitudinally matched records on students derived from 
11:274:21387:28:28:72:522:231:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:administrative records housed in the North Carolina Education Research Data Center.5 When 
11:275:21477:28:27:72:536:203:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:evaluating the effect of taking Algebra I by 8th grade, we focus on those students enrolled in one 
11:276:21576:27:28:72:521:176:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of our 10 districts in the year after they began 7th grade.  We restricted the sample to students 
11:277:21674:28:27:72:495:148:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:with valid scores on the state’s standardized 6th and 7th grade mathematics end-of-grade 
11:278:21763:27:24:72:529:121:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assessments. For each student, we averaged those two scores, to reduce possible concerns with 
11:279:21857:24:7:72:218:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
11:280:21922:7:16:72:542:90:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:5 The Data Center supplies unique identifying numbers that allow researchers to link student records in different data 
11:281:22041:16:0:72:272:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:sets while protecting the identities of individuals. 
12:282:22098:0:27:72:513:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:measurement error in test scores, and used that average to assign them to deciles in order to 
12:283:22192:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:stratify them by prior math performance.6 Students were assigned to districts based on their 8th 
12:284:22288:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade enrollment. We then tracked their progress through college-preparatory math courses using 
12:285:22384:27:28:72:546:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:information from the state’s end-of-course examinations in Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II.   
12:286:22482:28:28:107:533:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:We employ several outcome measures based on students’ math achievement and course-
12:287:22564:28:27:71:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taking. Ideally, we would have estimated the impact of taking Algebra I by 8th grade on actual 
12:288:22659:27:28:72:530:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:knowledge gained, as measured by performance on the test designed for that course and on the 
12:289:22752:28:27:72:529:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:tests for subsequent math courses. The approach is frustrated, however, because some students 
12:290:22846:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:never take Algebra I, and many more never take the follow-up courses. These facts create two 
12:291:22939:28:28:72:509:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:sources of sample selection bias. The more serious one is that so many students never take 
12:292:23030:28:27:72:535:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Geometry or Algebra II. If we were to use as outcome measures the scores on the tests for those 
12:293:23126:27:28:72:532:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:two courses, we would have to restrict ourselves to those select students brave or accomplished 
12:294:23222:28:27:72:538:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:enough to take the courses at all. To avoid the obvious selection bias that would invite, we adopt 
12:295:23321:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:as our outcome measure simply whether or not students passed those courses, an outcome we can 
12:296:23415:28:27:72:527:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:measure for all students given that those who do not take a course by definition cannot pass it. 
12:297:23512:27:28:72:536:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The second source of selection bias arises in analyzing the end-of-course test score in Algebra I. 
12:298:23611:28:28:72:529:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Because we can observe performance only for those students who actually take the course, our 
12:299:23704:28:27:72:525:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:analysis may lead us to overstate the negative effects of the acceleration policy. That outcome 
12:300:23800:27:28:72:519:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:will occur to the extent that a policy of accelerating students into 8th grade algebra correlates 
12:301:23898:28:27:72:520:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:with efforts to expand the set of students ever taking algebra, causing marginally-performing 
12:302:23992:27:28:72:533:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students to be swept into the sample only during years of acceleration. To deal with this second 
12:303:24089:28:20:72:524:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:selection problem, we estimate alternative models using quantile regression methods.  For the 
12:304:24183:20:8:72:218:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
12:305:24248:8:16:72:525:101:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:6 If a student took Algebra I before 8th grade, the fact was noted, and the student was included with students who 
12:306:24363:16:11:71:515:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:took Algebra I by 8th grade. If the student took it in a different district from his or her 8th grade district, he was 
12:307:24482:11:0:71:176:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:dropped from the sample. 
13:308:24511:0:27:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:quantile regressions, we impute test scores for non-algebra takers, under the presumption that 
13:309:24606:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:those students who do not take the course would have scored below the median conditional on 
13:310:24698:28:27:72:341:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:their observed characteristics (Neal and Johnson 1997). 
13:311:24754:27:28:108:534:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:In contrast to our analysis of Charlotte-Mecklenburg (CLV 2012) – where we had direct 
13:312:24840:28:28:71:542:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:evidence that that district had undertaken an explicit policy of placing more 8th graders in algebra 
13:313:24941:28:27:72:537:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:classes – we have little documentary proof for the districts studied in the current paper of formal 
13:314:25041:27:28:72:485:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy directives about offering algebra to 8th graders.  Moreover, as noted above, our 
13:315:25129:28:27:71:492:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:identification strategy will yield biased results to the extent that across-cell variation in 
13:316:25223:27:28:72:502:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:placement patterns reflects across-cell variation in unobservables rather than policy.  Our 
13:317:25315:28:28:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:strategy for distinguishing policy-induced variation from random fluctuations in placement 
13:318:25406:28:27:71:528:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:patterns attributable to student unobservables rests on the assumption that there is no reason to 
13:319:25504:27:28:71:538:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:expect systematic variation in unobservables across cohorts.  If all variation in mean unobserved 
13:320:25602:28:27:71:501:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:characteristics across cohorts is idiosyncratic, then we can use standard statistical tests to 
13:321:25697:27:28:71:534:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:determine whether the degree of observed variation is too large to be explained by idiosyncratic 
13:322:25794:28:27:71:503:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:factors alone.  In practice, we use two rounds of statistical tests.  The first is a simple Chi-
13:323:25890:27:28:71:535:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:squared test for significant variation in placement patterns across cohorts within a district/decile 
13:324:25991:28:28:72:497:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:cell. The second is an F-test for significant residual variation in placement patterns after 
13:325:26084:28:27:72:303:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:controlling for observed student characteristics. 
13:326:26134:27:28:108:540:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:To appreciate the need for the first of these exclusions, consider the bar graphs in Figures 
13:327:26227:28:27:72:535:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2 to 4. These graphs show the percentage of students (grouped by quintile rather than decile, for 
13:328:26325:27:28:72:516:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:ease of presentation) who took Algebra I by 8th grade in five selected districts. For example, 
13:329:26420:28:28:72:530:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Figure 2, which tracks middle schoolers who took Algebra I in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, clearly 
13:330:26513:28:0:72:537:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:illustrates the effects of that district’s bold algebra acceleration policy. Successive cohorts in the 
14:331:26620:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:first three quintiles experienced a marked jump, then drop, in the risk of taking Algebra I by 8th 
14:332:26718:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade. In contrast, there was almost no change over the period for students in the highest quintile 
14:333:26818:28:27:72:507:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:– almost all of whom took algebra by 8th grade. Figure 3, for Wake County, reveals a very 
14:334:26908:27:28:72:525:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:different pattern, with virtually no change over time in the treatment of students in the bottom 
14:335:27005:28:28:72:149:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:three quintiles.  
14:336:27023:28:27:108:533:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:The Chi-squared tests for the 100 decile-district subsamples test the null hypothesis that 
14:337:27114:27:28:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the probability of taking algebra for those students remained the same for all six cohorts – i.e., 
14:338:27213:28:27:72:509:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:that any observed variation is attributable to random fluctuation rather than any systematic 
14:339:27306:27:28:72:517:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:change in policy.7 For 35 of the 100 subsamples, we could not at the 5% level of confidence 
14:340:27398:28:28:72:534:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:reject the hypothesis of no difference in probability across the six cohorts, leading us to exclude 
14:341:27498:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:those cells from our sample.8  For example, none of the bottom seven deciles in Wake County 
14:342:27590:27:28:72:529:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:showed significant variation across cohorts, reflecting the near uniformity that is evident in the 
14:343:27689:28:27:72:537:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:pattern of bars for the bottom three quintiles in Figure 3. For Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the lack of 
14:344:27788:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variation in the top quintile shown in the figure turns out to reflect a lack of variation primarily in 
14:345:27892:28:27:71:526:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the top decile alone, so we excluded that decile.  In contrast, for Durham, the hypothesis of no 
14:346:27989:27:28:71:507:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variation could be rejected for all 10 deciles, a result that is not surprising, considering the 
14:347:28086:28:28:71:209:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:patterns evident in Figure 4. 
14:348:28116:28:27:107:489:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A: The second set of tests eliminates decile-district subsamples for which student 
14:349:28197:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:characteristics appear to explain a significant portion of the variation in algebra-taking across the 
14:350:28299:28:27:72:538:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:cohorts. For our entire sample of students, we estimated a linear probability model regressing an 
14:351:28397:27:28:72:518:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:indicator for 8th grade Algebra I placement on gender, year of birth, categorical variables for 
14:352:28493:28:32:72:508:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:race/ethnicity, free lunch status, and parental education, as well as fixed effects for cohort, 
14:353:28589:32:7:72:218:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
14:354:28654:7:12:72:492:90:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:7 Note that seven of the decile-district subsamples had no students who had taken Algebra I by 8th grade. 
14:355:28760:12:0:72:378:78:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:8 The p-values from the Chi-squared tests are shown in Appendix Table A1. 
15:356:28838:0:27:72:511:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:decile, district, and all their interactions. For each of the 100 decile-district subsamples, we 
15:357:28935:27:28:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performed an F-test for the hypothesis that the cohort fixed effects were equal.9 For six decile-
15:358:29032:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:district subsamples that had not previously been excluded by our first test of variation, we were 
15:359:29130:27:28:72:499:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:unable to reject this hypothesis, leaving us with 59 remaining decile-district subsamples, 
15:360:29221:28:28:72:266:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:containing a total of 124,505 students.10 
15:361:29262:28:27:108:511:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:For this trimmed sample, Table 1 shows, by district, the number of students and the 
15:362:29346:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:means and standard deviations of our measure of prior achievement, as well as four of our main 
15:363:29441:28:27:72:529:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:outcome measures. As noted above, we sorted students into deciles of prior math achievement, 
15:364:29534:27:28:72:531:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:based on the average of each student’s 6th and 7th grade standardized end-of-grade math scores. 
15:365:29630:28:28:72:491:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The remaining four variables are measures of outcomes and are all based on the state’s 
15:366:29717:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mandatory end-of-course tests . In addition to the score on the Algebra I end-of-course exam, we 
15:367:29814:27:28:72:497:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:also track whether students took and passed that course and the two follow-on courses – 
15:368:29902:28:27:72:541:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Geometry, and Algebra II.11 Owing to our exclusion of designated decile-district subsamples, the 
15:369:29999:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:two largest districts, Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Wake County, contribute fewer students to the 
15:370:30094:28:27:71:527:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:final sample than the third largest district, Guilford. The average student characteristics reflect 
15:371:30194:27:28:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the deciles that remained after trimming. The averages for Wake and Cabarrus, which had most 
15:372:30287:28:28:72:501:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:or all of their lowest seven deciles excluded, reflect the characteristics of their remaining 
15:373:30381:28:27:71:522:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relatively high-scoring students. The mean for Charlotte-Mecklenburg, in contrast, shows the 
15:374:30474:27:34:71:524:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:effects of having some of its highest deciles dropped. Within each of the districts, the average 
15:375:30571:34:8:72:218:178:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
15:376:30636:8:11:72:337:170:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:9 The p-values for these F-tests are shown in Appendix Table A2. 
15:377:30701:11:12:72:383:159:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:10 The excluded decile-district subsamples are identified Appendix Table A3. 
15:378:30778:12:16:72:532:147:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:11 Our definition of a passing grade on the Algebra I and Algebra II end-of-course tests is based on the proficiency 
15:379:30895:16:11:72:539:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:standard in place for most of the years in our sample, which was roughly equal to the 20th percentile of the statewide 
15:380:31014:11:12:71:534:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:distribution for both tests.  In 2007, the state adopted stricter grading standards on both end-of-course tests, placing 
15:381:31135:12:11:71:531:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:the passing threshold closer to the 40th percentile of the statewide distribution.  By using a uniform standard based 
15:382:31253:11:12:72:535:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:on a specific point in the distribution, we assume that there is no meaningful change in the statewide distribution of 
15:383:31372:12:11:72:541:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:Algebra I or Algebra II test scores over time.  As there is no substantial shift in standards on the Geometry EOC test, 
15:384:31492:11:0:72:238:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:no comparable adjustment is necessary.   
16:385:31537:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:rate of passage for Algebra I by 10th grade is higher than those for Geometry by 11th and Algebra 
16:386:31635:27:28:72:125:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:II by 12th.  
16:387:31648:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Before turning to estimates of the effect of taking Algebra by 8th grade, we summarize 
16:388:31735:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the correlates of our four main outcome measures. Table 2 presents estimates based on four OLS 
16:389:31830:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regressions explaining the four measures – the student’s performance on the first Algebra I end-
16:390:31926:28:27:72:524:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of-course test and the three binary indicators for taking and passing Algebra I, Geometry, and 
16:391:32021:27:28:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra II, as described above. These results should not be assigned a causal interpretation, as 
16:392:32118:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:they make use of observational variation in algebra timing, which presumably correlates with 
16:393:32211:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:unobserved determinants of math achievement.  The table reports estimated coefficients on an 
16:394:32304:28:28:72:516:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:indicator for taking Algebra I by 8th grade as well as cohort, district fixed effects, and decile 
16:395:32402:28:27:72:513:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:fixed effects. Most noteworthy are the coefficients for taking algebra by the 8th grade. They 
16:396:32496:27:28:72:521:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that, although students who take algebra in middle 
16:397:32587:28:27:72:531:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:school tend to perform poorly on the algebra end-of-course test, they are more likely than other 
16:398:32684:27:28:72:535:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students to take and pass Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. They are more than 5 percentage 
16:399:32779:28:27:72:527:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:points more likely than other students to take and pass Geometry, and the differences are even 
16:400:32874:27:28:71:246:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:greater for the two algebra courses.  
16:401:32912:28:28:71:516:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: As for other correlates of taking algebra in middle school, the regression reveals few 
16:402:32999:28:27:71:500:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:statistically significant differences by cohort. By district, Wake County, the omitted one, 
16:403:33091:27:28:71:514:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:consistently bests most of the others, reflecting in part its more affluent makeup. The decile 
16:404:33186:28:27:71:531:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:indicators have the expected pattern, with all coefficients increasing monotonically through the 
16:405:33283:27:28:71:498:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:first eight deciles. Not surprisingly, the best predictor of math achievement is prior math 
16:406:33375:28:28:71:138:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:achievement. 
16:407:33388:28:0:71:74:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
17:408:33392:0:27:72:290:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:IV. The Causal Effects of 8th Grade Algebra  
17:409:33437:27:28:72:507:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Following the approach we take in CLV (2012), we employ instrumental variables 
17:410:33516:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:methods to estimate the causal impact of taking algebra by 8th grade. As described in section II 
17:411:33613:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:above, we used fitted values from a first stage regression (1) as an instrument for the likelihood 
17:412:33712:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:that a student of cohort c, whose prior achievement puts her in decile d, and whose residence 
17:413:33806:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assigns her to school district s, will be put into an Algebra I class by 8th grade. Because we have 
17:414:33906:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:excluded all students who were in decile-district subsamples for which this likelihood of taking 
17:415:34003:28:27:72:503:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra by 8th grade either did not vary significantly over time or for which across-cohort 
17:416:34095:27:28:72:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variation could be attributed to student characteristics, we can view the remaining students as 
17:417:34191:28:28:72:519:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:facing exogenously varying probabilities of receiving this treatment, with those probabilities 
17:418:34286:28:27:72:510:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:being entirely a function of year of birth, that is, of the cohort into which the student found 
17:419:34382:27:28:72:171:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:herself in 7th grade.  
17:420:34405:28:27:72:534:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: We implemented three variants of instrumental variables estimation. First, we estimated 
17:421:34493:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:simple two-stage least squares, for both equations explaining the score on the Algebra I test and 
17:422:34591:28:27:72:532:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the linear probability models explaining course passage. Second, we used binomial probit as an 
17:423:34686:27:28:72:538:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:alternative to the 2SLS linear probability models because the latter, while producing coefficients 
17:424:34785:28:28:72:497:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:easy to interpret in terms of probabilities, do not conform to the necessary distributional 
17:425:34877:28:27:72:539:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assumptions in either the first or second stage. Third, we applied a quantile regression version of 
17:426:34977:27:28:72:533:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:I.V. using imputation methods to deal with sample selection in the students who take Algebra I.

17:428:35086:27:28:71:532:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Table 3 reports instrumental variables estimates applying to students at large, with none 
17:429:35176:28:28:71:502:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of the interactions we focus on below. The first equation employs IVQR estimation, with 
17:430:35264:28:0:71:534:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:imputed test scores for students not taking Algebra I at all. The other equations use as outcomes 
18:431:35366:0:27:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taking and passing the three math courses, with a two-stage least squares and binomial probit 
18:432:35460:27:28:71:540:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:used for each of those outcomes. Each model controls for prior achievement (based on 6th and 7th 
18:433:35556:28:27:72:508:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade end-of-grade math tests), cohort and district fixed effects, and the predicted value of 
18:434:35650:27:28:72:403:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra I enrollment by 8th grade derived from first-stage equations. 
18:435:35720:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: The estimated equations paint a largely negative picture. Students who were enrolled in 
18:436:35808:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:years when their districts were more aggressive about teaching Algebra I to 8th graders scored 
18:437:35903:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:lower on their end-of-course test (some 37% of a standard deviation lower) and were  less likely 
18:438:36000:28:27:72:516:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to take and pass Geometry by 11th grade by some 6.6 percentage points ( based on the 2SLS 
18:439:36090:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:model).  Nor were they more likely to take and pass Algebra II by 12th grade; in fact the 2SLS 
18:440:36185:28:28:72:510:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:model implies that they were a little less likely to. The only ray of sunshine in these results 
18:441:36281:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:comes from the probability of passing Algebra I itself. We take this positive finding to be a direct 
18:442:36382:27:28:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:consequence of the opportunity an early algebra class affords a student who does not pass the 
18:443:36476:28:27:72:529:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:course the first time around to retake it. These findings closely mirror those we obtained in our 
18:444:36574:27:28:72:286:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:earlier analysis of Charlotte-Mecklenburg.12 
18:445:36618:28:27:72:215:322:144:Times:144:g_d0_f6:B:Effects by Prior Achievement 
18:446:36646:27:28:72:518:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:  Analyzing outcomes in 10 different districts provides us an opportunity to  examine  
18:447:36732:28:28:72:516:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:heterogeneity across the student population in the effects of taking algebra by 8th grade. It is 
18:448:36829:28:27:72:514:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:especially important to determine whether there are differences by prior achievement, since 
18:449:36921:27:28:72:534:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:much of the discussion about the advisability of teaching algebra to 8th graders concerns middle 
18:450:37018:28:27:72:537:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:schoolers’ readiness for the course. Few would dispute that at least some 8th graders are ready to 
18:451:37117:27:37:72:541:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:take algebra. The question is, how many? To address this question, we estimated equations of the 
18:452:37214:37:7:72:218:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
18:453:37279:7:16:72:542:113:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:12 In CLV (2012, Table 4), for example, the estimated coefficient in the corresponding IVQR equation is -0.324***, 
18:454:37394:16:12:71:543:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:compared  to  the  -0.374***  in  the  current  paper.  The  estimated  coefficients  in  the  2SLS  equations  in  the  previous  
18:455:37525:12:11:71:543:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:paper  are  0.069**,  -0.095***,  and  -0.002  for  Algebra  I,  Geometry  and  Algebra  II,  respectively,  compared  to  the  
18:456:37653:11:0:71:336:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:0.091***, -0.066***, and -0.026* in Table 3 of the current paper. 
19:457:37723:0:27:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:form shown in Table 3 with interactions by quintile of prior achievement. These are presented in 
19:458:37820:27:28:72:515:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Table 4b. For ease of interpretation, we have dropped the bivariate probit specifications and 
19:459:37914:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:added a 2SLS specification for the Algebra I test score, the estimates from which may well be 
19:460:38008:27:28:72:310:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:subject to sample selection bias, as noted above.  
19:461:38059:28:28:108:525:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:The most striking set of estimates is for the effect of passing Geometry. The estimated 
19:462:38147:28:27:72:522:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:coefficients make it clear that the overall negative effect of taking algebra by 8th grade comes 
19:463:38244:27:28:72:508:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:entirely from the deleterious effects on students in the lowest three prior-year achievement 
19:464:38337:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:quintiles. For those students – occupying the middle and bottom portions of the distribution – 
19:465:38432:27:28:72:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra by 8th grade reduces by at least 8 percentage points the chance that a student will take 
19:466:38529:28:28:72:535:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and pass geometry by 11th grade. For students in the top quintile, however, taking algebra by 8th 
19:467:38626:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade increases the chance of success in geometry. For students in the fourth quintile, there is no 
19:468:38726:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:effect one way or the other. As for passing Algebra I, something of a U-shaped effect is evident. 
19:469:38824:28:27:72:515:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We interpret the large positive coefficient in the lowest quintile to be an enabling effect: for 
19:470:38921:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:those most likely to struggle in algebra the best shot at passing the course eventually is to start 
19:471:39021:28:27:72:520:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:early. The effects on Algebra I test scores are negative for all students. The RFQR estimates, 
19:472:39116:27:28:72:537:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:which impute poor performance to those with missing test scores in a quantile regression model, 
19:473:39212:28:28:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:show that performance by students in quintiles 2 and 3 is harmed the most and that by students at 
19:474:39310:28:27:72:534:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the top is harmed the least. As for passing Algebra II, the faintly negative effect observed in the 
19:475:39410:27:28:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:overall effects shows up in the Table 4b estimates only in the second quintile, and with a point 
19:476:39507:28:27:71:534:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:estimate suggesting a decline of 4 percentage points. For Algebra II it is impossible to reject the 
19:477:39607:27:28:71:331:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:hypothesis that all the quintile coefficients are equal.

20:481:39701:27:28:72:485:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: We estimated three additional models with interactions for three other student 
20:482:39780:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:characteristics: gender, free lunch status, and parental education. Taken together, these models 
20:483:39877:27:28:72:523:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:yield several quite unexpected results. The gender interactions are shown in Table 5. Holding 
20:484:39971:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:constant their previous math achievement, boys score lower than girls do and are less likely to 
20:485:40067:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:pass the three math courses.  The interaction with algebra by 8th grade is positive, implying the 
20:486:40165:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:negative effects of early algebra are more pronounced among girls.  This implies that the gender 
20:487:40262:28:27:72:503:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:gap is much more pronounced among students who do not take algebra by 8th grade.  The 
20:488:40348:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:percentage point gap in passage rates separating boys and girls is 5.1 for those who did not take 
20:489:40446:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra by 8th grade but only 0.6 for those who did.  For Algebra II the corresponding gender 
20:490:40540:28:27:72:535:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:gaps are 6.8 and 3.0 percentage points. The estimated coefficients for Algebra I test scores tell a 
20:491:40640:27:28:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:similar story: boys are lagging behind girls in high school math, but the gap is smaller among 
20:492:40735:28:27:72:272:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:those who took algebra in middle school. 
20:493:40776:27:28:72:504:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Table 6 reports interaction effects for free and reduced-price lunch, a common but 
20:494:40859:28:27:72:540:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:imperfect proxy for low income.  Unsurprisingly, subsidized lunch receipt associates with poorer 
20:495:40956:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:academic outcomes overall.  Interaction terms indicate that the effects of algebra acceleration are 
20:496:41056:28:28:72:537:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:more pronounced among disadvantaged students in some cases, but not others.  Students on free 
20:497:41150:28:27:72:510:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and reduced lunch suffer a more pronounced negative effect on standardized Algebra I test 
20:498:41240:27:28:72:541:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:scores, but more encouraging results on all other outcomes. The positive effect of acceleration on 
20:499:41339:28:27:72:518:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra I passage is stronger among subsidized lunch recipients.  For passing Geometry and 
20:500:41430:27:28:72:528:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra II, the penalty associated with taking algebra in middle school was partially or wholly 
20:501:41526:28:28:72:525:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:erased for those getting free and reduced price lunch.  This puzzling pattern might result from 
20:502:41622:28:0:72:528:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:tracking practices in high schools.  Students who do not take Algebra I in middle school face a 
21:503:41722:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mathematics placement decision in high school, with options including the college-preparatory 
21:504:41816:27:28:72:509:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:sequence beginning with Algebra I as well as other options.  Disadvantaged students, for a 
21:505:41907:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variety of reasons, may be more likely to choose or be steered into less rigorous tracks in high 
21:506:42004:27:28:72:521:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:school.  Completing Algebra I in middle school, by contrast, clearly marks a student as being 
21:507:42098:28:28:72:513:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:selected for the college preparatory track, even if the student’s performance in the course is 
21:508:42193:28:27:72:148:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relatively poor. 
21:509:42210:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: The last set of interactions is summarized in Table 7, where the characteristic of interest 
21:510:42302:28:27:72:524:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:is parental education, specifically, whether either parent had a bachelor’s degree or more. Not 
21:511:42398:27:28:72:525:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:surprisingly, students with college-educated parents did better than others on every one of our 
21:512:42494:28:28:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:outcome measures.  Interaction terms show that the children of highly educated parents appear 
21:513:42588:28:27:72:537:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relatively impervious to the effects of algebra acceleration – both positive and negative.  Results 
21:514:42688:27:28:72:500:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:are consistent with the view that highly educated parents buffer the impacts of education 
21:515:42778:28:27:72:118:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policies.  
21:516:42789:27:28:72:507:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: The effects of algebra acceleration are clearly heterogeneous.  Generally speaking, 
21:517:42873:28:27:72:482:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students who begin in a relatively advanced position – perhaps thanks to their family 
21:518:42959:27:28:72:528:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:background, or to their rate of learning in earlier grades – appear to suffer no long term effects 
21:519:43058:28:28:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:when steered towards taking the course in 8th rather than 9th grade.  The story differs for students 
21:520:43159:28:27:72:495:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:who begin at an educational disadvantage.  Altogether, patterns indicate that a policy of 
21:521:43249:27:28:72:539:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mandating 8th grade algebra for all students runs the risk of exacerbating educational inequalities 
21:522:43349:28:27:72:498:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the high school years, with the possible exception of disadvantaged student for whom 
21:523:43437:27:28:71:466:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:acceleration implies a possible track switch into college-preparatory coursework.  
21:524:43520:28:28:72:340:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:V. Taking Calculus and Other Advanced Math Courses 
21:525:43570:28:0:72:511:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: As articulated by Walston and McCarroll (2011) above, one of the strongest selling 
22:526:43657:0:27:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:points for teaching algebra to more 8th graders is the increased opportunities it should provide for 
22:527:43758:27:28:72:530:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students to take courses beyond Algebra II, including calculus. Ideally, we would have liked to 
22:528:43854:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:analyze the effect of taking algebra in middle school on students’ enrollment and success in these 
22:529:43953:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:more advanced math courses. However, North Carolina has no end-of-course tests for these 
22:530:44042:28:28:72:510:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:advanced math courses like those it mandates for Algebra I and II and Geometry. The only 
22:531:44131:28:27:72:513:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:information on enrollment in these courses is a relatively new data set summarizing student 
22:532:44223:27:28:71:524:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:transcripts, which just covers 7th grade cohorts beginning with 2002/03. The restriction to just 
22:533:44320:28:27:72:521:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:three age cohorts deals a significant blow to our identification strategy, which relies upon the 
22:534:44417:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:existence of variation in placement patterns across cohorts that is too large to be explained by 
22:535:44514:28:28:72:532:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:idiosyncratic factors.  As a result, we abandon that strategy here and focus on a form of bounds 
22:536:44611:28:27:72:494:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:analysis, presenting simple statistics with clearly signed biases.  This strategy can yield 
22:537:44703:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:informative results in certain circumstances, such as when documenting that the upper bound on 
22:538:44798:28:27:72:298:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:a coefficient with a clear upward bias is small. 
22:539:44847:27:28:72:528:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Figure 6 shows the share of two groups of students, by level of prior achievement, who 
22:540:44934:28:27:72:532:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:took calculus by 12th grade: those who had taken Algebra I by 8th grade and those who had not. 
22:541:45029:27:28:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Not surprisingly, taking calculus was more common among students in the algebra-by-8th grade 
22:542:45122:28:28:71:531:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:group. There are two reasons for this difference. One is a causal inference: taking algebra early 
22:543:45220:28:27:71:516:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:places students in a superior position to proceed to calculus. The other reason is that the two 
22:544:45316:27:28:71:533:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:groups are different: even conditional on 6th and 7th grade performance, early algebra-takers are 
22:545:45414:28:27:72:521:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:likely to be more promising students in ways not captured by test scores alone.  We therefore 
22:546:45508:27:28:72:539:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:expect simple comparisons such as the ones shown here to be affected by positive selection bias. 
22:547:45605:28:28:72:533:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The difference between the rates of calculus-taking, shown by the vertical distance between the 
22:548:45701:28:0:72:537:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:curves, is therefore an upper bound on the effect of a policy to teach Algebra I in middle school. 
23:549:45804:0:27:72:524:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In the lower half of the prior achievement distribution, this gap is small, suggesting that, for a 
23:550:45903:27:28:72:531:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:majority of students, taking Algebra I in middle school is not going to have a big impact on the 
23:551:46000:28:27:72:517:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:probability of taking calculus in high school. For students near the median in middle school, 
23:552:46094:27:28:72:540:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:access to Algebra I in 8th grade raises the chances of taking calculus in high school by at most 10 
23:553:46194:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:percentage points.  Note that some students manage to take calculus even after waiting to take 
23:554:46289:28:27:72:529:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Algebra I until high school, presumably because they take two math courses simultaneously in 
23:555:46382:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:one or more years.  Not until we get into the top quintile of students (by prior achievement) is the 
23:556:46483:28:27:72:541:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:raw difference in rates of calculus-taking as much as 20 percentage points. In short, arguments to 
23:557:46582:27:28:72:521:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:accelerate algebra on the grounds that it significantly enables high school calculus-taking are 
23:558:46678:28:28:72:461:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:best applied to high-performing students, and not moderate or low performers. 13 
23:559:46758:28:27:72:190:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:VI. Repeating Algebra I 
23:560:46781:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: The last consequence of teaching algebra in middle school that we trace is a negative one: 
23:561:46872:28:27:72:523:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:repeating the first algebra course. We have seen that one consequence of the practice is lower 
23:562:46967:27:28:72:525:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performance on the Algebra I end-of-course test. Although taking the course in middle school 
23:563:47060:28:27:72:512:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:does indeed boost the chance of passing it eventually, for many students passing the course 
23:564:47152:27:28:71:530:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:requires taking it more than once. Here we look directly at repeating as an outcome of the push 
23:565:47248:28:32:71:239:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to teach algebra in middle school.  
23:566:47284:32:7:72:218:235:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:                                                                 
23:567:47349:7:16:72:542:228:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:13  A stronger case can be made for the enabling effect of accelerating algebra on the opportunity to take pre-calculus 
23:568:47469:16:12:72:531:212:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:courses. Comparisons similar to that shown in Figure 6 between students who did and did not take Algebra I in 8th 
23:569:47582:12:11:71:508:200:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:grade indicate larger differences in the share of students who took at least one pre-calculus course, including 
23:570:47694:11:12:71:525:189:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:analytical geometry and courses entitled “pre-calculus.” Compared to those in the previous graph, these lines are 
23:571:47808:12:11:71:537:177:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:farther apart, suggesting an upper bound net enabling effect amounting to almost 20 percentage points at the middle 
23:572:47924:11:12:71:507:166:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:of the prior achievement distribution and more than 40 percentage points at the 90th percentile. Although the 
23:573:48034:12:11:72:536:154:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:comparisons shown in Figure 6 suggest that moving algebra to 8th grade is unlikely to increase the share of students 
23:574:48151:11:12:72:542:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:who take calculus in high school, except for the top students, there does appear to be some real scope for an enabling 
23:575:48270:12:11:72:532:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:effect to operate for pre-calculus courses. The pre-calculus courses included in these latter comparisons were math 
23:576:48386:11:12:72:541:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:course numbered 2031(Analytical Geometry), 2070 (Pre-Calculus), and 2071 (IB Math Methods I). The findings are 
23:577:48497:12:11:72:489:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:quite similar if we define pre-calculus more broadly, in include in addition math course numbered 2041 
23:578:48600:11:12:72:534:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:(Trigonometry), 2054 (Integrated Math IV), 2065 (Probability and Statistics), 2066 (AP Statistics, 2070), and 2078 
23:579:48715:12:11:72:141:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:Times:F:(Math HL I IB).  
23:580:48731:11:0:72:75:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F: 
24:581:48735:0:27:108:511:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:In this case, we expect a negative bias in simple estimates.  Early algebra takers are 
24:582:48822:27:28:72:537:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:positively selected and should therefore be less disposed to negative outcomes such as retaking.  
24:583:48920:28:27:72:495:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Any simple comparison will therefore likely understate the effect of acceleration on the 
24:584:49009:27:28:72:225:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:propensity to retake the course. 
24:585:49042:28:28:108:529:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:Using axes like the previous two figures, Figure 7 shows the percentage of students, by 
24:586:49130:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:prior achievement level, who had to repeat Algebra I. As expected, this share tends to be smaller 
24:587:49228:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:for students with higher prior math achievement. That said, the students who took Algebra I by 
24:588:49323:28:27:72:511:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:8th grade were more likely to repeat the course. For students at the 20th percentile score, for 
24:589:49419:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:example, the early algebra takers were more than 20 percentage points more likely to repeat the 
24:590:49515:28:28:72:482:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:course. Given the expected bias in these estimates, for roughly the bottom half of the 
24:591:49602:28:27:72:532:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:distribution, the effect of taking Algebra I by 8th grade is at least a 20 percentage point increase 
24:592:49703:27:28:72:518:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the risk of repeating the course.  For the median student, and all those below, acceleration 
24:593:49799:28:27:72:407:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:appears to be more likely to lead to course repetition than to calculus. 
24:594:49872:27:28:72:152:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:VII. Conclusion 
24:595:49887:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: This paper examines a widely-espoused policy in math education: getting more students 
24:596:49973:27:28:72:495:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to take algebra in 8th grade, rather than waiting until 9th grade, when most students have 
24:597:50064:28:28:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:traditionally taken the first course in algebra. Offering algebra early allows students more time in 
24:598:50165:28:27:72:536:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:high school to take advanced math courses, but critics complain that most students are not ready 
24:599:50262:27:28:72:512:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:for algebra in 8th grade. In a prior paper we examined the effect of early algebra, using data 
24:600:50357:28:27:72:533:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mainly from the Charlotte-Mecklenberg Schools, a district that had pursued a well-documented 
24:601:50450:27:28:72:528:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy to place more students into early algebra in the early 2000’s. We found that some of the 
24:602:50546:28:28:72:511:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:concerns raised by critics appear to be valid. In particular we found that students who were 
24:603:50639:28:0:72:528:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:pushed to take algebra by 8th grade performed less well in subsequent math courses, especially 
25:604:50738:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:geometry, as they progressed through high school.  That study is limited, however, because the 
25:605:50833:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:effects we obtained apply only to those students actually affected by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg 
25:606:50929:28:27:72:522:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy shift.  To see how generalizable these estimates are, in the current paper we extend the 
25:607:51025:27:28:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:analysis to the 10 largest North Carolina school districts. This expansion allows us to enrich the 
25:608:51124:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:analysis and explore a wider range of effects. In particular we are able to estimate effects for 
25:609:51221:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:high-performing students – who were not affected by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg policy shift – 
25:610:51314:27:28:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and to examine heterogeneous impacts by the student’s race, and by the income and education 
25:611:51406:28:27:72:226:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:status of the student’s parents.   
25:612:51441:27:28:108:531:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:Following the same basic methodology as in the earlier paper, we identify the effects of 
25:613:51530:28:28:72:525:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:accelerating algebra by using data on multiple cohorts of students disaggregated by their prior 
25:614:51626:28:27:72:524:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:math achievement and exploiting the fact that shifts in the timing of algebra occur at different 
25:615:51723:27:28:72:513:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:times in different districts to different deciles of students. Our aim is to assess the effects of 
25:616:51822:28:27:72:536:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variations in school policies and practices that manifest themselves in differing rates with which 
25:617:51921:27:28:72:522:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:otherwise similar students are assigned to take Algebra I in middle school. We examine three 
25:618:52014:28:27:71:495:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:kinds of possible effects on students: on their performance on the state’s mandatory test 
25:619:52104:27:28:71:539:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:administered to all Algebra I students; on how well they succeed in passing Algebra I, Geometry 
25:620:52200:28:28:71:505:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and Algebra II; and on whether they took courses beyond Algebra II, including calculus.   
25:621:52290:28:27:71:527:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: Our estimation strategy is designed to yield estimates that reflect causation, not simply 
25:622:52380:27:28:71:538:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:correlation. Since assignment of any student to take algebra in 7th or 8th grade is likely to depend 
25:623:52481:28:27:72:540:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:on numerous student-level factors, any attempt to assess the effect of early assignment to algebra 
25:624:52580:27:28:72:536:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:based on observational, within-cohort-and-district variation will inevitably be subject to omitted 
25:625:52679:28:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variable, or selection, bias. We therefore use instrumental variables estimation. The large number 
25:626:52778:28:0:72:519:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of districts used in this study means that a wider range of students were subjected to shifts in 
26:627:52879:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra placement policy over time.  As in our previous study, we use this variation to assess the 
26:628:52978:27:28:72:538:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:impact of algebra timing on student outcomes.  We infer that a policy shift has occurred in those 
26:629:53076:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:circumstances where the across-cohort variation in Algebra I placement patterns is too large to 
26:630:53172:27:28:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:be based on random fluctuations in student background characteristics alone. We use data on 
26:631:53264:28:28:72:533:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:students from six successive cohorts in the 10 districts, stratifying the sample by students’ prior 
26:632:53364:28:27:72:519:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:achievement, as measured by each student’s average scores on 6th and 7th grade standardized 
26:633:53456:27:28:72:526:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:math tests.  We then reduce the sample to those district and prior achievement decile cells that 
26:634:53553:28:27:72:387:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:exhibit significant variation in placement patterns across cohorts. 
26:635:53620:27:28:108:532:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:As in our previous paper, we find that the overall effect of taking algebra by 8th grade is 
26:636:53712:28:28:72:520:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to increase the probability that students will pass Algebra I by 10th grade, but to depress their 
26:637:53810:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performance on the Algebra I test and decrease the likelihood they will pass Geometry by 11th 
26:638:53903:27:28:71:511:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:grade. In addition, we find significant heterogeneity in effects. The most important form of 
26:639:53996:28:27:71:520:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:heterogeneity we observe is based on prior achievement. We find that the harmful effects are 
26:640:54089:27:28:71:519:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:almost entirely confined to students in the bottom 60% of the prior achievement distribution, 
26:641:54183:28:27:71:528:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:lending support to the argument of critics that only the best prepared students are ready to take 
26:642:54281:27:28:71:532:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra in 8th grade. Other sources of heterogeneity are less predictable.  As might be expected, 
26:643:54379:28:28:72:538:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:girls do better on our math outcomes, as do those not receiving free lunch and those with college 
26:644:54477:28:27:72:537:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:educated parents. But the interactions with early algebra were anything but expected. Boys were 
26:645:54573:27:28:72:529:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:harmed less by taking algebra early. Students on free lunch, while being harmed more by early 
26:646:54667:28:27:72:533:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:algebra on Algebra I test scores, actually were harmed less by other measures. And for students 
26:647:54763:27:28:72:536:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:with college-educated parents the effect of early algebra had varying effects but in general these 
26:648:54862:28:28:72:384:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:differences did little to affect their overall superior performance. 
26:649:54931:28:0:108:512:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:For two other outcomes, we are not able to use the instrumental variables approach, 
27:650:55019:0:27:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:because of limited data. We therefore offer estimates in the spirit of a “bounds” analysis. The 
27:651:55115:27:28:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:first outcome is taking calculus and other advanced math courses. This outcome is important 
27:652:55207:28:27:72:517:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:because a prime argument for moving algebra to 8th grade is that it opens up for students the 
27:653:55301:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:opportunity to take more advanced coursework in mathematics during high school. For calculus 
27:654:55394:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taking, we compared students who did and did not take algebra I by 8th grade. The differences 
27:655:55488:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:reflect the course and selection. Our bounds analysis suggests that there can be little effect in the 
27:656:55590:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:bottom half of the prior achievement distribution because so few students take calculus, whether 
27:657:55687:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:or not they took algebra in 8th grade. It is only in the top fifth that the differences are as great as 
27:658:55791:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:20 percentage points.  As for repeating Algebra I, all of the action is at the bottom of the prior 
27:659:55890:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:achievement scale, the potential effects are quite large. For those students at or near the bottom, 
27:660:55990:28:27:71:530:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taking Algebra I early increases the likelihood of re-taking the course by at least 20 percentage 
27:661:56088:27:28:71:106:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:points. 
27:662:56096:28:27:107:539:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:As is the case with our previous study of accelerated algebra, it is important to end with a 
27:663:56189:27:28:71:520:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:caveat emphasizing at least one conclusion that cannot be drawn from our work. The present 
27:664:56280:28:27:71:498:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:paper, like our previous study focusing on Charlotte-Mecklenberg, addresses a policy of 
27:665:56368:27:28:71:524:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:changing the timing of the conventional first course in algebra. We ask whether it was a good 
27:666:56462:28:28:71:524:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:idea to take the existing Algebra I course and increase the number of 8th graders taking it. We 
27:667:56558:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:cannot address the effects of proposals that would take concepts from algebra and introduce them 
27:668:56655:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to students in earlier grades to an extent not previously done, that is, a thorough-going reform of 
27:669:56755:28:32:72:529:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the mathematics curriculum. Regarding the desirability of such a reform, our research is silent.
