7:250:7308:13:14:72:75:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:251:7308:14:17:76:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This paper discusses the magnitude of Nonperforming Loans (NPL) in the banking sector of 
7:252:7397:17:16:76:526:714:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh   since   the   adaptation   of   prudential   norms   in   the   loan   classification   and 
7:253:7502:16:17:76:526:698:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning  system  in  1990.  Smooth  and  efficient  flow  of  saving-investment  process  is  a 
7:254:7603:17:17:76:525:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prerequisite  for  the  economic  development  of  a  country.  Bangladesh,  being  a  developed 
7:255:7700:17:16:76:526:664:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country and with an underdeveloped capital market, mainly depends on the intermediary role 
7:256:7790:16:17:76:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  commercial  banks  for  mobilizing  internal  saving  and  providing  capital  to  the  investor. 
7:257:7892:17:16:76:525:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus,  it  matters  greatly  how  well  our  financial  sector  is  functioning.  The  process  of 
7:258:7991:16:17:76:526:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic  development  of  Bangladesh  has  been  seriously  constrained  by  the  continuing 
7:259:8085:17:16:76:525:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crisis  of  the  accumulation  of  classified  loans.  As  Loan  is  the  prime  asset  of  a  bank,  it  is 
7:260:8194:16:17:76:525:582:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:essential  to  know  the  asset  quality  of  a  bank,  regulation  helps  to  determine  the  financial 
7:261:8299:17:16:76:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:health  and  efficiency  of  the  banking  sector.  Besides,  a  proper  loan  classification  and 
7:262:8398:16:17:76:525:549:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning system ensures credibility of the financial system that in turn restores trust and 
7:263:8494:17:17:76:525:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confidence  in  the  mind  of  depositors.  Loan  classification  and  provisioning  system  is  also 
7:264:8596:17:16:76:526:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:essential  for  regularizing  follow-up,  monitoring  activities  and  improving  the  recovery 
7:265:8692:16:17:76:525:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:position. However, the criteria for classifying and provisioning loan portfolios depend on the 
7:266:8787:17:16:76:267:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prudential policies of the central bank.  
7:267:8828:16:17:76:94:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:      
7:268:8833:17:16:76:526:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There are several reasons of classified  loans  in our banking sector such as  flow problem of 
7:269:8928:16:17:76:525:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bad  loans,  dissatisfactory  performance  of  the  courts,  having  no  concrete  NPL  management 
7:270:9027:17:17:76:525:416:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strategy equipped with both preventive and resolution measures, having no measurement of 
7:271:9116:17:16:76:526:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the meaningful application of the CRG device in the credit environment etc. For this, there is 
7:272:9211:16:17:76:525:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:huge amount of classified  loans  in our banking  sector. The Bangladesh  Bank  has given the 
7:273:9305:17:16:76:525:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:guidelines  regarding  the  provisioning  system  against  classified  loans  through  the  BCD  and 
7:274:9406:16:17:76:526:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:BRPD  circulation.    Due  to  increasing  default  risks  of  loans,  the  provisioning  system  has 
7:275:9508:17:16:76:525:333:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:been revised several times. For protecting the depositor‟s interest and keeping the bank‟s 
7:276:9599:16:17:76:525:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial  condition  solvent  huge  amount  of  provisions  are  kept  against  the  classified  loans. 
7:277:9704:17:17:76:526:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For the causes of classified  loans, provision of the banking  sector is  increasing. As a result 
7:278:9802:17:16:76:525:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the profit of the banks is coming down. Besides government also deprive from current year 
7:279:9892:16:17:76:274:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:taxes due to higher rate of provisioning.  
7:280:9934:17:16:76:79:250:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:281:9934:16:17:76:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:So it is needed to maintain a standard asset quality and so need to follow related prudential 
7:282:10027:17:16:76:525:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regulation.  Besides,  maintenance  of  an  ethical  standard  in  the  banking  profession  from  all 
7:283:10130:16:17:76:525:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concerns  can  be  viewed  as  an  important  means  for  making  the  credit  environment  credible 
7:284:10231:17:16:76:526:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  vibrant. We  have had a two-decade long  experience  in dealing with the NPLs problem 
7:285:10322:16:17:76:525:168:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  much  is known  about the causes and remedies of the problem. So,  it  is  very  important 
7:286:10418:17:17:76:525:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  the  lenders,  borrowers  and  policy  makers  to  learn  from  the  past  experience  and  act 
7:287:10519:17:16:76:521:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accordingly. It is optimistic that at present the trend of classified loans has begun to decline.

8:292:10628:14:26:251:314:744:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Introduction 
8:293:10640:26:21:72:75:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:294:10640:21:14:72:243:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1.1 Background of the Study: 
8:295:10667:14:13:72:75:683:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:296:10667:13:17:72:526:670:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Most of the business is done by banks with the funds which are collected from the public by 
8:297:10759:17:17:72:526:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:way of deposits. A non-performing asset in the banking sector may be termed as an asset not 
8:298:10851:17:16:72:526:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contributing to the  income of the  bank. In other words, it  is a zero  yield  asset when applied 
8:299:10950:16:17:72:526:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:particularly  to  loan  and  advances.  The  actual  concept  of  NPA  is  that  it  is  an  asset  which 
8:300:11056:17:16:72:525:603:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ceases to yield income for the bank and that any income accrued from such asset shall not be 
8:301:11149:16:17:72:526:587:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:treated as income until  it  is actually realized.  Classification of an asset as NPA  should  be  a 
8:302:11250:17:16:72:526:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:based  on  record  of  recovery.  Therefore,  an  asset  is  to  be  classified  as  NPA  when  there  is  a 
8:303:11359:16:17:72:526:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:threat  of  loss  for  the  recoverability  is  in  doubt.  In  spite  of  wide  ranging  reform  measures 
8:304:11466:17:17:72:526:537:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:initiated in the banking sector, the problem of non-performing assets assumed a central place 
8:305:11560:17:16:72:250:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in issues relating to banking sector.   
8:306:11599:16:14:72:77:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  
8:307:11599:14:17:72:525:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Lending  function of a  bank  needs to add value to the  bank. The  lending  function comprises 
8:308:11695:17:16:72:526:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:origination, funding, monitoring and servicing of loan. Loans are deemed as assets of a bank. 
8:309:11789:16:17:72:526:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To  maintain  asset  to  a  standard  quality  various  prudential  regulation  from  various  angle, 
8:310:11891:17:16:72:526:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:issued by central bank such as, loan classification criteria, provisioning requirement, income 
8:311:11986:16:17:72:502:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recognition, write-off policy, risk diversification, directed lending, debt restructuring etc. 
8:312:12080:17:16:72:75:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:313:12080:16:17:72:526:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  the  absence  of  strong  capital  market,  Bangladesh  depends  heavily  on  the  banking  sector 
8:314:12183:17:17:72:526:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for a smooth financial  intermediation. However,  for many  years  Bangladeshi  banking  sector 
8:315:12279:17:16:72:526:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has been burdened with the crisis of accumulation of huge non-performing loans. All types of 
8:316:12372:16:17:72:526:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:domestic banks i.e. NCBs, PCBs and DFIs are facing the daunting amount of non-performing 
8:317:12461:17:16:72:526:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan.  Since  1980s,  the  central  banks  of  the  developing  countries,  following  the  practices  of 
8:318:12567:16:17:72:526:308:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:the developed countries, have adopted the “prudential norms for asset classification”, with a 
8:319:12661:17:16:72:525:291:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:view to ensuring “transparency” and “quality” of the loan portfolios of the banks. It is a part 
8:320:12756:16:17:72:292:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of Financial Sector Reform Program (FSRP). 
8:321:12798:17:14:72:75:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:322:12798:14:16:72:526:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh,  too,  has  started  adopting  a  number  of  financial  sector  reform  measures  since 
8:323:12899:16:17:72:529:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1990  as  a  part  of  its  overall  economic  stabilization  and  structural  adjustment  program.  
8:324:13000:17:16:72:526:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Though    privatization    (allowing    new    private    commercial    banks    to    operate)    and 
8:325:13103:16:17:72:526:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:denationalization  (selling  out  government  banks  to  private  entrepreneurs)  of  the  financial 
8:326:13204:17:16:72:525:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions (as well as other real sector enterprises) started well before (in 1983) the adoption 
8:327:13303:16:17:72:388:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of stabilization and structural adjustment program by Bangladesh 
8:328:13367:17:17:72:526:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Government.  However,  even  if  we  consider  1990  as  take-off  year  in  regard  to  financial 
8:329:13466:17:16:72:525:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reforms,  we  have  by  this  time  passed  22  years  of reforms.  The  main  features  of  Financial 
8:330:13569:16:17:72:526:112:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sector  Reforms  Program  (FSRP)  in  the  context  of  banking  sector  of  Bangladesh  are: 
8:331:13663:17:16:72:526:95:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:liberalization of  interest rate policy, abolition of refinance and  introduction of rediscounting 
8:332:13762:16:0:72:525:79:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:scheme, introduction of new system of loan classification and provisioning, capital adequacy 
9:333:13855:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:requirement, strengthening of Central Bank, improvement in the operation of NCBs (recently 
9:334:13946:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changed  in  Ltd  company),  computerization  of  banks,  development  of  human  resources, 
9:335:14039:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reforms  in  the  legal  environment,  reforms  in  foreign  exchange  regime  and  development  of 
9:336:14139:16:17:72:146:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capital market. 
9:337:14154:17:16:72:75:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:338:14154:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After  the  introduction  of  explicit  loan  classification  system  in  1989,  loan  classification 
9:339:14256:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system  has  undergone  a  number  of  changes  from  time  to  time.  The  present  classification 
9:340:14355:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system  is  a  little  bit  relaxed  compared  to  the  international  norms  of  classifying  the  loan. 
9:341:14461:16:17:72:523:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Almost  a  quarter  of  the  total  loans  of  the  banking  sector  are  now  classified  or  non-
9:342:14560:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performing.  According  to  latest  BRPD  (Banking  Regulation  and  Policy  Department, 2012) 
9:343:14654:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:circular  of  Bangladesh  Bank  the  latest  figure  indicated  that  the  6.59  %  of  total  loan  is 
9:344:14758:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classified. Although, the ratio was as 26.09% since in 1990 and high as 41.1% in 1999 and it 
9:345:14851:16:17:72:322:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:came down gradually to the present level of 6.59%. 
9:346:14901:17:17:72:75:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:347:14901:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:It  is  obvious  that  non-performing loan (NPLs) reduce banks‟ profitability, as banks cannot 
9:348:14996:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:appropriate  interest  income  from  their  classified  loans.  NPLs  reduce  loan-able  funds  by 
9:349:15095:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stopping recycling. Banks  need to set aside a portion of their  income as  loan  loss reserve to 
9:350:15193:16:17:72:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:make up bad debt. A bank with a high percentage of NPLs suffers from erosion of the capital. 
9:351:15286:17:16:72:526:460:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:All those adverse impact of NPLs on banks‟ financial health such as low profitability and low 
9:352:15380:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capital base are clearly reflected in Bangladesh banking sector. The question arises as to why 
9:353:15475:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we  are  unable  to  solve  this  problem  for  such  a  long  time?  A  number  of  studies  have  been 
9:354:15580:16:17:72:526:411:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:undertaken  to  deal  with  the  problem  and  to  address  this  „default  culture‟  phenomenon. 
9:355:15678:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Emergence  and  accumulation  of  high  scale  of  non-performing  loans  after  independence 
9:356:15772:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:starting  from  the  nationalization  of  banks  has  been  well  discussed  by  a  number  of  authors 
9:357:15876:16:17:72:263:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Islam et al., 1999; Moral et al., 2000).  
9:358:15918:17:13:72:75:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:359:15918:13:17:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Several  attempts  have  been  made  to  explain  the  non-performing  loans  problem  with  some 
9:360:16016:17:17:72:525:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:theories  relating  to  political  economy  backed  by  empirical  findings.    Islam  et  al.,  (1999)  in 
9:361:16124:17:16:72:526:297:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:their study on bank loan default offered the idea of „comprador government‟ and „comprador 
9:362:16215:16:17:72:526:281:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:bourgeoisie‟ developed  by Paul Baran as an explanation of the  behavior of  Bangladeshi 
9:363:16304:17:16:72:526:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capitalists class where trading as opposed to manufacturing becomes the main business of the 
9:364:16397:16:17:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capitalists  and  they  act  as  importers,  indentors,  sales  agents,  suppliers,  etc.  The  same  study 
9:365:16505:17:16:72:526:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also   made   an  effort  to  explain  the  process  of  transfer  of  economic   surplus  through 
9:366:16604:16:17:72:526:215:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:international trade based on Emmanuel‟s theory of „unequal exchange‟ which complements 
9:367:16691:17:17:72:523:198:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Baran‟s explanation. Ahmad (1997) used three theoretical paradigms in his quest for a socio-
9:368:16783:17:16:72:525:181:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political  explanation  of  the  bank  loan  default  problem  of  Bangladesh,  the  rational  actor 
9:369:16884:16:17:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:theory, the pluralist instrumentalist theory and the organizational bargaining theory. Based on 
9:370:16980:17:16:72:526:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an  investigation  he  mentioned  some  important  factors  as  causes  of  loan  default  which 
9:371:17077:16:17:72:526:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:includes  lack  of  willingness  to  pay  coupled  with  diversion  of  fund,  willful  negligence  and 
9:372:17181:17:16:72:526:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:belief  that  waiver  may  be  available  in  the  future,  operational  problems,  inability  to  utilize 
9:373:17288:16:17:72:526:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production  capacity,  power  failure,  improper  credit  appraisal,  natural  calamity,  and  unfair 
9:374:17390:17:0:72:526:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:taxation.  Non-professional  handling  of  assets  both  by  the  NCBs  and  the  private  sector  bank 
10:375:17495:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was reported as the main reasons for the accumulation of loan default problem in Bangladesh 
10:376:17587:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Alam  and  Jahan,  1999).  It  included  the  Government  directed  credit  for  the  loss  making 
10:377:17687:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:public sector enterprises and the private sector banks‟  lending to insiders and connected 
10:378:17778:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:parties.  Prof.  Rehman  Sobhan  (1991)  in  his  study  on  debt  default  problem  examined  the 
10:379:17877:17:16:72:500:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nature and problems relating to poor repayment status of the two DFIs-BSB and BSRS.   
10:380:17961:16:17:72:75:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
10:381:17961:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Government of Bangladesh  has taken some  initiative such as tightening up of the regulatory 
10:382:18054:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measures  to  enable  banks  to  recover  loans  from  the  defaulters.  They  have  taken  some 
10:383:18151:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measures  on  recovery  of  defaulted  loan  such  as  Artha  Rin  Adalat  Ain  (Money  Loan  Court 
10:384:18251:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Act 2003) was enacted in 2003 with a view to improving the legal framework for recovery of 
10:385:18342:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:overdue  loans  and  advances  by  the  banks  and  financial  institutions.  In  recognition  of  the 
10:386:18445:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:importance  of  an  effective  risk  management  system,  BB  has  issued  guidelines  on  managing 
10:387:18545:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:core  risks  in  banking  in  October  2003.  The  five  core  risks  are  Credit  Risks,  Asset  and 
10:388:18647:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Liability Risks, Foreign Exchange Risks, Internal Control and Compliance Risks and Money 
10:389:18736:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Laundering  Risks.  Now  banks  are  not  allowed  to  approve  large  loans  in  favor  of  any 
10:390:18833:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:individual or group of borrowers in excess of 50  percent of their total capital. Loans, which 
10:391:18928:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have been classified as bad/loss for 5 years or more against which full provision s have been 
10:392:19022:16:17:72:361:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:kept are to be written off by the banks to clean their books.  
10:393:19084:17:16:72:75:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
10:394:19084:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Despite  massive  injection  of  loans  to  the  national  economy,  the  contribution  of  financial 
10:395:19186:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector  to  the  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  remained  at  dismal  level.  This  laden  loan 
10:396:19284:16:17:72:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contribution to GDP by the unhealthy and inefficient financial situation. Political connections 
10:397:19380:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have played a key role in sanctioning a loan. In such connection, we should realize that what 
10:398:19474:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will happen of the confidence of depositors and productive sectors borrower in the domestic 
10:399:19566:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial  system?  What will  happen if the defaulters are  not brought to book and  soundness 
10:400:19662:17:16:72:270:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of financial institutions are not ensured?

10:402:19705:17:16:72:215:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1.2 Objectives of the Study: 
10:403:19733:16:18:72:430:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Managements of NPA would have the following three specific objectives: 
10:404:19803:18:16:94:518:277:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Improving the quality of NPA to a performing status so that income on such assets is 
10:405:19889:16:18:94:153:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recognized. 
10:406:19900:18:17:94:508:243:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:  Upgrading the status of the assets so as to reduce the provisioning requirements.  . 
10:407:19985:17:17:94:526:226:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To  analyze  legal  aspect  to  recover  loans  from  the  defaulters  and  the  causes  and

11:426:20878:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Non-performing  Loan  is  very  much  important  for  the  banking  sector.  Here the  study  would 
11:427:20978:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be concentrate on laws and regulations and existing legal structure as well as status of NPL of 
11:428:21074:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:different  commercial  banks.  Problems  are  always  there  for  any  research  study.  Effort  was 
11:429:21175:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:there to overcome the limitations and to bring a reliable and fruitful result. The limitations of 
11:430:21273:17:18:72:139:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the study are: 
11:431:21287:18:17:98:376:525:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: This study did not cover primary and unpublished data. 
11:432:21342:17:16:98:526:508:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The major problem faced while conducting the research was unavailability of relevant 
11:433:21428:16:17:98:124:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:data.

11:436:21460:16:17:72:526:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This research report has been divided into seven parts. In the first chapter, introduction of the 
11:437:21558:17:16:72:526:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:research  has  been  given.  Here  the  background,  Objectives  of  the  study,  methodology  and 
11:438:21657:16:17:72:526:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:scope  has  been  elaborated.  In  the  second  chapter,  describe  the  conceptual  framework  and 
11:439:21757:17:16:72:526:392:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:review  of  the  literature.  The  third  chapter  portrays  the  trend  of  the  loan  default  problem  in 
11:440:21866:16:17:72:526:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh.  The  Fourth  chapter  illustrates the  loan  default  status of  commercial  banks.  The 
11:441:21968:17:16:72:526:359:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fifth chapter describes the descriptive analysis of related laws and impact of new regulations. 
11:442:22064:16:17:72:526:343:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  sixth  chapter  identifies  the  causes  and  remedies  of  non-performing  loans.  Finally  the 
11:443:22166:17:17:72:526:326:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seventh chapter contains the  findings, challenges  and concluding remarks on  nonperforming 
11:444:22259:17:16:72:115:309:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loans.

12:465:22397:14:16:72:75:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  
12:466:22397:16:16:72:201:637:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.1.1 Meaning of NPA: 
12:467:22417:16:17:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  bank  being  financial  intermediaries  are  in  the  business  of  accepting  deposits  for  the 
12:468:22520:17:16:72:526:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purpose  of  lending  and  to  augment  their  resources  at  times  they  borrow  money  from  other 
12:469:22622:16:17:72:526:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sources  and  meet  the  ever  increasing  borrowing  requirements  of  their  customers.  However, 
12:470:22722:17:16:72:526:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:most of the business is done by banks with the funds which are collected from the public by 
12:471:22814:16:17:72:525:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:way of deposits. They are, therefore, answerable to the public at large, who are keeping their 
12:472:22908:17:17:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:funds  with  the  banks  by  reposing  trust  in  the  ability  of  banks  that  they  will  not  put  the 
12:473:23015:17:16:72:222:521:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depositors interest to jeopardy. 
12:474:23047:16:17:72:75:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
12:475:23047:17:16:72:526:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: A non-performing asset  in the banking sector may  be termed as an asset not contributing to 
12:476:23140:16:17:72:526:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  income  of  the  bank.  In  other  words,  it  is  a  zero  yield  asset  when  applied  particularly  to 
12:477:23251:17:16:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan  and  advances.  The  actual  concept  of  NPA  is  that  it  is  an  asset  which  ceases  to  yield 
12:478:23358:16:17:72:526:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income  for  the  bank  and  that  any income  accrued  from  such  asset  shall  not  be  treated  as 
12:479:23461:17:17:72:526:422:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income  until  it  is  actually  realized.    Classification  of  an  asset  as  NPA  should  be  a  based  on 
12:480:23572:17:16:72:526:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:record  of  recovery.  Therefore,  an  asset  is  to  be  classified  as  NPA  when  there  is  a  threat  of 
12:481:23682:16:17:72:525:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loss  for  the  recoverability  is  in  doubt.  In  spite  of  wide  ranging  reform  measures  initiated  in 
12:482:23792:17:16:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  banking  sector,  the  problem  of  non-performing  assets  assumed  a  central  place  in  issues 
12:483:23896:16:17:72:206:356:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relating to banking sector.   
12:484:23925:17:17:72:75:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
12:485:23925:17:17:72:233:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.1.2 Causes for growing NPA: 
12:486:23954:17:16:90:526:305:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Improper selection of borrowers, inadequacies of character, capacity and capital at the 
12:487:24043:16:18:90:174:289:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:borrower‟s level. 
12:488:24060:18:17:90:395:271:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Deficiencies in appraisal, processing, sanction, and release. 
12:489:24122:17:18:90:513:254:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Inadequate/excess sanction of the limit irrespective of the economic size of the unit. 
12:490:24209:18:17:90:207:236:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Scattered financing. 
12:491:24230:17:18:90:522:219:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Unrealistic terms or conditions of sanction and fixing unrealistic repayment schedule. 
12:492:24317:18:17:90:459:201:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Political interference in sanctioning of loans and patronage to defaulters. 
12:493:24393:17:16:90:526:184:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Lack  of  infrastructural  facilities  like  power,  raw  materials,  fuel,  transportation, 
12:494:24487:16:18:90:250:168:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:marketing and technical support. 
12:495:24519:18:17:90:525:150:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Lack  of  inter-bank  co-ordination  as  well  as  cooperation  with  financial  institution  in 
12:496:24617:17:16:90:316:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchanging information over list of defaulters.

13:500:24666:0:16:72:200:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.1.3 Objectives of NPA: 
13:501:24690:16:18:72:425:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Management of NPA would have the following three specific objectives: 
13:502:24759:18:16:90:526:724:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Improving the quality of NPA to a performing status so that income on such assets is 
13:503:24845:16:18:90:148:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recognized. 
13:504:24856:18:17:90:495:690:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Upgrading the status of the assets so as to reduce the provisioning requirements. 
13:505:24938:17:17:90:521:673:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Cleansing balance-sheet of loss assets and also unsecured portion of doubtful assets.   
13:506:25026:17:16:72:75:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
13:507:25026:16:17:72:207:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.1.4 Framework of NPA: 
13:508:25049:17:16:72:526:623:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Risk  is  inherent  in  all  aspects  of  a  commercial  operation;  however  for  banks  and  financial 
13:509:25154:16:17:72:526:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions,  credit  risk  is  an  essential  factor  that  needs  to  be  managed.  Credit  risk  is  the 
13:510:25263:17:16:72:526:590:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possibility that a borrower or counter party will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with 
13:511:25360:16:17:72:526:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agreed  terms.  Credit  risk  management  needs  to  be  a  robust  process  that  enables  banks  to 
13:512:25462:17:17:72:526:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proactively  manage  loan  portfolios  in  order to  minimize  losses  and  earn  an  acceptable  level 
13:513:25566:17:16:72:525:540:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  return  for  shareholders.  And  NPL  management  must  be  thought  of  as  an  integral  part  of 
13:514:25670:16:17:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:overall credit risk management. It implies that NPL management is not an independent event, 
13:515:25762:17:16:72:525:507:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  stats  with  conversion  of  a  performing  loan  into  non-performing  loan.  In  fact  a  robust 
13:516:25867:16:17:72:526:491:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:NPL  management  must  start  before  a  loan  becomes  non-performing.  It  is  much  better  to 
13:517:25965:17:185:72:337:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prevent an NPL, rather than curing or nursing an NPL.

13:521:26051:17:16:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:NPL  Management  Strategy,  in  figure  2,  explains  that  the  incidence  of  non-performing 
13:522:26146:16:17:72:526:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:advances  (NPAs)  is  affecting  the  performance  of  the  credit  institutions  both  financially  and 
13:523:26251:17:16:72:526:215:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:psychologically.  The  successful  banker-client  relationship  in  the  credit  function  of  banks 
13:524:26352:16:18:72:326:199:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:involves three important and interlinked phases viz.: 
13:525:26405:18:17:94:497:181:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The right type and the right amount of credit are given to the right type of client. 
13:526:26489:17:18:94:458:164:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The borrower‟s makes proper use of the amount received from the bank. 
13:527:26559:18:16:94:460:146:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The borrower repays the outstanding loan along with the interest in time. 
13:528:26633:16:18:94:427:130:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Management of NPAs shall rely upon the following basic principles: 
13:529:26699:18:17:94:302:112:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Recovery of normal loans and advances 
13:530:26737:17:0:94:201:95:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Recovery of NPAs 
14:531:26756:0:16:94:526:757:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Compromise  should  be  a  negotiated  settlement  under  which  banks  should  ensure 
14:532:26844:16:18:94:352:741:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recovery of maximum dues with minimum expenses. 
14:533:26891:18:16:94:526:723:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Proper  distinction  needs  to  be  made  between  willful  defaulters  and  borrowers  who 
14:534:26984:16:18:94:349:707:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defaulted due to circumstances beyond their control. 
14:535:27036:18:16:94:526:689:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: In settlement cases the banks should promptly recycle the fund with advantage instead 
14:536:27123:16:17:94:450:673:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of resorting to expensive recovery proceedings spread over a long period.

14:538:27196:16:17:94:526:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:When  the  bank  is  entering  into  compromise  settlement  the  following  points  need  to  be 
14:539:27294:17:17:94:160:623:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remembered: 
14:540:27305:17:18:94:305:606:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Maximum recovery with minimum cost. 
14:541:27341:18:16:94:526:588:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Distinction  needs to be made between willful defaulters and defaulters on account of 
14:542:27428:16:18:94:244:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conditions beyond their scope. 
14:543:27458:18:16:94:526:554:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Where   security   is available,   proper   weightage   needs   to   be   given   location, 
14:544:27551:16:18:94:312:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:marketability conditions, possession thereof. 
14:545:27596:18:16:94:526:520:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Fund  recycling  to  maximum  advantage  instead  of  opting  for  lengthy,  expensive 
14:546:27684:16:18:94:181:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recovery process. 
14:547:27701:18:16:94:526:486:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: All compromise proposals should be reported to the next higher authority for scrutiny 
14:548:27788:16:18:94:274:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:so as to prevent fraudulent activities. 
14:549:27827:18:16:94:526:452:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Before   presenting   the   compromise   proposal   before   the   Settlement   Advisory 
14:550:27917:16:18:94:422:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:committee, the proposal needs to be examined by the top executive. 
14:551:27983:18:16:94:526:418:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Special  recovery  cells  needs  to  be  set  up  to  monitor  recovery  and  prevent  fresh 
14:552:28077:16:18:94:191:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generation of NPA. 
14:553:28095:18:16:94:526:384:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Adequate  attention  should  be  given  and  appropriate  action  initiated  for  upgrading 
14:554:28188:16:17:94:276:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:substandard assets to standard assets. 
14:555:28226:17:16:72:75:351:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:556:28226:16:17:72:526:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As a Preventive measure there should have proper screening before disbursement of the 
14:557:28312:17:17:72:252:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loans and surveillance such as:      
14:558:28348:17:18:94:234:301:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To select right borrowers. 
14:559:28375:18:17:94:260:283:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To identify viability of project. 
14:560:28409:17:18:94:267:266:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To ascertain credit environment. 
14:561:28442:18:17:94:215:248:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To assess credit need. 
14:562:28465:17:17:94:239:231:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To timely supply of credit. 
14:563:28493:17:18:94:243:214:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To obtain proper securities. 
14:564:28522:18:17:94:287:196:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To prevent defective documentation. 
14:565:28558:17:17:94:252:179:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: To maintain credit discipline. 
14:566:28589:17:16:94:97:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:567:28589:16:17:72:526:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Recovery of credit largely depends on effective follow-up. By supervision we mean to have a 
14:568:28681:17:16:72:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proper control over the borrowers operation to ensure the end-use of funds. Supervision keeps 
14:569:28775:16:17:72:526:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:track of  the  end-use  of  fund  lent.  Supervision  and  follow-up  function  in  banks  has  assumed 
14:570:28879:17:17:72:455:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considerable significance due to increasing trend of sickness in industrial units.

15:572:28963:0:16:72:146:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan Review: 
15:573:28975:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan review  is  not luxury  but necessary  for a sound  bank  lending program. The structure of 
15:574:29072:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:credit  review  process would  have  to  periodically  examine  the  assumptions  on  which  every 
15:575:29171:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan  was  appraised  and  granted,  and  whether  these  assumptions  have  changed  materially 
15:576:29268:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enough to endanger the debt-servicing capacity of the borrower. Typically, all or most of the 
15:577:29362:16:17:72:399:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:following aspects are reviewed for every loan till it is repaid in full. 
15:578:29434:17:18:72:75:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:579:29434:18:16:90:526:641:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Developments  in the economy that  may  have an  impact on the  industry  in which the 
15:580:29522:16:18:90:183:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:borrower operates. 
15:581:29540:18:17:90:452:607:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Developments in the industry or sector in which the borrower operates. 
15:582:29611:17:17:90:405:590:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The borrower‟s payment record in this and other loans so far. 
15:583:29673:17:18:90:450:573:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:  The quality, condition and value of the prime and collateral securities. 
15:584:29746:18:16:90:526:555:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The  completeness  of  loan  documentation,  and  developments  in  law  governing  the 
15:585:29835:16:18:90:270:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instruments effecting credit delivery. 
15:586:29873:18:16:90:526:521:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Some  borrowers  may  default  on  debt  service  due  to  factors  out  of  their  control.  In 
15:587:29971:16:17:90:526:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:such cases, the bank may have to reschedule the debt requirements and alter some of the 
15:588:30059:17:16:90:207:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:covenants, if necessary. 
15:589:30083:16:17:72:75:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:590:30083:17:16:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Central  banks  of  most  countries  have  devised  country-specific  definitions  and  control 
15:591:30179:16:17:72:526:439:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:systems to tackle „sick‟ borrowers. There are three categories of sickness that could afflict 
15:592:30273:17:17:72:127:422:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:borrowers: 
15:593:30283:17:16:94:525:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a) Sickness  at  birth- the  project  itself  has  become  infeasible  either  due  to  faculty 
15:594:30377:16:17:94:294:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assumptions or a change in environment. 
15:595:30416:17:16:94:479:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:b) Induced sickness- caused by management in competencies or willful default. 
15:596:30491:16:17:94:526:356:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:c) Genuine   sickness-where   the   circumstances   leading   to   sickness   are   beyond   the 
15:597:30587:17:16:94:525:339:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:borrower‟s control, and has happened in spite of the borrowers sincere efforts to avert 
15:598:30675:16:17:94:159:323:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the situation. 
15:599:30689:17:17:72:75:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:600:30689:17:17:72:227:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Key Steps for Loan Workout: 
15:601:30716:17:17:98:526:272:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Always  keep  the  goal  of  loan  workouts  firmly  in  mind:  to  maximize  the  banks 
15:602:30806:17:17:98:281:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:chances for full recovery of its funds. 
15:603:30845:17:17:98:526:238:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The  repaid  detection  and  reporting  of  any  problems  with  a  loan  are  essential;  delay 
15:604:30943:17:17:98:291:221:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:often worsens a problem loan situation. 
15:605:30982:17:17:98:526:204:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Keep  the  loan  workouts  responsibility  separate  from  the  lending  function  to  avoid 
15:606:31076:17:17:98:324:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possible conflicts of interest for the loan offer. 
15:607:31126:17:17:98:526:170:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Bank  workout  specialists  should  confer  with  the  troubled  customer  quickly  on 
15:608:31214:17:16:98:526:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possible  options,  especially  for  cutting  expenses,  increasing cash  flow,  and  improving 
15:609:31309:16:18:98:203:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management control. 
15:610:31328:18:16:98:526:119:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Develop  a  preliminary  plan  of  action  after  determining  the  banks  risk  exposure  and 
15:611:31424:16:17:98:525:103:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:sufficiency of loan documents especially any claims against the customer‟s collateral 
15:612:31510:17:0:98:257:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:other than that held by the bank. 
16:613:31545:0:16:98:525:757:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Estimate  what  resources  are  available  to  collect  the  trouble  loan  including  the 
16:614:31637:16:17:98:346:741:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimated liquidation values of assets and deposits. 
16:615:31689:17:16:72:75:724:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
16:616:31689:16:18:72:246:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan review helps in the following: 
16:617:31724:18:17:98:403:690:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Continuously checking if the loan policy is being adhered to. 
16:618:31786:17:18:98:383:673:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Identifying problem accounts even at the incipient stage. 
16:619:31844:18:16:98:324:655:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Assessing the bank‟s exposure to credit risk.

16:621:31890:17:14:72:468:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:22..22  Objectives and Importance’s of Loan Classification and Provisioning::  
16:622:31965:14:13:72:75:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  
16:623:31965:13:17:72:526:595:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:According to BRPD Circular No. 19 dated December 27, 2012, Bangladesh Bank has, over 
16:624:32050:17:16:72:526:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the last several years, positioned the banks on a path towards higher regulatory capital ratios 
16:625:32146:16:17:72:526:562:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:and a more precise calculation of each individual bank‟s need for capital, through a gradual 
16:626:32239:17:16:72:526:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implementation of internationally recognized capital standards. The enforcement of a stricter 
16:627:32333:16:17:72:526:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regulatory  capital  regime  also  requires  measures  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  financial  data 
16:628:32436:17:17:72:526:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which   are  used   internally,  stated  in  the  audited   financial   statements  and  reported  to 
16:629:32538:17:16:72:527:495:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:Bangladesh  Bank  as  per  rules.  For  both  the  banks  managerial  and  Bangladesh  Bank‟s 
16:630:32632:16:17:72:526:479:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:supervisory  purposes,  as  well  as  for  accurate  valuation  of  a  bank‟s  capital  in  all  of  its 
16:631:32737:17:16:72:216:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial reports is necessary. 
16:632:32768:16:14:72:75:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
16:633:32768:14:17:72:526:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:An accurate valuation of capital relies,  in turn, on an accurate valuation of assets. Loan  loss 
16:634:32866:17:16:72:526:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning – the recognition that some or all of the required payments on a loan may never 
16:635:32958:16:17:72:525:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be  made – is  the  single  most  important  aspect  of  asset  valuation  to  bankers  and  bank 
16:636:33055:17:16:72:526:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supervisors. It is  important because  loans typically  make up 50% or  more of the total assets 
16:637:33152:16:17:72:525:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the bank. Basel II and Basel III devote a great deal of attention to the distinction between 
16:638:33248:17:17:72:526:349:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:“expected  losses” and  “unexpected  losses” on the  bank‟s  loan portfolio. The purpose of 
16:639:33340:17:16:72:527:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning is to take into account expected losses. Expected losses can be assigned to loans 
16:640:33435:16:17:72:526:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:based on a loan classification system, which has been utilized in Bangladesh for many years 
16:641:33527:17:16:72:261:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and is being updated with this circular. 
16:642:33567:16:17:72:75:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
16:643:33567:17:16:72:526:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh  Bank  also  wishes  to  stress  that  it  is  the  responsibility  of  bank  management  to 
16:644:33671:16:17:72:525:250:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adopt  and  implement  proper  accounting  and  reporting,  and  that  correct  classification  and 
16:645:33771:17:16:72:526:233:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning  is  a  part  of  that  responsibility.  Loan  classification  and  provisioning  must  be  a 
16:646:33878:16:17:72:526:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:key  component of  a  regular  internal  loan  review  process that  looks  at the  current  likelihood 
16:647:33982:17:17:72:526:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  the borrower  will  repay.  The  value  of  the  formed  allowance  that  results  from  the 
16:648:34081:17:16:72:491:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning process should reflect all expected losses resulting from credit exposures. 
16:649:34169:16:17:72:75:167:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
16:650:34169:17:16:72:526:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh  Bank  has  established  requirements  for  general  loan  loss  provisions,  in  certain 
16:651:34269:16:17:72:526:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percentages,  for  certain  categories  of  loans  that  are  unclassified  or  in  the  Special  Mention 
16:652:34375:17:16:72:526:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Account.  As  the  name  suggests,  general  provisions  are  assigned  to  take  into  account  the 
16:653:34476:16:17:72:526:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expected  losses  on  pools  of  loans  that  are  thought  to  have  similar  characteristics.  The 
16:654:34577:17:0:72:526:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics  of  each  individual  loan  are  not  analyzed.  Put  differently,  it  is  not  known  or 
17:655:34687:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:even  assumed which  loan or  loans  in the pool are going to result  in  loan  losses;  it  is simply 
17:656:34790:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:taken  as  given  that  in  such  large  pools,  even  those  currently  unclassified,  there  will 
17:657:34890:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:undoubtedly be individual loans that in the future will not be repaid. Ideally, the percentages 
17:658:34986:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of provision that are applied to each pool are determined based on historical  loss experience 
17:659:35081:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of similar  loan pools. Banks  are encouraged to calculate these  historical  loss experiences on 
17:660:35179:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  loan  pools  for  which  Bangladesh  Bank  has  indicated  general  provision  percentages,  and 
17:661:35281:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:use  these  data  if  they  result  in  higher  provisions  than  are  required  in  this  circular.  Because 
17:662:35391:17:16:72:525:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:general provisions are not formed based on expectations of loss on any individual loan, they 
17:663:35484:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are allowed to be included in the calculation of Tier 2 capital, subject to some restrictions. In 
17:664:35582:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contrast,  specific  provisions  (established  on   loans  that  are  classified  as Sub-standard, 
17:665:35681:16:17:72:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Doubtful  or  Bad/Loss)  are  set  up  on  a  loan-by-loan  basis  after  careful  analysis  of  each 
17:666:35783:17:16:72:526:576:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:individual loan‟s probability of repayment. For loans placed into any of these classification 
17:667:35877:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:categories, weaknesses have been identified that cast doubt on the borrower‟s ability or intent 
17:668:35973:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to make all contractual payments in a timely manner. For this reason, specific provisions are 
17:669:36067:17:16:72:370:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not allowed to be included in the calculation of Tier 2 capital.

17:671:36131:17:16:72:525:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan  classification  is  the  act  of  grouping  or  arranging  of  loans  and  advances  according  to 
17:672:36236:16:17:72:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their  status  like  unclassified,  sub-standard,  doubtful  and  bad  or  loss  based  on  given  criteria. 
17:673:36345:17:16:72:526:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Provisioning  means  setting  aside  certain  fund  from  the  current  year  profit  against  possible 
17:674:36449:16:17:72:525:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan   losses.   In   Bangladesh,   Bangladesh   bank   prescribes   the   loan   classification   and 
17:675:36552:17:17:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning criteria through BRPD Circular No. - 1 dated June 05, 2006; BRPD Circular 
17:676:36638:17:16:72:526:410:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:No. -7  June  14,  2012;  BRPD  Circular  No.-14  dated  September  23,  2012  and  BRPD 
17:677:36727:16:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Circular No. 19 dated December 27, 2012. As  part of this program, a  new  system of  loan 
17:678:36818:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classification  and  provisioning  against  potential  loan  losses  for  advances  was  introduced  in 
17:679:36922:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:November 1989. Before 1989 no specific guidelines were followed by the commercial banks 
17:680:37010:17:16:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  this  purpose.  This  process  is continued  to  date.  The  title  of  the  circular  was “Master 
17:681:37114:16:17:72:526:328:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman:Circular:  Loan  Classification  and  Provisioning”. The  introduction  of  this  program  was 
17:682:37209:17:16:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aimed at to bring loan loss provisioning and classification in line with international standards 
17:683:37306:16:17:72:171:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by the end of 2012.  
17:684:37326:17:17:72:75:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
17:685:37326:17:16:72:523:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan  classification  means  giving  each  and  every  loan  case  a  status  like  unclassified,  sub-
17:686:37429:16:17:72:526:245:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:standard, doubtful and bad or loss through verification of borrowers‟ repayment performance 
17:687:37521:17:16:72:526:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on a particular date while provisioning means setting aside fund from the profit (profit before 
17:688:37617:16:17:72:526:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provision and taxes) against possible loan loss. This is obviously essential for determining the 
17:689:37714:17:16:72:526:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial health and efficiency of the banking sector. Besides, a proper loan classification and 
17:690:37811:16:17:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning system  ensures credibility of the  financial system that  in turn restores trust and 
17:691:37910:17:17:72:279:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confidence in the minds of the depositors.  
17:692:37953:17:16:72:75:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
17:693:37953:16:17:72:526:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan  classification  makes  two  pronged  attacks  on  the  activities  of  banks. First, interests 
17:694:38054:17:16:72:526:112:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:applied on loans are not taken into account because such interests are to be taken into account 
17:695:38150:16:17:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only  on  its  realization. Second, banks  have  to  make  provisions  on  classified  loans as  per 
17:696:38251:17:0:72:523:79:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:guidelines by Bangladesh Bank from out of the income earned by them on performing loans.  
18:697:38340:0:17:72:248:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Objectives of Loan Classification: 
18:698:38374:17:18:94:251:741:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Find out net-worth of a bank. 
18:699:38404:18:17:94:347:723:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Help for assessing financial soundness of a bank. 
18:700:38454:17:18:94:477:706:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Help for determining required provision and the amount of interest suspense 
18:701:38530:18:16:94:526:688:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Put  the  bank  on  sound  footing  in  order  to  develop  sound  banking  practice  in 
18:702:38620:16:16:94:156:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh.

18:704:38631:17:17:72:254:639:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Importance of Loan Classification: 
18:705:38665:17:18:94:234:622:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Strength credit discipline, 
18:706:38693:18:17:94:287:604:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Improve loan recovery positions and 
18:707:38729:17:17:94:254:587:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Make future planning of loan

18:709:38759:17:16:72:273:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.3 Categories of Loans and Advances: 
18:710:38796:16:17:72:526:537:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For  the  purpose  of  loan  classification,  loan  and  advances  have  been  grouped  into  four 
18:711:38895:17:16:72:127:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:categories: 
18:712:38906:16:17:72:75:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
18:713:38906:17:16:72:526:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(a) Continuous loan: The loan which is sanctioned without specific repayment  schedule 
18:714:38991:16:17:72:526:471:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:but there is a specific expiry date for repayment and credit limit can be treated as continuous 
18:715:39087:17:17:72:316:454:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan. For examples: O/D, CC, PC, LIM, LTR, etc. 
18:716:39134:17:16:72:75:437:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
18:717:39134:16:16:72:526:421:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(b) Demand Loan: When loan is sanctioned on the basis of repayment depends upon the 
18:718:39216:16:17:72:526:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:demand  of  bank  can  be  treated  as  demand  loan.  Contingent  or  other  liabilities  which  are 
18:719:39318:17:17:72:526:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:converted into forced loan are also to be treated as demand loan. For examples: Forced LIM, 
18:720:39410:17:16:72:174:371:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:PAD, FBP, IBP, etc.

18:722:39429:14:16:72:525:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(c) Term Loan: The  loan which  has a specific  expiry date for repayment and  for which 
18:723:39517:16:17:72:526:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:repayment is schedule through specific repayment schedule is treated as fixed term loan. For 
18:724:39610:17:17:72:330:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:example: Project finance, industrial finance, and tec.  
18:725:39665:17:14:72:75:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
18:726:39665:14:16:72:526:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(d) Short-Term   Agricultural   Credit and   Micro-Credit: Short-Term   Agricultural 
18:727:39748:16:17:72:526:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Credit means the credit which is enlisted as short term credit under the annual credit program 
18:728:39843:17:16:72:526:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:announced  by  Agricultural  Credit  Department  of  Bangladesh  bank.  Credit  in  agriculture 
18:729:39939:16:17:72:523:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector repayable within 12 months is also included in this category. On the other hand, Short-

18:734:40309:17:16:72:250:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:22..44      Basis for Loan Classification: 
18:735:40345:16:16:72:526:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:If  any  uncertainty  or  doubt  arises  in  respect  of  recovery  of  any  Continuous  Loan,  Demand 
18:736:40448:16:17:72:526:112:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan  or  Fixed  Term  Loan,  the  same  will  have  to  be  classified  on  the basis  of  qualitative 
18:737:40552:17:16:72:526:95:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:judgement be it classifiable or not on the basis of objective criteria. If any situational changes 
18:738:40651:16:0:72:526:79:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:occur  in  the  stipulations  in  terms  of  which  the  loan  was  extended  or  if  the  capital  of  the 
19:739:40761:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:borrower is impaired due to adverse conditions or if the value of the collateral decreases or if 
19:740:40858:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the recovery of the loan becomes uncertain due to any other unfavourable situation, the loan 
19:741:40951:17:16:72:380:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will have to be classified on the basis of qualitative judgement . 
19:742:41017:16:17:72:75:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
19:743:41017:17:16:72:525:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Despite the probability of any  loan being affected due to the reasons stated above or for any 
19:744:41112:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:other reasons, if there is any hope for change of the existing condition by resorting to proper 
19:745:41208:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:steps, the loan, on the basis of qualitative judgement, will be classified as 'Sub-standard '. But 
19:746:41307:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:even after resorting to proper steps, there exists  no certainty of total recovery of the  loan,  it 
19:747:41407:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will  be  classified  as  '  Doubtful  '  and  even  after  exerting  the  all-out  efforts,  there  exists  no 
19:748:41519:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:chance of recovery, it will be classified as ' Bad/Loss ' on the basis of qualitative judgement. 
19:749:41616:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For incorporating qualitative judgment, banks must focus on the likelihood that the borrower 
19:750:41709:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will repay  all amounts due  in a timely  manner, using their own  judgment and the  following

22:883:48393:16:17:72:526:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  some cases, a  legitimate banking practice  may  allow  for the renewal of a continuous  loan

22:885:48596:16:17:72:526:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:circumstances  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  borrower  and  do  not  signify  that  the

22:888:48886:16:17:72:526:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sometimes  result  in  an  overstatement  of  capital,  when  loans  that  have  a  low  probability  of

25:1122:56432:16:11:72:203:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.7 Review of Literature: 
25:1123:56457:11:14:72:74:350:6:Times New Roman:6:Times New Roman: 
25:1124:56457:14:16:72:525:336:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Nonperforming loans (“NPLs”) refer  to  those  financial  assets  from  which  banks  no  longer 
25:1125:56554:16:17:72:523:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:receive   interest   and/or   installment   payments   as   scheduled.   They   are   known   as   non-
25:1126:56657:17:17:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:performing because the loan ceases to “perform” or generate income for the bank. According 
25:1127:56748:17:16:72:525:286:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:to  Choudhury  et  al.  (2002),  the  nonperforming  loan  is  not  a  “uniclass”  but  rather  a 
25:1128:56846:16:17:72:526:270:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:“multiclass” concept, which means that NPLs can be classified into different varieties usually 
25:1129:56941:17:16:72:526:253:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:based on the “length of overdue” of the said loans. NPLs are viewed as a typical byproduct of 
25:1130:57035:16:17:72:525:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial  crisis:  they  are  not  a  main  product of  the  lending  function  but  rather  an  accidental 
25:1131:57144:17:16:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:occurrence of the lending process, one that has enormous potential to deepen the severity and 
25:1132:57238:16:17:72:526:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration of financial crisis and to complicate macroeconomic management (Woo, 2000). This 
25:1133:57328:17:17:72:526:187:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:is  because NPLs can bring down  investors‟ confidence  in the  banking system, piling up 
25:1134:57418:17:16:72:526:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unproductive economic resources even though depreciations are taken care of, and impeding 
25:1135:57508:16:17:72:526:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the resource allocation process. In a bank-centered financial system, NPLs can further thwart 
25:1136:57602:17:16:72:526:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic recovery by shrinking operating margin and eroding the capital base of the banks to 
25:1137:57695:16:17:72:526:121:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:advance new loans. This is sometimes referred to as “credit crunch” (Bernanke et al., 1991). 
25:1138:57788:17:0:72:526:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  addition,  NPLs,  if  created  by  the  borrowers  willingly  and  left  unresolved,  might  act  as  a 
26:1139:57898:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contagious financial malaise by driving good borrowers out of the financial market.1 Further, 
26:1140:57991:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Muniappan  (2002)  argues  that  a  bank  with  high  level  of  NPLs  is  forced  to  incur  carrying 
26:1141:58094:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costs on non-income yielding assets that not only strike at profitability but also at the capital 
26:1142:58192:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adequacy  of  a  bank,  and  in  consequence,  the  bank  faces  difficulties  in  augmenting  capital 
26:1143:58295:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources. Bonin and Huang (2001) also state that the probability of banking crises increases 
26:1144:58389:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:if financial risk is not eliminated quickly. Such crises not only lower living standards but can 
26:1145:58486:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also  eliminate  many  of  the  achievements  of  economic  reform  overnight.  The  economic  and 
26:1146:58585:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial  implications  of  NPLs  in  a  bank-centered  financial  economy can  be  best  explained

26:1171:58816:16:17:72:526:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Having such a system, Bangladesh needs to study the condition of NPLs on a routine basis in 
26:1172:58908:17:16:72:526:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:order to augment investible capital  in the productive  sectors as well  as to ensure sustainable

26:1176:59115:17:17:72:526:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:were   cultivated   during   the   early   stage   of   the   liberation   period   (1972-1981),   by   the 
26:1177:59223:17:16:72:526:181:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:government‟s “expansion of credit” policies on the one hand and a feeble and infirm banking

26:1179:59409:17:16:72:526:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:et  al.  (2000)  argue  that  the  expansion  of  credit  policy  during  the  early  stage  of  liberation, 
26:1180:59518:16:24:72:526:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which was directed to disbursement of credit on relatively  easier terms, did actually  expand

27:1216:60239:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defaulters  in the  background who, later on, diminished the  financial  health of  banks through 
27:1217:60337:17:16:72:526:725:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:the  “sick  industry  syndrome”.2 Islam  et  al.  (1999)  add  that  despite  the  liberalizing  and 
27:1218:60437:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privatizing  of  the  banking  sectors  in  the  1980s  with  a  view  to  increasing  efficiency  and 
27:1219:60540:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competition, the robustness of the credit environment deteriorated further because of the lack 
27:1220:60635:16:17:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:of effective lenders‟ recourse on borrowers. Choudhury et al. (1999) find that Government

27:1223:60917:16:17:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:judgments) regarding “loan classification and provisioning”3, and the use of accrual policies 
27:1224:61011:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  accounting  for  recording  interest  income  of  NPLs  resulted  in  malignment  of  the  credit

27:1227:61161:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  the  1990s,  however,  a  broad  based  financial  measure  was  undertaken  in  the  name  of 
27:1228:61260:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:FSRP4, enlisting the help of World Bank to restore financial discipline to the country.  Since 
27:1229:61355:17:16:72:526:526:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:then,  the  banking  sector  has  adopted  “prudential  norms”  for  loan  classification  and 
27:1230:61450:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning.  Other  laws,  regulations  and  instruments  such  as  loan  ledger  account,  lending 
27:1231:61552:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:risk  analysis  manual,  performance  planning  system,  interest  rate  deregulation,  the  Money 
27:1232:61651:16:17:72:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Loan Court Act 1990 have also been enacted to promote sound, robust and resilient banking 
27:1233:61741:17:16:72:526:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:practice. Surprisingly, even after so many measures, the banking system of Bangladesh is yet 
27:1234:61834:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to free itself from the grip of the NPL debacle. The question thus arises, what are the reasons 
27:1235:61930:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behind  such  a  large proportion of  nonperforming  loans  in the  economy of Bangladesh? Is  it 
27:1236:62028:16:17:72:526:411:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:because of “flexibility in defining NPLs” or lack of effective “recovery strategies” on the part 
27:1237:62125:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the  banks?   Alternatively,   is   it  due  to  poor  enforcement  status  of   laws  related  to 
27:1238:62228:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nonperforming loans? The present study has concentrated on the above issues mainly with a 
27:1239:62318:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:view to assisting policymakers to formulate concrete measures regarding sound management

27:1245:62611:17:16:72:525:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on the outstanding balance of the classified loans less the amount of Interest Suspense and the

27:1251:62939:7:16:72:525:159:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2 This  phenomenon  was  observed  in  the  mid-1980s.  This  is  not  a  sunset  industry  but  created  by  borrowers 
27:1252:63058:16:7:72:114:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:willfully.  
27:1253:63069:7:16:72:526:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:3 Loan classification refers to the process banks use to review their loan portfolios and assign loans to categories 
27:1254:63185:16:12:72:526:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:or  grades  based  on  the  perceived  risk  and  other  relevant  characteristics  of  the  loans  (Finance  Forum,  2002). 
27:1255:63310:12:11:72:75:108:10:Times New Roman:6:Times New Roman:Provisioning is a method that banks use to set aside funds against possible loan loss. 4

28:1260:63539:16:17:72:505:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For all other eligible collaterals, the provision will be maintained at the stated rates on the 
28:1261:63635:17:16:72:378:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:balance calculated as the greater of the following two amounts: 
28:1262:63698:16:17:72:498:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:i. outstanding balance of the classified loan less the amount of Interest Suspense and the 
28:1263:63787:17:16:72:224:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:value of eligible collateral; and 
28:1264:63820:16:17:72:296:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ii. 15% of the outstanding balance of the loan.

28:1266:63866:17:16:72:340:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.8.2 Accounting of the Interest of Classified Loans: 
28:1267:63919:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:If any loan or advance is classified as 'Sub-standard' and 'Doubtful', interest accrued on such 
28:1268:64015:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan  will  be  credited  to  Interest  Suspense  Account,  instead  of  crediting  the  same  to  Income 
28:1269:64121:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Account.  In  case  of  rescheduled  loans  the  unrealized  interest,  if  any,  will  be  credited  to 
28:1270:64226:17:16:72:447:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Interest Suspense Account, instead of crediting the same to Income Account.  
28:1271:64302:16:17:72:75:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
28:1272:64302:17:17:72:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  soon  as  any  loan  or  advance  is  classified  as  'Bad/Loss',  charging  of  interest  in  the  same 
28:1273:64411:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:account  will  cease.  In  case  of  filing  a  law-suit  for  recovery  of  such  loan,  interest  for  the 
28:1274:64520:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period till filing of the suit can be charged in the loan account in order to file the same for the 
28:1275:64620:17:16:72:525:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount  of  principal  plus  interest.  But  interest  thus  charged  in  the  loan  account  has  to  be 
28:1276:64726:16:17:72:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:preserved  in  the  'Interest  Suspense'  account.  If  any  interest  is  charged  on  any  'Bad/Loss' 
28:1277:64830:17:16:72:526:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:account  for  any  other  special  reason,  the  same  will  be  preserved  in  the  'Interest  Suspense' 
28:1278:64936:16:17:72:525:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:account. If  classified  loan  or  part  of  it  is  recovered  i.e.,  real  deposit  is  effected  in  the  loan 
28:1279:65049:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:account,  first  the  interest  charged  and  accrued  but  not  charged  is  to  be  recovered  from  the 
28:1280:65156:16:17:72:342:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:said deposit and the principal to be adjusted afterwards. 
28:1281:65213:17:17:72:75:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
28:1282:65213:17:16:72:525:377:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“Making provision  stemmed  from  the  credit  transactions  such  as  credit  sales.  Sales  on  any 
28:1283:65315:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:basis  other  than  for  cash  make  possible  the  subsequent  failure  to  collect  the  account.  An 
28:1284:65419:17:16:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uncollectable account receivable is a loss of revenue that requires, through proper entry in the 
28:1285:65516:16:17:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accounts,  a  decrease  in  the  asset  accounts  receivable  and  related  decrease  in  income  and 
28:1286:65618:17:16:72:526:311:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:stockholders‟ equity. Recording the bad debt expense recognizes the loss in revenue and the 
28:1287:65710:16:17:72:526:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decrease  in  income.  Of  the  two  methods  of  recording  uncollectible  accounts  receivable,  the 
28:1288:65813:17:17:72:526:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:allowances  method  is  appropriate  in  situation  where  it  is  probable  that  an  asset  has  been 
28:1289:65917:17:16:72:526:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impaired and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated since the collectability 
28:1290:66011:16:17:72:526:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of receivables is considered a loss contingency. A receivable is a prospective cash inflow, and 
28:1291:66106:17:16:72:525:228:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:the probability of its collection must be considered in valuing this inflow (Kieso et al, 2001).” 
28:1292:66203:16:17:72:75:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
28:1293:66203:17:16:72:526:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:On the other hand, an uncollectable  loan/advance  for the banking  business  is  not only a  loss 
28:1294:66302:16:17:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  revenue,  but  also  a  loss  of  capital.  The  uncollectible  interest  receivable  is  the  loss  of 
28:1295:66410:17:17:72:526:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revenue  and  the  uncollectable  principal  is  the  loss  of  capital.  An  analogy  between  the 
28:1296:66510:17:16:72:458:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uncollectable account receivable and the uncollectable interest can be drawn as: 
28:1297:66590:16:17:72:75:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
28:1298:66590:17:16:111:486:112:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sales price= Cost+ Mark up fir risk premium and profit expectation (spread) 
28:1299:66664:16:0:297:300:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
29:1300:66666:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:So, the provision against the  interest receivable  can  be treated as a normal  business expense 
29:1301:66764:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:since it reflects the probable loss of revenue. The conflict may arise that the nature of banking 
29:1302:66861:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:business is different from the nature of other business and banks are not  utilizing the capital 
29:1303:66958:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:directly to generate revenue-generating goods whereas other business do. But the banks take 
29:1304:67050:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the collateral against the  loans and advances  mainly to create pressure  for timely repayment 
29:1305:67146:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of loans and advances. From this it is evident that the loss of a capital is the fault of either of 
29:1306:67246:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  legal  system  or  of  the  political  system  of  management  system  but  neither  of  the 
29:1307:67344:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shareholders nor the depositors. Under protectionist banking systems like Bangladesh there is 
29:1308:67438:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:less chance that the depositors will be deprived in case of a bank failure. So, the loss is of the 
29:1309:67537:17:16:72:184:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:owners (shareholders). 
29:1310:67559:16:17:72:75:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
29:1311:67559:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Now a day the bank managers of Bangladesh deduct the amount of interest suspended and the 
29:1312:67649:16:17:72:525:560:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:value of “eligible securities”5 from the outstanding amount in order to determine the base for 
29:1313:67743:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provisioning  to  NPLs.  For  unclassified  loans,  however,  they  keep  a  general  provision  (1%) 
29:1314:67845:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:against the outstanding amount and include it in the capital to determine the capital adequacy 
29:1315:67940:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the bank (at present 9%). With regard to income recognition, as the banking sector follows

29:1317:68133:16:17:72:525:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interest  on  substandard  and  doubtful  loans  as  income  for  the  bank,  but  rather  keep  it 
29:1318:68233:17:16:72:523:460:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:separately in an “interest suspense account”. However, if any amount is received against sub-
29:1319:68326:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:standard  and  doubtful  loans,  the  said  amount  is  deducted  from  the  total  interest  suspense 
29:1320:68429:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount.  In  the  case  of  a  bad/loss  loan,  the  interest  on  such  loan  is  also  kept  in  the  interest

29:1322:68649:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:doubtful  loans, this  interest is also excluded  from the  income of the  bank. These accounting

30:1344:69291:17:11:72:212:699:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3.1 Nature of the Problem: 
30:1345:69317:11:12:72:74:688:6:Times New Roman:6:Times New Roman: 
30:1346:69317:12:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  basic  function  of  commercial  banks  is  financial  intermediation  between  savers  and 
30:1347:69414:17:16:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:borrowers.  Banks  are  financial  intermediaries  that  mobilize  funds  from  surplus  economic 
30:1348:69512:16:17:72:526:643:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:units and allocate those funds to deficit economic units. Bank mobilizes fund mainly through 
30:1349:69605:17:16:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:collecting  deposits  and  allocate  those  funds  by  providing  loans.  Bank  credit  is  the  principal 
30:1350:69712:16:17:72:526:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sources  of  loanable  fund  for  millions  of  households  and  the  government.  Agricultural, 
30:1351:69809:17:16:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:commercial,  and  industrial  activities  of  a  nation  are  often  financed  by  bank  credit.  Without 
30:1352:69915:16:17:72:526:577:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adequate financing there can  be  no growth or  maintenance of stable output.  Thus, the bank 
30:1353:70009:17:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:credit  influences  total  macroeconomic  environment  by  affecting  money  supply,  investment, 
30:1354:70107:17:16:72:222:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:total output, and employment.  
30:1355:70137:16:17:72:291:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                                         
30:1356:70209:17:16:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This  process  is  an  ongoing  one  that  begins  when  a  loan  application  is  made  and  screened 
30:1357:70312:16:17:72:526:494:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(origination)  and  continues  until  the   loan   is   repaid.   As  unpaid   loans   are   incomplete 
30:1358:70416:17:16:72:527:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transactions  for  lenders  this  incomplete  transaction  will  not  add  any  value  rather  destroy it. 
30:1359:70523:16:18:72:516:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:And this unpaid or default loan causes constraints on the process of economic development.

30:1363:70644:13:17:72:526:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  banking  remains  the  main  intermediary  vehicle  of  harnessing  investible  capital  for 
30:1364:70741:17:17:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accelerating  the  growth  of  the  productive sectors  in  Bangladesh,  the  continuing  crisis  of 
30:1365:70841:17:16:72:526:369:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accumulation  of  non-performing  and  defaulted  bank  loans  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  most 
30:1366:70941:16:17:72:526:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:serious constraints in the path of economic development of our country. Now we will discuss 
30:1367:71033:17:16:72:417:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:how the loan default problem has emerged in our country by year wise.

30:1371:71128:14:16:72:526:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Before the liberalization of Bangladesh , the economic development policies of Pakistan was 
30:1372:71220:16:17:72:525:262:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:centered  around  growth –oriented „modernization paradigm ‟,wherein industrialization was 
30:1373:71311:17:16:72:525:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assigned  the  top  priority  in  the  allocation  of  investible  funds  from  the  institutional  credit 
30:1374:71418:16:17:72:527:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sources  in  the  name  of  providing  employment  to  the  vast  multitude  of  the  so-called 
30:1375:71514:17:16:72:526:212:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:„disguisedly  unemployed  labour  force  ‟.This  attempt  of  development  of  an  industrial 
30:1376:71608:16:17:72:526:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:entrepreneurial  class  in  Pakistan  miserably  failed  to  provide  adequate  quantum  of  formal 
30:1377:71708:17:16:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:industrial  employment  even  in  West  Pakistan.  This  is  regarded  as  one  of  the  main  factors 
30:1378:71811:16:17:72:526:163:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:behind the rapid growth of „‟regional economic disparity‟‟ between the two Pakistan.  Then 
30:1379:71902:17:17:72:526:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banking  was  blamed  as  a  principal  mechanism  of  siphoning –off  capital  from  the  East 
30:1380:71998:17:16:72:526:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Pakistan and, therefore, nationalization of the banks and insurance companies, became one of

31:1386:72241:13:16:72:526:736:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:After the liberation of Bangladesh, the Awami League Government‟s decision to nationalize 
31:1387:72331:16:17:72:526:720:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  banks  and  insurance  companies  operating  in  Bangladesh  should  be  considered  a  logical 
31:1388:72432:17:16:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:step but the task of re-organization of the nationalized banks in the chaotic, war-ravaged and 
31:1389:72526:16:17:72:526:687:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crisis-ridden  post-liberation  years  and  a  very  rapid  expansion  of  banking  network  in  rural 
31:1390:72629:17:17:72:526:670:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh   created  some  problems   for  the   banking   sector.  There  was   no  time after 
31:1391:72725:17:16:72:526:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nationalization  as the  most  corrupt,  indisciplined,  overmanned,  and  mismanaged  concerns 
31:1392:72820:16:17:72:526:637:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mired  in  a  sea  of  recurrent  losses  in  the  backdrop  of  the  political  and  administrative 
31:1393:72921:17:16:72:281:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inexperience of the post liberation regime.

31:1395:72965:17:16:72:525:587:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  this  scenario,  the  nationalized  banks  were  involved  in  two  sorts  of  pressure  situations, 
31:1396:73070:16:17:72:526:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:firstly, the almost insatiable demand  for credit from the  loss  making state-owned enterprises 
31:1397:73167:17:17:72:526:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:kept the  banks under constant pressure due to a shortage of adequate  liquidity and  secondly 
31:1398:73262:17:16:72:525:537:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:the  newly emerging so called “briefcase business man” with connection with politics and 
31:1399:73351:16:17:72:526:521:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:politicians,  top  bureaucrats  and  top  bankers,  and  retired  military  and  civil  bureaucrats  were 
31:1400:73457:17:16:72:526:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constantly  lobbing  for  access  to  bank  credit  and  in  the  process  were  vitiating  the  work 
31:1401:73559:16:17:72:526:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:atmosphere  in  the  banks  by  alluring  a  section  of  the  bankers  to  indulge  in  corruption  and 
31:1402:73664:17:16:72:526:471:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:malpractices.  It  is  now  widely  recognized  that  today‟s  millionaires  of  Bangladesh  came 
31:1403:73762:16:17:72:526:455:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:mostly from the Ranks of those “briefcase business man” and the groups mentioned,  who 
31:1404:73849:17:16:72:526:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could  successfully  establish  and  maintain  this  types  of  patron  client  relationship  with  the 
31:1405:73953:16:17:72:526:422:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bankers  and  in  the  process  created  a  host  of  millionaires  from  amongst  those  bankers 
31:1406:74051:17:17:72:525:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:themselves,  who  had  actively  connived  and  harvested  the  illicit margins  in  exchange  of  the 
31:1407:74154:17:16:72:300:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:favours rationed out to those fortunate loanees. 
31:1408:74202:16:17:72:75:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
31:1409:74202:17:16:72:526:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  political  changes  of  1975  ushered  in  an  era  of  political  culture,  where  in  corruption 
31:1410:74306:16:17:72:526:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:gradually became institutionalized, the economics of rent seeking took firm roots in the body 
31:1411:74400:17:16:72:526:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:politic  of  Bangladesh.  In  the  process,  sanctioning  of  bank  loans  became  one  of  the  prime 
31:1412:74503:16:17:72:526:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:victims of the buying and selling process afflicting the political party affiliation process, and 
31:1413:74601:17:17:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  popular  mechanism  for  doling  out  financial  favors  to  party  leaders  as  well  as  political 
31:1414:74705:17:16:72:526:272:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cadres.  This  politicization  of  the  banking  practices  has  seriously  hampered  the  institutional 
31:1415:74810:16:17:72:526:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disciplines  of  the  banks,  where  professional  expertise,  integrity  and  ethical  values  have 
31:1416:74911:17:16:72:526:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:become exceptions to some extent rather than rules. Ex-bankers emerged as financiers as the 
31:1417:75003:16:17:72:526:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:newly  floated  private  banks,  but  there  was  no  mechanism  to  make  them  accountable  or  to 
31:1418:75104:17:16:72:526:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:know about the sources of their cash. Defaulters of bank loans taken from nationalized banks 
31:1419:75197:16:17:72:526:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or  state  owned  development  finance  institutions  swelled  the  rank  of  directors  of  the  newly 
31:1420:75301:17:16:72:526:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:established private banks, but nobody intervened on behalf of the loan-giving banks caught in 
31:1421:75395:16:17:72:526:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the middle with defaulted loans. The laws, rules and regulations relating to banking remained 
31:1422:75489:17:17:72:526:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mostly in  the  books;  and  the  judicial  process  utterly  failed  to  take  the  willful  defaulters  to 
31:1423:75598:17:16:72:526:123:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:task, thereby making the process of lender‟s recourse on borrowers almost a mockery in 
31:1424:75685:16:17:72:526:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh. Therefore, we surmise that behind all these malaises, the nature of the state and 
31:1425:75779:17:0:72:526:90:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:of politics played the real villainous role by patronizing and developing a class of „comprador 
32:1426:75877:0:16:72:526:758:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:bourgeoisie‟  in  Bangladesh,  created,  nursed  and  constantly  nourished  by  state-patronage. 
32:1427:75975:16:17:72:459:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:And, in this nursing process, bank loans were rampantly used as lucrative doles.

32:1431:76243:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:genuine hardships regarding repayment of bank loans for the others. The domestic industries

32:1434:76528:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political doldrums of the late-eighties provided additional excuses to these swelling groups of 
32:1435:76624:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defaulters.  The  BNP  government  of  1991-96  tried  to  stem  the  rot  in  this  field  in  the  initial 
32:1436:76733:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:years  of   its  term.  They  repeated  the  blunders  of   its  predecessor  of  providing   lavish 
32:1437:76834:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:encouragements  to  bank  managements  to  ease  and  expedite  the  process  of  term  lending, 
32:1438:76931:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:especially according to its own political exigencies at the later stages of its rule, which added 
32:1439:77029:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:a  massive  amount  of  fuel  to  the  fire  of  the  so-called „default-culture‟. And earlier lending 
32:1440:77132:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sprees continues to haunt the banking  sector even today  by sustaining the  momentum of the 
32:1441:77225:16:17:72:351:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:build-up of the defaulted loans of the earlier two decades.

32:1445:77345:13:17:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  loans comprise the  most  important asset as well as the primary source of earning  for the 
32:1446:77441:17:16:72:526:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banking financial institutions and on the other hand also the major source of risk for the bank 
32:1447:77537:16:17:72:526:422:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management  so  a  prudent  bank  management  should  always  try  to  make  an  appropriate

32:1454:78105:16:17:72:526:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic implications of the non-performing / default loans are not only stoppage of creating 
32:1455:78199:17:17:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:new  loans  but  also  the  erosion  of  banks  profitability,  liquidity  and  solvency,  which  might 
32:1456:78303:17:16:72:526:272:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sometimes leader towards collapse of the banking financial system. It has, therefore, become 
32:1457:78396:16:17:72:526:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sine qua  non  for policy  makers to study the  loan  default  scenario of the  banking  sector of a 
32:1458:78497:17:16:72:526:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:routine  basis  for  estimating  classified  loan,  making  appropriate  provisioning,  adopting 
32:1459:78594:16:17:72:524:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effective recovery strategy and thus ensuring soundness and efficiency of the banking sector.  
32:1460:78688:17:16:72:75:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
32:1461:78688:16:17:72:526:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Before  privatization  and  liberalization  this  banking  activities  were  thus  directed  to  disburse 
32:1462:78794:17:16:72:526:173:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:credit, according to the Government‟s economic priority, and hence little attention was placed 
32:1463:78889:16:17:72:526:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to identify the problem loans and making provisions thereon, although there was a significant 
32:1464:78983:17:17:72:525:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount  of  hidden  default  loans.  After  1982,  the  banking  sector  of  Bangladesh  underwent  a 
32:1465:79085:17:16:72:526:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rapid  denationalization  and  privatization  process.  The  out  of  six  nationalized  commercial 
32:1466:79185:16:17:72:526:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bank (Uttara Bank and Pubali Bank) were denationalized in 1983 and 1984 respectively with 
32:1467:79275:17:0:72:525:90:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a view to  increasing the  efficiency of the  banking sector. Henceforward, private  banks were 
33:1468:79373:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:allowed  to conduct banking operations ( banking sector books  60 private banks having 628 
33:1469:79464:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:branches,  and  7  foreign  banks  having  14  branches  at  the  end  of  1984)  in  order  to increase, 
33:1470:79570:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competition, reasons, the efficiency and productivity of the banking sector. But due to various 
33:1471:79666:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reasons, the efficiency of the banking  sector did  not increase rather the credit discipline was 
33:1472:79764:17:16:72:146:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:further eroded. 
33:1473:79779:16:17:72:75:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
33:1474:79779:17:17:72:525:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  most  important  aspect  of  this  study  is  to  measure  the  magnitude  of  loans  classified 
33:1475:79881:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:substandard,   doubtful   and   bad/loss   since   the   adoption   of   criteria   for   overdue   loan 
33:1476:79986:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classification in 1990. In connection to this, it must be mentioned that the banking system in 
33:1477:80081:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh  (as  of  December, 2011)  comprises  four  types  of  scheduled  banks – 4  State 
33:1478:80173:16:17:72:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:commercial  banks  (SCBs),  5  government-owned  development  financial  institutions  (DFIs), 
33:1479:80268:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:30 private commercial banks (PCBs) and 10 foreign commercial banks (FCBs) – for catering 
33:1480:80356:16:17:72:525:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  the  credit  needs  of the  economy.  Therefore,  data  on  classified  loans  in  both  the  banking 
33:1481:80462:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector  as  a  whole  and  in  different  clusters  of  banks  are  taken  into  account  to  gain  a  clearer

34:1522:80847:17:17:72:525:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  government  also  formed  a  committee  in  1986  in  the  name  of  National  Commission  on 
34:1523:80946:17:16:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Money,  Banking  and  Credit  for  providing  suggestions  on  non-performing  loans  so  as  to 
34:1524:81043:16:17:72:526:618:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:improve  the  efficiency  of  the  banking  system.  The  Word  Bank  also,  at  this  time  started 
34:1525:81144:17:16:72:384:601:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:making an in-depth study on the financial sector of Bangladesh.   
34:1526:81208:16:17:72:75:585:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
34:1527:81208:17:16:72:526:568:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Regarding the default loans, Bangladesh Bank, however, asked the commercial banks to use 
34:1528:81297:16:17:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their own subjective criteria for the identification of problem loans and to maintain provisions 
34:1529:81394:17:16:72:526:535:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:against  it.  Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  banking  sector  as  a  whole  simply  neglected  the 
34:1530:81498:16:17:72:526:519:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:identification of problem assets as well as maintenance of proper provision on it. At that time 
34:1531:81594:17:17:72:526:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banking community used to believe that they would be able to realize the time bared loans in 
34:1532:81687:17:16:72:526:485:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:full after selling the security kept against it. And as such, they used to deem accrued interest 
34:1533:81783:16:17:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on the  non-performing  loans as their  income  following the accrual  principles of accounting. 
34:1534:81880:17:16:72:526:452:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Hence,  both  the  profit  and  loss  account  and  the  balance  sheet  did  not  reflect  thee  actual 
34:1535:81985:16:17:72:526:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:position and  both  dividend  and  taxes  were  paid  from  the  overstated  income.  This  practice 
34:1536:82085:17:16:72:526:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seriously eroded the capital bases of the banks till the end of 1989, as before that there were 
34:1537:82181:16:17:72:526:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hardly  any  policy  guidelines  by  the  central  bank  regarding  classification  of  loans  and 
34:1538:82280:17:17:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:maintenance of provisions against it. Of course, there was also an absence of appropriate laws 
34:1539:82375:17:16:72:252:369:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relating to recovery of default loans.  
34:1540:82414:16:17:72:75:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
34:1541:82414:17:16:72:526:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In order to curb continuing financial distress and to arrest increasing growth of default loans, 
34:1542:82511:16:17:72:526:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh  Bank formally  introduced  BCD  Circular  No-34 on  November  16,  1989  on  loan 
34:1543:82604:17:16:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classification  and  making  provisions  thereof.  The  circular  states  that  henceforth  the  banks 
34:1544:82707:16:17:72:526:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:themselves will carry out the classifications of their loans at least once in a year on the basis 
34:1545:82805:17:17:72:526:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the  position  existing  on  December  31  (annual  closing  date)  in  accordance  with  the 
34:1546:82903:17:16:72:526:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:guidelines given in the BRPD Circular No. 07 on June 14, 2012: Loan Classification and 
34:1547:82990:16:17:72:526:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Provisioning.  It  also  states  that  except  for  agricultural  short-term  loans,  all  loans  are  to  be 
34:1548:83100:17:16:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:classified as either classified' or unclassified‟. Classified loans are to be considered as those 
34:1549:83198:16:17:72:526:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loans that have a reduced chance of repayment and are to be further classified as substandard, 
34:1550:83293:17:16:72:526:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:doubtful and  bad/  losses. It further states that the bank will use both overdue and qualitative 
34:1551:83390:16:17:72:364:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:judgment criteria to deem a loan classified or unclassified.

34:1553:83474:16:17:72:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  know  proper  assessment  of  the  probable  losses  o  revenue  is  required  to  make  proper 
34:1554:83574:17:17:72:526:121:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:provision  and  to  determine  the  net  realizable asset position: “There is always a requirement 
34:1555:83673:17:16:72:526:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  banks  to  systematically  and  realistically  identify  their  problem  assets  and  provide 
34:1556:83772:16:0:72:526:88:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adequate reserves for possible losses. To accomplish this, Bangladesh Bank issued guidelines 
35:1557:83867:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in 1989 (vide BCD Circular No. 34, dated 16.11.89) regarding classification and provisioning 
35:1558:83960:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procedure.  Subsequently,  a  revised  policy  as  introduced  in  1994  (vide  circular  No.20,  dated 
35:1559:84064:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:27.12.94) to be implemented by banks in five phases commencing 31st December 1994. The

35:1561:84245:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:line  with  international  standards  by  the  end  of  1998.  Prior  to  1989,  there  were  no  clear  cut 
35:1562:84354:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy guidelines to enforce adequate provision by the banks. In the majority of cases, banks 
35:1563:84448:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:simply  did  not  identify  problem  assets,  establish  realistic  provisions  for  potential  losses  or 
35:1564:84555:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suspend  interest  on  non-performing  assets.  As  a  result,  the  balance  sheet  did  not  reflect  the 
35:1565:84663:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banks actual condition and the income statement overstated profits upon which dividends and 
35:1566:84755:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:taxes were paid. However, during the mid-eighties a norm was fixed by Central Bank to raise 
35:1567:84847:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  level of provisions  by  0.5% of the total  loans  each  year till  it reached 4%. Obviously,  it 
35:1568:84950:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:had no relation to loans classified. Interestingly, the banks on the whole did not comply with 
35:1569:85045:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this  requirement.  The  situation  ultimately  led  to  unreasonable  developments  regarding 
35:1570:85140:17:17:72:418:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:keeping of provisions by the banks (Choudhury et al, 1997, pp.43-44)”. 
35:1571:85210:17:16:72:75:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
35:1572:85210:16:17:72:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It implies that the Central Bank policy of raising  provision does not cover the  fluctuation  in 
35:1573:85308:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classified  loan.  Besides  the  commercial  bank  on  the  whole  did  not  comply  with  this 
35:1574:85404:16:17:72:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:requirement may  be due to luck of Central Bank  supervision,  lack of sufficient profit before 
35:1575:85500:17:16:72:526:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provision  and  taxes.  This  expanse  of  the  borrowers  is  the  interest  against  the  loans  and 
35:1576:85603:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:advances. For sometimes it is an unavoidable issue that banks charge higher interest rate that 
35:1577:85698:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:become  difficult  for  the  borrowers  to  repay  and  the  banks  (specially  the  PCBs)  defend 
35:1578:85797:16:17:72:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:themselves by saying that they have to pay a higher rate against deposits and borrowings, and 
35:1579:85891:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they have to add a higher proportion for risk, which actually results from their anticipation of 
35:1580:85988:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan loss. Whatever might b e the attack and counter attack, on principle the bank can lose at 
35:1581:86083:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:most a portion of the interest since interest is the additional amount the borrowers are paying 
35:1582:86179:17:16:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to the banks for the services they are getting from the banks. How far the reduction of interest 
35:1583:86276:16:17:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spread, that is, the difference between the interest received and the interest paid will improve 
35:1584:86373:17:16:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the present bad  loan situation  is  not certain  because willful defaulters are  indifferent to such

35:1592:86776:17:17:72:526:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bank,  bank  managers  usually  divide  all  loans  into  five  categories  (continuous  loan,  demand 
35:1593:86879:17:16:72:526:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loan,  term  loan  payable  within  five  years,  term  loan  payable  in  more  than  five  years  and

35:1595:87090:17:16:72:526:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:repayments.  All  troubled  loans  are  then  further  reclassified  as  special  mention  account

36:1601:87558:16:17:72:525:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bank  managers  review  the  loan  quality  on  a  quarterly  basis.    With  some  exceptions,  the 
36:1602:87659:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banking  sector  at  present  follows  a  norm  of  six  months  overdue  for  deeming  a  loan 
36:1603:87755:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nonperforming.    The  rate  of  provision  on  classified  loans  follows  norms  of  5%,  20%,  50% 
36:1604:87857:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  100%  against  special  mention  accounts,  substandard,  doubtful,  and  bad/loss  loans

38:1879:92491:14:16:72:526:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In comparison to the international standard of loan classification and provisioning, it is found 
38:1880:92588:16:17:72:526:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  the  banking  system  of  Bangladesh  follows  4  stages  (SMA,  sub-standard,  doubtful,  bad 
38:1881:92689:17:17:72:526:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  loss)  to  define  the  status  of  a  classified  loan,  as  opposed  to  three  stages  (sub-standard, 
38:1882:92799:17:16:72:526:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:doubtful,  bad  and  loss)  used  in  the  international  standard.  While  the  international  standard 
38:1883:92904:16:17:72:526:420:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provides the norm of 3 months overdue for terming a loan substandard, this period is used in 
38:1884:92997:17:16:72:526:403:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Bangladesh  as  the  norm  for  terming  a  loan  a  “special  mention  account”.  In  addition, 
38:1885:93094:16:17:72:526:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh  shows  more  flexibility  than  the  international  standard  in  the  classification  of 
38:1886:93196:17:16:72:525:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:long-term  loans. However,  in  the  case  of  provisioning  and  frequency  of  classification, 
38:1887:93292:16:17:72:526:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh follows the international standard to a great extent. In the final analysis, it can be 
38:1888:93390:17:17:72:526:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concluded that the present loan classification and provisioning system in use in Bangladesh is 
38:1889:93485:17:16:72:526:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:similar  to  a  great  extent  to  the  international  standard,  although  it  is  yet  to  adopt  the

41:2011:97759:17:17:72:526:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compared to 2004, marking the end of a declining trend since 1997, with the exception of the

41:2018:98278:16:17:72:526:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2011.  A  more  alarming  picture  is  observed  in  the  case  of  bad/loss  loans,  which  account  for 
41:2019:98384:17:16:72:526:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more than 80% of  NPLs since the  year 1997  but in 2011, 82.61%. Unfortunately, this trend 
41:2020:98476:16:17:72:526:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has not shown any improvement over the period 1990 to 2011. NPLs still account for 6.59% 
41:2021:98565:17:16:72:526:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of all loans in Bangladesh. This staggering rate of bad loans in fact reflects the incapability of 
41:2022:98664:16:17:72:526:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the banking sector to arrest the growth of NPLs, although an encouraging trend of declining

42:2045:99785:16:17:72:526:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  the  highest  ratio  of  NPLs  is  in  the  category  of  loans  of  SCBs  (45.62%)  and  DFIs 
42:2046:99886:17:16:72:526:447:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(65.02%). This  is  followed  by term  loans over  a  maturity of 5  years (42.68%)  for DFIs  and 
42:2047:99985:16:17:72:526:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(25.3%)  for  SCBs  in  2004.  However,  in  the  case  of  continuous  loans  and  demand  loans, 
42:2048:100084:17:16:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:SCBs and DFIs have the largest ratios of NPLs (14.01% and 21.8% respectively) among the 
42:2049:100172:16:17:72:526:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bank clusters in December 2011 (table 6). Therefore, it can be concluded that non-performing 
42:2050:100265:17:17:72:525:381:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loans  in the  sector of  micro and agricultural  loans, as well as term  loans of SCBs and DFIs,

43:2058:100528:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It  is  evident  that in  2011,  the  growth  rate  of  advances  is  the  highest  in  SCBs  (14.1%), 
43:2059:100630:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:followed by FCBs (3.1%). Prior to 2011, however, PCBs played a leading role for a number 
43:2060:100719:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of years (Table 6).  SCBs also show an increasing trend in advances since 1999, whilst DFIs 
43:2061:100811:16:17:72:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:show a declining rate of growth, except for the years 2001 and 2011. In order to compare the 
43:2062:100904:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth rate of classified  loans to the growth rate of advances,  it  is observed that the growth

43:2065:101199:17:16:72:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for all clusters of banks, PCBs, FCBs and DFIs, except in a few cases (table 6). Presently  in 
43:2066:101294:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2011, the growth rate of classified loans is found to be lower than the growth rate of advances

46:2172:104929:14:16:72:526:666:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:There is a famous maxim “justice delayed is justice denied”. This can be applied to banks, 
46:2173:105020:16:17:72:526:650:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:especially  in developing  countries  like Bangladesh, owing to the presence of corruption  and 
46:2174:105116:17:17:72:526:633:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opaqueness in the settlement process as well as poor enforcement of laws that usually create a

46:2185:106091:16:17:72:526:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Again,  some  new  laws  with  prudential  regulations  like  Banking  Companies  Act  1991  and

46:2194:106656:14:16:72:526:310:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Artha  Rin  Adalat  Act  was  enacted  in  1990  to  address  separately  all  issues  related  to 
46:2195:106758:16:17:72:526:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:NPLs,  with  the  objective  of  ensuring  the  safety  and  soundness  of  the banking  system.  An 
46:2196:106858:17:17:72:526:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:analysis  of  the  performance  of  this  court  reveals  that  the  number  of  suits  filed,  amounts 
46:2197:106962:17:16:72:526:260:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:claimed and number of settled suits have all increased considerably from 1991 to 2011 (table 
46:2198:107055:16:17:72:526:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:8). It is also encouraging that the percentage of settled suits has increased considerably from 
46:2199:107151:17:16:72:526:227:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:11.59%  in  1991  to  37.71%  in  2001,  46.36%  in  2004  and  71.69%  in  end  of  2011. 
46:2200:107242:16:17:72:526:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Unfortunately,  the  recovery  rate  is  seen  to  be  very  slow  and  is  confined  to  3.65%  in  1991, 
46:2201:107349:17:16:72:526:194:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:8.65%  in  2001  and  19.00%  in  2011,  ultimately  3%-19%  only  during  the  last  twenty  years. 
46:2202:107450:16:17:72:526:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus,  the  slow  execution  of  the  decrees  in  Bangladesh  can  be  seen  as  the  main  factoring 
46:2203:107553:17:16:72:282:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contributing to very low recovery of NPLs. 
46:2204:107595:16:17:72:75:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
46:2205:107595:17:17:72:526:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 8 (chart 8) shows the overall picture of suits  filed and  settled  in the  Artha Rin  Adalat 
46:2206:107694:17:16:72:526:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:during  1991  to  2011.  If  we  focus  our  attention  to  the  bank  group  wise,  it  is  observed  that 
46:2207:107802:16:17:72:526:95:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:number of cases under trial is highest in the SCBs (33796), followed by DFIs (12758), PCBs 
46:2208:107893:17:0:72:526:78:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(10542) and FCBs (179) in 2001 .Though DFIs and PCBs have nearly same number of cases 
47:2209:107981:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:under  trial,  the  amount  of  suits  under  trial  in  PCBs  is  much  higher  than  DFIs.  In  terms  of 
47:2210:108089:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:settled cases,  SCBs, DFIs and PCBs all  are having almost equal percentage (about 43%) of 
47:2211:108180:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cases  settled  while  FCBs  are  far  ahead  of  all  other groups;  the  percentage  of  their  settled 
47:2212:108285:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cases  is  70.39%  as  on  June  30,  2000. The  recovery  of  FCBs  is  much  higher  (44.30%)  as 
47:2213:108384:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compared  to  SCBs  (8.10%)  and  PCBs  (10.09%).  As  FCBs  operate  under  the  same  legal 
47:2214:108478:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:framework for loan recovery their far better performance indicate the potential of attaining a 
47:2215:108573:17:17:72:519:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more effective enforcement than what is so far achieved in regard to SCBs, DFIs and PCBs.

50:2350:111679:14:17:72:526:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The main hindrance, therefore, relating to the recovery of default loans at this moment seems 
50:2351:111773:17:16:72:526:497:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to be the poor enforcement status of laws and slow execution of decrees. In this connection, it 
50:2352:111869:16:17:72:526:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:must be mentioned that the law itself is not solely responsible for delay in settlement of cases

54:2565:120608:17:16:72:526:615:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:don‟t have enough banking experience. As they are young and lack experience, it may be one 
54:2566:120699:16:17:72:220:599:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the reasons of default loan.

54:2569:120764:16:17:72:526:549:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sometimes people without prior business experience want to do something. It may so happen 
54:2570:120854:17:16:72:526:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that after retirement from govt. or private service people want to establish a business which is 
54:2571:120951:16:17:72:526:516:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not very relevant to his past experience. Besides  his own equity they  look  for bank  finance. 
54:2572:121048:17:16:72:526:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Normally  banks  do  not  finance  in  the  projects  where the  key  personnel  do  not  have  enough 
54:2573:121151:16:17:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:background  in  that  particular  business.  When  banks  finance  in  the  projects  where  the  key 
54:2574:121253:17:16:72:526:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:personnel  lack  relevant business  experience,  it  becomes  risky  for  the  bank.  Probability  of 
54:2575:121355:16:17:72:320:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:failure in these sorts of projects tends to be higher.

54:2578:121477:16:17:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Business  experience  is  somehow  related to  business  background.  Here  business  background 
54:2579:121574:17:16:72:526:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:means  family  business  background.  Though  family  business  has  a  role  in  entrepreneurial 
54:2580:121672:16:17:72:526:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:orientation,  there   is   no  direct  relationship  between   business   background  and  business 
54:2581:121772:17:16:72:526:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance or  loan repayment. It is true that  youths coming  from  business  background are 
54:2582:121867:16:17:72:526:334:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:familiar with business and banking but there are other ways to get oriented with the same, not

54:2586:122037:17:16:72:526:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We all know this is one of the most common reasons behind default culture in Bangladesh. It 
54:2587:122129:16:17:72:526:251:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can  happen  in  some  situations  like  when  security  backing  loan  is  weak,  customer  feels  that 
54:2588:122234:17:16:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defaulting  the  loan  will  not  harm  him  much.  In  that  case  he  tends  to  default.  In  other  cases 
54:2589:122344:16:17:72:526:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:like  when  cash  flow  from  the  business  is  not  impressive,  people  are  unwilling  to  repay  the 
54:2590:122450:17:16:72:526:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loans.   Even   sometimes   without   any   reason   customers   default   loan   that   is   purely 
54:2591:122551:16:17:72:346:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:psychological and absolute unwillingness to repay loan.

54:2594:122641:16:17:72:526:135:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sometimes business need support from other sources. When cash flow is lean and the project 
54:2595:122732:17:16:72:526:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is in lull, it needs feeding. Without further feeding company may become sick and incur loss

55:2605:123139:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sometimes no attractive industry acts as primary cause of loan default. Companies operating 
55:2606:123231:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  non  attractive  industries  have  higher  probability  of  performing  poor.  Because  of  poor 
55:2607:123332:17:16:72:526:642:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:financial performance, company‟s cash flow gets affected. Because of cash flow the company 
55:2608:123423:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:becomes  less  liquid  which  contributes  in  defaulting  bank  loan.  Not  necessarily  that  all  the 
55:2609:123528:17:16:72:322:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:companies of non attractive industry perform poor.

55:2612:123602:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Strong  competition  does  not  directly  contribute  in  defaulting  loan.  Strong  competition  takes 
55:2613:123706:17:17:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:place when  many  companies enter  into an  industry where the  industry cannot accommodate 
55:2614:123797:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:so  many  companies.  In  strong  competition  only  efficient  players  survive.  So  the  inefficient 
55:2615:123901:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:companies find it difficult to make profit and sale their product. Once they fail to make profit, 
55:2616:123999:17:16:72:380:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the company is likely to default its loan installment in the bank.

55:2619:124096:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Before  sanctioning  a  loan  banks  look  in  to  the  matter  that  how  the  management  of  the 
55:2620:124196:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:company is. If the bank feels that the management is capable enough to successfully run the 
55:2621:124288:16:17:72:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:business and utilize bank finance, then bank agree to finance otherwise not. Even sometimes 
55:2622:124379:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banks  sets  conditions  like  some  of  the  key  personnel  must  not  quit  the  organization  before 
55:2623:124484:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:repayment  of  the  loan.  Managerial  capability  plays  a  vital  role  in  repaying  bank  loan.  The 
55:2624:124589:16:17:72:443:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more professional the management is the less probability of defaulting loan.

55:2627:124697:16:16:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Definitely  Poor  financial  performance  is  the  most  important  cause  of  loan  default.  Once  a 
55:2628:124800:16:17:72:526:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:company is not solvent, it is un-likely to repay its loan. Poor financial performance is the key 
55:2629:124897:17:17:72:526:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reason  behind  maximum  loan  default.  Poor  financial  performance  can  be  arisen  from  many 
55:2630:124996:17:16:72:222:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:other reasons described above.

55:2632:125026:17:16:72:178:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B5: Poor Cash flow: 
55:2633:125045:16:17:72:526:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In most cases poor cash flow is the aftermath of poor financial performance. Because of poor 
55:2634:125138:17:16:72:526:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cash  flow companies  mainly default  loan. Because of  irregular cash  flow, business  becomes 
55:2635:125234:16:17:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unstable  and  illiquid.  In  that  case  business  does  not  have  enough  cash  to  service  loans 
55:2636:125336:17:17:72:526:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:payment and  interest. Even  if a company  is profitable, the company  may  default  because of 
55:2637:125431:17:16:72:526:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cash flow. In some cases, a business may sell  most of its finished goods in credit. So it may 
55:2638:125526:16:17:72:471:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not have enough cash to support the loan and other debts. So it may cause default.

56:2643:125631:16:17:72:526:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Low market share may be a reason of loan default but not a single respondent mentioned it as 
56:2644:125724:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one of the reasons of their  loan default. Low  market share  means  low  sales,  low sales  mean 
56:2645:125822:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:low profit and  low profit results default. But operating  in a  niche  market, having a  very  low 
56:2646:125922:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market  share  a  firm  can  be  profitable  enough  to  repay  its  entire  loan  obligation  as  well  as 
56:2647:126030:16:17:72:183:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:retain sizable earning.

56:2652:126214:16:17:72:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:firm badly needs money, it does not get enough funds because of delayed assessment by the 
56:2653:126304:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bank.  This  infuses  shortage  of  cash  in  their  business  operations.  They  hardly  manage  their

56:2658:126606:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:funds until security documentation formalities are completed. As a result business do not get

56:2662:126813:17:16:72:240:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C3: Lack of Proper Monitoring: 
56:2663:126843:16:17:72:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Monitoring is one of the most important parts in credit. Through monitoring lenders come to 
56:2664:126935:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:know  that  whether  their  fund  is  being  used  for  the  desired  purpose  or  not.  Sometimes 
56:2665:127034:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disbursed  money  is  used  for  purposes  other than  the  specific  areas.  In  that  case  risk  of  loan 
56:2666:127143:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:default  gets  higher.  Banks  sanction  loan  on  the  basis  of  feasibility  of  the  project.  Bank  as  a 
56:2667:127254:17:16:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lender  expect  that  the  loan  will  be  serviced  by  the  cash  flow  generated  from  that  particular 
56:2668:127362:16:17:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:business. But if credit  is used  in some other areas desired cash  flow  may  not come  from the 
56:2669:127460:17:16:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:business  and  chance  of  loan  default  gets  high.  Therefore  banks  monitor  activities  of  the 
56:2670:127562:16:17:72:526:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:borrower  whether  the  fund  is  being  properly  utilized  or  business  is  generating  enough  cash 
56:2671:127666:17:17:72:526:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:flow or not. Banks use specialized formats for loan monitoring. Bank periodically review the 
56:2672:127759:17:16:72:526:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance of the  borrower and based on that bank decides whether to renew the  facilities 
56:2673:127852:16:17:72:479:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or not. The tools used for monitoring are portfolio review, profitability analysis etc.

56:2677:128069:16:17:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exceptions.  If  there  is  any  exception  then  corrective  action  needs  to  be  taken.  If  corrective 
56:2678:128177:17:17:72:526:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:actions  are  taken  on  time  chance  of  default  loan  reduces.  When  customer  misses  one 
56:2679:128273:17:16:72:526:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:installment, concerned officer of the  bank  must visit the customer and understand where the 
56:2680:128367:16:17:72:445:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problem lies. If proper action is taken, probability of loan default is reduced.

59:2806:137043:17:0:94:526:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:analyze  information  and  to  put  optimal  conditions  to  its  loan  supply.  To  develop  this 
60:2807:137144:0:16:94:525:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ability,  financial  institutions  must  be  in  a  condition  of  sound  market  competition  and 
60:2808:137243:16:18:94:258:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:appropriate prudential regulation. 
60:2809:137277:18:16:94:526:724:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Considering credit as a scarce resources and source of economic and political power, 
60:2810:137363:16:17:94:525:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:all  the  societies  around  the  world  are  careful  about  its  distribution  and  use.  In  order  to 
60:2811:137469:17:16:94:525:691:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:best utilize credit an attempt should be made in order to avoid concentration of loans into 
60:2812:137561:16:18:94:149:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:few hands. 
60:2813:137571:18:16:94:526:657:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Strengthening   the   security   market   will have   a   positive   impact   on   the   overall 
60:2814:137668:16:17:94:525:641:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development  of  the  banking  sector  by  increasing  the  competitiveness  in  the  financial 
60:2815:137764:17:16:94:525:624:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector. In a developed capital market the range of portfolio selection is wider and people 
60:2816:137855:16:17:94:526:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can  compare  the  security  of  their  investment  among  the  banks  and  the  security  market. 
60:2817:137954:17:17:94:498:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As a result banks remain under some pressure to improve their financial soundness. 
60:2818:138036:17:17:94:526:574:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Bangladesh has a bright prospect in the sectors of small and medium scale enterprises. 
60:2819:138124:17:17:94:525:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Poorer  sections  of  the  society  have  innate  entrepreneurial  ability  of  undertaking  some 
60:2820:138222:17:16:94:525:540:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:small  profitable  projects.  Successful  operation  of  some  NGOs  (Grameen  Bank  and 
60:2821:138311:16:17:94:525:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:BRAC  are  few  of  them)  provides  evidences  that  the  poor  people  can  be  bankable  even 
60:2822:138408:17:17:94:187:507:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:without collateral.  
60:2823:138428:17:17:94:526:490:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Bangladesh  may  look  for  and utilize  a  number  of  merger  and  acquisition  cases 
60:2824:138516:17:16:94:525:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:especially among the larger banks if any for the better information sharing, management, 
60:2825:138605:16:17:94:249:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and diversification of activities. 
60:2826:138639:17:16:94:97:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
60:2827:138639:16:17:72:526:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In    the  Bangladesh  banking  sector,  the  main  conflict  is  that  the  loss  due  to  inefficiency  of 
60:2828:138748:17:16:72:526:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:collection  of  bad  loans  for  whatever  reasons,  where  the  shareholders  are  definitely  not 
60:2829:138848:16:17:72:526:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:responsible, are adjusted by  making provisions out of profit and then utilizing this provision 
60:2830:138944:17:17:72:526:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to write off bad loans, the collection of which is uncertain. It may not be justified because the 
60:2831:139041:17:16:72:526:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount  and  payment  sys  tem  is  not  linked  to  performance,  especially  in  case  of  less  than 
60:2832:139145:16:17:72:526:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:average performance. To minimize this conflict, loan classification should be stopped, that is, 
60:2833:139241:17:16:72:525:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regular repayment should be ensured. This will reduce the provision for the loan loss amount, 
60:2834:139335:16:17:72:526:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  in  turn  will  result  in  more  tax  payment  and  more  after tax  profit  of  the  organization, 
60:2835:139443:17:16:72:526:291:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:which  is  the  precondition  for  maximization  of  shareholders‟  wealth.  Provision  in  other 
60:2836:139541:16:17:72:525:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:business is an estimation based on the past experience of the uncollectible amounts. If banks 
60:2837:139635:17:17:72:526:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can  stop  classification,  then  1  percent  of  unclassified  loans  will  suffice  or  in  the  future  this 
60:2838:139747:17:16:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:percentage may also reduced: “Prevention is better than cure. This should be the watchword 
60:2839:139838:16:17:72:526:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  monitoring  and  supervising  loan  accounts  of  bank.  Making  classification  and  pursuing 
60:2840:139938:17:16:72:526:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:borrowers  to  regularize  the  accounts  rarely  meet  success.  The  cost  of  such  exercise  is  also 
60:2841:140044:16:17:72:526:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:heavy.  So,  the  bank  should   evolve  appropriate  systems  to  detect  deficiencies   in  the 
60:2842:140142:17:16:72:526:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management  of  credit  operations  well  before  it  calls  for  classification.  In  this  regard  an 
60:2843:140246:16:17:72:526:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effective on-site and off-site supervision system should be in place both in the schedule banks 
60:2844:140342:17:16:72:255:142:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:and central banks (Alam and Jahan).”

62:2925:141369:14:8:72:289:702:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:7.1 Summary of Findings and Challenges: 
62:2926:141408:8:12:72:74:694:6:Times New Roman:6:Times New Roman: 
62:2927:141408:12:17:72:526:682:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  foregoing  discussion  regarding  NPLs  in  Bangladesh  reveals  that  the  banking  sector  of 
62:2928:141509:17:17:72:526:665:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh  is  yet  to  get  out  of  its  NPL  mess,  although  substantial  improvement  has  been 
62:2929:141611:17:16:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:noticed recently. In terms of adoption of the international loan classification and provisioning 
62:2930:141708:16:17:72:526:632:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system, Bangladesh follows the international standard (table 2) to a great extent, but lags far 
62:2931:141804:17:16:72:526:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behind  with  regard  to  the  management  of  NPLs.  At  present  (2011),  the  banking  system  of 
62:2932:141905:16:17:72:525:599:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh exhibits a very high proportion of NPLs (6.59%) when compared to India and Sri 
62:2933:141995:17:16:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Lanka is lower. The most dissatisfactory performance is seen in the management of “bad 
62:2934:142082:16:17:72:526:566:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:loans” which consistently account for more than 80% of total NPLs (table 5). This situation 
62:2935:142174:17:17:72:525:549:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:clearly demonstrates the inefficacy of the banking system to tackle the “flow problem of bad 
62:2936:142267:17:16:72:526:532:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:loans”. Therefore, the first challenge  facing the banking sector of Bangladesh  is  how to 
62:2937:142359:16:17:72:473:516:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constitute sufficient measures to address the flow problem of bad loans effectively. 
62:2938:142443:17:16:72:75:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
62:2939:142443:16:17:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It  is  observed  that  among  the  different  clusters  of  banks  in  Bangladesh,  SCBs  and  DFIs 
62:2940:142544:17:16:72:526:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continue to have an alarming amount of NPLs is 14.1% and 21.8% respectively in 2011 since 
62:2941:142634:16:17:72:526:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  adoption  of  prudential  norms  in  1990.    Although  it  is  not  clear  which  sectors  contain 
62:2942:142739:17:16:72:526:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:major  NPLs,  available  data  indicates  that  the  highest  ratio  of  NPLs  are  in  the  category  of 
62:2943:142845:16:17:72:526:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loans  of  both  SCBs  and  DFIs  are14.1%  and  21.8%  respectively,  followed  by  term  loans 
62:2944:142942:17:17:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:having a maturity of more than 20 years in the case of DFIs (Table 6).  The NPL ratio of term 
62:2945:143036:17:16:72:526:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:loans given  by SCBs  is also observed to be very  high.  Another  important observation  is the 
62:2946:143133:16:17:72:526:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:gradual reduction of capital in SCBs due to maintenance of poor loan loss provisions against 
62:2947:143226:17:16:72:526:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:default loans (table 7). These aspects clearly call for ending the operation of SCBs and DFIs. 
62:2948:143321:16:17:72:526:334:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, it needs to be mentioned here that the stock markets of Bangladesh are not efficient 
62:2949:143415:17:16:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enough to channel funds for industrial growth, and thus SCBs as well as DFIs play a vital role 
62:2950:143510:16:17:72:525:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  meeting the  overall  industrial  credit  needs  of  the  country.  Hence,  the  second  challenge 
62:2951:143613:17:17:72:526:284:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:before the  banking  system  is to decide whether to stop operations of the SCBs and DFIs, to 
62:2952:143707:17:16:72:450:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privatize them, or to reorient them through financial engineering in full phase. 
62:2953:143787:16:17:72:75:251:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
62:2954:143787:17:16:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The study   reveals   the   dissatisfactory   performance   of   the   courts   (Money   loan   Court, 
62:2955:143889:16:17:72:526:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bankruptcy Court and PDR Court) in terms of rate of settlement of NPL disputes as well  as 
62:2956:143980:17:16:72:526:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate of recovery of loans over the years in review (tables 9&10). The main problem related to 
62:2957:144074:16:17:72:526:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:very  low  recovery  lies  in  the  very  slow  execution  of  the  decrees.  The  Financial  Sector 
62:2958:144175:17:17:72:526:168:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Reform  Project  (FSRP)  argues  that  the  huge  loan  delinquency  of  the  Bangladesh  banking 
62:2959:144273:17:16:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system  reflects,  among  other  things,  the  weakness  of  the  legal  infrastructure,  which  cannot 
62:2960:144377:16:17:72:526:135:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:ensure lenders‟ recourse on borrowers. The inefficacy on the part of the legal system also 
62:2961:144468:17:16:72:526:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sometimes  encourages  borrowers  to  refrain  from  paying  legitimate  dues  to  the  banks.  The 
62:2962:144568:16:17:72:526:102:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Center  for  Policy  Dialogue  (CPD)  Task  Force  Report  (2001)  also  indicates  that  the  main 
62:2963:144668:17:0:72:526:85:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hindrance  at  this  moment  in  Bangladesh  is  the  existing  legal  framework  and  its  lengthy 
63:2964:144770:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procedures.  However,  if  the  delay  in  the  settlement  process  arises  due  to  the  shortage  of 
63:2965:144874:16:17:72:526:742:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:judges, then separate posts like “Bank Magistrates” can be created to settle NPL issues. It is 
63:2966:144969:17:16:72:526:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to be kept in mind, however, that without having the proper cooperation and sincerity of the 
63:2967:145062:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concerned  individuals,  the  law  itself  can  by  no  means  expedite  the  process.  Thus,  the  third 
63:2968:145168:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:challenge before the banking sector is how to ensure cooperation, sincerity and accountability 
63:2969:145262:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the  involved  parties  like  plaintiff,  defendants,  lawyers  and  judges,  in  order  to  make  the 
63:2970:145369:17:17:72:259:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:settlement process vibrant and speedy. 
63:2971:145407:17:16:72:75:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
63:2972:145407:16:17:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Concerning  recovery  strategies  by  artha-rin  adatal,  it  is  observed  that  Bangladesh  has 
63:2973:145505:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concentrated  mainly  on  legal  measures  to  address  the  NPL  issue  (table  8).  Unfortunately, 
63:2974:145606:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these  legal  measures  have  been  found  to  be  very  time  consuming,  resource  draining  and 
63:2975:145705:17:16:72:529:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ineffective,  and  have  ultimately  resulted  in  poor recovery  performance  (table  9  &  10).  
63:2976:145804:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Interestingly,  despite  being  aware  of  this  fact, the  banking  system  of  Bangladesh  has  barely 
63:2977:145909:17:17:72:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:begun  to  adopt  non-legal  measures  such  as  out of  court  settlements,  compromise  settlement 
63:2978:146010:17:16:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:schemes,  formation  of  loan  workout departments  etc.  as  operate  in  India  for  the  effective 
63:2979:146112:16:17:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recovery  of  NPLs.  Therefore,  the  fourth  challenge  confronting  the  banking  sector  is  how  to 
63:2980:146216:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constitute a concrete NPL management strategy equipped with both preventive and resolution 
63:2981:146307:16:17:72:122:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measures. 
63:2982:146316:17:16:72:75:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
63:2983:146316:16:17:72:525:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In a bank-centered financial system, it is very crucial to determine whether the defaulter is a 
63:2984:146412:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:willful one or a genuine one. In the case of the  former,  if timely  and adequate  measures  are 
63:2985:146510:16:17:72:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not  taken  and  problems  are  left  unresolved,  the  willful  defaulters  can  have a  psychological 
63:2986:146613:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact on good borrowers, acting as a catalyst to financial degradation. In fact, in developing 
63:2987:146709:17:16:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries  like  Bangladesh,  a  large  number  of  willful  defaulters  operate  in  the  financial 
63:2988:146810:16:17:72:526:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market,  trying  to  degrade  the  credit  environment  either  by  window-dressing  their  financial 
63:2989:146912:17:16:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:health  or  by  influencing  the  bank  management  through  vested  groups,  or  both.  In  many 
63:2990:147010:16:17:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reports (BRC, SAPRI, CPD), serious concerns have been shown about the presence of willful 
63:2991:147100:17:16:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defaulters in Bangladesh and it has been suggested that loan facilities should not be offered to 
63:2992:147197:16:17:72:526:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this  group.  Nevertheless,  in  reality,  the  banking  system  has  not  yet  come  up  with  any 
63:2993:147297:17:17:72:526:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effective strategies to identify the habitual defaulters and to take action against them. In this 
63:2994:147395:17:16:72:525:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regard,  a  prominent challenge  before  the  banking  sector  could  be  seen  as  how  to  develop 
63:2995:147495:16:17:72:497:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:specific tools and techniques to distinguish the willful defaulters from the genuine ones. 
63:2996:147585:17:16:72:75:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
63:2997:147585:16:17:72:526:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Almost  a  decade  ago,  the  banking  system  of  Bangladesh  adopted  a  lending  risk  analysis 
63:2998:147684:17:16:72:526:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(LRA) device – a prescribed manual given by FSRP for analyzing loans of Tk. 10 million and 
63:2999:147774:16:17:72:525:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:above – with the objective of gauging the intensity of risk associated with large loans and to 
63:3000:147868:17:17:72:526:162:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:choose loan proposals with low risk exposures. LRA has now been superseded by the “credit 
63:3001:147958:17:16:72:526:145:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:risk grading system” for better identification and management of borrower‟s risk. However, 
63:3002:148049:16:17:72:526:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  application  of  this  sophisticated  technique  (CRG)  as  a  credit  screening  and  monitoring 
63:3003:148152:17:16:72:526:112:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tool  largely  depends  on  sufficient  business  data  and  know-how  of  the  concerned  credit 
63:3004:148250:16:17:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:officials.  Surprisingly,  these  are  seen  to  be  very  poor  in  the  credit  environment  of  this 
63:3005:148354:17:0:72:526:79:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country.  Thus,  the  appropriate  authorities  should  pay  proper  heed  to  redressing  these 
64:3006:148453:0:16:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problems  to  ensure  meaningful  application  of  the  CRG  device  in  the  credit  environment  of 
64:3007:148555:16:17:72:136:742:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bangladesh.  
64:3008:148567:17:16:72:75:725:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
64:3009:148567:16:17:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After the financial crisis of 1997, the East Asian countries (China, Malaysia, Singapore, and 
64:3010:148661:17:16:72:526:692:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indonesia) realized that asset  management companies can play a  vital role  in addressing the 
64:3011:148756:16:17:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bad  loan  problem  and  can ensure  robust  financial  discipline.  Recently,  India  has  set  up  an 
64:3012:148859:17:17:72:526:659:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:asset  management company as a trust to reorganize their  bad  loans. India  has also  instituted 
64:3013:148957:17:16:72:526:642:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:“factoring devices” and “asset securitisation techniques” to remove NPLs from the balance 
64:3014:149047:16:17:72:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sheet of  a  bank.  In  Bangladesh,  however,  no  initiative  has  been  taken  so  far  towards  the 
64:3015:149150:17:16:72:526:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:formation of an asset management company which could undertake activities relating to asset 
64:3016:149242:16:17:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reconstruction and develop markets for distressed assets. Factoring devices and securitisation 
64:3017:149337:17:16:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:techniques are hardly ever employed for the removal of NPLs in Bangladesh. Therefore, the 
64:3018:149427:16:17:72:526:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:next challenge  before the  banking  sector is  how to set up an asset  management company or 
64:3019:149521:17:17:72:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institute  factoring  services  and  asset  securitisation  techniques  that  would  address  NPLs 
64:3020:149620:17:16:72:293:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effectively without generating moral hazards. 
64:3021:149664:16:17:72:75:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
64:3022:149664:17:16:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This study reveals that the highest loan defaults are in the category of micro and agricultural 
64:3023:149760:16:17:72:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:credits,  followed  by  term  loans  /  large  loans  having  maturity  of  20  years  and  more  than 20 
64:3024:149865:17:16:72:526:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:years (table 5). To resolve this  issue, the  loan  syndication technique  might be considered  as 
64:3025:149964:16:17:72:526:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an   effective   financial   tool.   However,   proper   application   of   this   technique   requires 
64:3026:150068:17:16:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cooperation, sincerity and transparency among banks, practices which are seen to be absent in 
64:3027:150162:16:17:72:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  country  at  present.  Moreover,  bankers  have  been  observed  to  engage  in  unhealthy 
64:3028:150258:17:17:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competition  in the  market.  Therefore, another  issue  is  how to exercise syndicated  financing 
64:3029:150357:17:16:72:434:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:technique minimizing unhealthy competition among banks in Bangladesh.  
64:3030:150427:16:17:72:75:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
64:3031:150427:17:16:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally,  maintenance  of  an  ethical  standard  in  the  banking  profession  from  all  concerns  can 
64:3032:150532:16:17:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be  viewed  as  an  important  means  for  making  the  credit  environment  credible  and  vibrant. 
64:3033:150633:17:16:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ethics  contributes  great  deals  to  fair  practices  of  lending  when  law  itself  becomes  impotent 
64:3034:150739:16:17:72:526:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:due to invisible contingencies. Hence, the importance of ethics in financial institutions should 
64:3035:150836:17:17:72:164:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not be overlooked.

64:3037:150854:16:9:72:206:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:7.2 Concluding Remarks: 
64:3038:150877:9:13:72:73:236:4:Times New Roman:4:Times New Roman: 
64:3039:150877:13:17:72:527:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:More than 20 years have passed since the adoption of prudential norms in the banking system 
64:3040:150968:17:16:72:526:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of Bangladesh in 1990. Unfortunately, the banking system is still burdened with an alarming 
64:3041:151060:16:17:72:529:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount  of  NPLs  and  lags  far  behind  the  neighboring  countries  of  India  and  Sri  Lanka.  
64:3042:151160:17:16:72:526:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Although   Bangladesh   has   to   a   large   degree   adopted   international   standards   of   loan 
64:3043:151264:16:17:72:526:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classification and provisioning, the  management of  NPLs  is  found  ineffective, as the  system 
64:3044:151362:17:17:72:526:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has  failed  to  arrest  fresh  NPLs  significantly.  It  needs  to  be  mentioned  that  management  of 
64:3045:151467:17:16:72:526:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:NPLs must be multi-pronged, with different strategies pursued at the different stages through 
64:3046:151560:16:17:72:526:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which a credit facility passes. Measures should be in place for both prevention and resolution.
