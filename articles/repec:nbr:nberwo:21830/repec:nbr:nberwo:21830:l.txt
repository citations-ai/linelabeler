2:34:2005:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:I analyze recent federal minimum wage increases using the Current Population Survey.  The relevant
2:35:2103:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:minimum wage increases were differentially binding across states, generating natural comparison
2:36:2198:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:groups.  I first estimate a standard difference-in-differences model on samples restricted to relatively
2:37:2302:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:low-skilled individuals, as described by their ages and education levels.  I also employ a triple-difference
2:38:2410:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:framework that utilizes continuous variation in the minimum wage's bite across skill groups.  In both
2:39:2511:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:frameworks, estimates are robust to adopting a range of alternative strategies, including matching on
2:40:2612:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the size of states' housing declines, to account for variation in the Great Recession's severity across
2:41:2715:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:states.  My baseline estimate is that this period's full set of minimum wage increases reduced employment
2:42:2820:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:among individuals ages 16 to 30 with less than a high school education by 5.6 percentage points.  This
2:43:2922:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:estimate accounts for 43 percent of the sustained, 13 percentage point decline in this skill group's employment
2:44:3033:14:42:72:533:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:rate and a 0.49 percentage point decline in employment across the full population ages 16 to 64.

3:65:4368:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Notowidigdo,2013).   Additional  research  emphasizes  macroeconomic  factors  ranging

4:79:5516:24:24:89:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Clemens and Wither (2014b) analyze recent minimum wage increases’ effects using

4:81:5678:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:makes use of the fact that this period’s federal minimum wage increases were differen-
4:82:5764:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tially binding across states, generating natural comparison groups.  As discussed below,
4:83:5852:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the SIPP has both advantages and disadvantages for analyzing these differentially bind-
4:84:5939:24:24:72:226:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing minimum wage changes.
4:85:5964:24:24:89:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The current paper analyzes this historical episode using the Current Population Sur-
4:86:6048:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vey (CPS). While the CPS lacks some of the SIPP’s novel features, it has advantages with
4:87:6136:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regards to data quality and the horizon over which it permits analysis. Because the CPS
4:88:6223:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:underlies the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) unemployment series, in-sample employ-

4:90:6393:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As shown below, this paper’s findings reinforce Clemens and Wither’s (2014b) conclu-
4:91:6477:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sion that this period’s minimum wage increases had significant, negative effects on low-
4:92:6565:24:24:72:230:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:skilled workers’ employment.
4:93:6593:24:24:89:544:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:My analysis employs two estimation frameworks. I first conduct a standard difference-
4:94:6678:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in-differences analysis of the employment of a particularly low-skilled group, namely in-
4:95:6767:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dividuals ages16to30with less than a high school education. I then introduce a triple-
4:96:6853:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:difference  extension  of  the  difference-in-differences  framework.   The  latter  framework
4:97:6947:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exploits variation in the minimum wage’s bite across skill groups that fully partition the
4:98:7037:24:24:72:203:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:working age population.
4:99:7060:24:23:89:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The primary threat to these research designs is the possibility that low-skilled work-
4:100:7146:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ers were differentially affected by the Great Recession in states that were fully versus par-
4:101:7239:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tially bound by this period’s federal minimum wage increases. House price data make it
4:102:7325:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:apparent that the housing crisis was relatively severe in states that were partially bound.
4:103:7416:24:0:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Macroeconomic conditions thus had a more negative effect on employment among low-
5:104:7498:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:skilled  workers  in  partially  bound  states  than  in  fully  bound  states.   This  will  tend  to
5:105:7600:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bias estimated effects of this period’s minimum wage increases on employment towards
5:106:7684:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:zero. In the basic difference-in-differences framework, I take two approaches to address-
5:107:7773:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing this concern. My simplest approach is to control directly for a proxy for the housing
5:108:7862:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decline’s  severity,  namely  the  all-transactions  median  house  price  index  produced  by
5:109:7956:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Within this approach, I then explore the
5:110:8039:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline’s sensitivity to controlling further  for a variety of macroeconomic aggregates,
5:111:8128:24:24:72:524:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:including stimulus spending through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.
5:112:8207:24:24:89:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:My baseline estimate is that the differentially binding portion of this period’s mini-

5:114:8374:24:23:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a high school education by3.7percentage points.  Controlling for additional macroeco-
5:115:8459:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nomic  covariates  has  little  impact  on  this  estimate.   By  contrast,  taking  no  measure  to
5:116:8559:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account for variation in the housing decline’s severity results in a downwardly biased
5:117:8645:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate.   Employment  among  young,  low-education  adults  declined  by1percentage
5:118:8730:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:point more in fully bound states than in partially bound states in spite of the fact that
5:119:8819:24:24:72:421:349:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:the latter states’ housing declines were significantly more severe.1
5:120:8887:24:24:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Within the difference-in-differences framework, my second approach involves match-
5:121:8969:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing states on the basis of the severity of their housing declines.  In the baseline version
5:122:9060:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  this  approach,  I  restrict  the  sample  to  matches  for  which  the  difference  in  the  me-
5:123:9161:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dian house price decline was less than $10,000.  Using this criterion, I estimate that the
5:124:9251:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differentially binding portion of this period’s minimum wage increases reduced the em-
5:125:9337:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment of low-skilled individuals by3.8percentage points.  This estimate involves no
5:126:9423:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:additional effort to control for heterogeneity in the Great Recession’s severity. Including
5:127:9514:24:36:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the controls used in the more basic difference-in-differences design results in an estimate
5:128:9605:36:16:88:540:122:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:1As discussed in section3, the implied magnitude of the bias associated with taking no steps to account
5:129:9708:16:11:72:540:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:for variation in the housing decline’s severity is roughly what one can infer using external estimates from
5:130:9815:11:0:72:253:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2013).
6:131:9855:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:just over4percentage points.  Allowing the threshold for what constitutes a sufficiently
6:132:9943:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:good  match  to  range  from  $5,000to  $20,000has  essentially  no  effect  on  the  resulting
6:133:10038:24:24:72:123:660:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:estimate.2
6:134:10048:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:My second estimation framework utilizes additional variation in the extent to which
6:135:10131:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:minimum  wage  increases  bite  the  wage  distributions  of  different  skill  groups.   Using
6:136:10226:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline  wage  information  from  the  CPS’s  Merged  Outgoing  Rotation  Groups  (CPS-
6:137:10314:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:MORG), I estimate variation in the minimum wage’s bite across age-by-education cells.3
6:138:10400:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:I  then  implement  a  triple-difference  estimation  framework  in  which  the  degree  of  the
6:139:10496:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:minimum  wage’s  bite  serves  as  a  continuous  treatment  variable.4This  approach  thus
6:140:10587:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:makes  more  extensive  use  of  the  information  on  treatment  intensity  that  can  be  har-
6:141:10683:24:23:72:355:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nessed in the CPS’s repeated cross sectional samples.
6:142:10736:23:24:89:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Like the difference-in-differences estimates, the estimates exploiting differential bite
6:143:10824:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across  skill  groups  provide  evidence  of  negative  effects  on  employment.  That  is,  they
6:144:10921:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide evidence that the differentially binding portion of this period’s minimum wage
6:145:11007:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases  reduced  the  employment  of  low-skilled  workers.    As  in  the  difference-in-
6:146:11100:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differences  results,  the  estimated  employment  declines  are  robust  to  augmenting  the
6:147:11193:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline  specification  with  additional  controls  for  the  evolution  of  macroeconomic  ag-
6:148:11289:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gregates. They are similarly robust to restricting the sample to “good” matches based on
6:149:11377:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the size of states’ housing declines.  Also as in the difference-in-differences framework,
6:150:11467:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates  on  the  matched  sample  are  robust  to  dropping  controls  for  macroeconomic
6:151:11559:24:24:72:187:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conditions altogether.
6:152:11581:24:44:89:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:I next assess my estimates’ implications for the effects of this period’s minimum wage
6:153:11667:44:19:88:499:161:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:2I also implement matching based on the percent decline rather than the level of the change.
6:154:11759:19:16:88:540:142:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:3The analysis includes a3age group by3education group approach and a5age group by4education

6:156:11865:16:15:88:539:110:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:4For  a  recent  example  of  a  similar  estimation  framework,  see  Hoynes  and  Schanzenbach’s  (2012)

7:158:12028:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases on aggregate employment.  From2006to2012, the average effective minimum
7:159:12109:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage rose by $1.72across the United States.  The differential change between fully and
7:160:12195:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:partially bound states was $0.62. Extrapolating from in-sample estimates to the full effect
7:161:12286:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the $1.72increase comes with standard caveats, which are discussed in section4.  My
7:162:12372:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline  estimate  is  that  this  period’s  minimum  wage  increases  reduced  employment
7:163:12463:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among individuals ages16to30with less than a high school degree by5.6percentage
7:164:12542:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:points.  This amounts to43percent of the decline in this group’s employment between
7:165:12625:24:24:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:2006and2012. Further, it accounts for a0.49percentage point decline in the employment
7:166:12710:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to population ratio across all individuals ages16to64.  This aggregate impact,  which
7:167:12795:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is derived exclusively from impacts on individuals ages16to30with less than a high
7:168:12877:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:school  education,  is  modestly  smaller  than  the  full-population  employment  estimate
7:169:12968:23:24:72:259:445:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:from Clemens and Wither (2014b).5
7:170:13001:24:24:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The paper proceeds as follows. Section1presents background information regarding

7:177:13587:155:16:88:540:122:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:5In the prior paper,  the SIPP’s panel structure enabled a more concentrated harnessing of the mini-

8:183:14069:23:24:72:539:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:On May25,2007, Congress legislated a series of minimum wage increases through the

8:186:14331:24:24:72:539:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:2007, the federal minimum rose from $5.15to $5.85, in July2008it rose to $6.55, and in
8:187:14417:24:24:72:204:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:July2009it rose to $7.25.

8:191:14685:24:24:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was below $6.55, rendering it at least partially bound by the July2008increase and fully

9:211:16258:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that  fully  bound  states  were  less  severely  impacted  by  the  Great  Recession  than  were

9:221:17047:24:24:72:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:criterion is that surveyed individuals be between16and64years of age.  The samples
9:222:17129:24:24:72:519:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are thus fully representative of the working age population during this time period.

9:229:17735:16:15:85:540:110:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:10Specifically, I use extracts generated using the Minnesota Population Center’s Integrated Public Use
9:230:17837:15:0:72:322:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Microsamples (Flood, King, Ruggles, and Warren,2015).

10:237:18384:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:MORG, I first construct an indicator equal to1if the individual’s self-reported wage rate
10:238:18473:24:48:72:229:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:falls between $5.15and $7.25:

10:243:18792:24:68:71:172:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, I construct:

10:249:19247:24:57:71:539:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across this set of skill groups is, unsurprisingly, strongest among individuals ages16to
10:250:19335:57:16:85:540:122:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:11Some workers report wage rates below the $5.15federal minimum.  Such cases reflect some combi-

11:256:19843:24:48:72:477:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relatively trivial bite on the wage distributions of higher skilled individuals.

11:258:19961:32:24:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:I begin my analysis by estimating the following difference-in-differences specification
11:259:20048:24:24:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:on a sample restricted to the most affected skill group, namely individuals ages16to30

11:265:20246:43:24:72:539:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The primary outcome variable of interest,Yi,s,t, is employment. The specification controls
11:266:20336:24:24:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for  the  standard  features  of  difference-in-differences  estimation,  namely  sets  of  state,
11:267:20434:24:24:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:States, and time, Timet, fixed effects.  The vectorXs,tcontains time varying controls for
11:268:20523:24:24:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:each state’s macroeconomic conditions. In my baseline specification,Xs,tincludes the all-

11:270:20698:24:38:72:191:239:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:of the housing crisis.13
11:271:20722:38:15:85:540:201:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:12In the construction ofAi,s,t,  I code individuals as0if they do not report being paid on any hourly
11:272:20823:15:12:71:539:186:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:basis.  Consequently,  the fractions are lower than what one would obtain if one made additional use of
11:273:20926:12:16:71:352:174:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:wage rates imputed on the basis of weekly earnings and hours.
11:274:20987:16:16:85:540:158:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:13It is not uncommon for minimum wage studies to control directly for a region’s overall employment or
11:275:21089:16:12:71:539:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:unemployment rate.  Econometrically, it is likely preferable to exclude such variables.  The policy change
11:276:21195:12:12:71:539:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:of  interest  may  directly  affect  statewide  employment,  for  example,  which  is  the  aggregate  outcome  of
11:277:21309:12:12:71:539:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:primary  interest.   Median  house  prices  are  less  subject  to  this  concern  for  two  reasons.   First,  many
11:278:21425:12:11:71:539:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:minimum wage workers are dependents.  Many of their incomes will thus have minimal impact on their
11:279:21523:11:0:71:539:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:households’ housing decisions.  Second,  even households headed by minimum wage workers will tend
12:280:21622:0:24:89:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Equation (3) allows for two potentially important sources of dynamics in the federal
12:281:21706:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:minimum  wage  legislation’s  effects.   First,  and  most  importantly,  the  legislation  was
12:282:21801:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:enacted  in  May2007,  with  wage  increases  going  into  effect  in  July  of2007,2008,  and
12:283:21895:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:2009.  The specification thus treats May2007through July2009as a period of transition
12:284:21980:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(periodp=Transition)  from  the  old  policy  regime  to  the  new  policy  regime.   Prior
12:285:22071:24:24:71:348:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:months correspond to the baseline, or periodp=0.
12:286:22119:24:24:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second,  as  in  Clemens  and  Wither  (2014b),  the  specification  allows  the  minimum
12:287:22208:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage’s effects to unfold differentially over the short- and medium-run.  I code August
12:288:22294:24:24:71:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:2009through July2010as period Post1and all subsequent months as period Post2. This
12:289:22376:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:straightforwardly allows for the possibility that firms’ and workers’ short- and medium-
12:290:22464:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:run  responses  may  differ.   Within  the  recent  minimum  wage  literature,  evidence  from
12:291:22558:23:24:71:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Aaronson, French, and Sorkin (2013), Meer and West (Forthcoming), and Sorkin (2015)
12:292:22641:24:24:71:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicates that such effects may be important.14The primary coefficients of interest are
12:293:22728:24:24:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f2:B:βPost1(t)andβPost2(t),  which  characterize  the  differential  evolution  of  employment  in
12:294:22821:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:states  that  were  fully  bound  by  the  new  federal  minimum  relative  to  states  that  were
12:295:22919:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:partially  bound.   I  calculate  the  standard  errors  on  these  coefficients  allowing  for  the
12:296:23019:24:48:71:311:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:errors,εi,s,t, to be correlated at the state level.

12:298:23125:32:24:89:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Within equation (3)’s difference-in-differences framework, I examine the results’ ro-
12:299:23210:24:24:71:539:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bustness to applying sample restrictions motivated by a matching procedure.  I match

12:301:23383:35:12:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:to  have  tangential  if  any  influence  on  the  housing  market  segments  in  which  median  home  values  are
12:302:23497:12:12:72:540:150:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:determined.  I present specifications with additional macroeconomic controls primarily to check whether
12:303:23600:12:12:72:540:138:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:my results are sensitive to the inclusion of controls used regularly in the literature. The results are affected
12:304:23712:12:16:72:277:126:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:little by the inclusion of these variables inXs,t.
12:305:23762:16:15:85:540:110:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:14In the current setting, the lag between legislation and full implementation is sufficiently long that the
12:306:23869:15:0:71:444:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:relevant dynamics might largely be expected to unfold during the transition period.
13:307:23954:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:values averaged across all months in these years).  The matches are thus based on the
13:308:24039:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:extent of the housing decline from the first to the last year of the baseline analysis sam-
13:309:24130:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ple.   To  be  more  precise  regarding  the  procedure,  I  apply  nearest  neighbor  matching
13:310:24225:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:without  replacement.   I  then  restrict  the  sample  on  the  basis  of  the  quality  of  the  re-
13:311:24327:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sulting matches. For example, the baseline matching sample requires that the difference
13:312:24414:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in matched states’ housing declines be no greater than $10,000.15I explore the results’

15:372:28944:24:24:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  high  school  degree.   Conditional  on  the  decline  in  states’  median  house  prices,  em-
15:373:29042:24:24:72:539:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment within this skill group declined by3.7percentage points more in fully bound
15:374:29126:24:24:72:539:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:states than in partially bound states.  This is an economically substantial28percent of

15:376:29304:24:24:72:539:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:group accounts for8.4percent of the working age population, the associated in-sample

16:380:29644:24:24:89:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For columns2and3,  I estimate equation (3) on samples of higher-skilled workers.
16:381:29724:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The sample in column2includes skill groups for which the minimum wage’s “bite,” as

16:383:29885:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this group’s employment is a negative,  statistically insignificant -1.1percentage points
16:384:29974:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the short run and -0.5percentage point in the medium run.  The sample in column
16:385:30056:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3includes skill groups for which the minimum wage’s “bite,” as reported in column3
16:386:30138:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of Table1, was less than0.015.  The estimated change in this group’s employment is an
16:387:30223:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:even smaller, and again statistically insignificant, -0.4percentage point in the short run
16:388:30313:24:23:72:315:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and -0.0percentage point in the medium run.
16:389:30356:23:24:89:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Across broad skill groups, the magnitudes of the estimates in Table3are monotoni-

16:391:30524:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the highest of these broad skill groups is economically quite close to0.  The employ-
16:392:30613:24:24:72:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment decline estimated in column1thus does not appear to be associated with employ-
16:393:30696:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment declines among skill groups that would implausibly be affected by increases in the
16:394:30783:24:24:72:159:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:minimum wage.
16:395:30796:24:24:89:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  estimates  associated  with  the  housing  price  index  are  also  informative.   The
16:396:30887:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:housing price index is strongly, positively correlated with employment among individu-
16:397:30973:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:als in each skill group. Consistent with findings from Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo
16:398:31059:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2013), this is particularly true among the lowest skilled.  For the lowest skilled, the es-
16:399:31151:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:timate implies that a $100,000decline in median house prices predicts a2.8percentage
16:400:31235:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:point decline in employment. The associated estimate for relatively high skilled workers
16:401:31323:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is that a $100,000decline in median house prices predicts a0.5percentage point decline
16:402:31409:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  employment.   An  implication  of  this  finding  for  estimates  that  pool  high  and  low
16:403:31505:24:0:72:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:skilled workers, as in estimates of equation (4), is that the coefficients on proxies for the
17:404:31600:0:48:72:447:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:housing decline’s severity must be allowed to vary across skill groups.

17:406:31736:33:24:89:539:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table4explores  the  relevance  of  the  inclusion  of  macroeconomic  controls  for  the

17:408:31912:23:24:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Column3shows that controlling additionally for macroeconomic aggregates including
17:409:31993:24:24:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  statewide  employment  rate  and  personal  income  per  capita  yields  an  estimate  of
17:410:32087:24:24:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:-3.3percentage  points.17Column4shows  that  controlling  additionally  for  stimulus
17:411:32172:24:24:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:spending associated with the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act has no effect on
17:412:32256:24:24:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this estimate.18Consistent with Clemens and Wither’s (2014b) analysis using the SIPP,
17:413:32341:24:24:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:columns3and4thus show that the baseline estimate is little affected by incorporating
17:414:32425:24:24:72:271:436:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:additional macroeconomic controls.19
17:415:32461:24:24:89:539:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Column5shows that, as implied by the data from Figure3, taking no measures to
17:416:32538:24:24:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:control for variation in the severity of the housing crisis yields a downwardly biased es-
17:417:32628:24:24:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:timate. Specifically, it shows that employment among individuals ages16to30with less
17:418:32712:24:23:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than a high school degree declined by1percentage point more in fully bound states than
17:419:32798:23:24:71:539:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in partially bound states in spite of the fact that the housing crisis was much more severe
17:420:32889:24:36:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among partially bound states. The differential effect of the housing decline thus obscures
17:421:32979:36:16:85:540:257:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:17As discussed in Section2,  the inclusion of these controls is less econometrically attractive than the
17:422:33083:16:12:71:539:241:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:inclusion of the median house price index. I present specifications with these additional controls primarily
17:423:33191:12:16:71:539:229:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:to show that my results are relatively insensitive to the inclusion of controls used regularly in the literature.
17:424:33304:16:15:85:540:213:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:18The stimulus variable is constructed using data from Chodorow-Reich, Feiveson, Liscow, and Wool-
17:425:33402:15:12:71:540:198:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:ston (2012). Consistent with Chodorow-Reich, Feiveson, Liscow, and Woolston’s (2012) findings, I obtain a

18:436:34443:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:one can infer using external estimates from Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2013).20
18:437:34528:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Because the housing decline is so relevant, the persuasiveness of the results rests in part
18:438:34619:24:24:71:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the consistency of the estimates obtained using equations (3) and (4), the robustness
18:439:34707:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of each baseline to the matching strategy,  the robustness of each baseline to the incor-

18:442:34967:24:24:89:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table5shows that the estimates in Table4are moderately reduced by expanding the
18:443:35046:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline  period  to  include2005.   A  comparison  of  Table4and  Table5’s  first  columns
18:444:35137:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provides an explanation for this result.  The dependent variable in these columns is the
18:445:35225:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level  of  states’  effective  minimum  wage  rates.   The  reported  coefficients  thus  describe
18:446:35323:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the differential change, from the full pre-legislation period to the post-implementation
18:447:35411:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period, in fully and partially bound states’ average effective minimum wage rates.  Ex-
18:448:35498:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:panding the base period reduces this differential change, reflecting the fact that some of
18:449:35588:24:24:71:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the partially bound states increased their minimum wage rates between2005and2006.
18:450:35669:24:24:72:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The estimated employment decline per $1increase in the minimum wage is essentially

18:457:36321:12:12:72:539:202:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:The housing decline was, on average, moderately less than1standard deviation (of the distribution across
18:458:36425:12:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:all states) larger in partially bound states than in fully bound states. If my estimation sample consisted of
18:459:36534:12:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:a skill group that exhibited the same sensitivity to housing demand, Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo’s
18:460:36636:12:12:72:539:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:(2013)  estimates  would  suggest  a  bias  of  just  under0.8percentage  points.  The  actual  bias  exceeds  this
18:461:36751:12:12:71:540:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:because, as shown in Table3, the employment of high school dropouts ages16to30was more sensitive
18:462:36847:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:to the housing crisis than the employment of other groups.  For this group, the coefficient on the housing
18:463:36953:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:price index was0.28.  When I estimate this coefficient on a sample containing all individuals ages21to
18:464:37055:12:12:72:539:118:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:55, I obtain a coefficient of0.10. The bias suggested by Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo’s (2013) estimate
18:465:37161:12:11:71:540:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:is thus on the order of 0.8×0.280.10≈2.4.  This is roughly the difference between the estimates reported in
18:466:37268:11:0:72:298:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Table4’s column5relative to columns2through4.

19:483:38661:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:line, low-skilled workers’ employment in fully bound states exceeded their counterparts’

20:511:40909:24:24:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decline  in  hours,  including  both  extensive  and  intensive  margin  adjustments,  was  be-
20:512:41004:24:24:72:539:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tween1.7and1.8hours per week.  This1.8hour decline accounts for an economically
20:513:41083:24:24:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:substantial17percent of this skill group’s labor input at baseline.  Column5shows that
20:514:41169:24:24:72:539:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the decline in weekly hours conditional employment was roughly1.3over the long run.
20:515:41252:24:24:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The net stability of the number of part time jobs thus appears to reflect two offsetting
20:516:41340:24:23:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects.  The first effect is a conversion of some full time work into part time work.  The
20:517:41431:23:0:72:406:96:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:second effect is the elimination of some initially part time jobs.

21:523:41920:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earnings over the short run and a $13decline over the medium run.22These declines
21:524:42001:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:follow directly from the overall reductions in hours. At the new minimum wage of $7.25,
21:525:42088:24:24:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a decline of1.8hours per week translates directly into a $13decline in weekly earnings.

21:528:42344:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the differential bite of this period’s minimum wage increases on the lowest-skilled

21:530:42527:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:points.  This largely reflects three factors.  First,  individuals in this skill group worked
21:531:42620:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in just under40percent of months at baseline.  Second, during months when these in-
21:532:42703:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dividuals were employed, their self-reported wage rates were between the old and new
21:533:42787:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:federal minimum roughly one third of the time.  Finally, some of the instances when in-
21:534:42874:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dividuals report wage rates in the affected range involve employment in uncovered jobs
21:535:42960:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(e.g., workers who receive tips). The minimum wage increases’ mechanical contribution
21:536:43045:24:28:71:443:277:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:B:to this group’s average weekly earnings turns out to be less than $3.23
21:537:43116:28:15:85:539:249:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:22These estimates relate quite closely to estimates from Clemens and Wither (2014b).  The prior paper
21:538:43217:15:12:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:analyzes a more concentrated sample of low wage workers. That paper’s estimates of employment effects
21:539:43318:12:12:72:540:222:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:and  declines  in  average  earnings  are  correspondingly  moderately  larger.    For  example,  Clemens  and
21:540:43428:12:12:72:539:210:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Wither (2014b) estimate a $90short run decline in average monthly earnings, which is moderately larger
21:541:43530:12:12:72:539:198:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:the monthly decline implied by a $15decline in weekly earnings. Clemens (Forthcoming) further analyzes
21:542:43632:12:12:72:539:186:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:the implications of Clemens and Wither’s (2014b) estimates for payroll tax revenues and spending through
21:543:43736:12:16:72:248:174:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:a variety of public assistance programs.
21:544:43776:16:16:85:540:158:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:23The steps in this calculation are as follows.  First, the minimum wage increases’ differential bite on
21:545:43880:16:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:this skill group’s wage distribution, in fully bound states relative to partially bound states, was5percent
21:546:43987:12:12:72:539:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:of survey months as reported in Table1.  Second, this skill group’s average hours of work when working
21:547:44089:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:is27.  The product of these values would thus yield a $2.84increase in weekly earnings in fully bound
21:548:44190:12:11:71:540:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:F:states  relative  to  partially  bound  states  if  the  minimum  wage’s  bite  in  each  instance  was  the  full  $2.10
21:549:44311:11:0:71:539:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:increase  from  $5.15to  $7.25.   This  is  an  upper  bound  because  affected  workers’  initial  wage  rates  were

22:554:44691:24:24:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:involves stacking the skill groups on which separate difference-in-differences regressions

22:564:45542:24:24:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by Charles,  Hurst,  and Notowidigdo (2013) and shown directly in Table3,  I allow the

22:566:45703:24:24:89:539:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The estimates in Table10provide evidence that, comparing changes in fully bound

22:568:45870:24:24:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases experienced greater declines in employment. The estimates, which fall between

22:570:46047:24:24:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comparing fully bound states to partially bound states, employment in the lowest skill

22:572:46222:24:41:72:539:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:highest  skill  groups  was  essentially  unchanged.   Next,  recall  Table1’s  presentation  of

22:574:46383:16:15:85:540:110:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:24Note that if these controls were not allowed to vary across groups they would be perfectly collinear

23:585:47228:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that allow the minimum wage’s bite to vary across9skill groups, while Table12allows
23:586:47311:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for20skill groups.  As with the estimates reported in Table7,  none of these specifica-

23:588:47486:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thus reveal that the estimated employment effects are robust to applying the matching

25:647:52317:24:43:71:539:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates suggest that estimates of aggregate employment impacts that assume effects

25:649:52509:16:12:72:540:138:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:also worth noting that fully saturated triple difference models are not sensitive to this form of specification

27:687:55588:24:24:89:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Extrapolating the estimates from Table3requires sensitivity to the fact that the em-
27:688:55672:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment effects of minimum wage increases may be non-linear, likely with larger effects
27:689:55760:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for final increments than for initial increases. Further, a given nominal value of the min-
27:690:55851:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imum wage has more purchasing power, and hence likely more bite, in the typical fully
27:691:55936:24:24:71:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound  state  relative  to  the  typical  partially  bound  state.   Figure3showed  that  fully
27:692:56031:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound states have relatively low incomes and housing costs, perhaps making it unsur-
27:693:56115:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prising that they had not voluntarily brought their minimums to the levels seen in the
27:694:56201:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:partially  bound  states.   Indeed,  the  July2009increase  in  the  federal  minimum  wage
27:695:56292:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:brought  the  minimum  to  nearly50percent  of  the  median  wage  in  many  fully  bound
27:696:56381:24:24:71:495:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:states, and did so during the weakest national labor market of the last75years.
27:697:56460:24:24:89:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The extrapolation proceeds as follows. My in-sample estimate is that the differentially
27:698:56547:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:binding portion of this period’s minimum wage increases reduced the employment of
27:699:56628:24:23:71:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individuals ages16to30with less than a high school education by3.7percentage points
27:700:56711:23:24:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(9percent).   The95percent  confidence  interval  on  this  estimate  extends  from1.5to
27:701:56799:24:24:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:5.9percentage points.  Applying the relevant sample weights, this group accounted for
27:702:56884:24:24:71:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:8.4percent of the full population ages16to64.  A3.7percentage point decline in this
27:703:56967:24:0:71:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:group’s employment thus implies an 8.4×0.037=0.31 percentage point decline in fully
28:704:57052:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound states’ employment to population ratios. The confidence interval on this estimate
28:705:57139:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:extends from0.13to0.49percentage point.  Because fully bound states account for41
28:706:57220:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent of the full U.S. population, the purely in-sample decline in employment implies
28:707:57307:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a 0.31×0.41≈0.13 percentage point decline in the national, working-age employment
28:708:57388:24:24:72:175:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to population ratio.
28:709:57408:24:24:89:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The0.13percentage point decline in the national employment to population ratio is
28:710:57489:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  purely  in-sample  estimate  for  the  differential  change  in  the  minimum  wage  in  fully
28:711:57586:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound states relative to partially bound states.  That is, it is an estimate of the effect of
28:712:57679:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a $0.62differential increase in the minimum wage in states that account for41percent
28:713:57763:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  working  age  population.   On  average  across  all  states,  the  effective  minimum
28:714:57858:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage  rose  by  $1.72over  this  time  period.   A  purely  linear  extrapolation,  both  within
28:715:57954:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  across  states,  thus  implies  an  aggregate  effect  of  roughly  0.13×1.41×1.72.62≈0.86
28:716:58049:24:24:72:164:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percentage point.
28:717:58066:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:My baseline extrapolation splits the difference between a purely linear extrapolation
28:718:58151:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and failing to extrapolate at all.  I estimate that this period’s minimum wage increases
28:719:58239:24:24:72:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account for a0.49percentage point decline in the employment to population ratio among
28:720:58324:24:24:72:539:325:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:B:allindividuals ages16to64. This estimate is derived solely from estimated employment
28:721:58408:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:declines  among  individuals  ages16to30with  less  than  a  high  school  degree,  as  my

28:723:58581:24:35:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups  were  relatively  imprecise.28Among  individuals  ages16to30with  less  than
28:724:58665:35:16:85:539:218:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:28In Figure6’s panels C and D, the2010and2014wage distributions provide additional,  suggestive
28:725:58760:16:12:71:539:202:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:evidence that this period’s minimum wage increases reduced employment among the lowest-skilled in-
28:726:58858:12:12:71:539:190:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:dividuals in slightly higher observable skill groups.  The panels plot wage distributions for high school
28:727:58963:12:12:71:539:178:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:dropouts between ages31and45. The relevant feature of this group’s real wages, as shown in Panel C, is
28:728:59065:12:12:71:540:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:F:that the2010and2014distributions were indistinguishable from one another at all wage rates above $7.25
28:729:59167:12:12:71:540:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:in  nominal  terms.   That  is,  the  real  wages  of  individuals  in  percentiles1through55of  this  skill  group
28:730:59282:12:12:71:539:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:were essentially the same in2014as in2010. Between2010and2014, the real value of the minimum wage
28:731:59379:12:12:71:540:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:declined by8percent, from $7.25to $6.68in2010dollars. In2014, the figure reveals that employment had
28:732:59479:12:12:71:539:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:emerged at wage rates between $7.25and $6.68(again in2010dollars).  Erosion of the minimum wage’s
28:733:59576:12:11:71:540:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:real value corresponded with a3percentage point, or5percent, increase in this skill group’s employment
28:734:59678:11:0:71:539:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:rate.  The absence of shifts elsewhere in the wage distribution is suggestive that, as the minimum wage’s

29:736:59879:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employment by5.6percentage points.  This amounts to43percent of the decline in this

29:738:60023:56:37:72:282:604:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f5:C:5Concluding Discussion
29:739:60045:37:24:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:I  conclude  by  briefly  recapitulating  the  key  elements  and  findings  of  this  paper’s
29:740:60139:24:24:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analysis.   I  analyze  the  effects  of  recent  federal  minimum  wage  increases,  which  were
29:741:60236:24:24:72:540:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differentially binding across states.  Because these minimum wage increases took effect
29:742:60323:24:24:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:during the Great Recession, I document heterogeneity in the housing decline’s severity
29:743:60409:24:24:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and implement several approaches to accounting for its influence on low-skilled workers’
29:744:60497:24:23:72:142:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employment.
29:745:60508:23:24:89:539:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:My analysis of this period’s minimum wage increases’ effects has the following struc-
29:746:60593:24:24:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ture.   First,  I  take  a  straightforward  approach  to  controlling  for  heterogeneity  in  the
29:747:60692:24:24:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:housing decline’s severity within a standard difference-in-differences specification.  Sec-
29:748:60783:24:24:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ond, I show that controlling for additional macroeconomic covariates has little effect on
29:749:60872:24:24:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  initial  estimates.   Third,  I  show  that  the  bias  associated  with  making  no  attempt
29:750:60970:24:24:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to control for heterogeneity in the housing decline’s severity is of a magnitude in line
29:751:61058:24:24:72:539:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with what one can infer from Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo’s (2013) analysis of the
29:752:61143:24:24:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:housing  boom  and  bust.   Fourth,  I  show  that  the  results  are  robust  to  implementing
29:753:61238:24:24:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:triple-difference specifications that make relatively extensive use of variation in the min-
29:754:61330:24:23:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imum  wage’s  relevance  across  skill  groups.   Finally,  I  show  that  the  results  from  both
29:755:61429:23:31:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the difference-in-differences and triple-difference specifications are robust to accounting
29:756:61520:31:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:real value eroded, we are observing movement down a labor demand curve.  A similar picture emerges
29:757:61618:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:among  individuals  ages16to30with  exactly  a  high  school  degree.   By  contrast,  employment  among
29:758:61722:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:individuals ages16to30with less than a high school degree did not recover between2010and2014.  As
29:759:61819:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:shown in Panel A, this group’s real wage distribution shifted modestly down between2010and2014, such
29:760:61919:12:11:71:540:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:that its nominal wage distribution (and with it the $7.25minimum wage rate’s bite) had not shifted (Panel
29:761:62024:11:0:71:537:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:B). The $7.25minimum wage was thus similarly binding on this group’s wage distribution in both years.
30:762:62127:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for  heterogeneity  in  the  housing  decline’s  severity  using  a  standard  matching  proce-
30:763:62222:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dure.  The evidence supports the view that this period’s minimum wage increases had
30:764:62305:24:0:72:417:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant, negative effects on low-skilled workers’ employment.

56:1022:100991:24:24:89:539:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  current  paper’s  analysis  relates  most  closely  to  the  analysis  in  Clemens  and
56:1023:101083:24:24:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Wither (2014b). My estimation frameworks mirror those in Clemens and Wither (2014b)
56:1024:101166:24:24:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as closely as possible.  They are the repeated cross sectional analogs of the prior paper’s

56:1026:101356:24:24:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explore whether CPS data cross validate the prior paper’s analysis of SIPP samples from

56:1029:101559:24:24:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cussing.   The  CPS  enjoys  advantages  with  regards  to  data  quality  and  the  time  frame
56:1030:101655:24:24:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:over which I am able to construct analysis samples. A first point worth noting is that the
56:1031:101745:24:23:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:CPS underlies national statistical agencies’ best estimates of the unemployment rate at
56:1032:101832:23:24:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both the state and national levels.  As noted above, this paper’s analysis samples cover
56:1033:101920:24:24:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the full universe of CPS respondents ages16to64. In-sample employment changes thus
56:1034:102002:24:24:71:540:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:map  directly  into  national  employment  statistics.   Second,  the2008SIPP  panel  begins
56:1035:102094:24:24:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:during the summer of2008, limiting the analysis in Clemens and Wither (2014b) to an
56:1036:102177:24:33:71:540:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interval  spanning  the  July2009increase  in  the  federal  minimum  wage.29By  contrast,
56:1037:102267:33:15:85:539:110:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:29A  related  point  is  that  Clemens  and  Wither’s  (2014b)  approach  to  identifying  affected  individuals
56:1038:102379:15:0:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:relies  on  observed  wage  rates,  and  thus  generates  samples  of  individuals  who  were  employed  for  at
57:1039:102493:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the CPS allows me to initiate samples in the years preceding the May2007legislation
57:1040:102576:24:24:71:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behind this period’s minimum wage increases.  This makes it possible to investigate the

57:1042:102731:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The SIPP, by contrast, has advantages with respect to the identification of low-skilled
57:1043:102818:24:24:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers  and  the  outcomes  it  is  able  to  track.   Monthly  panel  data  makes  it  possible
57:1044:102915:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  identify  affected  workers  with  greater  precision  than  the  demographic  and  indus-

57:1046:103110:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Wither (2014b) uses12months of wage and employment information,  extending from
57:1047:103189:24:24:71:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:August2008through July2009, to identify workers whose wage rates would be affected
57:1048:103271:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by  the  July2009minimum  wage  increase.   The  analysis  shows  that  such  individuals
57:1049:103360:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:were  roughly3times  as  likely  to  report  wage  rates  between  the  old  and  new  federal

57:1057:104012:12:12:72:540:277:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f2:F:intoemployment.  The analysis does, however, include separate estimates of transitions into employment

58:1089:106801:24:24:71:539:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tant for two reasons.  First,  teenagers are less relevant than low-skilled adults from an

58:1091:106985:39:15:85:540:225:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:32Somewhat earlier work on particular demographic groups, such as teenagers, includes Card (1992a),
58:1092:107084:15:12:72:539:210:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Card (1992b), Neumark and Wascher (1995), and Currie and Fallick (1996). Additional work on teenagers
58:1093:107185:12:12:72:540:198:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:and/or  specific  industries,  like  food  service  and  retail,  includes  Katz  and  Krueger  (1992),  Card  and

58:1096:107510:12:16:72:106:162:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:growth.
58:1097:107517:16:16:85:539:146:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:33As emphasized by Burkhauser and Sabia (2007) and Sabia and Burkhauser (2010), it is primarily low-
58:1098:107617:16:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:skilled adults, rather than teenage dependents, who are the intended beneficiaries of anti-poverty efforts.
58:1099:107724:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:In the European context, Dolado, Kramarz, Machin, Manning, Margolis, Teulings, Saint-Paul, and Keen
58:1100:107823:12:11:72:540:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:(1996) observed during the mid-1990s that teenagers, at that time, accounted for a relatively small share
58:1101:107928:11:0:72:178:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:of all low-paid workers.
59:1102:107954:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dependents and less likely to have dependents of their own.  Additionally, teenage em-
59:1103:108040:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment is now significantly less common than it was30, or even15, years ago. Between
59:1104:108126:24:24:71:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:2003and the present, the teenage employment rate’s peak was at37.4percent in Febru-
59:1105:108209:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ary2004.   In2012it  averaged26.4percent.   By  contrast,  the  teenage  employment  rate
59:1106:108298:24:24:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:averaged44percent over the1980s and1990s.  Early analyses of teenagers, for example
59:1107:108381:24:24:71:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:those of Card (1992a,b), thus involved periods during which teenage employment was
59:1108:108463:24:24:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a more prominent phenomenon.  In the current labor market, teenage employment is a
59:1109:108545:24:24:71:234:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less relevant object of analysis.
59:1110:108578:24:24:89:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, labor demand elasticities may vary across both industries and demographic
59:1111:108659:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups. This would be expected, for example, if the shapes of within-skill-group produc-
59:1112:108747:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tivity distributions vary meaningfully across groups. A similar point applies to analyses
59:1113:108836:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of food service establishments.  While it is interesting to observe how such firms adjust,
59:1114:108926:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:food service establishments likely face different input substitution and output demand
59:1115:109012:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticities  than  firms  in  other  sectors.   Direct  analysis  of  the  minimum  wage’s  effects
59:1116:109112:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across sectors is thus preferable to inferring economy-wide effects using estimates asso-
59:1117:109201:24:24:71:316:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ciated with food service establishments alone.

60:1133:110483:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analyzed  in  Table8.   I  estimate  that  the  differentially  binding  portion  of  this  period’s
60:1134:110583:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:minimum wage increases reduced teenage employment by nearly2percentage points.
60:1135:110661:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The point estimates are thus non-trivially smaller than the estimated impact on individ-

60:1139:111028:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this particular historical episode, analyses of teenagers thus appear to have less power

60:1146:111611:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:readily  at  hand.   As  shown  in  Table2,  partially  bound  states’  housing  declines  were
60:1147:111706:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significantly less severe than fully bound states’ housing declines.  As also noted above,
60:1148:111796:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates from Charles,  Hurst,  and Notowidigdo (2013) make it possible to gauge the

60:1150:111979:23:24:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:states.  I thus adopt a baseline specification with several relevant characteristics.  First, I
60:1151:112074:24:24:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:take a straightforward approach to controlling directly for heterogeneity in the housing
60:1152:112162:24:0:71:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:declines’ severity.  Second, I demonstrate that controlling for additional macroeconomic
61:1153:112252:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:covariates  leaves  the  baseline  estimates  little  changed.35Third,  I  show  that  the  bias
61:1154:112348:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:associated with making no attempt to control for heterogeneity in the housing declines’
61:1155:112435:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:severity is of the expected sign and magnitude. Fourth, I show that the results are robust
61:1156:112525:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to implementing triple-difference extensions that make more extensive use of variation
61:1157:112611:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the minimum wage’s relevance across skill groups.  Fifth, I show that the results are
61:1158:112699:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:robust to accounting for heterogeneity in the housing decline’s severity using a standard
61:1159:112788:24:24:72:183:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matching procedure.
61:1160:112807:24:24:89:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  the  analyses  in  this  paper  and  Clemens  and  Wither  (2014b)  hew  closely  to
61:1161:112901:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:standard program evaluation methods.  This contrasts with what Addison,  Blackburn,
61:1162:112984:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Cotti (2013) describe as the traditional estimation of “standard minimum-wage em-
61:1163:113069:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment equations.” It is increasingly recognized that the traditional approach embeds
61:1164:113156:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quite strong assumptions regarding the dynamics with which a minimum wage change
61:1165:113236:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:influences employment.  It can also obscure dynamics linked to lags between legislation
61:1166:113323:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and implementation.  Because lags between legislation and implementation may differ
61:1167:113406:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significantly across natural experiments, this can be particularly problematic for studies
61:1168:113496:24:24:72:416:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the longer panel of state and federal minimum wage changes.
61:1169:113558:24:24:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Implementation lags and dynamics at least partially underly observers’ difficulty in
61:1170:113642:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:adjudicating the empirical debate over historical minimum wage changes’ effects.  The
61:1171:113727:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debate within the literature suggests that analyses of the longer panel of minimum wage
61:1172:113814:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes  are  sensitive  to  a  combination  of  specification  choices  and  sample  selection
61:1173:113909:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:procedures.36Given  the  diversity  of  natural  experiments  involved,  it  seems  unlikely
61:1174:114001:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that any one approach to selecting control groups or any one specification of dynamics
61:1175:114087:23:28:72:253:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would be universally appropriate.
61:1176:114120:28:16:85:540:154:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:35The point estimates decline modestly in the full sample analysis and increase modestly in the analysis
61:1177:114224:16:16:72:420:138:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:of samples in which states were matched on the size of their housing declines.
61:1178:114302:16:16:85:540:122:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:36The discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of various estimation strategies by Dolado, Kramarz,
61:1179:114403:16:11:72:539:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Machin,  Manning,  Margolis,  Teulings,  Saint-Paul,  and  Keen  (1996)  is,  in  many  respects,  quite  prescient
61:1180:114518:11:0:72:330:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:regarding sources of disagreement in the recent literature.
62:1181:114579:0:24:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A key element of the program evaluation approach adopted here is the visual pre-

62:1183:114744:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics.  Potentially relevant dynamics include anticipation effects and the possibility
62:1184:114833:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of differences between short and long run responses.  Allowance for anticipation effects
62:1185:114921:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  particularly  important  in  this  setting  due  to  the26month  lag  between  the  relevant
62:1186:115017:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:legislation  and  the  implementation  of  the  third  and  final  increase  in  the  federal  min-

62:1188:115204:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:show  why  analyses  of  the  longer  panel  of  state  minimum  wage  changes  will  tend  to
62:1189:115298:24:24:72:463:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have difficulty estimating anything other than relatively short-run effects.
62:1190:115374:24:24:89:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Sorkin (2015) provides a theoretical basis for expecting the distinction between short-
62:1191:115461:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and long-run effects to be economically meaningful.  The considerations Sorkin (2015)
62:1192:115546:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:highlights  point  to  two  conceptually  relevant  features  of  the  setting  I  analyze.   A  first
62:1193:115648:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:point is that my post-legislation analysis window is long by the literature’s standards. It
62:1194:115739:24:24:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:includes both a26month implementation phase and a40month post-implementation
62:1195:115815:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period.37Second,  because  the  analysis  involves  a  period  of  significant  labor  market
62:1196:115908:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upheaval, the shifts in production technologies Sorkin (2015) emphasizes may have been
62:1197:115994:24:24:72:357:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hastened relative to less turbulent historical episodes.
62:1198:116050:24:24:89:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  empirical  approaches  in  this  paper  and  Clemens  and  Wither  (2014b)  are  facil-
62:1199:116142:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:itated  in  part  by  the  historical  setting.   In  contrast  with  the  longer  panel  of  state  and
62:1200:116246:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:federal minimum wage changes, the period analyzed here has three attractive features.
62:1201:116331:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:First, there is a relatively clean division of states into those that were fully and partially
62:1202:116425:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound by this period’s federal minimum wage changes.  Second, this division roughly
62:1203:116508:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evenly  divides  the  U.S.  population.   Third,  because  states  enacted  very  few  minimum
62:1204:116602:24:48:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage changes between July2009and December2012, the analysis period has a less con-
62:1205:116684:48:15:85:539:110:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:F:37After2012, the setting encounter’s the minimum wage literature’s usual problem that the post-policy
62:1206:116785:15:0:72:522:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:change period becomes contaminated with additional state (and municipal) minimum wage changes.

63:1208:116970:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the policy space make this a well suited application for relatively straightforward pro-
