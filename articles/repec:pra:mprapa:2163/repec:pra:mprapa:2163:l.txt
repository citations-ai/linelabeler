2:16:395:32:16:89:520:474:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:General  Equilibrium  Theory  in  econometrics  is  based  on  the  vague
2:17:468:16:16:89:519:458:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:notion   of   utility.   Prices,   dynamics,   and   market    equilibria   are
2:18:547:16:16:89:521:442:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:supposed to be derived from utility. Utility is sometimes treated like a
2:19:619:16:16:89:520:426:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:potential,   other   times   like   a   Lagrangian.    Illegal   assumptions   of
2:20:700:16:16:89:520:410:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:integrability  of  actions  and  dynamics  are   usually  made.  Economists
2:21:775:16:16:89:522:394:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:usually assume that price is the gradient of utility in equilibrium, but  I
2:22:850:16:16:89:516:378:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:observe instead that price as the gradient  of utility is an integrability
2:23:924:16:16:89:521:362:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:condition for the Hamiltonian dynamics of  an  optimization  problem.
2:24:993:16:16:89:520:346:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:I   discuss   both   deterministic    and   statistical    descriptions   of    the
2:25:1076:16:16:89:519:330:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dynamics   of    excess    demand    and    observe    that    Adam   Smith’s
2:26:1153:16:16:89:521:314:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:stabilizing hand is not to be found either in deterministic or stochastic
2:27:1226:16:16:89:519:298:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dynamical  models  of  markets   nor  in  the  observed  motions  of   asset
2:28:1302:16:16:89:520:282:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:prices.  Evidence  for  stability  of  prices  of  assets   in  free  markets  has
2:29:1384:16:0:89:186:266:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:not been found.
3:30:1400:0:32:90:168:708:196:g_d0_f6:196:g_d0_f6:C:0. Overview
3:31:1411:32:17:90:524:676:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Section  1  defines  utility,  marginal  utility  and  ‘General   Equilibrium
3:32:1488:17:16:90:521:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Theory’,   which   postulates   price   as   the   gradient   of   utility   as   an
3:33:1572:16:16:90:521:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium condition.  Part  2  introduces  the  dynamics  of  GET,   the
3:34:1646:16:16:90:521:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:ABH model,  and  the  search  for  stable  equilibria,  motion  toward  a
3:35:1719:16:16:90:521:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:unique stable  equilibrium point  represents  the  universal  action  of
3:36:1791:16:16:90:522:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Adam Smith’s hand. Scarf showed that it is easy to construct models
3:37:1858:16:16:90:520:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:where  stable  equilibria  do  not  occur,  and  Saari   pointed  out  that
3:38:1933:16:16:90:522:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:chaos  is  not  excluded.  I  add  the  observation   that   excess   demand
3:39:2009:16:16:90:522:547:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dynamics  also   does   not   exclude   complexity.   Adam  Smith’s   hand
3:40:2083:16:16:90:521:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:becomes  unable  to   match  demand  and  supply  in  unregulated   free
3:41:2155:16:16:90:521:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:markets.  Part  3  discusses  the  Hamiltonian  systems  that   arise   from
3:42:2231:16:16:90:522:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  use  of  optimization   and  control   theory  in  econometrics.   Here,   I
3:43:2312:16:16:90:521:483:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:point  out  that  the  condition  that  price  is  a  gradient  of  utility  is  an
3:44:2395:16:16:90:524:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:integrability    condition    for    the    dynamics,    not    an    equilibrium
3:45:2476:16:16:90:521:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:condition,  that  the  utility  is  generally  a  functional,  not  a  function,
3:46:2556:16:16:90:521:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:and  that   stable  equilibria  cannot   occur.   Part   4  follows   the   pioneer
3:47:2639:16:16:90:522:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Osborne  in  discussing  markets  and  trading   via  a  toy  model  of  limit
3:48:2717:16:16:90:521:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:orders,  and  follows  Black  in  observing  that   noise  is  essential   for
3:49:2795:16:16:90:523:387:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:liquidity. Section  5  introduces  Osborne’s  lognormal  model  of  noisy
3:50:2868:16:16:90:522:371:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:stock  prices.  The  CAPM  (Capital   Asset  Pricing  Model)   is   derived
3:51:2943:16:16:90:522:355:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:from  white  noise,   and  in  section  6  the  Black-Scholes   option  pricing
3:52:3022:16:16:90:521:339:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:model  is  derived  from  the  CAPM.  It  is  observed  that   the  notion  of
3:53:3100:16:16:90:522:323:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:utility (along with Adam Smith’s  hand) is not  used in modeling stock
3:54:3170:16:16:90:521:307:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:prices and apparently  can  be forgotten.  Section  7 explains  why the
3:55:3241:16:16:90:521:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:study of  prices  as  deterministic  flows  in  the  ABH  model  and  control
3:56:3318:16:16:90:522:275:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:theory,  even  in  the  chaotic  or  complex  case,   cannot   model  noise
3:57:3393:16:16:90:520:259:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:(‘randomness’)  in  stock  prices  at   short   times.    In  part   8  I   note   that
3:58:3480:16:16:90:523:243:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:there  is  no  idea  of  stability  or  equilibrium  in  the  stochastic   dynamics
3:59:3563:16:16:90:521:227:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:used to  model asset  prices,  and that  neither  the  lognormal  nor  the
3:60:3637:16:16:90:524:211:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:correct  empirical  distribution  (exponential)  defines  an  ‘equilibrium’
3:61:3712:16:16:90:521:195:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:price.  Here,   Adam  Smith’s   hand  is  observed  to  have   disappeared
3:62:3786:16:16:90:522:179:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:altogether  because  there  are  no  restoring  forces:  excess  demand  is
3:63:3861:16:16:90:521:163:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:pure  random  noise.  The  economists  mislabel  stochastic   dynamics  as
3:64:3935:16:16:90:523:147:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:‘equilibrium  dynamics’   because   they   maximize   expected   utility
3:65:4007:16:16:90:520:131:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:(which   does   not   guarantee   equilibrium)   instead   of   maximizing
3:66:4081:16:16:90:521:115:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:entropy (which would, if  equilibrium were  possible). Part  9 informs
3:67:4151:16:0:90:523:99:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the   reader    of   Osborne’s    observation    that    the   supply-demand
4:68:4228:0:17:90:522:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:‘graphs’  in  Samuelson’s   text   are   merely  cartoons   that   cannot  be
4:69:4305:17:32:90:270:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:derived from empirical data.
4:70:4333:32:32:90:243:659:196:g_d0_f6:196:g_d0_f6:C:1. What is econometrics?
4:71:4357:32:16:90:522:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Econometrics  begins  with  Adam  Smith’s  idea  of  an  ‘invisible  hand’
4:72:4431:16:16:90:524:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that   is   supposed   to   match   supply   to   demand   in   markets.   An
4:73:4508:16:16:90:521:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium market  is  defined  as  one  where  the  match  of  supply  to
4:74:4583:16:16:90:521:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:demand  determines  the  price  of  a   commodity.  In  such  a   market
4:75:4655:16:16:90:521:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:trades  are  imagined  to  take  place  only  at  the  equilibrium  price.  The
4:76:4734:16:16:90:521:547:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:following  mathematics,   which  I  will  call  econo-logic,   is  invented  as
4:77:4813:16:32:90:439:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the underpinning of General Equilibrium Theory (GET).
4:78:4866:32:16:90:517:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Given  n  commodities  in  quantities  x1,....xn,   a   function   U(x1,...xn),
4:79:4945:16:16:89:519:483:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:called  ‘satisfaction’   (economists  also  call   it  ‘utility’)  is  postulated.
4:80:5027:16:16:89:518:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Utility should describe consumer preferences, but only for a ‘rational’
4:81:5098:16:16:89:521:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:consumer. A rational  consumer is one who maximizes utility subject
4:82:5165:16:16:89:521:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:to  a  budget  constraint,   completing  the  circle.  The  function  U  is
4:83:5240:16:16:89:520:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:assumed  to  be  concave,   building  in  the   assumption   of   decreasing
4:84:5316:16:16:89:520:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:returns:  less  satisfaction  from  eating  five  ice-cream   cones  than  from
4:85:5395:16:16:89:520:387:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:eating one. Because utility functions cannot be derived without  more
4:86:5464:16:16:89:522:371:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:information  one  must  consider  the  entire  class  of  concave  utility
4:87:5538:16:16:89:522:355:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:functions.   This   classification    is   topologically    well-defined    only
4:88:5618:16:16:89:519:339:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:locally,  not  globally,  because  it  is  not  invariant   under  arbitrary
4:89:5694:16:32:89:331:323:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:nonlinear  coordinate  transformations.
4:90:5733:32:16:89:520:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Equilibrium is described as the result of maximizing U subject to  the

6:162:8588:16:16:90:522:523:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:never  solved  within  econometrics.  Typically,  integrability  has  been

6:164:8732:16:32:90:498:491:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:do so, including in dynamical generalizations of GET (see below).

6:169:9107:16:16:90:523:395:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:should occur in order  to  reach  equilibrium. Adam Smith’s  invisible
6:170:9177:16:16:90:523:379:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:hand is then a synonym for the bidding and  price adjustments  during
6:171:9246:16:16:90:521:363:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  bidding.  Imagine   many  traders   at   a   market,   each   with  his  own

6:173:9405:16:16:90:522:331:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:auctioneer,  called  the  Walras  auctioneer,  calls  out  a  price  vector  p.

6:179:9692:16:16:90:520:214:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:before the next round of bidding. This continues until the total  excess
6:180:9764:16:16:89:519:198:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:demand for  all  traders  vanishes,  which  defines  equilibrium. Trades
6:181:9836:16:16:89:521:182:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:are then allowed to occur. If this seems a tortured caricature of a real
6:182:9908:16:16:89:521:166:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:auction (forcing reality to fit the model rather  than  the reverse),  it is
6:183:9984:16:16:89:521:150:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:a   good   example   of   econo-logic.    Adam   Smith’s   main   idea   in

8:225:12672:16:16:90:523:675:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  relationship  (5)  to   find  demand  as   a   function  of  price,  x   =  d(p).
8:226:12758:16:16:90:522:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Given  that  one  holds  n  commodities  at  time  t,  the  usually  assumed

8:228:12910:16:16:90:521:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:times numbers of commodities held at time 0 must be the  same  as  the
8:229:12980:16:16:90:520:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:prices times quantities of commodities held at  any later  time  t.  That
8:230:13053:16:52:90:468:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:is, the scalar product (in our inner product commodity space)

8:232:13133:31:17:90:521:512:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:will automatically be conserved when we get around to building the
8:233:13199:17:16:90:523:495:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dynamics.  The   excess   demand  ε1(p)  is  then  formed  in  commodity
8:234:13271:16:0:90:279:479:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:space for one consumer, then i

8:238:13342:32:17:90:522:411:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:where  xo  represents   the  quantities  of  each  commodity  initially  held
8:239:13419:17:16:90:521:394:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:before  the  ‘Walras  auction’  begins.  Having  constructed  the  excess
8:240:13492:16:16:90:522:378:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:demand   for   n   commodities   for   one   consumer   one   then   uses
8:241:13565:16:16:90:522:362:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:permutation symmetry to write down the total excess demand vector
8:242:13630:16:16:90:521:346:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:for  each  commodity  for  m  consumers.  This  yields  the  total   excess
8:243:13705:16:16:90:522:330:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:demand vector  e(p).  The  ABH model simply assumes  that  the  price
8:244:13774:16:32:90:173:314:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:changes obey
8:245:13786:32:32:270:411:282:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:A:dp/dt = ε(p),                (8)
8:246:13818:32:16:90:520:250:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:so  that   Walrus’  auction   has   been  replaced   by  a   flow   in  p-space.
8:247:13898:16:16:90:521:234:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Equilibrium is described as vanishing excess demand, and the process
8:248:13966:16:32:90:258:218:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:is still called Tatonnement.
8:249:13994:32:16:90:521:186:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:That a flow should be called ‘trial and error’ appears peculiar at  first
8:250:14067:16:16:90:521:170:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:sight,  because  what   could  be  further   from  the  notion  of  an  auction
8:251:14146:16:16:90:522:154:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:than a flow? However, if we construct solutions to (8) using Picard’s
8:252:14215:16:16:90:520:138:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:method of repeated  approximations  then we have  a  trial  and  error
8:253:14285:16:16:90:521:122:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:approach   to   the   exact   solution   that   is   guaranteed    to   converge
8:254:14365:16:16:90:521:106:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:whenever a Lipshitz condition is satisfied  by the  excess  demand. The
8:255:14436:16:0:90:521:90:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:solution,  however,   needn’t  be  an  equilibrium  solution  and  generally
9:256:14513:0:17:90:521:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:isn’t, even as the time goes to infinity (this is a  not only a  question of
9:257:14589:17:48:90:481:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:existence and stability of equilibria, but of basins of attraction).
9:258:14657:48:16:90:521:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:The  Walras  condition  (the  budget  constraint   M   =  constant))  means
9:259:14732:16:16:90:519:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that  that  the  vectors  p  and  ε(p)  are   perpendicular.   This  constraint
9:260:14811:16:16:90:519:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:confines   the   motion   to    an    n-sphere    in   price   space.    General
9:261:14891:16:16:90:521:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Equilibrium   Theory   then   tries   to   restrict    the   studies   to   excess
9:262:14973:16:16:90:521:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:demands  that   have   a   unique  equilibrium,  and   mainly  searches   for
9:263:15050:16:16:90:520:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:those  equilibria,  which  is  rather   boring  mathematics   with  trivial,
9:264:15126:16:16:90:521:547:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:uninteresting (not to mention inapplicable) dynamics. The search  for
9:265:15195:16:16:90:521:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:a   globally-unique   equilibrium   was   a   way   to   try   to   justify   the
9:266:15276:16:16:90:521:515:196:g_d0_f9:196:g_d0_f8:B:universality of Adam Smith’s  invisible hand, the notion that,  given a
9:267:15347:16:16:90:522:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:free   market,   the   same   conditions   should   lead   to   equilibrium   in
9:268:15427:16:16:90:522:483:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Moscow,  Mexico  City,  New  York,  London,  and  Frankfort.   In  this
9:269:15498:16:16:90:521:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:mythology, trading  only occurs at  equilibrium. However,  asking  for
9:270:15568:16:16:90:521:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:universality  of  solutions  of  dynamics  equations  for  arbitrary   initial
9:271:15646:16:16:90:521:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:conditions is too  high an  expectation.  Even  if  the  ABH model were
9:272:15717:16:16:90:521:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:qualitatively applicable Moscow and New York could well belong to
9:273:15782:16:16:90:521:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:different  basins  of  attraction   (nonuniversality  of  effects  of  excess
9:274:15859:16:32:90:393:387:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:demand), and equilibria need not hold in market.
9:275:15907:32:16:90:521:355:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:With only two commodities integrability is guaranteed by elementary

9:278:16123:16:16:90:522:307:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:three  commodities  have  the  nice  property  that   the  excess  demand
9:279:16196:16:16:90:521:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:vector  must  be  the  cross  product  in  price  space  of  the  gradients   of

9:284:16460:17:16:89:523:175:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:construct model utilities where there is no approach to equilibrium by

10:296:17260:16:16:90:521:576:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:was   the   first   to   emphasize   that    the   damped   simple   harmonic
10:297:17337:16:16:90:521:560:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:oscillator has a global conservation law and actually constructed the
10:298:17406:16:16:90:521:544:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:invariant.  Many  of  today’s  physicists  and  mathematicians  seem  to
10:299:17478:16:16:90:522:528:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:have  trouble  accepting  this  fact,  but  it  was   known  to  Jacobi  and  Lie
10:300:17559:16:16:90:520:512:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:quite  generally.   In  a   driven  dissipative   system   these   conservation
10:301:17638:16:16:90:522:496:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:laws are singular at equilibria (Arnol'd [11] therefore  refuses  to label

10:306:17956:16:16:90:520:400:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:(the  flow  can  be  parallelized  only  locally),  never   globally.  There   are
10:307:18038:16:16:90:522:384:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:mathematical (but not economically realistic) conditions under which

10:309:18184:16:16:90:522:352:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:easy   to   construct   counter-examples    where,    e.g.,    an    unstable
10:310:18261:16:16:90:522:336:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium is  enclosed  by a  stable  limit  cycle.  Saari   [12]  points  out
10:311:18341:16:16:90:522:320:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that the class of more generally  admissible excess  demand vectors  is
10:312:18412:16:16:90:522:304:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:so   great    that    nothing,   especially   not    deterministic    chaos,    is
10:313:18494:16:16:90:522:288:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:precluded. In other  words,  Adam Smith’s  invisible hand  cannot  be
10:314:18563:16:16:90:521:272:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:relied  upon  to  match  supply  to  demand  globally.  At  best,  it  is  a   local

10:316:18719:16:16:90:522:240:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:flows in phase space may not be merely chaotic, they may be complex
10:317:18786:16:16:90:521:224:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:(no  scaling  laws,   computer-like  behavior,   surprises  at   all   length

10:319:18942:16:16:90:521:192:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that  equilbrium  is  stable,  or  even  exists  for  an  arbitrary   excess

10:321:19089:16:16:90:522:160:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:to believe in the universality of the effects excess demand on the basis

10:323:19234:16:16:90:522:128:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:local, not global. On the basis of econometric analysis, what works in

11:326:19447:0:17:90:522:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:would be useful [14], and some have gone over to econometrics [1,15],
11:327:19516:17:32:90:406:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:but GET has never proven to be empirically useful.
11:328:19566:32:16:90:521:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Leaving  aside  the  failure  of  the  invisible  hand  to  regulate   the  entire
11:329:19648:16:16:90:521:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:world in a trivial way, there are other  more serious objections to the
11:330:19719:16:16:90:521:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:ABH model.  First,  what  is  the  relaxation  time  for  prices? This  is  a
11:331:19796:16:16:90:523:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:very  good  question,  because  theoretical   econometricians   usually
11:332:19867:16:16:90:521:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:assume  rapid  relaxation   to   equilibrium.  This  seems  strange   to
11:333:19939:16:16:90:519:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:physicists, but we must remember that econometrics, especially GET,
11:334:20006:16:16:90:523:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:is  more  like  a   belief-system   or   logic-system   than   it  is  like  physics.
11:335:20091:16:16:90:521:547:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Unfortunately for physicists who might want try to do better,  the left
11:336:20162:16:16:90:521:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:hand  side  of  the  ABH  equation  (8)  has  units  of  $/sec  or   DM/sec,
11:337:20238:16:16:90:522:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:whereas   the  right  hand  side  (excess  demand)  is  a   pure  number,  and
11:338:20316:16:16:90:521:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:there   is   no   way   to   discover   a   fundamental   constant    (a   global
11:339:20397:16:16:90:521:483:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:invariant)   with   dimensions   of   money/time   to   repair   this   defect.
11:340:20476:16:16:90:523:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Relaxation times simply cannot be predicted on the basis of the ABH
11:341:20543:16:16:90:521:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:model as it now stands. One could multiply ε(p) by an interest  rate  to
11:342:20615:16:16:90:520:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:get  the  right  units,  but  this  would  be  arbitrary   and  meaningless.  Or,
11:343:20696:16:16:90:523:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:one  could  abandon  the  idea  that   p  represents   price  (has   dimensions
11:344:20775:16:32:90:340:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:of money), but where would that get us?
11:345:20814:32:16:90:521:371:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Lying  in  the  same  boat   is  the  question  of  the  relaxation   time  of  the
11:346:20897:16:16:90:520:355:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:commodity variables x. In the ABH model the prices are slaved to the
11:347:20965:16:16:90:520:339:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:commodity   variables,    which    are    implicitly   presumed    to    relax
11:348:21043:16:32:90:394:323:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:infinitely fast: there are no differential equations
11:349:21095:32:32:90:357:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B: dx/dt = s(p,x)     (11)
11:350:21118:32:16:90:521:259:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:for the commodity variables. A physicist might ignore the Walras law
11:351:21186:16:16:90:521:243:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:(the budget constraint), because physicists are  usually pretty good at
11:352:21257:16:16:90:522:227:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:violating   budgets   anyway.   Let’s   do   this   and   look   at   a   vaguely
11:353:21338:16:16:90:522:211:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:analogous  mathematics  problem  in  physics,  a  Hamiltonian  system
11:354:21407:16:16:90:522:195:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:where x is position (phase space can always chosen to be flat  [8]) and
11:355:21478:16:30:90:463:179:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the covector p is the corresponding canonical momentum. If
11:356:21536:30:36:244:347:149:196:Symbol:196:g_d0_f8:A:  p=∇U                (12)
11:357:21560:36:17:90:522:113:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:where   U  is  a  scalar   function  of  x,   then    the   dynamics  is  globally
11:358:21642:17:16:90:522:96:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:integrable [8] and the motion is confined to an n-dimensional cylinder
11:359:21712:16:0:90:522:80:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:or torus in the 2n-dimensional (x,p) phase space. Einstein pointed out
12:360:21784:0:17:90:521:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that assuming that p = grad U is equivalent to  assuming integrability
12:361:21854:17:16:90:522:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:of  the  dynamical  system  [16],  although  this  was   shown  earlier   in
12:362:21930:16:16:90:521:675:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Liouville’s more  complete explanation  of  integrability  [8b]. This  is  a
12:363:22006:16:16:90:522:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:formal  non-economic  analog   of  Walras’  law.  Here,   there  is  no
12:364:22077:16:16:90:523:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dissipation, and so there are no stable equilibria in phase space,  only
12:365:22149:16:16:90:520:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:elliptic  and  hyperbolic  points.  For   bounded  motion  one  has   eternal
12:366:22226:16:16:90:523:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:oscillation (with neutral  stability). The function U is just the reduced
12:367:22299:16:16:90:524:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:action  in  this  case.   The  condition  for  (12)  (discussed  explicitly  by
12:368:22378:16:16:90:523:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Liouville but not  by Einstein) is that  there  are  n  global  commuting
12:369:22451:16:16:90:521:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:constants   of   the   motion,   n   global   conservation    laws   of   the
12:370:22528:16:16:90:520:547:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Hamiltonian   system.   This   then   guarantees    that   Ldt   is   an   exact
12:371:22608:16:16:90:521:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:differential,   where  L  is  the  Lagrangian,   so  that   the  action  is  now  a
12:372:22691:16:16:90:522:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:function  (a   generating   function).  The   canonical   momentum  then   is
12:373:22768:16:32:90:401:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the x-gradient of the action or the reduced action.
12:374:22819:32:16:90:523:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  dynamics  is  nonintegrable   (as  is  typically
12:375:22900:16:30:90:293:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the case) then the reduced action

12:381:22956:32:17:90:521:370:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B: is a path-dependent functional, not a  function, so that  the analog  of
12:382:23029:17:16:90:522:353:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  utility  U  exists   at   best  locally,   not   globally,  and  cannot   even  be
12:383:23116:16:16:90:521:337:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:written    down    as    an    infinite    series    without    using    analytic
12:384:23197:16:16:90:523:321:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:continuation.   This  might  seem  very  far   fetched  as   economics,   but
12:385:23274:16:16:90:522:305:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Hamiltonian   systems  actually   occur  in  econometrics   (see   section  3
12:386:23351:16:32:90:136:289:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:below).
12:387:23358:32:16:90:521:257:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Hamiltonian  dynamics  shows  that  it  is  dangerous  blindly  to  assume
12:388:23432:16:16:90:522:241:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that the question of path dependence of a utility functional (13) can be
12:389:23504:16:16:90:523:225:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:divorced   from   the   question   of   integrability    of    the    underlying
12:390:23584:16:16:90:520:209:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dynamics. Gibbs tried  but failed  to  make a  similar  point  to  I.  Fisher
12:391:23661:16:16:90:523:193:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:[2], who was not as strong a  mathematician  as  was  Gibbs and didn’t
12:392:23731:16:16:90:522:177:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:understand   integrability.   Gibbs   pointed   out   that    the   utility   is
12:393:23811:16:16:90:521:161:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:generally  path  dependent,  and  suggested  that   Fisher   address  the
12:394:23884:16:16:90:523:145:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:problem  of   nonintegrability   in  relation   to   a   possible  underlying
12:395:23961:16:16:90:520:129:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dynamics. Fisher  did not  understand  nonintegrability  of  differential
12:396:24034:16:16:90:521:113:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:forms  (neither  did  Walras   or  Pareto),   so  that   Gibbs’  point  was
12:397:24109:16:16:90:521:97:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:entirely  lost  on  Fisher,   who  erased   all   mention  of   nonintegrability
12:398:24189:16:0:90:521:81:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:from his last  papers  on utility after  he had become established  as  an
13:399:24265:0:17:90:522:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:economist.  I  expect  that   Gibbs  knew  and  understood  Liouville’s
13:400:24336:17:16:90:523:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:integrability  theorem  in  Hamiltonian  mechanics  and  had  in  mind
13:401:24406:16:16:90:521:675:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:precisely  the  discussion  above.  Fisher’s  failure  to  address  the  path
13:402:24483:16:16:90:521:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:dependence of  utility left  Samuelson  and  other  economists  to  worry
13:403:24556:16:16:90:522:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:about  nonintegrability  some  fifty  years  later.   The  economists   finally
13:404:24635:16:16:90:521:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:stopped  worrying   about  it,   but  never   solved   the   problem.   It   is   not
13:405:24720:16:16:90:520:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:clear  that  they  became  aware   of  Liouville’s  integrability  theorem,

19:606:35983:16:16:90:521:227:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:friction.  A  trade  likely  will  not  be  reversed  if  the  seller  would  lose  a

19:608:36096:32:16:90:522:179:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Black [22] emphasized that  noise is essential  for liquidity. Noise  and
19:609:36169:16:16:90:521:163:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:friction go together. Small friction (low transaction fees) is necessary

20:639:38409:16:16:90:520:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:bid and ask quotes will be lowered to 20 and 19 7/8. Correspondingly,
20:640:38478:16:16:90:521:275:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:if the last  limit order executed was  a buy of one or more round lots,
20:641:38549:16:16:90:521:259:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:then the bid/ask quotes are  both  increased  by 1/8. If  no  one  wants  to
20:642:38625:16:16:90:521:243:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:buy  at   20  and  there   is  a   mass   of   buy  orders   at   10,   then   either   the
20:643:38716:16:16:90:521:227:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:bid/ask prices  must  be  dropped  dramatically   or   else  trading   in  the
20:644:38794:16:16:90:521:211:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:stock must be halted for the day (like closure of a bank when there’s  a
20:645:38866:16:16:90:526:195:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:threat   of  a  run).  The  stock  market   is  not  in  equilibrium:  the  bid/ask
20:646:38949:16:16:90:522:179:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:and  trading  prices  are   not  equilibrium  prices.  Even  when  one   limit
20:647:39027:16:16:90:522:163:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:order  can  be  filled  (by  matching  a  buyer  at  20  1/8  to  a  seller  at  20,
20:648:39111:16:16:90:521:147:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:e.g.),  most  limit  orders  cannot  be  filled:  the  total   excess  demand  for
20:649:39193:16:16:90:521:131:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the stock S does not vanish. Economists label stock market trading  as
20:650:39263:16:16:90:524:115:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:‘equilibrium’ because  they  tend  to  label  everything  as  ‘equilibrium’,
20:651:39339:16:0:90:446:99:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:even when it is not. I discuss this in detail in part 8 below.
21:652:39403:0:17:90:522:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:What about  the ‘real value’ of an asset like a stock? Black argues that
21:653:39475:17:16:90:521:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:‘value’  is  both  random    and  unobservable,  whereas   price  is  random
21:654:39551:16:16:90:521:675:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:and observable. He asserts that price always tends to return  to value
21:655:39621:16:16:90:521:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:after  large  deviations,  but  we  will  see  in  the  next  section  that  the
21:656:39701:16:16:90:521:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:model used by Black  and  others  to  describe  stock  market  movements
21:657:39773:16:16:90:522:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:has no restoring forces, only random walkers. Black also says that  he
21:658:39843:16:16:90:521:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:will  call  the  market  ‘efficient’   if   price  is  within   a   factor   of   two   of
21:659:39933:16:16:90:520:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:value. Since value is both unobservable and undefined, this assertion
21:660:40002:16:16:90:522:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:has  no  meaning.  If  we  try  to  identify  ‘value’  with  price  then  we  may
21:661:40083:16:16:90:519:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:fall into the trap of accepting the efficient  market  hypothesis (EMH),
21:662:40155:16:16:90:522:547:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:which  states   that   dart-throwing    in  designing   a   portfolio   as   is
21:663:40234:16:16:90:519:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:effective  trying  to  choose  stocks  on  the  basis  of  some  other  rational
21:664:40314:16:16:90:519:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:basis,   like   an   estimate    of   ‘value’.   There    is   evidence   that    dart-
21:665:40401:16:16:90:520:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:throwing   can   be   beaten   over   short    enough   time   intervals    that
21:666:40481:16:16:90:521:483:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:information   has  not  had  time  to  propagate   to  all  investors   (see
21:667:40557:16:16:90:521:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:[24,24b],  for  example).  Not  all  investors  react   the  same  at  the  same
21:668:40637:16:16:90:522:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:time to the same information, and investors (agents) typically are not
21:669:40707:16:16:90:521:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:rational  but act on ‘hunches’, on the basis  of  someone  else’s  advice,
21:670:40781:16:16:90:521:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:or   (as   Black   points   out)   on   the   basis   of   noise   perceived   as
21:671:40862:16:16:90:521:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:information.  Black  observes  that  we  never  can  be  certain  that  we
21:672:40936:16:16:90:521:387:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:have  information  instead  of  noise.  He  used  the  (now-popular)   term
21:673:41011:16:16:90:523:371:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:‘noise trader’ and argued that ‘information traders’ can make money
21:674:41078:16:16:90:522:355:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:by timing their trades to  take  advantage  of  noise  traders,  who  make
21:675:41152:16:16:90:521:339:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:up  the  bulk  of  the  market  and  are   responsible  for  the  liquidity  of   the
21:676:41237:16:16:90:521:323:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:market.  The  EMH  is  a  good  assumption  for  people  who  do  not
21:677:41306:16:16:90:521:307:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:follow news closely and who react  too slowly to  anticipate  changes
21:678:41375:16:16:90:523:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:in market conditions. The EMH advises them to invest in index funds
21:679:41442:16:16:90:520:275:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:and  advises   them  not   to   follow   the   advice   of   ‘financial   advisors’,
21:680:41526:16:16:90:521:259:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:who  generally  do  not  know  any  more  about  predicting  market

21:682:41667:16:16:90:520:227:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:thrower.  In  the  end,  the  value  of  an  asset  like  a  stock  or  bond  that
21:683:41749:16:16:90:522:211:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:you can’t eat, sleep in or under, warm or cool yourself with it, ride on

21:686:41979:16:16:90:522:163:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:worth  at  that  time.  It’s  price  at  any  later  time  is  unknown  and
21:687:42054:16:16:90:522:147:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:undetermined.  This  does  not  prevent  good  traders   from   making
21:688:42124:16:16:90:524:131:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:money. We can forget  about  the  illusions of  ‘value’  and  ‘equilibrium’
21:689:42199:16:16:90:522:115:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:and concentrate on prices in the face of excess demand when it comes
21:690:42267:16:0:90:268:99:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:to stocks, bonds, and money.

22:696:42634:16:16:90:521:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:consumption or real use. People who buy stocks or  offer  credit  prefer
22:697:42706:16:16:90:520:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:rising prices of assets. No one who invests in the stock market  wants
22:698:42776:16:16:90:520:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium (vanishing  excess  demand  for  the  asset),  because  in  that
22:699:42852:16:16:90:524:563:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:case  there  are  no  gains  (due  to  dividends  or  price  appreciation).   A

22:707:43466:16:16:90:521:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:been large for many individual stocks. Most individual stocks are  not
22:708:43536:16:16:90:520:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:in  equilibrium  even   when   the   market   approximately   is.   Long-time

22:721:44485:16:16:90:521:195:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium.  Following   the  example  set  by  Black    [22],  if  they  do  not
22:722:44567:16:16:90:520:179:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:accept my argument and revise  their  description then  I will attribute

24:777:48163:23:16:90:522:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:found that stock prices could be fit  approximately  by this  assumption

24:784:48686:16:16:90:520:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:central limit theorem. I note also that one needs an additive variable

27:885:53254:16:16:90:522:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:know  what  the  phrase  ‘risk  premium’  means.   The  ‘risk  premium’  is
27:886:53329:16:32:90:443:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:simply the second term on the right hand side of (31) [28].
27:887:53388:32:16:90:521:579:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:It  has  long  been  known  that  the  prediction  (31)  of  CAPM  does  not

27:890:53607:16:16:90:521:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:[33,34], which is the reverse of the  model’s prediction (higher  returns
27:891:53680:16:16:90:520:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:for higher risk). This model is based on  EMH, namely, that  all  assets
27:892:53752:16:16:90:522:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:do a random walk so that dart-throwing is predicted to be as good as

27:894:53899:16:16:90:519:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Another way  to  say it is that  the  Brownian  motion  approximation

27:897:54112:16:16:90:522:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:out, however, we can never be sure that the perceived information  is
27:898:54181:16:32:90:216:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:not really just noise.
27:899:54203:32:16:90:519:371:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:The biggest fault with the model is that the variances, as Mandelbrot

27:902:54419:16:16:90:521:323:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:increasingly longer time horizons. In applying the  model one  can  not
27:903:54490:16:16:90:519:307:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:use a long time series  to  obtain  a  ‘global’,  estimate  for  the  variance.
27:904:54569:16:16:90:522:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:One  should  instead  estimate  the  variance   locally  for  the  period  ∆t
27:905:54646:16:16:89:521:275:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:over  which  the  investment  is  made.  The  variance   estimates   must  be

36:1232:71702:16:16:90:522:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:moment about dynamics, can the idea of  a  utility function with  (2) be

36:1235:71923:16:16:90:522:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:look at empirical data? Osborne [21] asked whether  there  is evidence
36:1236:71993:16:16:90:521:387:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:that  supply-demand  curves  pass  this  basic  test.  The  evidence  for

36:1239:72219:16:16:90:523:339:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:not based upon any known empirical data. Economists  like to  discuss
36:1240:72288:16:16:90:521:323:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:elasticity  (requiring  a  continuously  differentiable  utility)  but  do  not

36:1245:72667:16:16:90:521:243:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  predicted  price  vector  p  for  n  commodities  as   a   function  of

36:1247:72825:16:16:90:522:211:196:g_d0_f9:196:g_d0_f8:B:cannot   be   extracted    from   real   data,   and   observes   that   there   is   no

37:1256:73530:0:17:90:521:708:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:implies  that  the  idea  of  path-independent   utility  makes  no  sense
37:1257:73604:17:16:90:521:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:empirically  (writing   down  utility  as   a   functional   may   make   sense

37:1278:75156:16:16:90:521:339:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:where  no  one  knows  the  outcome.  Events  like  the  collapse  of  the

37:1281:75381:16:16:90:522:291:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:(LTCM)  are  examples  of  ‘surprises’  that  were  not  predicted  by  any
37:1282:75456:16:16:90:520:275:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:theory and which were not anticipated by many very astute  financial

37:1289:75915:32:16:90:522:147:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:Black [35] points out that  econometric  theorizing  is not  accepted  on
37:1290:75988:16:16:90:522:131:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  basis  of  experiment,   but  because  researchers   persuade   one
37:1291:76060:16:16:90:521:115:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:another   that  the  theory  is  ‘correct   and  relevant’.   This,  alone,   is  not
37:1292:76145:16:16:90:521:99:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:enough  to  establish  a  theory  in  physics  where   precise   identical
37:1293:76219:16:0:90:521:83:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:repeated,  experiments  are  performed  (or  in  astronomy  where  there

38:1295:76370:17:16:90:519:691:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:accurate  data),  although  string  theory  and  various  too-ambitious
38:1296:76441:16:16:90:522:675:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:models  in  cosmology   are   open   to   criticism   on   this   count.   Black
38:1297:76521:16:16:90:522:659:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:expected  that  experiments  eventually  will  be  done  in  economics  and
38:1298:76596:16:16:90:521:643:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:finance   whenever   the   desire   is   great    enough.   LTCM    was    a
38:1299:76672:16:16:90:521:627:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:completely uncontrolled experiment.  LTCM  went  under because  the
38:1300:76739:16:16:90:520:611:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:usual  expectations   about  arbitrage   proved   wrong:   bond  interest
38:1301:76812:16:32:90:426:595:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:spreads widened instead of ‘returning to equilibrium.’

38:1304:77012:16:16:90:521:531:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:the  notion  of  market  equilibrium  was  philosophically  soothing  in  a
38:1305:77087:16:16:90:522:515:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:time  when  conservatives   and  others   were   afraid   of  revolt   and
38:1306:77161:16:16:90:521:499:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:revolution  by  the  masses.  General   Equilibrium  Theory  is  more  like  a
38:1307:77239:16:16:90:521:483:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:mathematics-based   ideology   than   like   a   science.   In   the   age   of
38:1308:77318:16:16:90:522:467:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:complexity it will  not  likely survive  whereas  Newtonian  mechanics
38:1309:77388:16:16:90:522:451:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:not only survived but generated  the  field of  deterministic  chaos,  and
38:1310:77462:16:16:90:521:435:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:has  been  speculated  to  contain  complexity  as   well  [13].  The  recent
38:1311:77539:16:16:90:521:419:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:deregulation   of   banking/insurance/brokerage   combined   with   the
38:1312:77610:16:32:90:502:403:196:g_d0_f8:196:g_d0_f8:B:lack of regulation of options trading will surely lead to ‘surprises’!
