4:79:4806:0:17:72:540:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:default, will only purchase government debt if there is a sufficient risk premium.  The resulting increase in
4:80:4915:17:17:72:540:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the cost of funds makes default more likely.2Pessimism can be self-fulfilling even if fundamentals are sound
4:81:5023:17:17:71:324:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:enough that an equilibrium without default exists as well.
4:82:5081:17:16:86:539:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:These results hold for real economies, in which the intervention of a monetary authority is not considered.
4:83:5188:16:17:71:539:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Does this debt fragility exist in a nominal economy?  The presence of a monetary authority can provide an
4:84:5293:17:17:71:539:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:alternative source of revenue through an inflation tax and perhaps use its influence to stabilize real interest
4:85:5404:17:17:71:539:658:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:rates.  Can the monetary authority act to eliminate strategic uncertainty over the value of sovereign debt?  If
4:86:5515:17:16:71:539:641:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:so, will it have an incentive to do so?  The answers to these questions are relevant for assessing the relevance
4:87:5627:16:17:71:539:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of these results on strategic uncertainty in debt markets and for guidance on the conduct of monetary policy.
4:88:5736:17:17:86:539:608:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The overlapping generations model with active fiscal and monetary interventions provides a framework
4:89:5836:17:17:71:539:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:for analysis.  The model is structured to highlight strategic uncertainty in the pricing of government debt
4:90:5943:17:16:71:539:574:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:stemming from the default choice of a government.  By construction, there is an equilibrium without default,
4:91:6051:16:17:71:377:558:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and in general there are other equilibria with state contingent default.
4:92:6123:17:17:86:539:541:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The monetary authority intervenes through transfers to the fiscal entity,  financed by an inflation tax.
4:93:6227:17:16:71:539:524:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The  monetary  intervention  has  a  number  of  influences.   First,  the  inflation  tax  delivers  real  resources  to
4:94:6348:16:17:71:539:508:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the government, thus reducing the debt burden from taxation.  Second, the realized value of inflation alters
4:95:6456:17:17:71:539:491:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the real value of debt and consequently the debt burden left to the fiscal authority.  Third, it may impact
4:96:6563:17:17:71:370:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:expectations of future inflation and thus the tax base for seignorage.
4:97:6633:17:16:86:539:457:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Given these transfers and its outstanding obligations, the fiscal authority chooses to default or not.  Our
4:98:6740:16:17:71:539:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:analysis emphasizes the dependence of this default decision, and thus the extent of strategic uncertainty, on
4:99:6849:17:17:71:539:424:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the conduct of monetary policy.  As our results develop, the capacity of the monetary authority to stabilize
4:100:6957:17:17:71:539:407:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:sovereign  debt  markets  relies  on  the  interplay  of  the  inflation  and  expectation  channels,  not  on  on  the
4:101:7076:17:16:71:260:390:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:collection of revenue from the inflation tax.
4:102:7121:16:17:86:539:374:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We undertake the analysis under alternative monetary policy regimes.  If there is complete discretion in
4:103:7225:17:17:71:539:357:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary policy or if the monetary authority commits to a strict inflation target, the strategic uncertainty
4:104:7333:17:17:71:318:340:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:in the real economy is present in the monetary economy.
4:105:7388:17:16:86:539:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:However, if the monetary authority can commit to a particular state contingent transfer function, given
4:106:7491:16:17:71:539:307:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:an inflation target, then its intervention can stabilize debt valuations.  Specifically, this policy is designed to
4:107:7606:17:17:71:539:290:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:eliminate all equilibria with state contingent default, preserving the one in which debt is risk-free.  Interest-
4:108:7719:17:17:71:539:273:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:ingly, this desired intervention does not “bail-out” the fiscal authority.  Rather, the countercyclical nature
4:109:7829:17:16:71:539:256:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of this policy induces an accommodative fiscal stance in times of low productivity.  This intervention leans
4:110:7937:16:17:71:442:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:against negative sentiments of investors and preserves the fundamental price of debt.
4:111:8022:17:17:86:539:223:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This policy is reminiscent of the commitment of the European Central Bank, reflected in the above quote
4:112:8125:17:16:71:540:206:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of Mario Draghi, to undertakewhatever it takesto counter pessimistic self-fulfilling expectations on Eurozone
4:113:8234:16:17:71:539:190:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:sovereign debt markets.  Under the intervention we design, the central bank uses its commitment power to
4:114:8338:17:17:71:539:173:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:have a stabilizing influence on sovereign’s debt valuations.  In equilibrium, no actual intervention is required
4:115:8450:17:15:71:539:156:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and debt is uniquely valued.  Moreover, this policy does not endanger the primary objective of the central
4:116:8556:15:12:83:540:141:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:2This interaction between beliefs and default is central to Calvo (1988);  and other contributions that followed,  including

5:126:9542:16:17:71:539:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:(1988) extends his real economy to include a discussion of inflation as a form of partial default.  He imposes
5:127:9652:17:17:71:539:608:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f12:an exogenous motive of money demand and an explicit cost of inflation function that affects net output.3
5:128:9756:17:17:71:539:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Calvo (1988) argues that there may exist multiple equilibria in the determination of inflation and the nominal
5:129:9866:17:16:71:539:574:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:interest rate on government debt.  For this analysis, there is no interaction between fiscal and monetary debt

5:131:9988:17:17:86:539:541:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Corsetti and Dedola (2013) augments Calvo’s framework to study the interaction of fiscal and monetary
5:132:10089:17:16:71:539:524:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:policy.   Their  analysis  retains  some  of  the  central  features  of  Calvo’s  model,  including  exogenous  money
5:133:10207:16:17:71:540:508:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:demand and costlyex postinflation.  They argue that monetary interventions through the printing press will
5:134:10313:17:17:71:539:491:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:not generally resolve debt fragility.  But, the central bank, through its holding of government debt, can have
5:135:10423:17:17:71:168:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:a stabilizing influence.
5:136:10447:17:16:86:539:457:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Aguiar, Amador, Farhi, and Gopinath (2013) build a nominal economy with a debt roll-over crisis, as in
5:137:10549:16:17:71:539:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Cole and Kehoe (2000).  They investigate the optimal degree of conservativeness of the central bank (as in
5:138:10655:17:17:71:539:424:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Rogoff (1985)) as a tool to address inefficient debt crisis.  Moderate inflation aversion contains the occurrence
5:139:10768:17:17:71:395:407:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of self-fulfilling debt crisis and restrains the inflation bias in normal times.
5:140:10848:17:16:86:539:390:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Our analysis differs from these others papers in a couple of fundamental ways:  (i) endogenous money
5:141:10948:16:17:71:539:374:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:demand and (ii) no assumedex  postcosts of inflation.  In particular, money demand in our model comes
5:142:11049:17:17:71:540:357:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:from  intertemporal  savings  of  households  and  the  cost  of  inflation  occurs  through  theex  anteeffect  of
5:143:11164:17:17:71:539:340:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:anticipated  inflation  on  labor  supply.   The  endogeneity  of  money  demand  is  central  to  our  results.   Our
5:144:11282:17:16:71:539:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:environment displays a complementarity between expected and realized inflation.  Money demand reflects
5:145:11384:16:17:71:540:307:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:expected inflation.  The absence of an explicitex postcost of inflation provides a strong incentive forex post
5:146:11494:17:17:71:539:290:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:inflation.  With these two features, under discretion, the central bank can be cornered into a high inflation
5:147:11603:17:17:71:539:273:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:equilibrium, unable to either inflate nominal debt or provide additional resources via seignorage, along with
5:148:11712:17:16:71:539:256:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:a low inflation equilibrium.4Accordingly, our analysis of fragility in debt markets builds upon the critical
5:149:11820:16:17:71:235:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:need to anchor inflation expectations.
5:150:11858:17:17:86:539:223:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 describes the economic environment and the fiscal problem
5:151:11962:17:16:71:539:206:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of  the  government.   Section  3  displays  debt  fragility  in  a  benchmark  real  economy.   Section 4  defines  the
5:152:12082:16:17:71:539:190:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:relevant equilibrium concept in the nominal economy and investigates the presence of debt fragility under two
5:153:12191:17:17:71:539:173:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary policy frameworks:  delegation and discretion.  Section 5 characterizes a monetary policy rule that
5:154:12299:17:15:71:539:156:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:can eliminate debt fragility and presents conditions such that this strategy is credible.  Section 6 concludes.
5:155:12410:15:9:83:296:141:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:3Specifically, see equations (16) and (19) in Calvo (1988).
5:156:12469:9:0:83:454:132:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:4This feature of our model is similar to that explored in Chari, Christiano, and Eichenbaum (1998).
6:157:12569:0:27:72:261:759:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f11:2    Economic Environment
6:158:12594:27:17:72:540:732:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Consider  an  overlapping  generation  economy  with  domestic  and  foreign  agents.   Agents  live  two  periods.
6:159:12709:17:17:72:197:715:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Time is discrete and infinite.
6:160:12739:17:16:86:539:698:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:There are a couple of key components of the model.  First, agents differ in productivity in young age and
6:161:12844:16:17:72:540:682:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:form a demand for savings.  Relatively poor agents hold money as a store of value rather than incurring a
6:162:12949:17:17:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:cost to save through an intermediary.  Importantly, money demand is endogenous, thus making the tax base
6:163:13053:17:16:72:365:648:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:for seignorage dependent on inflation expectations of young agents.
6:164:13120:16:17:86:539:632:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Second the government issues debt each period and faces a choice on how to finance the repayment of its
6:165:13223:17:17:72:508:615:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:obligations.  In particular, the government can tax labor income, print money or default on its debt.
6:166:13324:17:17:86:539:598:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The environment is structured to highlight debt fragility:  there are multiple self-fulfilling values of gov-
6:167:13433:17:33:72:503:581:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:ernment debt.  In this section, we describe the choices of private agents and the fiscal environment.
6:168:13534:33:23:72:190:548:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:2.1    Private Agents
6:169:13555:23:17:72:540:525:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Every period, a continuum of mass 1 of domestic agents (households) is born and lives two periods.  These
6:170:13660:17:17:72:540:508:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:agents  consume  only  when  old  and  their  preferences  are  linear  in  consumption  and  labor  disutility  is
6:171:13775:17:17:72:540:491:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:quadratic.   This  restriction  is  introduced  to  neatly  capture  the  reaction  of  agents  to  government  policy
6:172:13893:17:16:72:105:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:choices.
6:173:13901:16:17:86:539:458:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Domestic agents produce a perishable good in both young and old age.  Production is linear.  In youth,

6:177:14213:17:17:86:539:391:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Agents have access to two technologies to store value:  money or financially intermediated claims.  Access
6:178:14319:17:17:72:540:374:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:to the latter is costly: agents pay a participation cost Γ for access to intermediaries.  Limited financial market
6:179:14433:17:16:72:540:357:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:participation sorts agents in two groups.  For convenience, we will refer topooragents, who will hold only

7:207:16268:17:17:71:539:499:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:income is distortionary:  a high tax rate reduces return to working and hence the labor supply of old agents.

8:266:19990:15:12:83:539:159:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:8Given the indifference of risk neutral agents regarding their portfolio of government debt and storage,θis not determined

9:296:21454:17:17:71:540:485:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:domestic agents. First, direct costs of default are born by old rich agents, who hold a fractionθof government
9:297:21564:17:16:71:539:468:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:debt.  Second, if the government repudiates its debt, the country suffers from a deadweight loss, as commonly
9:298:21673:16:17:71:540:452:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:assumed in the literature on strategic default.11Formally, aggregate productivity contemporaneously drops

9:300:21885:17:16:71:539:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This is partly to ensure that default effects are contained within a generation but also reflects the quantitative

9:313:23211:7:12:79:540:224:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:11Penalties and direct sanctions are central theoretic concepts for enforcement of international asset trade.  See the seminal

9:315:23430:7:12:79:540:205:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:12Empirical evidence regarding reputation costs of default are mixed:  exclusion from international credit markets are short-

12:462:30554:27:16:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This section studies the interaction of monetary interventions and debt fragility.  Intuitively, monetary policy
12:463:30666:16:17:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:acts via three channels.  First, it can collect seignorage taxes and supplement the resources collected through
12:464:30777:17:15:72:501:138:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:labor taxation.  Second, by adjusting the realized inflation rate, it can lower the real value of debt.
12:465:30880:15:0:79:375:123:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:16This source of multiplicity is at the heart of Calvo (1988) and Cooper (2012).
13:466:30962:0:17:86:539:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:But, third, there are potential resource costs of funding the government through the inflation tax:  young
13:467:31068:17:17:72:540:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:agents perceiving high inflation in the future will work less,  reducing the monetary tax base.  This effect
13:468:31176:17:17:72:540:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:though depends on the extent of discretion in the conduct of monetary policy.  Also, the mean inflation rate
13:469:31284:17:16:72:513:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃πeis priced into the nominal interest rate, which makes attempt to deliver surprise inflation difficult.
13:470:31390:16:17:86:539:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Accordingly, this section of the paper is constructed around two polar cases, distinguished by the ability
13:471:31496:17:24:72:236:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of the monetary authority to commit.
13:472:31532:24:17:86:540:651:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:i.Monetary delegation: monetary policy decisions are made by an independent central bank that pursues
13:473:31633:17:17:96:539:634:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:a known and explicit rule, independent of fiscal considerations.  We consider the case of strict inflation
13:474:31739:17:24:96:425:617:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:targeting:  the central bank is committed to an unconditional inflation rate.
13:475:31816:24:17:83:539:593:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:ii.Monetary discretion:  monetary and fiscal decisions are linked.  Given the state of the economy, money
13:476:31921:17:17:96:539:576:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:creation and taxes are set so as to minimize welfare costs and tax distortions of old agents given a

13:478:32081:24:17:71:539:535:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Before analyzing debt fragility under these monetary regimes, we formally define the equilibrium concept of

13:490:32928:17:16:72:296:288:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f12:that we only consider cases where debt has value.17

13:494:33285:16:17:72:539:222:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:debt.   Both  the  sunspot  shock  last  period,s−1,  and  the  current  realization,s,  may  impact  fiscal  policy,
13:495:33402:17:17:72:291:205:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary policy and the choices of private agents.

15:585:37646:23:17:71:539:379:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In this institutional structure, the treasury has discretionary power over fiscal policy, choosing fiscal policy

15:588:37973:17:17:71:539:329:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:key intuition behind this result is that strict inflation targeting turns a nominal debt contract into a real
15:589:38082:17:17:71:539:312:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:security.  Hence the presence of debt fragility in real economy identified in section 3 persists in the nominal
15:590:38193:17:16:71:242:295:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:economy with strict inflation targeting.
15:591:38233:16:17:86:539:279:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:One interpretation of this structure is that the government of an individual country delegates its monetary

22:969:56730:17:16:72:540:345:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:policy could be sustained with a reputational mechanism that takes full demonetization of the economy as
22:970:56834:16:17:72:540:329:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the punishment for deviating from the inflation target.  Indeed, the welfare in the real economy is lower than
22:971:56944:17:17:72:540:312:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the welfare in the monetary economy.  We formally discuss this class of reputational mechanisms in Section

22:975:57198:16:17:72:540:222:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:adjust inflation and seignorage to accommodate variations in the price of government debt driven by strategic
22:976:57307:17:17:72:203:205:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:uncertainty and avoid default.
22:977:57337:17:16:86:539:188:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In a monetary discretion regime, the government has full discretionary power over both monetary and
22:978:57436:16:17:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:fiscal policy.  It designs its policy (τ(S), ̃π(S),D(S)) in every state, as a best response to realized productivity
22:979:57552:17:17:71:539:155:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:shockA,  the sunspots (s−1,s) and predetermined variables of the economym−1andi.  The government
22:980:57648:17:0:71:539:138:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:maximizes the welfare of home agents.  This is, in effect, the same as minimizing the cost of its policy to
23:981:57757:0:17:72:540:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:taxpayers, hence to old agents, since they contribute to government’s resources via the tax on labor income
23:982:57864:17:17:72:220:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and seignorage on money holding.
23:983:57896:17:17:86:540:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In an environment with discretion, money creation provides anex postsource of revenue without creating
23:984:57998:17:16:72:540:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:any distortion.  This low social cost of revenue ought to reduce the likelihood of default and stabilize debt
23:985:58107:16:17:72:101:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:values.
23:986:58114:17:17:86:539:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:But, an essential element of this environment is the interaction between expected and realized inflation.
23:987:58219:17:17:72:540:658:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Specifically, if agents anticipate high inflation (low  ̃πe), they would reduce labor supply in youth and their
23:988:58330:17:16:72:539:641:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:real  money  holdingsm−1accordingly.   To  collect  revenue  from  seignorage,  the  central  bank  then  has  to
23:989:58443:16:17:72:540:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:deliver a higher inflation rate (low  ̃π), consistent with the initial beliefs of agents.  Hence, under discretion,
23:990:58558:17:17:72:540:608:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the capacity of the central bank to support a stressed fiscal authority may be compromised by the strategic
23:991:58665:17:17:72:540:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:complementarity between expected inflation and delivered inflation:  if agents anticipate the willingness of
23:992:58773:17:16:72:540:574:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the central bank to resort to inflation, the real money tax base would decrease, which in turn reduces the
23:993:58879:16:17:72:252:558:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:capacity of the central bank to intervene.
23:994:58921:17:17:86:540:541:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The formation of expectations by young agents reflects theseex  postpolicy choices.  Let   ̃πe(S) denote
23:995:59025:17:16:72:540:524:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the  expectation  of  future  (inverse)  inflation  given  the  current  stateS.   Then  the  requirement  of  rational
23:996:59144:16:17:71:540:508:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:expectations is  ̃πe(S) =ES′|S ̃π(S′) where the expectation is over the future state givenS.  This condition
23:997:59252:17:17:72:342:491:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:will be used in the construction of equilibria under discretion.
23:998:59316:17:17:86:539:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:To characterize a SREE under discretion, we first determine the policy choices of a discretionary policy
23:999:59420:17:16:72:540:457:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:maker, then analyze the debt pricing dimension of the equilibrium and the associated stationary inflation
23:1000:59525:16:31:72:332:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:expectations.  The SREE combines these essential elements.

23:1015:60124:24:17:86:539:214:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Herem≡m(S) is the real money demand of current young agents.  As seen in (4), the money demand of
23:1016:60221:17:17:71:539:197:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the young is driven by current inflation expectations that are entirely independent of the current choices of
23:1017:60330:17:16:71:540:180:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the discretionary policy maker.  Further,m−1, real money held by the current old, is predetermined when the
23:1018:60437:16:0:71:540:164:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary authority decides onσD.  Thus (50) captures a direct link from money growth to inverse inflation
24:1019:60544:0:31:72:333:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃πD.  The government budget constraint under repayment is:

24:1033:61173:17:17:72:281:569:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:describe monetary policy as the choice of  ̃πD(·).
24:1034:61223:17:17:86:539:552:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Following Calvo (1978), we assume that money printing is bounded so that the effective inverse inflation
24:1035:61327:17:16:71:539:535:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:rate cannot be lower than  ̃π>0.27Importantly, our results do not hinge upon this precise bound, but rather
24:1036:61434:16:17:72:461:519:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f12:lie in the strategic interaction between expected and realized inflation under discretion.28
24:1037:61526:17:17:86:539:502:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:If the government chooses to repay the debt, the real money tax basem−1is given.  Its policy is naturally
24:1038:61631:17:17:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:biased toward inflation since taxing money holdings does not distort labor supply decisions of current money
24:1039:61739:17:16:72:540:468:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:holders.  If this tax revenue is sufficient to cover its obligations, there is no labor tax imposed, and, using
24:1040:61850:16:17:72:540:452:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Assumption 2, repayment is preferred over default.  Else, if seignorage does not generate enough revenue to
24:1041:61957:17:17:72:540:435:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:cover its obligations, the government must impose a labor tax if it chooses to avoid default.  Under discretion,
24:1042:62069:17:16:72:540:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the government relies primarily on seignorage revenue to service debt.  This characterization is summarized
24:1043:62176:16:17:72:127:402:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:in Lemma 3.
24:1044:62187:17:17:86:539:385:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In the event of default, the choice of the inflation rate is welfare neutral given the specified social welfare

24:1061:63157:12:10:72:540:179:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:can implement.  In the appendix of that paper, this restriction is rationalized by the presence of an alternative technology such
24:1062:63286:10:9:72:540:169:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:that agents can bypass the cash-in-advance constraint.  In effect, the return on this alternative technology pins down the worst

25:1079:64116:17:16:72:540:613:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:distortionary.  It will use labor taxation only if needed to repay the debt.  Hence, if the real inflation tax base
25:1080:64231:16:17:72:356:597:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:is large enough to service debt, then its labor tax policy isτ= 0.
25:1081:64297:17:17:86:539:580:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We derive first the condition under which seignorage alone is enough to service debt.  From the budget

25:1084:64605:16:0:72:497:530:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f17:demand  of  the  current  young.   The  resulting  inverse  rate  of  inflation  is  given  by  Π(S)  =ν

25:1087:64727:13:17:71:380:513:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Hence, resource from seignorage is enough to service debt if Π(S)≥ ̃π.

26:1139:67311:17:17:72:539:538:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:ization of the sunspots−1.  Using Assumption 3 and Lemma 3, there is a risk-free equilibrium of the debt
26:1140:67415:17:16:71:540:521:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:financing problem, with inflation expectations  ̃πe(so)≥ ̃π.29This may arise withτ= 0 and  ̃πe(so)≥ ̃πor,
26:1141:67520:16:17:72:260:505:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:from Lemma 3, withτ >0 and  ̃πe(so) =  ̃π.
26:1142:67562:17:17:86:539:488:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Suppose investors believe the government will default on its debt with positive probability.  If the belief is
26:1143:67672:17:17:71:540:471:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:self-fulfilling, then the optimal policy of the government must be to set the inflation level to  ̃πfor allAwhether
26:1144:67787:17:16:72:540:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:it reimburses its debt or defaults.  Otherwise, resources from seignorage would be enough to cover principal
26:1145:67895:16:17:72:539:438:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and interest on debt for all realization ofA, and default would be avoided.  Hence, inflation expectations of
26:1146:68004:17:17:72:539:421:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:agents are consistent with the best response of the government at   ̃πe(sp) =  ̃π.  The no-arbitrage condition
26:1147:68114:17:30:72:197:404:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:pricing public debt becomes:

26:1156:68249:17:17:86:540:326:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:From Lemma 2, we know that there are at least two interest ratesithat are consistent with this equi-
26:1157:68349:17:16:72:540:309:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:librium  condition,  one  of  which  carries  a  risk-premium  and  induces  the  government  to  default  for  some
26:1158:68465:16:17:72:540:293:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:realizations  ofA.   Hence  the  initial  pessimistic  beliefs  are  self-fulfilling  and  support  the  existence  of  an
26:1159:68587:17:25:72:322:276:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:interest rate that carries a positive probability of default.
26:1160:68648:25:17:86:539:251:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The key is that inflation expectations and probability of default are jointly linked by the anticipation
26:1161:68752:17:16:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of the best response of the discretionary government.  In particular, the interest rate with a risk-premium
26:1162:68859:16:17:72:540:218:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:that  solves  the  no-arbitrage  condition  is  systematically  associated  with  the  lowest  real  money  tax  base

26:1164:69078:15:13:79:540:186:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:29In general   ̃πe(S) denotes expected (inverse) inflation.  The notation   ̃πe(s) highlights the dependence of expectations on
26:1165:69205:13:9:72:540:173:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:the sunspot,s.  This is the expectation held by young agents regarding the future value of  ̃π.  This value determines the labor
26:1166:69333:9:0:72:464:164:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:supply and real money demand of young poor agents.  It also influences the nominal interest rate, see (9).

27:1168:69472:24:16:72:540:735:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We now turn to the third component of the equilibrium:  the determinants of inflation expectations   ̃πe(s).
27:1169:69580:16:17:72:540:719:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This  section  establishes  two  results.   First,  there  exist  inflation  expectations,  contingent  on  the  sunspot
27:1170:69700:17:17:72:540:702:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:realization,  that  are  consistent  with  the  choices  of  the  government.   Second,  there  may  be  multiple  such
27:1171:69819:17:17:72:540:685:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:levels  of  inflationary  expectations.   This  last  point  arises  from  the  complementarities  between  monetary
27:1172:69935:17:16:72:218:668:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:expectations and policy response.
27:1173:69968:16:17:86:539:652:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:As shown in the proof of Lemma 4, in the event of pessimism, young agents expect high inflation, i.e.
27:1174:70069:17:17:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃πe(sp)  =   ̃π.   That  is,  whenever  the  equilibrium  of  the  debt  financing  problem  induces  state-contingent
27:1175:70188:17:17:72:539:618:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:default, the inflation rate is maximal.  So, regardless of the current stateS, given pessimism in the previous
27:1176:70298:17:16:71:539:601:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:period,s−1=sp, the inverse inflation rate is  ̃π(S) =  ̃π.  This is then consistent with the initial expectations
27:1177:70411:16:17:71:457:585:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of the current old, formed when they were young in the previous period, i.e.   ̃πe(sp) =  ̃π.
27:1178:70504:17:17:86:539:568:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The  issues  of  existence  and  multiplicity  of  inflation  expectations  arise  whens−1=so.   From  Lemma
27:1179:70612:17:16:72:540:551:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:4,  young agents anticipate the government will service its debt obligation for allS.  The question is then
27:1180:70719:16:17:71:539:535:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:how the government will repay its obligation.  Given the bias toward inflationary financing of debt,  what
27:1181:70825:17:17:71:539:518:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:determines  ̃πe(so) is whether seignorage resource is enough to service principal and interest on debt for all
27:1182:70935:17:17:71:540:501:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:(A,s).  If the debt is not too large, then the inflation tax alone is sufficient to cover debt obligations:  i.e.
27:1183:71048:17:16:72:540:484:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃πr(A,s,·)> ̃πfor all (A,s) and   ̃πe(so)> ̃π.  In this case,τ(A,s) = 0 for all (A,s).  Else, the inflation tax
27:1184:71160:16:17:72:528:468:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:will be maximal,  ̃πe(so) =  ̃π, and supplemented by a labor tax.  In both casesD(A,s,) =rfor all (A,s).
27:1185:71264:17:17:86:540:451:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Formally, Lemma 3 established that withs−1=so, given the real money tax baseνmm−1=νm ̃πe(so),

28:1230:73269:30:25:72:326:456:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f9:Proof.Computation details are provided in Appendix 7.2.
28:1231:73324:25:17:86:539:431:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In the first case, the level of debt and inflation expectations are such that seignorage is sufficient to service
28:1232:73437:17:16:72:539:414:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:debt for any realization ofs.  In the second case, the level of debt and inflation expectations are such that
28:1233:73546:16:17:72:540:398:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:seignorage is not sufficient to service debt, and must be complemented with labor taxes for any realization

28:1235:73659:17:17:86:539:364:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:In fact, for some debt levelb≥ˆb,  ̃πe(so) can take several values.  This is due to the interactions between
28:1236:73767:17:16:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:expected  inflation  and  delivered  inflation,  present  in  (57).   It  can  give  rise  to  a  seignorage  Laffer  curve,
28:1237:73891:16:17:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:where several rates of inflation in excess of  ̃πgenerate the same real resource.31In addition, there is another
28:1238:74003:17:17:72:539:314:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:possible outcome with maximum inflation,  i.e.    ̃πe(so) =   ̃π,  and positive labor taxes.  These elements are
28:1239:74115:17:17:72:540:297:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:summarized in Figure 2.  To be clear, this multiplicity is a consequence of allowing an endogenous money
28:1240:74219:17:16:72:313:280:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:demand through the overlapping generations structure.
28:1241:74272:16:17:86:539:264:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Lemma 5 establishes the existence of  ̃πe(so) for allb < ̄b, but does not describe all the possible regimes.
28:1242:74380:17:17:72:540:247:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Indeed, as explained in the proof of Lemma 4, the inflation regime under optimism does not influence the
28:1243:74484:17:17:72:540:230:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:existence of multiple valuations of debt.  Hence, without loss of generality, we select in Lemma 5 an inflation

29:1256:75629:25:25:83:524:619:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:1.  Ifs−1=so, government debt is risk free as the treasury reimburses with probability 1, with either:

29:1259:75912:25:17:83:540:549:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:2.  Ifs−1=sp, the interest rate incorporates a risk-premium.  For allA, ̃π(A,·) =  ̃π.  The treasury defaults

29:1262:76184:16:17:72:540:491:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:builds on Lemma 4 and the existence of several interest rates (and associated inflation expectations) consis-
29:1263:76293:17:17:72:229:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:tent with the equilibrium definition.
29:1264:76330:17:16:86:540:457:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Ifs−1=so, then by Assumption 3, debt is risk free.  Two cases need to be distinguished, as established
29:1265:76432:16:17:72:539:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:in  Lemma  5.   Ifb <ˆb,  then  inflation  expectations  under  optimism   ̃πe(so)  allow  seignorage  resource  to
29:1266:76547:17:17:71:539:424:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:be sufficient to service principal and interest on debt.  Young agents form expectations of no default and
29:1267:76653:17:17:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃πe(so)> ̃π.  They supply labor accordingly,  young agents with low productivity save with money,  young
29:1268:76758:17:16:72:539:390:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:rich agents save via intermediated claims;  the interest rateion the government security satisfies the no-
29:1269:76864:16:17:72:539:374:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:arbitrage condition (9) with a zero probability of default, i.e.Pd= 0, and  ̃πe(so).  The optimal policy of the
29:1270:76975:17:17:71:460:357:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:government is then to set for allA, alls,  ̃π(A,s,·)> ̃π,τ(A,s,·) = 0 and repay the debt.
29:1271:77064:17:17:86:539:340:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:On the other hand,  ifˆb≤b < ̄b, then there is an equilibrium with   ̃πe(so) =   ̃π, seignorage resource is
29:1272:77171:17:16:72:540:323:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:not sufficient and taxes need be raised to service debt.  Using Lemma 3 and Assumption 3, for allA, alls,
29:1273:77276:16:17:72:539:307:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃π(A,s,·) =  ̃π,τ(A,s,·) solves the government budget constraint (51) and debt is repaid.  Accordingly, young

29:1275:77494:17:17:72:175:273:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:cases, all markets clear.
29:1276:77519:17:16:86:540:256:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Fors−1=sp,  we  detail  only  the  differences  with  the  previous  case.   Independently  of  the  level  ofb,
29:1277:77631:16:17:72:539:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:young agents form rational expectations in which there is a positive probability of default, i.e.Pd>0, and
29:1278:77737:17:17:72:540:223:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9: ̃πe(sp) =   ̃π.  The government security is priced accordingly.  Giveniand seignorage revenueνm ̃π(1− ̃π),
29:1279:77844:17:17:71:540:206:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:there is a unique threshold ̄A(i)> Alsuch that the optimal policy is to raise labor taxesτfor allA≥ ̄A(i)
29:1280:77949:17:16:71:539:189:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:so as to satisfy the budget constraint (51) and default otherwise.  Finally, expectations are consistent with

29:1282:78107:25:17:86:539:148:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Does monetary discretion provide a shield against debt fragility?  Can the government inflate the real
29:1283:78209:17:0:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:value of debt and generate additional resources to service its debt? The answer is negative. As the proposition
30:1284:78322:0:17:72:540:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:makes clear, this result does not hinge upon a particular inflation ceiling  ̃π.32Indeed, when pessimism hits
30:1285:78431:17:17:72:540:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the economy, the interplay between inflation expectations and real money tax basecornersthe central bank

30:1287:78657:17:16:72:540:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:treasury.  Hence, under monetary discretion, the sunspot shock to investors confidence triggers a joint shift
30:1288:78766:16:17:72:540:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:in inflation expectations and debt sustainability.  This shift in inflation expectations is the driving force that
30:1289:78880:17:17:72:540:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:neutralizes the strategy of the discretionary government to print money and collect seignorage to service its
30:1290:78989:17:17:72:94:658:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:debt.
30:1291:78994:17:16:86:539:641:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Finally, the strategic complementarity between expected and delivered inflation may give rise to inflation
30:1292:79100:16:17:72:540:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:multiplicity, as discussed in sub-section 4.3.3.  This element is not explicit in Proposition 4.  The point of the
30:1293:79214:17:17:72:540:608:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:proposition, and of this paper, is to study the interaction of debt fragility and monetary policy.  Accordingly,
30:1294:79326:17:17:72:540:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the analysis in Proposition 4 rests on the selection of a particular equilibrium in the event of optimism, i.e.
30:1295:79437:17:16:72:540:574:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f9:s−1=so.  The equilibrium selection is orthogonal to the multiple solutions of the debt pricing equation, as
30:1296:79544:16:17:72:540:558:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:argued before.  Of course, it is possible to add another, independent, dimension to the problem by introducing
30:1297:79654:17:40:72:353:541:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:strategic uncertainty over the the inflation rate, given optimism.

30:1299:79746:27:16:72:540:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:These  results  make  clear  that  the  monetary  authority  may  be  unable  to  prevent  debt  fragility.   If  there
30:1300:79865:16:17:72:540:458:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:is a commitment to an unconditional inflation target,  the environment is similar to a real economy,  thus
30:1301:79971:17:17:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:exposing the debt to multiple valuations.  If the monetary authority has complete discretion, then it will use
30:1302:80081:17:17:72:539:424:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the inflation tax to raise revenueex postand again fiscal tools may be needed to finance debt repayments.  In
30:1303:80190:17:16:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:both cases, when productivity is low, the tax burden can become excessive leading to default.  In equilibrium,
30:1304:80300:16:17:72:442:391:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the valuation of debt will be subject to investor sentiments in a sunspot equilibrium.
30:1305:80386:17:17:86:539:374:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This section considers a more nuanced monetary intervention which is accommodative during periods of
30:1306:80486:17:17:72:540:357:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:low productivity.  We show that with commitment, this intervention eliminates debt fragility.  Further, we
30:1307:80592:17:16:72:540:340:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:provide conditions such that reputation effects are strong enough to support this outcome without commit-

30:1310:80741:23:17:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This section returns to the commitment case.  Instead of imposing an inflation target, we allow the central
30:1311:80848:17:16:72:540:250:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:bank to choose a state-contingent inflation policy that alters the real debt burden and distributes resources
30:1312:80957:16:17:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:from seignorage across states.  As in Chari, Christiano, and Eichenbaum (1998) this is a one period com-
30:1313:81061:17:17:72:540:217:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:mitment,  allowing  the  monetary  authority  to  commit  to  inflation  next  period,  contingent  on  the  current
30:1314:81177:17:17:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:state.   By  carefully  choosing  the  distribution  of  realized  future  inflation,  the  central  bank  can  provide  a
30:1315:81299:17:16:72:193:183:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:shield against debt fragility.
30:1316:81329:16:17:86:539:167:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Suppose  the  monetary  authority  commits  to  a  rule  given  by   ̃π(A,i,s−1):  the  rate  of  inflation  in  the
30:1317:81445:17:15:72:540:150:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:current period depends on current productivity, the interest rate on outstanding debt as well as the sunspot
30:1318:81553:15:0:79:410:135:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:32Specifically, it holds for  ̃πarbitrarily close to 0, i.e.  an inflation ceiling arbitrarily high.
31:1319:81655:0:17:72:539:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:realization from previous period.33This rule is devised with a couple of key properties.  First,  to induce
31:1320:81762:17:17:72:540:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:agents to hold money, the rule will deliver a target rate of inflation.  Second, it will support the fundamental
31:1321:81874:17:17:72:540:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:equilibrium  by  using  monetary  tools  to  counter  pessimistic  expectations  so  that  equilibria  with  strategic
31:1322:81992:17:16:72:539:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:uncertainty no longer exist.34In this way, the monetary authority responds to variations in current beliefs,
31:1323:82100:16:17:72:540:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:reflected in the sunspot and the interest rate, by appropriately setting policy for the future.  Importantly, if
31:1324:82212:17:17:72:540:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:investors were pessimistic in the previous period, this policy responds to variations in productivity:  the rate
31:1325:82324:17:17:72:540:658:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of inflation is inversely related to current productivity.  Specifically, whenAis high, the rate of inflation is
31:1326:82436:17:16:72:540:641:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:relatively low and fiscal policy, through the setting of tax rates, bears more of the burden of financing debt
31:1327:82546:16:17:72:540:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:obligations.  But during times of low productivity, when default is likely, the monetary authority inflates the
31:1328:82657:17:17:72:540:608:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:real value of debt and generates seignorage revenue.  Both effects allow the fiscal authority to set low taxes
31:1329:82767:17:17:72:151:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and avoid default.
31:1330:82785:17:16:86:539:574:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We first describe the desired properties of this policy, derive its existence and properties in Lemma 6.
31:1331:82889:16:17:72:540:558:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Then,  we  characterize  the  stationary  equilibrium  of  the  economy  under   ̃π(A,i,s−1)  and  argue  that  such
31:1332:83005:17:17:72:286:541:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f12:monetary policy rule stabilizes debt valuations.35
31:1333:83055:17:16:86:539:524:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Specifically, suppose the central bank commits to a rule in which   ̃π(A,i,so) =   ̃π∗for all (A,i):  under
31:1334:83162:16:17:71:540:508:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:optimism, there is an inflation target as inmonetary delegation.  Delivered inflation  ̃π∗is independent of both
31:1335:83274:17:17:71:540:491:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:current productivityAand the interest rate on debt.  Whens−1=sp, the central bank implements a state
31:1336:83374:17:17:71:539:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:dependent (on (A,i)) monetary policy, labelled‘law’, forleaning against the winds.  This policy satisfies two
31:1337:83483:17:16:71:135:457:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:key properties.
31:1338:83498:16:17:86:539:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:First, given pessimism the policy rule anchors inflation expectations:   ̃π(A,i,sp) meets the inflation target

31:1359:84113:17:15:71:539:206:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:with probability 0 or 1.  For low values of debt obligations, the fiscal authority will choose to repay its debt,
31:1360:84226:15:9:79:348:191:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:33This commitment is independent of other elements of the state vector.
31:1361:84297:9:12:79:540:182:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:34To be clear, the policy is designed to eliminate equilibria with state contingent default.  The equilibrium with certain default
31:1362:84427:12:7:72:103:170:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:remains.
31:1363:84435:7:12:79:539:163:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:35As written,  the intervention depends on (A,i,s−1).  In the equilibrium constructed below,  optimism is equivalent to an
31:1364:84557:12:10:72:540:151:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:interest rate satisfying (1 +i) ̃π∗=R.  Hence there is only one interest rate conditional on optimism.  If there is pessimism, we
31:1365:84686:10:9:72:540:141:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:condition monetary policy on the interest rate on the outstanding debt in order to specify the monetary intervention both on

31:1367:84937:10:0:72:346:122:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:not the sunspots.  This is used in the discussion of policy implementation.

32:1375:85562:25:16:71:539:625:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f9:Proof.We  derive  a  state-contingent  monetary  policy  rule   ̃π(A,i,sp)  that  satisfies  (58)  and  deters  state

32:1377:85788:17:17:71:539:592:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:seignorage a negligible source of income for the fiscal authority.  This simplified framework outlines clearly
32:1378:85898:17:16:71:539:575:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:that the capacity of the central bank to influence the default decision of the treasury does not primarily rely
32:1379:86009:16:17:71:539:559:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:on providing more or less resources, but rather on its capacity to alter the real return to debt across states.
32:1380:86120:17:17:71:408:542:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The proof is extended to the general caseθ≥0 andνm≥0 in Appendix 7.3.

33:1426:87934:16:17:71:540:587:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:ond, the policy rule is countercyclical:   ̃π(A,i,sp) is increasing inA, i.e.  the lower the technology realization,
33:1427:88050:17:17:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the higher is inflation.  Accordingly, the real return to debt is state contingent and increasing inA.36Also,

33:1430:88380:17:17:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the policy further contributes to lower the fiscal burden in states where fiscal needs are the highest, i.e.  the

34:1470:90945:62:17:86:539:456:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This proposition makes clear that the commitment of the central bank rules out the effect of pessimism
34:1471:91047:17:17:72:540:439:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:on the value of debt.  The key to this result is the relaxation of the incentive to default by the fiscal authority
34:1472:91162:17:16:72:388:422:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:through the erosion of the real return to debt in low productivity states.
34:1473:91236:16:17:86:539:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Figure  3  displays  the  equilibrium  monetary  policy  rule  and  the  induced  tax  policy,  as  described  in
34:1474:91349:17:17:72:540:389:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Proposition 5.38In the cases−1=sp, note the distribution of inflation over realization ofA:  for lowA,
34:1475:91451:17:17:71:539:372:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:high  inflation,  i.e.   low  real  value  of  debt  and  high  seignorage  revenue.   Hence,  in  case  of  pessimism,  the
34:1476:91575:17:16:71:539:355:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary authority implements a countercyclical policy that stabilizes the price of debt and provides fiscal
34:1477:91683:16:17:71:539:339:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:relief for low values ofA, compensated by lower inflation for higher realizations ofA.  A critical element of
34:1478:91792:17:17:71:539:322:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:this policy is the commitment of the central bank so that inflation expectations are anchored and the real
34:1479:91898:17:17:71:539:305:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:money tax base is not sensitive to variations in private agents sentiments.  It illustrates how the central bank
34:1480:92010:17:16:71:539:288:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:can  alter  the  real  value  of  debt,  and  incidentally  distribute  income  from  seignorage,  so  as  to  contain  the
34:1481:92133:16:17:71:540:272:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:fiscal pressure that weights on the fiscal authority.  In this sense, the monetary authorityleans  against  the
34:1482:92244:17:17:71:373:255:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f9:windsof pessimism as well as those associated with low productivity.
34:1483:92312:17:17:86:539:238:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:As written, the monetary intervention depends jointly on the sunspot from the previous period as well
34:1484:92413:17:16:71:539:221:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:as the interest on outstanding debt.  Along the equilibrium path, from Proposition 5, only the fundamental
34:1485:92519:16:17:71:539:205:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:price of debt will be observed.  Though extraneous uncertainty may still exist, it will not be reflected in the
34:1486:92630:17:17:71:539:188:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:equilibrium interest rates.  With this in mind, it may be more natural to condition monetary interventions
34:1487:92736:17:17:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:on interest rates so that along the equilibrium path, no actual intervention is needed.  But, the monetary
34:1488:92842:17:14:71:539:154:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:authority stands ready to intervene in response to higher interest rates that reflect investor pessimism.  This
34:1489:92953:14:0:79:444:140:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:38The dependence oniis not explicit as these are the policy functions along the equilibrium path.
35:1490:93052:0:17:72:540:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:is, in effect, a threat of the monetary authority off the equilibrium path to intervene either to support the
35:1491:93161:17:17:72:447:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:fiscal authority or, if interest rates are too high, to allow default with probability one.
35:1492:93252:17:17:86:539:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:Formally, in this case, the monetary authority commits to the following policy, labelled’wit’, for’whatever

35:1497:93444:38:17:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:With this implementation, the central bank commits to a strategy conditional on the nominal interest rate
35:1498:93549:17:16:72:539:618:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and ensures that private investors coordinate on the fundamental price of debti.  In equilibrium, only the
35:1499:93655:16:17:72:540:602:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:fundamental price of debt is observed and the central bank implements its unconditional inflation target.
35:1500:93760:17:17:72:540:585:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This approach is reminiscent of the analysis in Bassetto (2005).  Indeed, committing to this specific strategy

35:1517:94338:24:16:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The preceding analysis assumes that the monetary authority is granted the capacity to commit to policies
35:1518:94442:16:17:72:540:375:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and argues that this power can eliminate multiplicity.  This section replaces the assumption of commitment
35:1519:94548:17:17:72:539:358:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:with  an  equilibrium  response  to  deviations  from’wit’that  can,  in  principle,  support  this  policy  without
35:1520:94664:17:16:71:539:341:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:commitment.  The argument uses a version of the grim trigger strategy in repeated games, as in Rubinstein
35:1521:94769:16:17:71:539:325:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:(1979).  We focus on certain features of the economy, such as the presence of strategic uncertainty, that make
35:1522:94879:17:17:71:540:308:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:deviations from policy’wit’costly and thus support the elimination of debt fragility as an outcome without
35:1523:94985:17:17:71:128:291:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:commitment.
35:1524:94996:17:16:86:539:274:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The monetary authority has an incentive to deviate from its committed policy to take advantage of the
35:1525:95097:16:17:71:539:258:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:non-distortionary nature of the inflation tax.  To counter this gain,  we construct an equilibrium in which
35:1526:95204:17:17:71:540:241:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:any deviations from’wit’are met by a strict application of ’dlg’, the monetary delegation regime of strict
35:1527:95310:17:17:71:539:224:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:inflation targeting.  From Section 4.2, this generates lifetime welfare for each generation ofVdlg( ̃π∗,p), given
35:1528:95423:17:16:71:388:207:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:by (43), and which depends positively onp, the probability of optimism.
35:1529:95494:16:17:86:539:191:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The construction, formalized in Proposition 6, goes as follows.  Along the equilibrium path the monetary
35:1530:95598:17:17:71:539:174:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:authority follows’wit’described in (68).  This generates lifetime welfare ofVwit( ̃π∗).  In a given state, the
35:1531:95708:17:15:71:539:157:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:central  bank  can  deviate  and  consider  any  policy  whatsoever:  this  is  modeled  as  complete  discretion  for
35:1532:95826:15:12:79:540:142:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:39In other words, committing to a strategy allows the monetary authority a second mover-advantage while anchoring expec-

36:1535:96085:17:17:72:540:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:intervention is no longer credible.  The monetary authority returns to its essential mandate of a targeted

36:1572:97595:17:17:72:540:377:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:on the inflation tax:   ̃πdisc=   ̃π.  The base for this tax, i.e.  the money holdings of the old agents, will be
36:1573:97708:17:17:72:394:360:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:determined by the inflationary expectations they held in the prior period.

36:1589:98685:12:11:71:540:170:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:issue, i.e.   ̃πpAl> ̃π.  Further, we assume thatbis high enough, i.e.b > νm ̃π∗.  None of the results depend crucially on these
36:1590:98813:11:7:72:106:159:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:elements.
36:1591:98822:7:9:79:362:152:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:41Again, the market shutdown case is of no interest for the present analysis.
36:1592:98899:9:12:79:540:143:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:42This welfare criterion is not inconsistent with the one derived for the repayment vs.  default decision on debt.  As discussed
36:1593:99027:12:0:72:387:131:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:in 2.2, this decision has welfare consequences that are contained within a generation.
37:1594:99115:0:17:72:539:759:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f12:The idea here is that, like the ECB, the policy’wit’is built upon a basic commitment to an inflation target.43
37:1595:99225:17:17:71:539:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:As constructed, that inflation target is met on average by the policy and along the equilibrium path.  If policy
37:1596:99337:17:17:71:539:725:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f9:’wit’is not maintained, then the experiment with that form of intervention is over and the monetary authority
37:1597:99446:17:16:71:539:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:returns to its essential goal of strict inflation target.  In fact, resorting to the inflation target is a punishment
37:1598:99563:16:17:71:540:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:precisely because of the possibility of self-fulfilling debt crisis.  Indeed, sinceVwit( ̃π∗) =Vdlg( ̃π∗,1), we have
37:1599:99679:17:17:71:215:675:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f9:Vwit( ̃π∗)> Vdlg( ̃π∗,p) forp <1.
37:1600:99712:17:17:86:540:658:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:We evaluate the credibility of the policy’wit’whenever the capacity of the institution to anchor inflation
37:1601:99818:17:16:72:540:641:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:expectations is not challenged.  Accordingly, along the deviations considered,m−1=  ̃π∗.  If ∆(A,i, ̃π∗,p)≥0,
37:1602:99927:16:17:72:540:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:then policy’wit’is incentive compatible in state (A,i,p).  Using this construction, the’wit’policy can be
37:1603:100032:17:17:71:539:608:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:supported  in  an  equilibrium  without  commitment  if  the  costs  of  deviating  from  it  are  sufficiently  high.
37:1604:100150:17:24:71:112:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Formally,

37:1606:100274:17:17:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:monetary  authority  will  pursue  the  ’wit’  policy  in  all  states,  i.e.∆(A,i, ̃π∗,p)≥0for  allAandi∈[i,iδ].
37:1607:100387:17:24:72:191:533:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:Debt fragility is eliminated.
37:1608:100416:24:17:72:539:509:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f9:Proof.ClearlyWwit(A,i, ̃π∗)−Wdisc(A,i, ̃π∗)≤0 since the monetary authority operating under discretion
37:1609:100517:17:16:72:539:492:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:could replicate policy’wit’.  In fact from Proposition 4, it will choose   ̃π=  ̃π.  This inflation rate is higher
37:1610:100631:16:17:72:539:476:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:than that under policy’wit’for any (A,i).  Higher inflation relaxes the debt burden left to be serviced with
37:1611:100739:17:17:71:539:459:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:distortionary  taxation  and  unambiguously  increases  welfare.   Also  note  that  by  construction’wit’deters
37:1612:100851:17:16:71:397:442:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:state-contingent default.  A fortiori, no default is possible under discretion.
37:1613:100930:16:17:86:540:426:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f3:AsVdlg( ̃π∗,p)  is  increasing  inp,  ∆(A,i, ̃π∗,p)  is  decreasing  inp.   So  for  low  enoughp,Vwit( ̃π∗)−
37:1614:101039:17:17:71:540:409:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f9:Vdlg( ̃π∗,p) can be large.  Further, forβclose to unity,β1−β[Vwit( ̃π∗)−Vdlg( ̃π∗,p)] can be arbitrarily large.
37:1615:101150:17:25:71:445:392:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Hence forpsufficiently small andβclose enough to unity, ∆(A,i, ̃π∗,p)>0 for allA.
37:1616:101231:25:16:86:539:367:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This  proposition  nests  two  types  of  deviations  from  the  equilibrium  path.   First,  suppose  investors  in
37:1617:101347:16:17:72:539:351:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:periodt−1  believe  in  policy’wit’,  charge  the  fundamental  interest  rateiand  expect  the  unconditional
37:1618:101457:17:17:72:539:334:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:inflation target  ̃π∗in all states.  Still in periodtthe monetary authority operating under’wit’can choose to
37:1619:101566:17:16:72:540:317:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:deviate and resort to discretion.  The gain from this is the use of the non-distortionary inflation tax, which
37:1620:101676:16:17:72:539:301:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:is the highest forA=Al.  The cost is that’whatever it takes’is no longer credible.  But the foundation of
37:1621:101781:17:17:72:539:284:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the monetary authority as following strict inflation targeting, i.e.delegation, is not altered.  If the conditions
37:1622:101895:17:17:72:503:267:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of Proposition 6 are satisfied, the monetary authority does not deviate along the equilibrium path.
37:1623:101994:17:16:86:539:250:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Providing incentives for the monetary authority along the equilibrium path is necessary but not sufficient
37:1624:102100:16:17:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:for’whatever  it  takes’to be incentive compatible.  Consider a deviation by investors in which they believe
37:1625:102208:17:17:72:540:217:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:there is a positive probability of default implyingi > i.  We maintain the integrity of the monetary authority
37:1626:102318:17:17:71:540:200:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and  thus  anchor  inflationary  expectations  at   ̃π∗.44In  this  case,’wit’prescribes  to  implement{ ̃πpA}as
37:1627:102430:17:16:71:539:183:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:described in Lemma 6.  In this case, the incentive compatibility constraint will be binding in all states if it
37:1628:102541:16:15:71:540:167:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:binds whenA=Ah.  Indeed, to deliver the inflation targeton average, the central bank tightens monetary
37:1629:102643:15:12:79:540:152:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:43The deviation from’wit’to’disc’could be replaced by a deviation to the inflation target.  This would generate a smaller
37:1630:102764:12:7:72:256:140:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:short term gain, making it easier to support’wit’.
37:1631:102814:7:12:79:539:133:6:g_d0_f15:8:g_d0_f14:44As discussed earlier, policy’wit’applies only for interest rates below a level denotediδ.  For pessimism sufficiently high so
37:1632:102941:12:0:72:477:121:8:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f14:thati > iδ,’wit’prescribes default with probability one.  In that situation, there is no credibility to evaluate.
38:1633:103056:0:17:72:540:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:policy  whenever  the  realization  of  technology  is  high.   Still,  if  the  conditions  for  Proposition  6  hold,  the
38:1634:103180:17:17:72:539:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary authority will have an incentive to intervene to preserve its reputation and follow policy ’wit’.  In
38:1635:103290:17:17:72:457:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:this case, the pessimism of the investors is not warranted, whatever the realization ofA.
38:1636:103379:17:16:86:540:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The conditions for supporting policy’wit’have two components.  This first is the usual condition that
38:1637:103480:16:17:72:540:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the monetary authority does not discount the future too heavily.  The second is not standard and involves
38:1638:103585:17:17:72:540:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the strategic uncertainty of the model.  A gain from policy’wit’is the elimination of debt crisis that do arise
38:1639:103696:17:17:71:540:658:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:with probability (1−p) under the strict inflation target regime.  As this probability of pessimism gets larger,
38:1640:103807:17:16:71:539:641:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the penalty associated with sticking to the inflation target regime is larger.  Accordingly, the higher the risk
38:1641:103919:16:17:71:539:625:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of coordination failure under inflation targeting, the more credible it is for the central bank to promise to
38:1642:104028:17:17:71:330:608:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:undertake’whatever it takes’to counter pessimistic beliefs.
38:1643:104087:17:17:86:539:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Finally, note that here we are not considering a deviation in which investors no longer trust the monetary
38:1644:104193:17:16:71:539:574:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:authority  to  meet  the  inflation  target  on  average.   Otherwise,  investors  may  hold  arbitrary  expectations
38:1645:104310:16:17:71:540:558:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:about future inflation, which would influence the gain from discretion relative to’wit’.  As argued in Section
38:1646:104420:17:17:71:539:541:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:4.2, the foundation for the credibility of the strict inflation target regime could be supported with the threat
38:1647:104532:17:40:71:220:524:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:of demonetization of the economy.
38:1648:104565:40:26:71:179:484:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f11:6    Conclusions
38:1649:104581:26:17:71:539:458:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The goal of this paper was to determine whether monetary policy enhances or mitigates fiscal fragility.  Cast
38:1650:104690:17:17:71:539:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:as a real economy, the basic environment has fragile debt:  there are multiple valuations of government debt
38:1651:104798:17:17:71:233:424:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:depending on the beliefs of investors.
38:1652:104836:17:16:86:539:407:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:The effects of introducing monetary interventions depends on the commitment of the central bank.  If the
38:1653:104940:16:17:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:central bank is committed to an inflation target, then debt fragility remains.  If the central bank is allowed
38:1654:105050:17:17:71:539:374:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:full discretion, then the presence of an inelastic source of finance through seignorage is internalized by private
38:1655:105164:17:17:71:495:357:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:agents.  Any temptation to inflate the real value of debt is anticipated and debt fragility remains.
38:1656:105264:17:16:86:539:340:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Finally, we analyze how a committed central bank can deter debt fragility, by designing a specific monetary
38:1657:105371:16:17:71:539:324:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:policy rule.  We devise a state contingent intervention that eliminates pessimistic evaluations of government
38:1658:105480:17:17:71:539:307:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:debt.  The policy requires the monetary authority to implement a countercyclical policy, that erodes the real
38:1659:105589:17:17:71:539:290:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:value of debt and provides resources, through seignorage, in times of low productivity and thus low revenue.
38:1660:105697:17:16:71:539:273:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:By supporting the fiscal authorities in these states, the incentive for default is eliminated.  Sovereign debt is
38:1661:105810:16:17:71:539:257:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:no longer subject to multiple valuations driven by investors’ sentiments.  Interestingly, the credibility of this
38:1662:105923:17:17:71:378:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:monetary strategy increases with the risk of a self-fulfilling debt crisis.
38:1663:105998:17:17:86:539:223:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:A number of extensions are worth consideration.  First, the paper studies the extremes of commitment
38:1664:106098:17:16:71:540:206:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f16:and discretion.  An interesting middle case would be stochastic commitment.  A government acting in periodt
38:1665:106205:16:17:71:540:190:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:would be allowed to adjust its policy in periodt+1 with a probability less than one.  This partial commitment
38:1666:106314:17:17:71:356:173:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:would create a cost of high inflation and thus enrich the analysis.
38:1667:106381:17:16:86:539:156:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Second, the model is dynamic but the fiscal policy is within a generation.  Thus we have assumed away
38:1668:106482:16:17:71:404:140:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:the possibilities of debt turnover and intertemporal punishments for default.
38:1669:106559:17:0:86:539:123:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Third, our analysis has underlined that the capacity of the central bank to stabilize debt valuations rely
39:1670:106667:0:17:72:540:759:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:on the issuance of non contingent nominal assets labelled in domestic currency.  It does not apply to real,
39:1671:106774:17:17:72:522:742:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:indexed debt or debt issued in foreign currency.  Allowing governments this choice would be of interest.
39:1672:106878:17:17:86:539:725:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Finally,  as  in  many  other  studies,  the  outcome  with  discretion  imposes  an  upper  bound  on  inflation.
39:1673:106992:17:16:72:540:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Providing further micro foundations for this bound remains an open area.  Perhaps a political economy model
39:1674:107099:16:41:72:527:692:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:that stresses the redistribution aspects of labor income vs inflation tax would be a productive approach.
