3:72:4104:35:36:59:195:385:17:g_d0_f9:17:g_d0_f9:C:1  Introduction
3:73:4119:36:18:59:563:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:One of the main structural features of the global economy in recent years is the apparent shortage of
3:74:4220:18:18:59:563:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe assets. The two black lines in Figure1 illustrate the paths of the short-term interest rate (dark
3:75:4322:18:18:59:563:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:blue area) and an estimate of the expected return on equity. The difference between the two lines
3:76:4419:18:18:59:563:295:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is the equity risk premium (light blue area).1Short-term rates feature a widely noted downward
3:77:4513:18:17:59:563:277:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:secular trend and a sharp drop during the Great Recession. The evolution of the expected return
3:78:4608:17:18:59:563:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on equity is markedly different: It features the same downward trend as the short-term interest
3:79:4703:18:18:59:563:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rate until the early 2000s but then remains more or less stable. The disconnect between a stable
3:80:4799:18:18:59:563:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:expected return on equity and a declining short-term interest rate is particularly salient after 2002,
3:81:4901:18:18:59:563:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and even more so since the beginning of the Great Recession. A similar disconnect is observed

3:89:5708:9:15:72:563:104:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:1The expected return on equity and the equity risk premium are notoriously hard to estimate, and hence our

4:122:7096:18:18:59:563:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:remains in many developed economies. Decomposing these developments into shifts in safe asset
4:123:7189:18:18:59:563:295:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:demand and safe asset supply is plagued with difficulties, and some studies attribute the shortage
4:124:7287:18:18:59:563:277:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to a decrease in the supply of safe assets (see e.g. Barclays 2012 who estimates that about 50% of

4:129:7749:18:18:59:563:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:securitization of risky assets in positivenetsupply hampered by a financial friction. We discuss the
4:130:7849:18:17:59:563:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:emergence of a deflationarysafety trapequilibrium with endogenous risk premia once the economy
4:131:7943:17:18:59:563:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:hits the ZLB. It is an acute form of a liquidity trap, in which the shortage of a specific form of
4:132:8041:18:24:59:549:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets (safe assets), as opposed to a general shortage of assets, is the fundamental driving force.
4:133:8140:24:18:77:563:104:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The model is a perpetual youth OLG model with nominal rigidities and heterogeneous agents:
4:134:8230:18:18:59:563:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Neutrals (risk neutral) and Knightians (infinitely risk averse). Neutrals act as financial interme-
4:135:8329:18:18:59:563:68:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:diaries by owning risky Lucas’ trees (aggregate risk) and issuing safe assets to Knightians. This
4:136:8426:18:0:59:563:50:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:securitization process is hampered by a financial friction. At a given safe interest rate, as the supply
5:137:8531:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of safe assets shrinks relative to demand, a shortage of safe assets develops. The safe interest rate
5:138:8632:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:drops and the risk premium rises. This mechanism transfers resources from Knightians to Neutrals,
5:139:8729:18:24:59:495:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reduces the demand for safe assets, and restores equilibrium in the safe asset market.
5:140:8815:24:18:77:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:However, once the safe rate hits the ZLB, the transfer mechanism breaks down, and instead
5:141:8904:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrium in the safe asset market is endogenously restored through a drop in output (income),
5:142:9000:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:which reduces the demand for safe assets. This leads to a dual view of safe asset shortages. As
5:143:9095:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:long as safe interest rates are positive, safe asset shortages are essentially benign. But when safe
5:144:9195:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interest rates reach the ZLB, they become malign. This is because at the ZLB tipping point, the
5:145:9290:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:virtuous equilibrating mechanism through a reduction in safe interest rates is replaced by a perverse
5:146:9391:18:23:59:345:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrating mechanism through a reduction in output.
5:147:9445:23:18:77:563:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:There is an alternative, goods-markets, representation of the equilibrating mechanism. Figure2
5:148:9539:18:18:59:563:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:illustrates how equilibrium output (ξX) endogenously drops below exogenous potential output (X)
5:149:9634:18:18:59:563:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:at the ZLB (when the safe interest rate isrK= 0). When prices are rigid, the determination of
5:150:9727:18:18:59:563:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrium capacity utilization (ξ) can be represented by a standard Keynesian cross whereAS(ξX)
5:151:9824:18:18:59:563:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is aggregate supply andAD(ξX) is aggregate demand. Reflecting the fact that output is demand
5:152:9916:18:18:59:563:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:determined, aggregate supply is simply the 45 degree lineAS(ξX) =ξX. Aggregate demand is
5:153:10004:18:18:59:563:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the sum of the aggregate consumptions of Knightians and Neutrals. The aggregate consumption
5:154:10095:18:18:59:563:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f16:B:of KnightiansθVSis a constant fractionθof their aggregate wealth which is equal to thegross
5:155:10186:18:18:59:563:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:supply of safe assetsVS. The aggregate consumption of Neutrals is equal to their aggregate steady-
5:156:10284:18:18:59:563:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:state income which is equal to the sum of their aggregate labor income (1−α)(1−δ)ξXand their

5:158:10467:18:18:59:563:367:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:δis the fraction of output that accrues as dividends andαis the fraction of Knightians in the
5:159:10560:18:18:59:563:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:population (an index of thegrossdemand for safe assets). The key observation is that aggregate
5:160:10654:18:17:59:563:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:demand increases with outputξX, decreases with the safe interest raterK, increases with the supply
5:161:10752:17:24:59:410:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of safe assetsVS, decreases with the demand index for safe assetsα.
5:162:10819:24:18:77:562:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Adrop in safe asset supply or an increase in safe asset demand shift aggregate demand down. At
5:163:10913:18:18:59:563:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the ZLB, this contractionary demand shock cannot be counteracted by a reduction in safe interest
5:164:11009:18:18:59:563:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ratesrK. The endogenous result is a recession (ξX < X) accompanied by an increase in risk premia
5:165:11105:18:18:59:563:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(r−rK) (determined by the other equilibrium equations of the model). Intuitively, the reduction
5:166:11200:18:18:59:563:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in aggregate demand resulting from a reduction in the supply of safe assets lowers output, which
5:167:11296:18:18:59:563:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:further reduces aggregate demand, etc. ad infinitum until the economy reaches a new fixed point
5:168:11391:18:18:59:563:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with lower output. More precisely, the reduction in the value of safe assets reduces the wealth of
5:169:11489:18:18:59:563:164:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Knightians and hence their consumption. This impulse depresses output. This initial reduction in
5:170:11585:18:18:59:563:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output then reduces the income of Neutrals, and hence their consumption, which further reduces
5:171:11679:18:18:59:563:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output. This feedback loop between output and the consumption of Neutrals keeps going until the
5:172:11774:18:18:59:563:110:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economy settles at a new fixed point with lower values of output, assets, wealth, consumption and
5:173:11871:18:23:59:98:92:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:income.

6:181:12224:15:14:59:563:523:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:supply of safe assets (VS) or an increase in the demand for safe assets (α). Aggregate demand shifts

6:185:12447:18:18:59:563:435:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stagnation hypothesis (Hansen 1939, Summers 2013, Eggertsson and Mehrota 2014) and despite
6:186:12537:18:18:59:563:417:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the existence of a positive supply of infinitely lived risky assets (safe assets are in zero net supply):
6:187:12642:18:18:59:563:399:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The value of risky assets remains finite even when the safe interest rate (rK) is zero because our
6:188:12740:18:18:59:563:381:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:model features risk premia so that the discount rate (r) that applies to the risky cash flows of risky
6:189:12842:18:24:59:256:363:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:infinitely lived assets remains positive.
6:190:12883:24:17:77:563:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Figure2 also hints at the kind of policies that are likely to be effective in a safety trap. Policies
6:191:12984:17:18:59:563:322:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that increase the gross supply of safe assets (VS), such as “helicopter drops” of money, safe public
6:192:13084:18:18:59:563:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:debt issuances, and versions of QE (such as QE1 in the U.S. and LTRO in the Eurozone) involving
6:193:13179:18:18:59:563:286:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:swaps of “positive-beta” private risky assets for “zero-beta” public safe assets, stimulate aggregate
6:194:13280:18:18:59:563:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:demand and output, and lower risk premia.2In contrast, Operation Twist (OT) type policies
6:195:13369:18:18:59:563:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:involving swaps of “negative-beta” long-term government debt for “zero-beta” short-term public
6:196:13463:18:18:59:563:232:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:debt (such as QE2 and QE3 in the U.S.) are ineffective or even counterproductive.  Similarly,
6:197:13556:18:18:59:563:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:policies that seek to stimulate aggregate demand by boosting the value of risky assets, such as
6:198:13651:18:18:59:563:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Forward Guidance (FG), are largely ineffective in safety traps because they end up being dissipated
6:199:13750:18:18:59:563:178:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in higher risk premia: The positive effect of higher future asset values on the current value of
6:200:13846:18:18:59:563:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:risky assets is endogenously offset by an increase in risky discount rates (r), limiting the resulting
6:201:13948:18:18:59:563:142:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:increase in wealth and aggregate demand. Finally, policies that succeed in directly reducing the
6:202:14044:18:15:72:563:124:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:2We refer the reader to Remark 3 in Section3 and AppendixA.2.3for an analysis of “helicopter drops” of money.
6:203:14153:15:12:59:563:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Their effects depends on whether the extra money is retired using tax revenues once the economy exits the safety
6:204:14265:12:12:59:563:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:trap. If it is, then they are equivalent to safe public debt issuances: they generate the same stimulus in the safety
6:205:14382:12:12:59:563:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:trap, and they require the same increase in tax revenues after the economy exits the safety trap. If it is not, then
6:206:14498:12:12:59:563:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:they are more stimulative than safe public debt issuances, but this extra stimulation is no free lunch and instead
6:207:14612:12:12:59:563:61:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:comes at the cost of an over-stimulation of the economy after the economy exits the safety trap. In both cases,
6:208:14723:12:0:59:228:49:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:money issuances are no “silver bullet”.
7:209:14763:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe real interest rate, such as a large enough and credible increase in the inflation target, lead to
7:210:14865:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the emergence of a good equilibrium with no recession, positive inflation, and negative safe real
7:211:14962:18:24:59:129:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interest rates.
7:212:14977:24:18:77:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The sharp distinction between the risk tolerance of the two groups of agents allows us to isolate
7:213:15074:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the safety trap from more conventional liquidity traps. In our context, a safety trap corresponds
7:214:15171:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to a situation where the economy is at the ZLB and the securitization constraint is binding. In
7:215:15266:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:contrast, a liquidity trap is a situation where the economy is at the ZLB but the securitization
7:216:15362:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:constraint isnotbinding. In liquidity traps, in contrast to safety traps, QE does not stimulate
7:217:15457:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output while FG does.  Of course reality is not as stark and both type of elements, safety and
7:218:15551:18:17:59:563:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:liquidity, are likely to play a role. Our framework is designed to highlight the importance of safe
7:219:15650:17:18:59:563:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:asset markets in determining the relative effectiveness of macroeconomic and financial policies in
7:220:15748:18:24:59:135:553:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f10:B:ZLB contexts.3
7:221:15762:24:18:77:563:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We close the paper with a summary of two extensions developed in the appendix: First, the low
7:222:15855:18:18:59:563:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rates of a safety trap environment create a fertile ground for the emergence of bubbles. However, we
7:223:15955:18:18:59:563:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:show that risky bubbles do not alleviate the safety trap situation, as they do not expand the stock
7:224:16054:18:18:59:563:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of safe assets.  This formalizes some observations in Summers (2013) that in secular stagnation
7:225:16149:18:18:59:563:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:environments, even large financial bubbles only seem to create moderate economic expansions.
7:226:16241:18:18:59:563:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Conversely, safe bubbles do alleviate the problem. We associate the latter concept to that of public
7:227:16341:18:18:59:563:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:debt, and show that the existence of a bubbly region expands the fiscal capacity of the government
7:228:16439:18:18:59:563:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and reduces the crowding out effect, as bubble-debt does not require future taxation if real rates
7:229:16537:18:18:59:563:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:remain secularly low. Second, we show that when the securitization capacity of the economy is
7:230:16630:18:18:59:563:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:endogenous, private securitization decisions are efficient outside of a safety trap, but inefficient
7:231:16730:18:18:59:563:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:inside of it. This is because in a safety trap, private agents do not internalize the stimulative effects
7:232:16835:18:23:59:447:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of safe asset creation, and hence private incentives to securitize are too low.

7:234:17003:18:18:59:563:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:closely related is the literature that identifies the shortage of safe assets as a key macroeconomic

7:236:17197:18:18:59:563:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:2009, Caballero 2010, Bernanke et al. 2011, and Barclay’s 2012).4Our paper provides a model
7:237:17288:18:17:59:563:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that captures many of the key insights in that literature and that allows us to study the main
7:238:17382:17:16:72:563:219:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:3For example, the complete ineffectiveness of FG in safety traps as opposed to standard liquidity traps is an
7:239:17491:16:12:59:563:203:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:extreme result, which relies on the stark assumptions of the model. It should not be interpreted as an indictment
7:240:17604:12:12:59:563:191:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of FG, but rather as a demonstration that the features of safety traps, even if they appear only in some milder
7:241:17715:12:12:59:563:179:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:forms, are likely to mitigate the effect of FG. In this sense, the safety trap offers a possible resolution of the “forward
7:242:17838:12:12:59:563:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:guidance puzzle”, a term that refers to the discrepancy between the implausibly large effects of forward guidance
7:243:17951:12:12:59:563:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in standard New Keynesian DSGE models of liquidity traps and its more limited effects observed in the data. See
7:244:18062:12:12:59:563:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:e.g. Carlstrom et al. (2012) and Del Negro et al. (2015) for an exposition of this puzzle. See also Del Negro et al.
7:245:18178:12:12:59:563:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(2015) and McKay et al. (2015) for other possible rationalizations in models with incomplete markets and borrowing
7:246:18292:12:8:59:109:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:constraints.
7:247:18304:8:15:72:563:111:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:4Caballero et al. (2008a,b) developed the idea that global imbalances originated in the superior development
7:248:18412:15:12:59:563:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of financial markets in developed economies, and in particular the U.S. Global imbalances resulted from an asset
7:249:18524:12:12:59:563:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:imbalance. Although we do not develop the open economy version of our model here (see Caballero et al. 2015), our
7:250:18637:12:12:59:563:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:model could capture a specific channel that lies behind global imbalances: The latter were caused by the funding
7:251:18749:12:12:59:563:60:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:countries’ demand for financial assets in excess of their ability to produce them, but this gap is particularly acute
7:252:18866:12:0:59:483:48:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:for safe assets since emerging markets have very limited institutional capability to produce them.
8:253:18965:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:macroeconomic policy implications of this environment more precisely. Like us, Barro and Mollerus
8:254:19062:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(2014) considers an environment with heterogenous risk aversion. They show that such a model can
8:255:19158:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:quantitatively match the value of safe assets to GDP as well as a number of asset pricing facts. He
8:256:19257:18:18:59:563:702:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:et al. (2015) emphasize that the public supply of safe assets is determined not only by fiscal capacity
8:257:19360:18:18:59:563:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(as in our paper), but also by self-fulfilling expectations supported by strategic complementarities
8:258:19460:18:24:59:365:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:among investors arising in the presence of default decisions.
8:259:19521:24:18:77:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Second, there is the literature on liquidity traps (see e.g. Keynes 1936, Krugman 1998, Eggerts-
8:260:19617:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:son and Woodford 2003, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo 2011, Correia et al. 2012, and Werning
8:261:19712:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:2012). This literature emphasizes that the binding ZLB on nominal interest rates presents a chal-
8:262:19809:18:17:59:563:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:lenge for macroeconomic stabilization. Recent models (see e.g. Guerrieri and Lorenzoni 2011, and
8:263:19905:17:18:59:563:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Eggertsson and Krugman 2012) emphasize the role of tightened borrowing constraints in economies
8:264:20000:18:18:59:563:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with heterogeneous agents (borrowers and savers) in generating the aggregate demand contraction
8:265:20095:18:18:59:563:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that brings the economy into the ZLB. In our model it is the shortage of safe assets that causes a
8:266:20193:18:24:59:352:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:similar phenomenon, with distinctive policy implications.
8:267:20250:24:18:77:563:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Third, there is an emerging literature on secular stagnation: the possibility of a permanent ZLB
8:268:20346:18:18:59:563:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:situation (see e.g. Kocherlakota 2013 and especially Eggertsson and Mehrota 2014). Like us, they
8:269:20442:18:18:59:563:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:use an OLG structure with a ZLB. Unlike us, they do not consider risk and risk premia. As we show,
8:270:20540:18:18:59:563:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this difference has important consequences for the relative effectiveness of different policy options.
8:271:20642:18:18:59:563:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:An additional difference has to do with the theoretical possibility of permanent ZLB equilibrium in
8:272:20741:18:18:59:563:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the presence of infinitely-lived assets, such as land. Indeed, infinitely-lived assets would rule out a
8:273:20844:18:18:59:563:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:permanent ZLB in Kocherlakota (2013) and Eggertsson and Mehrota (2014). In our model, trees
8:274:20935:18:18:59:563:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are infinitely lived but their value remains finite even when the safe interest rate is permanently at
8:275:21037:18:18:59:563:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:zero. This is only possible because our model features risk and risk premia, which are ignored in
8:276:21134:18:17:59:563:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:most liquidity trap analyzes. Finally, our modelling of inflation in Section5 borrows heavily from
8:277:21232:17:24:59:224:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Eggertsson and Mehrota (2014).
8:278:21262:24:18:77:563:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Fourth, there is a literature that documents significant deviations from the predictions of stan-
8:279:21359:18:18:59:563:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dard asset-pricing models—patterns which can be thought of as reflecting money-like convenience
8:280:21454:18:18:59:563:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:services—in the pricing of Treasury securities generally, and in the pricing of short-term T-bills
8:281:21552:18:18:59:563:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:more specifically (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen 2011, 2012, Greenwood and Vayanos 2010,
8:282:21646:18:18:59:563:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Duffee 1996, Gurkaynak et al. 2006). Our model offers an interpretation of these stylized facts,
8:283:21742:18:24:59:466:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:where the “specialness” of public debt is its safety during bad aggregate states.
8:284:21823:24:18:77:563:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Fifth, there is a literature which emphasizes how the aforementioned premium creates incentives
8:285:21918:18:18:59:563:158:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for private agents to rely heavily on short-term debt, even when this creates systemic instabilities
8:286:22018:18:18:59:563:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(Gorton 2010, Stein 2012, Woodford 2012, Gennaioli et al.  2012).  Greenwood et al.  (2012)
8:287:22109:18:18:59:563:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:consider the role of the government in increasing the supply of short-term debt and affecting the
8:288:22206:18:18:59:563:104:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:premium. Gorton and Ordonez (2013) also consider this question but in the context of a model with
8:289:22303:18:17:59:563:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(asymmetric) information acquisition about collateral where the key characteristic of public debt
8:290:22400:17:18:59:563:69:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that drives its premium is its information insensitivity. The inefficiency takes the form of too much
8:291:22501:18:0:59:563:51:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:securitization. It occurs ex ante (before the crisis), because of a pecuniary externality (fire sales).
9:292:22605:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Instead, in our model, the inefficiency takes the form of too little securitization. The inefficiency
9:293:22706:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:occurs ex post (during the crisis) if there is a safety trap, and it does not originate in a pecuniary
9:294:22808:18:24:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:externality, but rather in a Keynesian externality operating through the level of aggregate demand.
9:295:22907:24:18:77:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The paper is organized as follows. Section2 describes our basic model and introduces the key
9:296:22999:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mechanism of a safety trap. Section3 introduces public debt and considers the effects of QE policies.
9:297:23100:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Section4 analyzes the role of forward guidance. Section5 introduces inflation. Section6 discusses
9:298:23197:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the robustness of the results to a relaxation of some of the extreme assumptions of the model. It
9:299:23294:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:also summarizes two extensions discussed in the Appendix: the emergence and role of bubbles, and
9:300:23390:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the presence of a securitization externality. Section7 concludes and is followed by an extensive
9:301:23486:18:51:59:109:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:appendix.
9:302:23495:51:35:59:181:537:17:g_d0_f9:17:g_d0_f9:C:2  The Model
9:303:23507:35:18:59:563:502:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this section we introduce our basic model, which is a stylized stochastic overlapping generations
9:304:23607:18:18:59:563:484:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:model.  We start by developing a benchmark flexible price model.  We then introduce nominal
9:305:23698:18:18:59:563:466:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rigidities, whose only purpose is to bring relevance to the nominal ZLB. In this model, as long as
9:306:23796:18:18:59:563:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe nominal interest rates are positive, safe assets shortages can be accommodated with reductions
9:307:23895:18:18:59:563:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in safe nominal interest rates. The associated reduction in the return of safe assets reduces their
9:308:23994:18:18:59:563:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:demand and restores equilibrium in the market for safe assets. But if safe nominal interest rates
9:309:24091:18:45:59:540:394:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are at the ZLB, then a safety trap emerges and asset markets are cleared through a recession.
9:310:24184:45:32:59:285:349:14:g_d0_f9:14:g_d0_f9:C:2.1  Flexible Prices Benchmark
9:311:24214:32:18:59:563:317:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:B:Demographics.The horizon is infinite and time is continuous. Population is constant and nor-
9:312:24306:18:17:59:563:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:malized to one. Agents are born and die at hazard rateθ, independent across agents. Each dying
9:313:24400:17:18:59:563:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f17:B:agent is instantaneously replaced by a newborn. Therefore, in an intervaldt,θdtagents die andθdt
9:314:24496:18:24:59:142:264:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:agents are born.
9:315:24512:24:18:77:563:240:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Aggregate risk.We model aggregate risk as follows. There are twoaggregatePoisson processes:
9:316:24603:18:18:59:563:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a good Poisson process with intensityλ+and a bad Poisson process with intensityλ−. We denote
9:317:24695:18:18:59:563:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:byσ+andσ−the stopping times for the realizations of the good and bad Poisson processes. We
9:318:24785:18:18:59:563:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:define a Poisson event to be the first realization of either the good or the bad Poisson process, with
9:319:24887:18:18:59:563:168:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f10:B:corresponding stopping timeσ= min{σ+, σ−}.   We say that the Poisson event is good ifσ=σ+
9:320:24976:18:18:59:563:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and bad ifσ=σ−. Before the Poisson event, fort< σ, outputXtper unit of time is equal toX.
9:321:25065:18:18:59:563:132:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:After the Poisson event, fort≥σ, outputXtis equal to-+X > Xif the Poisson event is good,
9:322:25153:18:18:59:563:114:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f16:B:and to-−X < Xif the Poisson event is bad. The focus of our analysis is on the periodbefore
9:323:25243:18:18:59:563:96:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the realization of the aggregate Poisson event, when agents make portfolio decisions in anticipation
9:324:25343:18:18:59:563:78:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of such an event. While most of our results only rely on the bad Poisson event, the good Poisson
9:325:25439:18:0:59:563:60:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:event will be important when we consider the effects of forward guidance, and so we introduce it
10:326:25536:0:24:59:134:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from the start.
10:327:25551:24:18:77:563:732:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Preferences.We assume that agents only have an opportunity to consume when they die,
10:328:25635:18:18:59:563:714:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:ct. We denote byσθthe stopping time for the idiosyncratic Poisson process controlling an agent’s
10:329:25731:18:18:59:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:death. This risk is uninsurable and plays no role in our model, aside from its aggregate saving
10:330:25826:18:24:59:119:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:implication.
10:331:25838:24:18:77:563:654:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:There are two types of agents in the population: a fractionαof Knightians and 1−αof Neutrals,
10:332:25931:18:18:59:563:636:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with identical demographics. These agents have different preferences over aggregate risk: Knightians
10:333:26031:18:18:59:563:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are infinitely risk averse over short time intervals, while Neutrals are risk neutrals over short time
10:334:26133:18:18:59:563:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:intervals. More precisely, for a given stochastic consumption process{ct}w   hich is measurable with
10:335:26233:18:17:59:563:582:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f17:B:respect to the information available at datet, we define the utilityUNtof a Neutral alive at datet,

11:411:30371:18:18:59:563:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:can own and operate Lucas trees (a Lucas tree owned and operated by a Knightian yields no
11:412:30460:18:18:59:563:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dividends). A Neutral can then securitize (borrow against) a tree that he owns by issuing arbitrary
11:413:30559:18:18:59:563:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:state-contingent securities to outside investors (other Neutrals or Knightians) against the cash
11:414:30655:18:18:59:563:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:flows of that tree. We assume that these state-contingent securities cannot be made contingent on
11:415:30752:18:18:59:563:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:idiosyncratic death Poisson processes. Neutrals therefore act like banks in many models of financial
11:416:30852:18:24:59:333:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:intermediation (see e.g. Holmstr ̈om and Tirole 1997).
11:417:30906:24:18:77:563:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The securitization process is hampered by an agency problem: only a fractionρof the cash flows

11:419:31095:18:18:59:563:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ways. One popular microfoundation in the financial constraints literature (see e.g. Holmstr ̈om and
11:420:31194:18:18:59:563:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Tirole 1997, 1998, Kiyotaki and Moore 1997, and a vast literature since then) is the existence of a
11:421:31293:18:18:59:564:110:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:moral hazard problem whereby the owner of a tree can abscond with a fraction 1−ρof the cash

11:423:31447:23:18:77:563:69:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We also make two technical financial friction assumptions which we maintain throughout the
11:424:31537:18:0:59:563:51:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:paper. The first assumption,ρ > α, ensures that the financial friction would have no bite in the
12:425:31634:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:absence of aggregate risk (i.e., if we had-+=-−= 1). This allows us to isolate the limits to the
12:426:31730:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:securitization of safe assets, from the more standard financial friction that limits the securitization of
12:427:31836:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets in general. In particular, this implies that the financial friction has no bite after the realization
12:428:31944:18:18:59:560:702:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:B:of the Poisson event (good or bad). This matters when we derive the value of safe assetsVS=ρ-−Xθ

12:452:33196:18:18:59:563:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Whenit= 0, money is not dominated by non-monetary safe assets as a safe store of value, and it is
12:453:33293:18:18:59:563:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:then also held as a safe store of value (the cash-in-advance constraint is slack). The monetary model
12:454:33394:18:18:59:563:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:has no equilibrium withit<0    because money would then dominate non-monetary safe assets as a
12:455:33488:18:18:59:563:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe store of value. The cashless limit of the monetary model (see e.g. Woodford 2003) coincides
12:456:33584:18:24:59:372:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with the model that we focus on here with a ZLB constraint.
12:457:33643:24:17:77:563:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Because prices are assumed to be flexible (for now), the assumption that the price level is
12:458:33734:17:18:59:563:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:continuous and the imposition of the ZLB constraint on nominal interest ratesit≥0have no

12:462:34116:18:18:59:563:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:shortly in Section2.2  , this is no longer true when prices are not perfectly flexible.But for now we
12:463:34217:18:24:59:234:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:focus exclusively on real variables.
12:464:34253:24:18:77:563:212:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Equilibrium.As we mentioned, we focus on the periodbeforethe (aggregate) Poisson event.
12:465:34340:18:18:59:563:194:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:That is, we analyze the consequences of the possibility and fear of a shock rather than of the
12:466:34434:18:24:59:187:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:realization of that shock.
12:467:34460:24:18:77:563:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Newborns trade their endowments for assets. They keep reinvesting and rebalancing their port-

12:469:34654:18:18:59:563:116:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their portfolios of assets to maximize their utility. Crucially, Knightians and Neutrals choose dif-
12:470:34754:18:23:59:144:98:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ferent portfolios.
12:471:34772:23:18:77:563:75:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The main features of the portfolios can be understood intuitively.  In order to maximize his
12:472:34864:18:0:59:563:57:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:utility at datet, a Knightian agent chooses to invest his wealth betweentandt+dtin safe assets;

13:475:35151:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:maximize his utility at datet, a Neutral agent chooses to hold some Lucas trees and to issue some
13:476:35248:18:18:59:563:702:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe assets to Knightians against their pledgeable dividends. This is all we need to know about
13:477:35343:18:24:59:329:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:optimal portfolios in order to derive the equilibrium.
13:478:35397:24:18:77:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Because of the linearity of preferences and the i.i.d. (across agents and time) nature of death,
13:479:35493:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the model aggregates cleanly. We denote byWKtthe total wealth of Knightians andWNtthe total
13:480:35584:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:wealth of Neutrals. We denote byVStthe total value of safe assets that can be issued against the
13:481:35680:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Lucas trees, and byVRtthe total value of risky assets, by which we mean the value of the Lucas

13:483:35874:17:18:59:563:571:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:VStas the total value of safe assets thatcanbe issued, not the value of safe assets thatareactually
13:484:35973:18:18:59:563:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:issued by Neutrals to Knightians. It is therefore possible that some safe assets are held by Neutrals.
13:485:36075:18:18:59:563:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We denote total wealth byWtwithWt=WKt+WNt, and the total value of assets byVt=VRt+VSt.

14:565:38962:18:18:59:563:277:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:can think of risky assets either as levered Lucas trees or as simply capitalizing the fraction of

14:570:39421:24:18:77:563:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Aswe shall see, safe real interest rate jump (toδθ) when a Poisson event occurs and so does

14:572:39608:18:18:59:563:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:means that the variable indexing the dividend pledged to safe assets must also jump after a Poisson

14:579:39982:18:0:59:563:74:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we always haveδSt< δρin equilibrium so that the pledgeability constraint is also slack before the

15:581:40181:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:asset creation. The extra pledgeable dividend after the good Poisson event and before the Poisson

15:633:42507:9:12:59:563:123:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:view safe assets as short-term debt which is rolled over every period, then this simply means that interest rate on

15:635:42742:12:12:59:563:99:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of dividends, then this means that the dividends are negative for a while. In both cases, it represents a flow payment
15:636:42860:12:12:59:562:87:10:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f11:F:from safe asset holders to their issuers. But note that after the Poisson event, safe real interest rates,δS+,andδS−
15:637:42976:12:12:59:563:75:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:are all positive and so payments necessarily flow from safe asset issuers to holders. This explains why even in this
15:638:43092:12:12:59:563:63:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:case, the value of safe assets (viewed as long-lived assets capitalizing a stream of dividends) remains positive and

17:696:46019:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:not central to the questions we want to analyze.  The only decision that agents are making is how
17:697:46116:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:to invest their wealth at every point in time, and because Knightians and Neutrals have different
17:698:46213:18:37:59:335:702:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:C:attitudes towards risk, they choose different portfolios.
17:699:46270:37:18:59:563:665:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f30:F:Remark 2Our model features two forms of market incompleteness.  The first one is tied to our
17:700:46362:18:18:59:563:647:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:overlapping generations structure, which makes future endowment (“wages”) non-pledgeable.  The
17:701:46456:18:18:59:563:629:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:second market incompleteness is the pledegeability of dividends constraint (ρ) which limits the ability
17:702:46559:18:18:59:563:611:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:to securitize (tranche) Lucas’ trees.  Tranching is desirable because it decomposes an asset into a
17:703:46658:18:17:59:563:593:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:safe tranche which can be sold to Knightian agents and a risky tranche. In the policy discussion we
17:704:46757:17:18:59:563:576:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:will not exploit the first form of incompleteness (we use the OLG structure mostly because it yields a
17:705:46859:18:18:59:563:558:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:stationary distribution of wealth between Neutrals and Knightians) and focus instead on the second
17:706:46957:18:18:59:563:540:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:form.  The latter implies that in equilibrium risky assets held by Neutrals contain an unpledgable

17:710:47263:32:18:59:563:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this section, we introduce nominal rigidities. We refer to the allocation of the above flexible price

17:712:47462:18:18:59:563:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate) before the Poisson event, and we writerntfor the natural risky expected rate of return
17:713:47563:18:18:59:563:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:before the Poisson event. Both are equal toδθafter the Poisson event (good or bad). For natural
17:714:47658:18:17:59:563:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output, we also sometimes use the term potential output. It is equal toXbefore the Poisson event,

17:716:47829:24:18:77:563:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:With nominal rigidities, there is potentially a gap betweenactual outputandpotential output.
17:717:47921:18:18:59:563:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Appropriate monetary policy can ensure that actual output is at potential as long as the safe natural
17:718:48022:18:18:59:563:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate is positive. But when the safe natural interest rate is negative, the economy reaches
17:719:48121:18:24:59:316:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the ZLB and actual output drops below potential.
17:720:48169:24:18:77:563:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Depending on whether we are in the unconstrained regime where the financial friction is slack

17:722:48364:18:18:59:563:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f16:B:and where the heterogeneity in risk aversion matters, the situation that emerges is either aliquidity

17:724:48561:18:18:59:563:164:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:feature positive and endogenous risk premia.  It will become apparent that the key distinction
17:725:48655:18:18:59:563:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:between the two situations has to do with the difference in the sensitivity of risk premia and its

17:727:48771:23:18:77:563:105:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our focus is on the safety trap, which is novel, but we also characterize the more standard

18:733:49237:31:18:59:563:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We use the traditional ingredients of New Keynesian economics: imperfect competition, sticky
18:734:49329:18:24:59:230:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prices, and a monetary authority.
18:735:49362:24:18:77:563:642:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Rigid prices.We assume that the prices of the different varieties are entirely fixed (an extreme

18:737:49552:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:where without loss of generality we takeP= 1. Monopolistic firms accommodate demand for their

18:739:49687:24:18:77:563:564:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Because the prices of all varieties are identical, the demand for all varieties is the same. Output

18:743:50001:24:18:77:563:486:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Monetary policy and the ZLB.In contrast with the case of flexible prices, with rigid prices,
18:744:50093:18:18:59:563:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the ZLB constraint impacts the real allocations that arise in equilibrium. This is because with rigid
18:745:50194:18:17:59:563:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prices, the nominal interest rate determines the safe real interest raterKt=itand hence we have a
18:746:50291:17:24:59:153:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:constraintrKt≥0   .
18:747:50310:24:18:77:563:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The safe natural interest rate is always positive atδθafter a Poisson event (good or bad). By
18:748:50403:18:18:59:563:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:setting the nominal interest rate equal to this safe natural interest rate, the monetary authority can
18:749:50505:18:18:59:563:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:replicate the natural allocation after a Poisson event. Before the Poisson event however, the safe

18:751:50705:18:18:59:563:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:setting the nominal interest rate equal to the natural safe interest ratei=rK,nt>0   , the monetary
18:752:50804:18:18:59:563:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:authority can replicate the natural allocation, ensuring that output is at potentialξ= 1. But if the

18:754:51007:18:18:59:563:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we shall see, it makes a great difference whether this happens in the unconstrained regime (liquidity
18:755:51108:18:18:59:563:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trap) or in the constrained regime (safety trap). The regime that is of most interest to us is the
18:756:51206:18:18:59:563:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safety trap. We therefore start with this case and then contrast it with the liquidity trap case. As
18:757:51306:18:18:59:563:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in the case where prices are flexible, we focus on stochastic steady states before the Poisson event

18:762:51637:18:18:59:563:103:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with flexible prices. We now explain howξis determined in two different but equivalent ways. First

19:817:53372:9:15:69:563:104:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:11Note that output in the safety trap can be higher or lower than output after the bad Poisson event. Indeed we

20:834:54366:18:18:59:563:591:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:steady state without any transitional dynamics. The mechanism by which equilibrium in the safe
20:835:54460:18:18:59:562:573:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:B:asset market is restored has two parts. The first part immediately reduces Knightian wealthWK
20:836:54553:18:18:59:563:555:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f16:B:to a lower level, consistent with the lower supply of safe assetsρ-−Xθ. The second partmaintains
20:837:54649:18:24:59:270:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Knightian wealthWKat this lower level.
20:838:54687:24:17:77:563:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The first part of the mechanism is as follows. The economy undergoes an immediate wealth
20:839:54775:17:18:59:563:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:adjustment (the wealth of Knightians drops) through a round of trading between Knightians and
20:840:54868:18:18:59:563:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Neutrals born in previous periods. At impact, Knightians hold assets that now carry some risk.
20:841:54962:18:18:59:563:460:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:They react by selling the risky part of their portfolio to Neutrals. This shedding of risky assets
20:842:55060:18:18:59:563:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:catalyzes an instantaneous fire sale whereby the price of risky assets collapses before immediately
20:843:55159:18:18:59:563:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:recovering once risky assets have changed hands. Needless to say, in reality this phase takes time,
20:844:55258:18:24:59:441:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:which we have removed to focus on the phase following the initial turmoil.
20:845:55332:24:18:77:563:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The second part of the equilibrating mechanism differs depending on whether the safe interest
20:846:55425:18:18:59:563:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f17:B:raterK=iis above or at the ZLB. IfrK=i>0, then a reduction in the safe interest raterK=i
20:847:55513:18:18:59:563:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:takes place.  This reduction in the safe interest rate effectively implements a transfer (in every
20:848:55611:18:18:59:563:328:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:period) from Knightians to Neutrals, which limits the growth of Knightian wealth. As a result, the
20:849:55709:18:18:59:563:310:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe asset market remains in equilibrium, and so does the goods market. But if the safe interest rate
20:850:55810:18:18:59:563:292:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is against the ZLBrK=i=0, then this reduction in the safe interest rate cannot take place and
20:851:55903:18:18:59:563:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the associated transfer cannot occur. The only adjustment mechanism is with a decline in output
20:852:55998:18:23:59:317:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(income), which also drags down Neutral’s wealth.
20:853:56047:23:18:77:563:233:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:AS-AD representation and the Keynesian cross.We now provide an alternative way of
20:854:56128:18:18:59:563:215:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:understanding the equilibrium determination of capacity utilizationξin a safety trap as a fixed point
20:855:56229:18:18:59:563:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in an AS-AD Keynesian cross representation whereξequalizes aggregate demand and aggregate
20:856:56318:18:19:59:563:179:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:supplyAD(ξX) =AS(ξX). This representation puts the goods market instead of the safe asset
20:857:56407:19:15:69:563:160:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:12We rule out rationing in the safe asset market. The reason is that the safe asset market is postulated to be
20:858:56517:15:12:59:563:145:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:competitive and the price of safe safe assets to be flexible, which is an assumption shared by all the New Keynesian
20:859:56633:12:12:59:563:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:literature. This is unlike the goods market where monopolistic suppliers of the different varieties of final goods post
20:860:56752:12:9:59:328:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:rigid prices and accommodate demand at these posted prices.
20:861:56811:9:15:69:564:112:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:13The one time unexpected shock could be a reduction in the securitization capacityρof the economy. It could also
20:862:56924:15:12:59:563:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:be a reduction inμ−, akin to an increase in macroeconomic uncertainty in the macroeconomic uncertainty literature,
20:863:57038:12:12:59:563:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:or to an increase in the severity of disasters in the rare disasters literature. The safety trap recession then arises
20:864:57156:12:12:59:563:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:transitorily but potentialy very persistently (in fact essentially permanently in the limitλ+→0 andλ−→0) in

21:869:57368:33:18:59:563:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This captures the fact that with rigid prices, output is demand determined. Aggregate demand

21:871:57539:18:17:59:563:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and NeutralsθWN, whereθacts as the effective aggregate average propensity to consume out
21:872:57627:17:18:59:563:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of wealth.  Since Knightians only hold safe assets and safe assets are only held by Knightians
21:873:57721:18:18:59:563:595:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in the constrained regime, Knightian wealth coincides with the value of safe assetsWK=VS,
21:874:57810:18:18:59:563:577:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and Knightian consumption isθWK=θVS. Similarly, since Neutrals only hold risky assets and
21:875:57899:18:18:59:563:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:risky assets are only held by Neutrals, Neutral wealth coincides with the value of risky assets

21:878:58156:18:18:59:563:505:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the Poisson event, Neutral consumption equals Neutral income, which is the sum of the income of

21:900:59677:18:18:59:563:141:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f4:B:shift to aggregate demand.Away from the ZLB, this reduction in aggregate demand can be accom-
21:901:59770:18:18:59:563:123:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:modated by an easing of monetary policy (a reduction ini=rK), thereby maintaining output at
21:902:59861:18:18:59:563:105:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:potential (ξ= 1). But at the ZLB, monetary policy cannot be eased, and instead the reduction in
21:903:59956:18:18:59:563:87:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:aggregate demand lowers output, which further reduces aggregate demand, etc. ad infinitum until
21:904:60051:18:18:59:563:69:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the economy reaches a new fixed point with lower output. Intuitively, the reduction in the value
21:905:60147:18:0:59:563:51:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of safe assets reduces Knightian wealth and hence Knightian consumption. This impulse depresses
22:906:60244:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output. This initial reduction in output then reduces the income of Neutrals, and hence their con-
22:907:60342:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sumption, which further reduces output. This feedback loop between output and the consumption
22:908:60435:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of Neutrals keeps going until the economy settles at a new fixed point with lower values of output,
22:909:60534:18:18:59:563:702:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets, wealth, consumption and income. The reduction in income of Neutrals and Knightians are
22:910:60628:18:24:59:236:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:constant at these new lower levels.

23:1032:64907:30:0:77:563:63:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Safety traps vs.  liquidity traps.We conclude this section by highlighting three broad
24:1033:64995:0:37:59:293:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:differences between safety and liquidity traps:
24:1034:65042:37:18:76:563:719:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:A:•Risk premium.Both safety traps and liquidity traps occur when the natural safe interest rate

24:1036:65222:18:18:88:563:683:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:key difference between safety traps and liquidity traps is the reason behind the ZLB: Safety
24:1037:65314:18:18:88:563:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:traps arise because of a shortage of safe assets and positive while liquidity traps originate in
24:1038:65410:18:18:88:563:647:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:a shortage of assets in general. Positive and endogenous risk premia are at the core of the
24:1039:65501:18:18:88:563:629:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:mechanics of safety traps, while they only play a peripheral role in liquidity traps (in fact, in
24:1040:65598:18:18:88:563:611:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:our rendition, they are zero). The securitization capacityρ, and more generally the supply of
24:1041:65691:18:17:88:563:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:safe assetsVSplay no role in liquidity traps, whereas they are the key bottlenecks in safety
24:1042:65783:17:18:88:563:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:traps. Aside from the direct relevance of endogenous risk premia during severe recessions,
24:1043:65873:18:18:88:563:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:this distinction has important implications for the persistence and policy implications of the
24:1044:65967:18:28:88:208:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:different kinds of traps.
24:1045:65992:28:18:76:563:512:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:A:•Persistence and secular stagnation.The possibility of a permanent ZLB equilibrium is some-
24:1046:66083:18:18:88:563:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:times disputed on the grounds that this would imply an infinite value for infinitely-lived
24:1047:66173:18:18:88:563:476:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:assets, such as land. In our model, Lucas trees are indeed infinitely lived, and for that reason,
24:1048:66270:18:18:88:563:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:a permanent liquidity trap cannot occur. Indeed, in the limitλ+→0andλ−→0    , we have

24:1050:66444:18:0:88:456:422:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:A:regime, in the limitλ+→0andλ−→0    , we haverK,n=δθ−α−ρ-

24:1053:66519:14:18:88:563:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:be negative. In that case, an essentially permanent safety trap emerges. The value of trees
24:1054:66610:18:18:88:563:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:remains finite even when the safe interest rate isrK=i=0 because our model features risk
24:1055:66698:18:18:88:563:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:premia so that the discount rate that applies to the risky cash flows of Lucas trees remains
24:1056:66790:18:27:88:162:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:positiver >0.
24:1057:66803:27:18:76:563:323:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:A:•Policy options:  a roadmap.In the next sections, we analyze policy options in safety traps,
24:1058:66895:18:18:88:563:305:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:and contrast them briefly with liquidity traps. In safety traps, effective stimulative policies
24:1059:66990:18:18:88:563:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:work by influencing the value of safe assetsVS(public debt issuances and QE in Section3)

24:1069:67474:18:18:88:563:174:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:later on when we discuss theineffectivenessof forward guidance in a safety trap (Section
24:1070:67562:18:18:88:563:156:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:4).  In sharp contrast, the relative effectiveness of safe public debt issuances and QE and
24:1071:67653:18:18:88:563:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:the relative ineffectiveness of Forward Guidance (FG) in safety traps are exactly inverted in
24:1072:67746:18:18:88:563:120:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:liquidity traps. Public debt issuances and QE become ineffective because they increase the
24:1073:67836:18:18:88:563:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:value of safe assetsVSbut crowd out the value of risky assetsVRand hence do not increase
24:1074:67924:18:17:88:563:84:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:the value of assetsVin general. FG becomes effective in liquidity traps because whenλ+>0   ,
24:1075:68016:17:0:88:552:67:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:the future value of risky assets after the good Poisson event affects the determination ofξ.

25:1079:68336:36:18:59:563:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this section we introduce safe public debt to our analysis. We focus on the safety creation and
25:1080:68434:18:18:59:563:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:transformation roles of the government by assuming that the taxes that support public debt are
25:1081:68528:18:18:59:563:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:levied on dividends (and are hence fully capitalized). As a result, the economy is de facto Ricardian
25:1082:68629:18:24:59:369:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in the unconstrained regime, but not in the constrained one.
25:1083:68689:24:18:77:563:573:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The government’s capacity to increase the total supply of safe assets by issuing safe public debt
25:1084:68786:18:18:59:563:555:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:depends on two factors:fiscal capacityandcrowding out of private safe assets by public safe assets.
25:1085:68885:18:18:59:563:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In a safe asset shortage situation, the relevant form of fiscal capacity is the government’s ability to
25:1086:68988:18:17:59:563:519:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:raise taxes in the bad events feared by Knightians. Crowding out, on the other hand, depends on
25:1087:69083:17:18:59:563:502:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:how much these taxes reduce the private sector’s capacity to issue safe claims backed by the risky
25:1088:69181:18:18:59:563:484:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dividends of Lucas trees. In our model, there is less crowding out when the securitization capacity
25:1089:69280:18:18:59:563:466:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the economy is impaired (when the financial friction is severe). In a safety trap, issuing public
25:1090:69380:18:18:59:563:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:debt, and possibly undertaking QE by purchasing private risky assets, increases the supply of safe
25:1091:69478:18:18:59:563:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets, stimulates the economy, and reduces risk premia. By contrast, these policies are much less
25:1092:69576:18:45:59:433:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:relevant (irrelevant in our stylized model) in conventional liquidity traps.

25:1094:69688:32:24:59:522:335:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:B:Public debt.Let us first introduce safe public debt outside of a safety trap withrK>0   .
25:1095:69777:24:18:77:563:311:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The government taxes dividends,δX. The tax rate isτ+after the good Poisson event occurs,

25:1097:69964:17:18:59:563:276:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:τtthat satisfies the government flow budget constraint. The government issues a fixed amount of
25:1098:70059:18:18:59:563:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:risk-free bonds that capitalize future tax revenues and pays a variable raterKt. The proceeds of the
25:1099:70159:18:24:59:381:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sales of these bonds are rebated lump-sum to agents at date 0.

26:1110:70742:0:18:59:575:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the government a comparative advantage in the production of safe assets.16In SectionA.6  , we
26:1111:70835:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:develop a different rationale for government intervention in the securitization market. There, we
26:1112:70932:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:endogenize the securitization capacityρand show that in a safety trap there is a securitization
26:1113:71027:18:18:59:563:702:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:externality that justifies government intervention; we postpone a full discussion of this justification
26:1114:71130:18:24:59:196:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for intervention until then.
26:1115:71158:24:18:77:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Note, however, that the scope for policy depends crucially on the securitization capacity of the
26:1116:71254:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economy (indexed byρ). In a very developed market,ρis high, and soon public debt starts to crowd
26:1117:71350:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:out privately produced safe assets. To see this, note that because the consumption of a Neutral
26:1118:71445:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cannot be negative (a form of limited liability), the fraction of dividends that it can pledge is now

26:1120:71631:17:24:59:563:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:threshold public safe assets crowd out private safe assets one for one (we return to this issue below).

26:1148:72849:23:16:69:563:211:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:16This mechanism has some commonality with the idea in Holmstr ̈om and Tirole (1998) that the government has
26:1149:72957:16:11:59:563:195:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a comparative advantage in providing liquidity. In their model like in ours, this result arises from the assumption
26:1150:73072:11:12:59:563:184:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:that some agents (consumers in their model) lack commitment and hence cannot borrow because they cannot issue
26:1151:73181:12:12:59:563:172:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:securities that pledge their future endowments. This can result in a scarcity of stores of value. The government can
26:1152:73297:12:12:59:563:160:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:alleviate this scarcity by issuing public debt and repaying this debt by taxing consumers. The proceeds of the debt
26:1153:73412:12:12:59:563:148:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:issuance can actually be rebated to consumers. At the aggregate level, this essentially relaxes the borrowing constraint
26:1154:73532:12:12:59:563:136:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of consumers, as they borrow indirectly through the government.  In their model like in ours, the comparative
26:1155:73641:12:12:59:563:124:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:advantage of the government in providing liquidity arises because it is better than private lenders at collecting
26:1156:73754:12:9:59:170:112:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:revenues from consumers.

27:1253:75726:22:16:69:563:145:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:19We can easily extend the model to feature intermediate crowding out by assuming that the trees differ in their

27:1255:75949:12:0:59:238:117:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:difference is that we now haveρ(τ−) =

27:1259:76069:8:16:69:563:97:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:20More generally, the distribution of taxes matters for this result. We refer the reader to an earlier version of
27:1260:76182:16:12:59:563:81:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:this paper, Caballero and Farhi (2013), for an exploration of this idea.  In a recent paper, Barro and Mollerus
27:1261:76293:12:12:59:563:69:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(2014) consider a model with heterogeneous risk aversion and assume that taxes are distributed independently of
27:1262:76404:12:11:59:563:57:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:risk aversion. They generate a crowding out of 0.5 despite the fact that Ricardian equivalence holds in their model.
27:1263:76520:11:0:59:509:46:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:See Abel (2015) for a detailed exploration of the determinants of crowding out in Ricardian economies.
28:1264:76624:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The stimulative effects of safe public debt can be understood most clearly by going back to our
28:1265:76719:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:AS-AD equilibrium representation. Because issuing safe public debt increases the supply of safe

28:1268:76970:24:18:77:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In the model, we necessarily haveτ+-+=τ−-−, which implies thatτ+< τ−. For this reason, it
28:1269:77059:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is natural to expect fiscal constraints to be more binding after the bad Poisson event than after the
28:1270:77160:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:good Poisson event. This is why we adoptτ−, a measure of the ability of the government to raise
28:1271:77255:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tax revenues after the bad Poisson event, as our measure offuture fiscal capacity. In particular, in

28:1278:77565:33:18:59:563:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Note however that taxes do not have to be raised while the economy is in the safety trap before

28:1282:77856:18:17:59:563:440:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:then public debt becomes risky. For example, suppose thatτ−has an upped bound at  ̄τ−reached

28:1287:78348:18:36:59:105:351:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economy.
28:1288:78356:36:18:59:563:315:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f30:F:Remark 3Money is a safe assets. At the ZLB, money has the same return as non-monetary safe

28:1290:78541:18:18:59:563:279:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:happens when the government issues extra money through a “helicopter drop” before the Poisson

28:1292:78743:18:18:59:563:243:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:options which differ in what the government does once the economy is no longer at the ZLB after
28:1293:78838:18:18:59:563:225:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:the Poisson event: (a) retire the extra money; (b) not retire the extra money. Option (a) is literally
28:1294:78940:18:17:59:563:207:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:identical  to  what  would  happen  if  instead  of  extra  money,  the  government  had  issued  extra  safe
28:1295:79049:17:18:59:563:190:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:short-term debt before the Poisson event and paid it back after the Poisson event. In both cases, the
28:1296:79150:18:18:59:563:172:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:government must raise the same amount of extra taxes after the Poisson event to either retire the
28:1297:79247:18:18:59:563:154:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:extra money or pay back the extra debt.  This stimulates the economy before the Poisson event in
28:1298:79343:18:18:59:563:136:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:a safety trap.  To analyze option (b) we must use the modification of the model introduced later in
28:1299:79442:18:19:59:563:118:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:Section4 which allows for capacity over-utilization as well as capacity under-utilization. Compared

28:1301:79656:15:12:59:563:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:dynamics and the economy jumps immediately to the new stochastic steady state before the Poisson event. Otherwise
28:1302:79769:12:9:59:463:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the new stochastic steady state before the Poisson event is only reached gradually over time.
28:1303:79862:9:15:69:563:63:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:22In AppendixA.4, we show that safe public debt issuances can sometimes lead to Pareto improvements, or if not,
28:1304:79973:15:0:59:421:48:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:at least to welfare improvements for certain classes of Utilitarian welfare functions.

29:1306:80159:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:but at the cost of over-stimulating the economy after the Poisson event.  In other words, there is a
29:1307:80259:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:policy tradeoff.  This tradeoff is unavoidable:  It it precisely because it over-stimulates the economy
29:1308:80362:18:18:59:563:702:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:after the bad Poisson event that it further increases the value of safe assets and further stimulates

29:1312:80602:31:18:59:563:590:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Here we use the term QE loosely to encompass policies that swap risky assets for safe assets such

29:1314:80792:18:18:59:563:554:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:follows: The government issues additional safe short term debt and purchases private risky assets
29:1315:80889:18:18:59:563:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(the value of which drops to zero after the bad Poisson event). Letˆβgbe the fraction of the value

29:1321:81162:18:18:59:563:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:does with the proceeds from the debt issuance, but the equilibrium rates of returnrandrKand
29:1322:81253:18:18:59:563:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:capacity utilizationξare identical. In QE, the government uses the proceeds to purchase private
29:1323:81348:18:18:59:563:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:risky assets instead of simply rebating them lump sum to private agents. The revenues from the
29:1324:81442:18:18:59:563:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:taxes ˆτbefore the bad Poisson event can be lowered because the government can now avail itself of
29:1325:81540:18:18:59:563:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:additional investment revenues from its holdings of private risky assets. Ifτ= 0, as would be the
29:1326:81637:18:18:59:563:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:case in a safety trap, then we can get ˆτ <0. This should then be interpreted as a possibility to
29:1327:81734:18:24:59:463:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reduce taxes if there were some other reasons for which taxes had to be raised.
29:1328:81813:24:18:77:563:295:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As long as there is less than full crowding out, the safe asset shortage is alleviated by this policy:

29:1330:82006:18:17:59:563:259:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:risky private assets from private balance sheets, but rather by injecting public assets into private
29:1331:82106:17:18:59:563:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:balance sheets. In other words, QE works by increasing the supply of safe assets. The proceeds of

30:1356:83271:18:18:59:563:647:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:ately from the fact that the securitization capacityρdoes not show up anywhere in the equilibrium
30:1357:83368:18:18:59:563:629:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:equations in liquidity traps. In our model, the effects of safe public debt issuances and QE in safety
30:1358:83470:18:18:59:563:611:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:traps rely entirely on the (assumed) superior ability of the government to address a form of market

30:1360:83643:24:18:77:563:569:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:A:This irrelevance result relies on our assumption (made throughout the paper) that dividends are
30:1361:83738:18:18:59:563:551:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:taxed while the endowment of newborns (wages) is not.  As a result, safe public debt issuances and
30:1362:83836:18:18:59:563:533:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:QE simply reshuffle the fraction of dividends that accrues to private asset holders and the fraction
30:1363:83936:18:17:59:563:515:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:of dividends that is absorbed by taxes to pay interest on debt of various maturities. This assumption
30:1364:84037:17:18:59:563:498:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:renders our framework de facto Ricardian in the unconstrained regime, despite the fact that we have

30:1366:84170:52:35:59:244:428:17:g_d0_f9:17:g_d0_f9:C:4  Forward Guidance
30:1367:84189:35:18:59:563:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Another major policy tool advocated in the context of the ZLB is Forward Guidance (FG): the
30:1368:84280:18:18:59:563:375:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:commitment to low future interest rates once the economy recovers. We show in this section that
30:1369:84375:18:18:59:563:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this policy, which is very effective in liquidity traps, isnotin safety traps. In a nutshell, the reason
30:1370:84479:18:18:59:563:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is that in safety traps the effects of FG are largely dissipated in higher risk premia: The positive
30:1371:84579:18:18:59:563:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:effect of higher future asset values on the current value of risky assets is endogenously offset by an
30:1372:84681:18:18:59:563:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:increase in risky premia, leaving the current value of risky assets, wealth, and aggregate demand
30:1373:84778:18:24:59:117:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:unchanged.
30:1374:84788:24:18:77:563:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We introduce one modification to our model in Section2 (and also drop public debt since it is
30:1375:84881:18:18:59:564:243:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f16:B:not central to our message):Agents now can stretch capacity utilization and produceξt>1units of
30:1376:84976:18:18:59:563:225:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f16:F:output per unit of non traded input.  This comes at a cost as there is a (proportional separable) per
30:1377:85077:18:18:59:563:207:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f4:B:period utility loss from capacity utilization overextension, equal tomax{ξt−1,0}.We introduce
30:1378:85170:18:18:59:563:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this modification to capture the standard effects of FG which is to commit to over-stimulating the
30:1379:85268:18:16:69:563:171:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:24Because the proceedsˆD−Dof the additional safe debt issuance are not rebated to Knightians, there are
30:1380:85371:16:12:59:563:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:transitional dynamics and the new stochastic steady state before the Poisson event is only reached gradually over
30:1381:85484:12:8:59:81:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:time.
30:1382:85489:8:16:69:563:135:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:25Going back to equation (2), we see that in the limitλ+→0andλ−→0, in a safety trap whenrK= 0, public

30:1385:85791:8:16:69:563:99:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:26If we allowed the endowments of newborns to be taxed, then safe public debt issuances and QE could have
30:1386:85896:16:12:59:563:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:some non-Ricardian effects, depending on exactly how these taxes are levied, and hence affect economic activity in
30:1387:86010:12:12:59:563:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a liquidity trap. For example, Kocherlakota (2013) and Caballero et al. (2015) study non-Ricardian environments
30:1388:86121:12:0:59:393:59:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:where issuing safe public debt can stimulate the economy in a liquidity trap.

31:1390:86297:18:24:59:484:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rates, while at the same time preserving all the results that we have derived so far.
31:1391:86382:24:18:77:563:714:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We assume that the cost is large enough so that under flexible prices, we still haveξt= 1 before
31:1392:86478:18:18:59:562:696:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f10:B:and after the Poisson event, with the same natural allocation as that characterized in Section2.27
31:1393:86576:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Importantly, with nominal rigidities where output is demanddetermined, this need not be true,
31:1394:86669:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:depending on the stance of monetary policy. The equilibrium conditions are then identical to those
31:1395:86767:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in Section2, but with the possibility that capacity utilization exceedsone before or after the Poisson
31:1396:86869:18:24:59:440:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:event. All the results derived so far are unchanged in this modified model.
31:1397:86944:24:18:77:563:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In this context, consider the following FG policy: Suppose that the good Poisson event occurs at
31:1398:87040:18:17:59:563:582:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:σ+. After the good Poisson event, the central bank stimulates theeconomy by setting the interest

31:1400:87226:18:18:59:563:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:nominal interest rate equal to the natural interest ratei+=δθ. Agents know throughout that the
31:1401:87320:18:24:59:270:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:central bank is committed to such policy.
31:1402:87361:24:18:77:563:505:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We can now solve the model backwards. We start by characterizing the endogenous path of

31:1405:87640:18:26:59:563:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output is above potential, and equilibrium capacity utilization satisfies a simple differential equation

32:1489:91110:18:18:59:563:259:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:after the good Poisson event.  In contrast to the safety trap case, this also increases the value of
32:1490:91210:18:18:59:563:241:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:assets before the Poisson event while the economy is in the liquidity trap. This wealth effect increases
32:1491:91314:18:18:59:563:223:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:demand and mitigates the recession.  Forward guidance works by alleviating the asset shortage that
32:1492:91412:18:18:59:563:205:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:is at the root of the recession.  It trades off a future boom (output above potential) after the good
32:1493:91513:18:15:59:500:187:12:g_d0_f30:8:g_d0_f10:C:Poisson event against a mitigation of the recession (output below potential) before it.31
32:1494:91602:15:16:69:563:172:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:29There is one caveat to this conclusion. We have assumed that prices are entirely rigid. If prices could adjust
32:1495:91714:16:12:59:563:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:gradually over time in a forward looking manner, then forward guidance could regain some kick: A commitment to
32:1496:91824:12:12:59:563:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:lower interest rates after the good Poisson event could increase inflation while the economy is in a safety trap. This
32:1497:91942:12:12:59:563:132:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:would lower the safe interest raterKand mitigate the recession. Note than when we model inflation in Section5, we
32:1498:92055:12:12:59:563:120:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:assume, motivated by a desire to capture downward wage rigidity, that inflation is determined by a myopic Philipps
32:1499:92169:12:12:59:472:108:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:curve rather than an expectations-augmented Philipps curve, so that this effect does not arise.
32:1500:92264:12:12:69:563:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:A similar comment applies to the unconventional tax policies considered by Correia et al.  (2012), which here
32:1501:92373:12:12:59:563:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:could simply take the form of an increasing path of sales taxes—say through a sales tax holiday—which would create
32:1502:92487:12:8:59:277:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:inflation in consumer prices and hence reducerK.

33:1508:92915:18:18:59:563:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(of increasing safe assets) is enhanced by its positive effect on inflation. Finally, as always, inflation
33:1509:93021:18:45:59:529:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:also opens the door for expectations and targets to alleviate the trap by lowering real rates.

33:1511:93165:31:18:59:563:590:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We assume that prices cannot fall faster than at a certain pace:πt≥ −(κ0+κ1(1−ξt)), with
33:1512:93253:18:18:59:563:572:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:κ1>0   . The more slack there is in the economy, the more prices can fall. We impose that if there
33:1513:93351:18:18:59:563:554:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is slack in the economy, prices fall as fast as they can: I.e.,ξt<1    impliesπt=−(κ0+κ1(1−ξt)).
33:1514:93447:18:33:59:435:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We capture this requirement with the complementary slackness condition

33:1516:93547:33:18:59:563:470:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This is a traditional upward sloping Phillips curve relating inflationπtand capacity utilizationξt.
33:1517:93646:18:17:59:563:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The Phillips curve becomes vertical atξt= 1. Our motivation is to capture downward nominal
33:1518:93736:17:18:59:563:435:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rigidities. This specification of the Phillips curve can be justified by appealing to a “nominal social
33:1519:93839:18:18:59:563:417:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:norm”, which can only be slowly revised downward over time, so that agents would never accept
33:1520:93932:18:18:59:563:399:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:setting prices falling faster than−(κ0+κ1(1−ξt)) per unit of time. Ifκ1= 0 andκ0= 0, this
33:1521:94021:18:18:59:563:381:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:corresponds to complete downward nominal rigidities. Ifκ0= 0 andκ1=∞,this corresponds
33:1522:94106:18:18:59:563:363:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to the case of perfectly flexible prices. This modeling strategy and the results that follow borrows

34:1574:96226:18:18:59:563:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:above, aggregate demand is steeper than aggregate supply and both curves intersect exactly once

34:1576:96419:18:0:59:169:50:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the previous sections.

35:1578:96529:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f4:B:ξ=1). To see this, note that the supply curve becomes vertical atξ= 1 and the demand curve
35:1579:96619:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:has a kink at the value ofπ=  ̃πthat solvesrK,n+π∗+φ(π−π∗) = 0: the demand curve is an

35:1581:96795:18:18:59:563:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:either one or three intersections between the supply and demand curves. We have already seen the
35:1582:96891:18:18:59:563:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bad equilibrium. The other equilibria, which exist if the inflation target is high enoughπ∗≥−rK,n,

35:1584:97011:24:18:77:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:To summarize, when−κ0+rK,n<0   , there is always a safety trap equilibrium withξ <1 and

35:1586:97189:18:17:59:563:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:then there are also two other equilibria withξ= 1 with two different nominal interest rates (i= 0

35:1588:97369:18:18:59:563:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:latter is locally determinate. In other words, the increase in the inflation target needs to be large
35:1589:97470:18:18:59:563:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:enough to even have a chance to work. Note however that even when there is a “good” equilibrium
35:1590:97565:18:18:59:563:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:withξ= 1 andi=rK,n+π∗>0   , the “bad” equilibrium withξ <1 andi= 0 still exists because

35:1594:97944:18:18:59:563:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:among these equilibria: The best a high inflation target can achieve is the possibility of a good
35:1595:98041:18:18:59:563:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrium, not the elimination of the possibility of the bad equilibrium.33,34Figure4 provides a
35:1596:98139:18:18:59:563:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:graphical illustration. In the figure, equilibrium inflation in the safety trap equilibrium is negative
35:1597:98242:18:24:59:212:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:but this need not be the case.
35:1598:98272:24:18:77:563:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We can connect this discussion with the Keynesian cross equilibrium representation developed
35:1599:98364:18:18:59:563:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in Section2, which can still be used withrK=i−πonce inflationπhas been solved out. Given
35:1600:98452:18:17:59:563:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:nominal interest ratesi, higher inflation helps to reduce safe interest rates, causing an upward shift
35:1601:98554:17:18:59:563:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in aggregate demand and resulting in a increase in output. WhenrK,n<0andπ∗>−rK,nin

37:1688:102482:24:17:77:563:530:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Just as in Section4, the solution featuresξ+t>1andπt≥π∗forσ+≤t< σ++T.The
37:1689:102554:17:18:59:563:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rest of the analysis is identical and the conclusion is identical. Forward guidance stimulates the
37:1690:102652:18:18:59:563:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economy after the good Poisson event, resulting in a boom and inflation above target. But this fails
37:1691:102752:18:32:59:482:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to stimulate the economy before the Poisson when the economy is in a safety trap.
37:1692:102833:32:18:59:563:445:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f30:F:Remark 6We could also introduce inflation in the unconstrained regime and liquidity traps. Just
37:1693:102928:18:18:59:563:427:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:like in the constrained regime,  when the natural safe interest rate is negativerK,n<0,there is
37:1694:103023:18:18:59:563:409:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:always a bad liquidity trap equilibrium with a recessionξ <1and deflationπ <0.  If the inflation
37:1695:103119:18:18:59:563:391:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:target ̄πis high enough, there is also a good equilibrium with no recessionξ= 1and inflation at
37:1696:103214:18:18:59:564:373:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:targetπ=  ̄π.  Introducing inflation does not change the results that safe public debt and QE are
37:1697:103311:18:18:59:563:355:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:F:ineffective in liquidity traps. Forward guidance gains an extra kick by increasing inflation, reducing
37:1698:103413:18:50:59:419:337:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:C:real interest rates, further stimulating output and inflation, and so on.
37:1699:103486:50:36:59:319:287:17:g_d0_f9:17:g_d0_f9:C:6  Extensions and Robustness
37:1700:103514:36:18:59:563:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In the appendix we present two extensions, which we briefly summarize here: an analysis of the
37:1701:103608:18:18:59:563:233:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:role of bubbles (AppendixA.5  ) and an endogenization of the securitization process to demonstrate
37:1702:103706:18:18:59:575:215:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the presence of a securitization externality (AppendixA.6  ). We also comment on the robustness of
37:1703:103804:18:24:59:116:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:our results.
37:1704:103816:24:18:77:563:173:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Bubbles and fiscal capacity.The very low interest rates that characterize a safety trap
37:1705:103903:18:18:59:563:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:raises the issue of whether speculative bubbles may emerge, and whether these can play a useful
37:1706:103998:18:18:59:576:137:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:role through their wealth effect. We show in AppendixA.5   that bubbles can indeed arise in safety
37:1707:104096:18:17:59:563:119:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:traps, but that only the emergence of safe bubbles (as opposed to risky bubbles) can stimulate
37:1708:104190:17:18:59:563:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economic activity. This is because only safe bubbles alleviate the shortage of safe assets while risky
37:1709:104292:18:18:59:563:84:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bubbles end up simply crowding out other risky assets. The fact that risky bubbles have no effect on
37:1710:104392:18:18:59:563:66:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:output in a safety trap formalizes some observations in Summers (2013) that in secular stagnation
37:1711:104489:18:0:59:563:48:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:environments, even large financial bubbles only seem to create moderate economic expansions. It
38:1712:104586:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stands in contrast to standard liquidity trap environments, where both safe and risky bubbles
38:1713:104679:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stimulate output. This is because in standard liquidity trap environments, both increase total asset
38:1714:104779:18:24:59:337:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:supply and alleviate the underlying shortage of assets.
38:1715:104834:24:18:77:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We associate safe bubbles to (some) safe public debt: The existence of a bubbly-region where
38:1716:104926:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the safe real interest rate is permanently below the growth rate of the economy is equivalent to an
38:1717:105025:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:expansion of the fiscal capacity of the government who can issue some amount of safe debt without
38:1718:105122:18:24:59:193:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ever having to raise taxes.
38:1719:105149:24:18:77:575:618:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Securitization externality.In AppendixA.6   we endogenize the securitization capacity of the
38:1720:105241:18:18:59:563:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economy. We assume that by investing resourcesjtXdt,a Neutral agent can increaseρ(jt) and,
38:1721:105331:18:17:59:562:582:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with it, increase the supply of safe assets (i.e., the share of the tree’s revenue in the bad state of
38:1722:105433:17:24:59:237:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the world that is pledgable today).
38:1723:105468:24:18:77:563:541:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We show in this extension that outside of a safety trap, the competitive equilibrium is constrained
38:1724:105567:18:18:59:563:523:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Pareto efficient, but that in a safety trap, it is constrained inefficient (there is underprovision of safe
38:1725:105674:18:18:59:563:505:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets). We trace back this inefficiency to asecuritization externality. In a safety trap, private agents
38:1726:105779:18:18:59:563:487:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:do not internalize the full social benefit of creating safe assets. More specifically, they do not take
38:1727:105882:18:18:59:563:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:into account the stimulative effects of these assets. This market failure builds a case for government
38:1728:105984:18:18:59:563:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:intervention in securitization markets. The government could use taxes or quantity restrictions to
38:1729:106082:18:18:59:563:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:encourage securitization, force financial institutions to raise more fresh capital than they would
38:1730:106180:18:18:59:563:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:do otherwise or directly recapitalize them to boost their securitization capacity, or simply directly
38:1731:106281:18:18:59:563:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:engage in securitization through QE. This argument is distinct from the comparative advantage of
38:1732:106377:18:24:59:407:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the government in safe asset creation that we analyzed in Section3.
38:1733:106444:24:18:77:563:355:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Robustness.Our model is stylized, which allows us to isolate and illustrate the key mecha-
38:1734:106534:18:17:59:563:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:nisms, and to bring out most clearly the differences between safety traps and liquidity traps. Of
38:1735:106631:17:18:59:563:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:course, its stark assumptions are likely to hold in a milder form in practice, and it is important to
38:1736:106732:18:24:59:377:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:understand how our results would be altered in such contexts.
38:1737:106793:24:18:77:563:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The fundamental features of our model, which drive our results, are the following: (i) nominal
38:1738:106887:18:18:59:563:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rigidities and a ZLB; (ii) macroeconomic uncertainty and risk aversion; (iii) heterogeneity in risk
38:1739:106986:18:18:59:563:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:aversion with risk tolerant and risk averse agents; (iv) financial frictions hampering securitization.
38:1740:107088:18:18:59:563:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Features (i) and (ii) are standard, although they are rarely combined in standard liquidity trap
38:1741:107184:18:18:59:563:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:analyses which rely on perfect foresight or log-linearizations. Feature (iii) gives rise to risk sharing
38:1742:107288:18:18:59:563:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:through asset markets, and in particular through the issuance of zero-net-supply safe assets from
38:1743:107385:18:18:59:563:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:risk tolerant agents to risk averse agents (one could imagine either the issuance of entirely safe
38:1744:107483:18:18:59:563:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets as in our model and also as in Barro and Mollerus 2014, or simply of safer assets than the
38:1745:107580:18:18:59:563:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:positive-net-supply Lucas trees). Feature (iv) hampers this securitization process by limiting the
38:1746:107678:18:24:59:327:116:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:collateral that can be used to back these safe assets.
38:1747:107732:24:17:77:563:92:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We model macroeconomic uncertainty in feature (ii) as a macroeconomic Poisson event, and we
38:1748:107823:17:18:59:563:75:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assume that all uncertainty is resolved at once after this Poisson event. The safety trap then only
38:1749:107922:18:0:59:563:57:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:arises before the Poisson event, precisely because a bad Poisson event might occur in the future.
39:1750:108021:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:At the cost of analytical tractability, one could allow for more general stochastic processes, and
39:1751:108119:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:relax the assumption that uncertainty is resolved all at once with the realization of the event. For
39:1752:108219:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:example, if another Poisson event could occur after the first Poisson event, then the economy could
39:1753:108318:18:18:59:563:702:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:end up in a safety trap not only before the first realization of the Poisson event, but also after the
39:1754:108420:18:18:59:563:684:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:realization of the first bad Poisson event, because another future bad Poisson event might occur.
39:1755:108517:18:18:59:563:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The resulting compounding of macroeconomic uncertainty would further reduce safe asset supply,
39:1756:108611:18:18:59:563:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and trigger an even bigger recession before the first Poisson event. Output after the first bad Poisson
39:1757:108714:18:18:59:563:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:event would also be lower, not only because of the exogenous impact of the first bad Poisson event,
39:1758:108813:18:24:59:288:612:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:but also because of an endogenous recession.
39:1759:108857:24:17:77:563:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In our model, features (iii) and (iv) take an extreme form: agents are either risk neutral or
39:1760:108950:17:18:59:563:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:infinitely risk averse; and there is a hard securitization constraint. In addition, we have assumed
39:1761:109049:18:18:59:563:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that agents do not substitute consumption intertemporally. These extreme assumptions make the
39:1762:109142:18:18:59:563:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:model tractable and transparent, and allow us to derive our results in closed form. Milder versions
39:1763:109241:18:18:59:563:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of these features would lead to milder forms of our main results: recessions at the ZLB associated
39:1764:109339:18:18:59:563:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with increases in risk premia generated by shortages of safe assets; stimulative effects of safe debt
39:1765:109440:18:18:59:563:481:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:issuances and QE; reduced effectiveness of FG. For example, and focusing on FG, with finite dif-
39:1766:109536:18:18:59:563:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ferences in risk aversion, FG would increase the attractiveness of risky assets and hence reduce the
39:1767:109636:18:18:59:563:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:demand of safe assets by risk averse agents, thereby stimulating the economy, the more so, the
39:1768:109730:18:18:59:563:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:lower the risk aversion of risk averse agents, and the higher the intertemporal elasticity of substi-
39:1769:109831:18:18:59:575:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tution. Likewise, with an active investment margin to relax financial frictions as in AppendixA.6  ,
39:1770:109931:18:18:59:563:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:FG would increase the incentives of risk tolerant agents to invest in securitization and issue safe
39:1771:110030:18:18:59:563:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assets to capture risk premia, increase the supply of safe assets, and hence stimulate the economy,
39:1772:110129:18:18:59:563:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the more so, the higher the elasticity of securitization capacity to investment or, equivalently, the
39:1773:110230:18:17:59:563:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:responsiveness of the supply of safe assets to risk premia. Similar observations apply to safe debt
39:1774:110329:17:18:59:563:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:issuances and QE. In particular, it is no longer key that public debt be absolutely safe in order to
39:1775:110429:18:18:59:563:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stimulate output: It is enough that it be safer (lower beta) than the private risky assets that are
39:1776:110528:18:51:59:345:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:being purchased with the proceeds of the debt issuance.
39:1777:110583:51:36:59:212:233:17:g_d0_f9:17:g_d0_f9:C:7  Final Remarks
39:1778:110599:36:18:59:563:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this paper we provide a model that captures some of the most salient macroeconomic consequences
39:1779:110697:18:18:59:563:179:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and policy implications of a safety trap. The model is deliberately highly stylized, which allows us
39:1780:110797:18:18:59:563:161:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to isolate the specific role of safe asset shortages at the ZLB. Safety traps correspond to liquidity
39:1781:110898:18:18:59:563:143:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:traps in which the emergence of an endogenous risk premium significantly alters the connection
39:1782:110992:18:23:59:378:125:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:between macroeconomic policy, wealth, and economic activity.
39:1783:111052:23:18:77:563:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In a nutshell, in a situation of safety trap, private agents (and some sovereigns) want to substitute
39:1784:111153:18:18:59:563:84:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:some of their risky holdings for safer ones. In the absence of mechanisms to lower safe interest rates
39:1785:111255:18:18:59:563:66:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to restore equilibrium, the most powerful policies are those that help the private sector implement
39:1786:111354:18:0:59:563:48:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this swap. As we mentioned in the main text, the early QE policies implemented by the FED during
40:1787:111452:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the subprime crises did just that, and there is extensive evidence of their effectiveness. Another
40:1788:111550:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:successful example is the OMT (outright monetary transactions) program established by the ECB
40:1789:111643:18:18:59:563:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in late 2012, which had an immediate impact on the Eurozone risk perception, or the more recent
40:1790:111738:18:24:59:367:702:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(April 2016) move of the ECB to purchase corporate bonds.
40:1791:111795:24:18:77:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:However, over time and partly as a result of lack of political support, asset purchase policies
40:1792:111890:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:have turned mostly into swaps of one form of safe asset for another, which is not nearly as effective
40:1793:111991:18:18:59:563:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in a safety trap context. In fact, in a previous version of this paper (Caballero and Farhi 2013), we
40:1794:112092:18:18:59:563:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:argued that Operation Twist (OT) type polices, where the FED purchases long maturity Treasuries
40:1795:112187:18:18:59:563:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and sells short maturity ones, could be counterproductive. The reason is that long-term public debt,
40:1796:112287:18:17:59:563:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:while risky, is anegative-betaasset. OT type policies boil down to swapping negative-beta assets
40:1797:112383:17:18:59:563:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for zero-beta assets, which reduces the effective supply of safe assets. By contrast, the right form of
40:1798:112486:18:18:59:563:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:QE policies entails swapping positive-beta assets for zero-beta assets, which increases the effective
40:1799:112587:18:24:59:166:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:supply of safe assets.
40:1800:112609:24:18:77:563:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Similarly, forward guidance policies are largely ineffective and can be seen as a mostly failed
40:1801:112704:18:18:59:563:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:attempts at stimulating the economy by attempting to increase the value of risky assets, which are
40:1802:112802:18:24:59:358:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:essentially dissipated in offsetting increases in risk premia.
40:1803:112864:24:18:77:563:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Sufficient increases in the inflation target, by reducing safe real interest rates, are effective at
40:1804:112964:18:18:59:563:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stimulating output. The same goes for imposing negative interest ratesrK<0   , to the extent that
40:1805:113061:18:18:59:563:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:it is possible. Recently, some countries have experimented with modest levels of negative interest
40:1806:113159:18:18:59:563:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rates. At this stage, it is unclear exactly how far below zero interest rates can go. Of course safety
40:1807:113261:18:18:59:563:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:traps can emerge even if the lower bound is not exactly at zero, as long as there is some finite lower
40:1808:113363:18:24:59:94:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bound.
40:1809:113369:24:17:77:579:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Given the faster growth of safe-asset-consumer economies than that of safe-asset-producer economies
40:1810:113468:17:18:59:563:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:as well as the aging of wealth-rich economies, absent major financial innovations, the shortage of
40:1811:113566:18:18:59:563:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:safe assets is only likely to worsen over time, perhaps as a latent factor during booms but reemerging
40:1812:113668:18:18:59:563:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in full force during contractions. It is our conjecture that the shortage of safe assets will remain as
40:1813:113771:18:18:59:563:266:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a structural drag, lowering safe rates, increasing safety spreads, straining the financial system, and
40:1814:113873:18:0:59:472:248:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:weakening the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy during contractions.

54:2530:136656:26:18:59:562:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:There are three main differences with the case where prices are flexible. The first difference is that

54:2532:136858:18:18:59:563:225:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on no Poisson event, the value of risky assets can change over time, leading to an extra source of
54:2533:136956:18:24:59:413:207:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:capital gains ̇VRt. The third difference is that inflation is zeroπt= 0.
54:2534:137028:24:18:77:563:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The cashless limitε→0 yields the same model as the model with rigid prices analyzed in the

54:2536:137215:18:40:59:178:147:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from the cashless limit.

54:2538:137282:32:18:59:563:75:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We consider the model with taxes and government debt of Section3 but unlike in the main text,
54:2539:137375:18:0:59:563:57:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we consider what happens away from the cashless limit. We assume that prices are rigid and that
55:2540:137472:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we are in the constrained regime. We focus on stochastic steady states before the realization of the
55:2541:137572:18:18:59:563:738:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Poisson event and dropt-subscripts. We incorporate the modification of the model introduced in
55:2542:137666:18:24:59:510:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Section4 which allows for capacity over-utilization as well as capacity under-utilization.
55:2543:137756:24:18:77:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The question is what happens when the government issues extra money before the Poisson event
55:2544:137848:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:when the economy is in a safety trap. There are two options which differ in what the government
55:2545:137943:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:does once the economy is no longer at the ZLB after the Poisson event: (a) retire the extra money
55:2546:138040:18:24:59:269:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and keep; (b) not retire the extra money.
55:2547:138081:24:18:77:563:618:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:A:Option (a): retire the extra money after the Poisson event.This option is identical
55:2548:138164:18:18:59:563:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to what would happen if instead of extra money, the government had issued extra safe short-term
55:2549:138259:18:17:59:563:582:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:debt before the Poisson event and paid it back after the Poisson event. For simplicity, we assume
55:2550:138356:17:18:59:563:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:throughout that we are in the non-Ricardian region where government debt does not crowd out
55:2551:138447:18:24:59:154:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:private safe assets.
55:2552:138467:24:18:77:563:523:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Let us start backwards. In order to buy back the money stock after the bad Poisson event, the

56:2620:140740:18:18:59:563:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:further increases wealth, etc. This feedback loop settles at a new fixed point with higher output

56:2622:140895:24:18:77:563:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Given that it stimulates output after the Poisson event, option (b) increases the cash flows hat

57:2703:143459:9:15:69:563:327:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:36There are transitional dynamics before the Poisson event when forward guidance is announced, which we do
57:2704:143565:15:12:59:563:312:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:not report in the interest of space.  After the (future) policy announcement, the economy first goes through a
57:2705:143675:12:12:59:563:300:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:phase where it is in the unconstrained regime for a while because because Knightian wealth only increases gradually
57:2706:143790:12:12:59:563:288:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:over time while the value of safe assets jumps up immediately. But conditional on no Poisson event occuring, the
57:2707:143902:12:12:59:563:276:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:economy eventually re-enters the constrained regime as Knightian wealth increases. All variables converge to their
57:2708:144016:12:9:59:298:264:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:new stochastic steady state values gradually over time.
57:2709:144071:9:15:69:563:255:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:37Note we could just as well have used the model with public debt. The central banker’s put works by increasing
57:2710:144182:15:8:59:344:240:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:both the public and private sectors’ ability to provide safe assets.
57:2711:144250:8:16:69:563:232:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f7:F:38Perhaps a more realistic policy option would be a commitment by the authorities to buy up safe assets at an
57:2712:144359:16:13:59:563:216:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:inflated price after the Poisson events—a form of government (central bank?) put. A commitment to buy up safe
57:2713:144468:13:12:59:562:203:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f37:F:private assets at an inflated valueω−ρμ−Xθ> ρμ−Xθwould mitigate the recession and increase the value ofξtoˆξ
57:2714:144576:12:9:59:84:191:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:where

57:2716:144592:21:12:59:563:161:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:It could be carried out by monetary authorities but it does require spare fiscal capacity (in the form of taxes or
57:2717:144706:12:12:59:563:149:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:seigniorage).  This kind of public insurance policy can potentially play a crucial role in a safety trap.  See, e.g.,
57:2718:144823:12:12:59:563:137:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Caballero and Kurlat (2010) for a proposal to increase the resilience of the financial system in a shortage of safe

63:3046:157783:31:18:59:563:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:A natural interpretation of safe bubbles is that they are a form of government debt. To develop this

65:3159:160132:24:18:77:563:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We show in this extension that outside of a safety trap, the competitive equilibrium is constrained

65:3188:161594:18:18:59:563:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:there is a new equation (the last one) which is simply the first order condition for securitization.
65:3189:161694:18:18:59:563:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This condition is intuitive: a Neutral managing a tree equates the marginal cost of increasing

65:3194:161957:24:18:77:563:66:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Apart from that, the analysis of the equilibrium is almost identical to that of the baseline model.
65:3195:162056:18:0:59:563:48:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In particular, and focusing on steady states, there is an unconstrained regime withr=rKand a
66:3196:162150:0:18:59:563:756:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:constrained regime withr > rK. If prices are rigid, we can enter a safety trap whererK,n<0   ,

66:3198:162328:18:24:59:367:720:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:investment. The details are omitted in the interest of space.
66:3199:162389:24:18:77:563:696:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now investigate the efficiency properties of the competitive equilibrium.  To do so, it is
66:3200:162482:18:18:59:563:678:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:convenient to introduce lump sum taxes that allow arbitrary redistribution within Knightians and
66:3201:162578:18:18:59:563:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:within Neutrals but not across these two groups. Because they only redistribute within groups,
66:3202:162672:18:24:59:396:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:these taxes do not change the characterization of the equilibrium.
66:3203:162738:24:18:77:563:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Consider the steady state of the competitive equilibrium with Neutral wealthWN, Knightian

66:3205:162913:18:17:59:563:582:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:throughout. We analyze first the case where prices are flexible. We then analyze the case with
66:3206:163007:17:18:59:563:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rigid prices. In the first case, output is always at capacity. The corresponding planning problem is
66:3207:163107:18:18:59:563:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:easier to analyze. Moreover, as long as the natural safe real interest rate is positive, this flexible
66:3208:163209:18:18:59:563:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prices planning problem is a constrained version of the rigid prices planning problem, but the
66:3209:163303:18:18:59:563:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:corresponding constraints are satisfied at the optimum of the latter, so that their solutions coincide.
66:3210:163406:18:24:59:455:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This is no longer the case when the natural safe real interest rate is negative.
66:3211:163486:24:18:77:563:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We are interested in whether it is possible to generate a Pareto improvement by controlling

66:3214:163772:18:15:59:563:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:With the lump sum taxes mentioned above, this happens if and only if we can find processesˆWKt,
