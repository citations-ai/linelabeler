2:25:1124:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:26:1132:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Incentive schemes that reward participants based on their relative performance are often thought 
2:27:1229:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:to be  particularly  risk-inducing.  Using  a  novel,  real-effort  task  experiment  in  the  laboratory,  we 
2:28:1339:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:find  that the  relationship  between  incentives  and  risk-taking  is  more  nuanced  and  depends 
2:29:1439:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:critically on the availability of information about peers’ strategies and outcomes. Indeed, we find 
2:30:1538:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:that  when  no  peer  information is  available,  relative  rewards  schemes  are  associated  with 
2:31:1637:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:significantly  less  risk-taking  than  non-competitive rewards.  In  contrast,  when  decision-makers 
2:32:1739:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:receive  information  about  their  peers’  actions  and/or  outcomes, relative  incentive  schemes  are 
2:33:1843:14:14:72:542:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:associated  with  more  risk-taking  than  non-competitive  schemes.  The nature  of  the  feedback—
2:34:1942:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:whether  subjects  receive  information  about  peers’  strategies,  outcomes,  or both—also  affects 
2:35:2043:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:risk-taking.  We  find  no  evidence  that  competitors  imitate  their  peers  when  they face  only 
2:36:2144:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:feedback  about  other  subjects’  risk-taking  strategies.  However,  decision-makers  take  more risk 
2:37:2247:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:C:when they see the gaps between their performance score and their peers’ scores grow. Combined 
2:38:2340:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:feedback  about  peers’  strategies  and  performance—from  which  subjects  may  assess  the  overall 
2:39:2443:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:C:relationship between risk-taking and success—is associated with more risk-taking when rewards 
2:40:2536:14:44:72:501:392:12:Times:12:Times:C:are based on relative performance; we find no similar effect for non-competitive rewards.

3:61:3017:30:18:75:528:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Compensation systems may affect not just the effort exerted by workers, but also the
3:62:3101:18:18:75:528:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:riskiness of their actions. For example, pay schedules that rewardsalespeople for closing
3:63:3190:18:18:75:528:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important transactions may also induce workers to over-extend the firms’ promises to
3:64:3274:18:18:75:528:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:buyers.  Particularly salient examples of workers’ excessive risk-taking come from the
3:65:3360:18:18:75:528:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recent banking and credit crisis. In aWall Street Journalop-ed in 2009, Alan Blinder
3:66:3444:18:18:74:528:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cited “...the perverse incentives built into the compensation plans of many financial firms”
3:67:3536:18:18:74:528:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the fundamental cause of the extreme risk-taking observed prior to the crisis. Decision-
3:68:3627:18:18:74:528:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:makers within the industry seem to agree. In a survey of over 500 senior managers in
3:69:3711:18:18:74:528:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial services firms, 52% of respondents indicated that they believed that “incentives
3:70:3801:18:18:74:528:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and remuneration” were the most significant contributors to the crisis in their industry
3:71:3889:18:17:74:155:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(KPMG,2009).
3:72:3901:17:18:94:528:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although commentators hold the incentives primarily responsible,  the rewards
3:73:3978:18:18:75:528:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schemes were not imposed in a vacuum.  Indeed, it may be the interplay between in-
3:74:4060:18:18:75:528:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centives and other features of the environment that led to the increased risk-taking. More
3:75:4150:18:18:75:528:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specifically, individuals’ decisions to adopt riskier strategies may be influenced by social
3:76:4242:18:18:75:528:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and informational factors, such as their relative and absolute performances to date, the
3:77:4330:18:18:75:528:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:norms around risk-taking within their organizations and industry, and the information
3:78:4415:18:18:75:528:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available to them before and during the competition.  Recently, there has been an in-
3:79:4500:18:18:75:527:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:creasing focus on the impact of social influences on economic decisions.1While the extant
3:80:4589:18:18:75:528:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature on risk-taking has explored the role of incentives and, separately, the role of
3:81:4679:18:18:75:528:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:feedback about own and peer performance histories, the interaction of the two has been
3:82:4765:18:18:75:210:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previously largely ignored.
3:83:4792:18:18:94:528:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we consider the interaction between incentives and information about
3:84:4875:18:17:74:528:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peers and ask: First, how does the presence and nature of feedback about peers affect risk-
3:85:4966:17:18:74:528:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking? Or, more precisely, how is an individual’s risk-taking influencedby the availability
3:86:5058:18:18:74:528:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of information about the performance and/or risk-related strategies of his or her peers?
3:87:5146:18:18:74:528:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, how does the relationship between this information and risk-taking change when
3:88:5232:18:18:74:472:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals are rewarded based on their relative versus absolute performance?
3:89:5309:18:18:94:528:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use an incentivized real-effort task in a controlled laboratory environment to
3:90:5390:18:18:74:528:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:answer these questions. Field data on individuals’ incentives, risk-taking strategies, and
3:91:5480:18:18:74:528:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peer information are largely unavailable and, even if available, they would be difficult to
3:92:5571:18:15:88:528:122:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:1Although psychologists have a long history of research on social influence, only recently has economic
3:93:5674:15:12:74:528:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:theory modeled social influence as it relates to risk. For example,Maccheroni, Marinacci and Rustichini
3:94:5777:12:12:75:528:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(2012) present an axiomatic foundation for interdependent preferences that supports the claim that the
3:95:5879:12:0:75:450:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:observation of peers’ outcomes can be useful in learning to improve one’s own choices.
4:96:5966:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyze due to inherent endogeneity issues. The laboratory allows us to use the random
4:97:6052:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assignment of subjects to treatments to infer causal relationships between information,
4:98:6139:18:18:75:209:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives and risk-taking.
4:99:6166:18:18:94:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The experimental environment is novel. It is is motivated with a hypothetical, framed
4:100:6251:18:18:74:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scenario that asks subjects to imagine themselves as financial analysts making simple
4:101:6336:18:18:74:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predictions about future stock performance. Analysts can gather information prior to an-
4:102:6424:18:18:74:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nouncing their predictions, but that research is costly and limits theresources available for
4:103:6517:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future forecasts. The experimental task asks subjects to decide first how much informa-
4:104:6604:18:18:74:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion to gather before submitting a binary prediction. The amount ofinformation revealed
4:105:6691:18:18:74:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determines the subject’s level of risk-taking. The analyst faces atrade-off between the
4:106:6778:18:18:74:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volume of forecasts that he or she can complete and their accuracy. Depending on treat-
4:107:6865:18:18:74:527:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment, the analyst is compensated according to an absolute or relative performance-based
4:108:6952:18:18:74:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pay scheme and receives information about the risk-taking strategies and/or forecasting
4:109:7039:18:17:74:188:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes of her peers.
4:110:7061:17:18:94:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, our results suggest that the relationship between incentives and risk-taking
4:111:7146:18:18:74:529:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depends critically on the features of the environment, including theavailability of infor-
4:112:7236:18:18:74:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mation about peers’ strategies and outcomes.2More specifically, when no information is
4:113:7322:18:18:75:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available, relative rewards schemes are associated with significantlyless risk-taking than
4:114:7412:18:18:75:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-competitive rewards. The presence of feedback reverses this relationship: when com-
4:115:7499:18:18:75:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:petitors receive information about their peers’ actions and performance, relative incentive
4:116:7590:18:18:75:466:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schemes are associated with more risk-taking than non-competitive schemes.
4:117:7664:18:18:94:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The nature of the feedback also matters. In a non-competitive rewards setting, sub-
4:118:7747:18:18:75:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jects engage in less risk-taking when exposed to simple information about either peers’
4:119:7834:18:18:75:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategies or outcomes. In a setting with competitive rewards, subjects engage in more
4:120:7920:18:18:75:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking when they receive information about both the strategies and scores of their
4:121:8007:18:18:75:528:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peers. We also find that, when the information is available, subjects’ risk taking is sen-
4:122:8097:18:17:75:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sitive to their relative position among their peers when rewards are based on relative
4:123:8183:17:18:75:528:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:performance; we find no similar sensitivity in settings with non-competitive rewards. Al-
4:124:8272:18:18:75:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:though previous studies have documented a preference for conformity in settings with
4:125:8356:18:18:75:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk (Goeree and Yariv,2007), we find no evidence that subjects’ strategies converge over
4:126:8445:18:18:75:417:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time within a group or that players’ imitate their peers’ strategies.
4:127:8514:18:18:94:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper contributes to two streams of the literature on incentives. The first aims
4:128:8598:18:18:74:528:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to understand the impact of specific compensation systems on risk-taking, and the second
4:129:8686:18:18:74:528:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explores the impact of feedback on performance.  We find that decision-makers’ risk-
4:130:8770:18:15:88:529:98:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:2We frame the results as decision makers’ responses to observing (or not) the strategies and outcomes of
4:131:8874:15:12:75:528:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:other competitors. Anticipation of being observed by others may also influence individuals’ risk attitudes

5:133:9010:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking is influenced by both of these features—risk-taking depends critically on both the
5:134:9099:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compensation style and the availability of information about own and peer performances.
5:135:9186:18:18:94:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Broadly, our paper contributes to managers’ understanding of compensation and per-
5:136:9268:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formance feedback—both important dimensions of organizationaldesign—to align work-
5:137:9350:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ers’ and firms’ objectives. The implication of our results varies by context. For example,
5:138:9440:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in settings in which risk-taking stimulates creativity and innovation, firms may wish to
5:139:9528:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pair highly competitive rewards schemes with rich feedback about peers’ strategies and
5:140:9614:18:18:75:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes. In settings in which risk-taking undermines the stability of a firm or industry,
5:141:9704:18:18:75:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms using relative compensation schemes may wish to restrict information about peers’
5:142:9791:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:actions and outcomes. If peer information is readily available or not feasibly hidden from
5:143:9881:18:18:75:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers, then firms may wish to rely on non-competitive rewards todiscourage undesir-
5:144:9966:18:18:75:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:able risk-taking. Although a firm’s success likely relies on both the effort and risk-taking
5:145:10058:18:18:75:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of its workers (among other factors), our research suggests anuanced relationship between
5:146:10147:18:17:75:366:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives and risk-taking that should not be overlooked.
5:147:10204:17:18:94:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The paper is organized as follows: Section2highlights the current paper’s position
5:148:10286:18:18:75:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the literature on risk-taking, information, and incentives; Section3describes our novel
5:149:10376:18:18:75:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experimental design; Section4provides a theoretical perspective on the experimental
5:150:10459:18:18:75:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:task and describes specific empirical predictions; Section5summarizes and interprets
5:151:10543:18:18:75:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the results of the experiment; and Section6concludes with a discussion of the paper’s
5:152:10628:18:18:75:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implications for understanding the relationship between risk-takingand information in
5:153:10713:18:45:75:290:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive and non-competitive settings.
5:154:10754:45:30:75:255:304:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:2  Related literature
5:155:10775:30:18:75:528:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Although much of the theoretical literature comparing competitiveand non-competitive
5:156:10859:18:18:75:528:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compensation schemes, including the foundational work ofLazear and Rosen(1981), has
5:157:10942:18:18:75:528:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focused on differences in the incentives for effort, researchers have also modeled the in-
5:158:11032:18:18:75:529:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centives for risk-taking under different types of pay schemes. Itis generally believed that
5:159:11123:18:18:75:528:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tournament-style rewards induce more risk-taking than comparable non-competitive, piece
5:160:11210:18:18:75:529:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate rewards. For example, competitors in winner-take-all tournaments are predicted to
5:161:11296:18:17:75:528:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choose maximal risk and zero effort, regardless of the prize spread (Hvide,2002). Simi-
5:162:11383:17:18:75:529:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larly, in multi-prize settings, more risk-taking is expected when prizes are awarded to a
5:163:11472:18:18:75:422:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower proportion of participants (Gaba, Tsetlin and Winkler,2004).
5:164:11538:18:18:94:528:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Ability or interim position in the tournament (if it is revealed) may also affect risk-
5:165:11625:18:18:75:528:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking. The common wisdom is that leaders tend to “play it safe” to preserve their position
5:166:11716:18:0:75:528:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while followers take more risk trying to catch up.Knoeber and Thurman(1994)’s analysis
6:167:11803:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of chicken producers shows that less able competitors adopt higher variance strategies, and
6:168:11894:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Brown, Harlow and Starks(1996) find that mutual fund managers increase the riskiness of
6:169:11981:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their portfolios when their mid-year performance is below the industry average. The same
6:170:12069:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regularities are observed in a laboratory experiment byEriksen and Kvaløy(2014). In
6:171:12152:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an asset trading experiment,Schoenberg and Haruvy(2012) observe larger bubbles when
6:172:12235:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects receive feedback about the performance of the top trader in their group. Relat-

6:174:12411:18:18:75:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2014) find that when information on subjects’ relative positions is available leaders ad-
6:175:12501:18:18:75:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:just their portfolios in the direction of negatively skewed assets, while followers prefer
6:176:12591:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positively skewed assets. The result holds for both competitive andnon-competitive in-
6:177:12677:18:18:75:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centives, which suggests that “playing it safe” and “catching up” are driven mainly by
6:178:12763:18:18:75:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:social rather than monetary incentives. However, the relationship between ability (or rel-
6:179:12853:18:18:75:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ative position) and risk-taking is not always negative.Taylor(2003) finds, in contrast to
6:180:12942:18:17:75:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the standard theory, that leading mutual fund managers take more risk in their portfolio
6:181:13030:17:18:75:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choices in the presence of interim reviews, whereas trailing managers take less risk. More

6:187:13483:18:18:75:528:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schemes focuses primarily on differences in effort.3More recently, a number of experi-
6:188:13569:18:18:75:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ments test the theoretical predictions about risk-taking in tournaments.Nieken(2010)
6:189:13653:18:18:74:527:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finds that, as predicted, subjects choose lower efforts when more noise is present in the
6:190:13742:18:18:74:529:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tournament; however, contrary to the predictions, subjects fail to select the highest level of
6:191:13836:18:18:74:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk.James and Isaac(2000) andRobin, Str ́aˇznick ́a and Villeval(2012) observe a more

6:193:14005:18:17:75:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives.Vandegrift and Brown(2003) explore the role of ability differences and task
6:194:14091:17:18:75:528:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difficulty in risk-taking with tournament incentives and find that low-ability subjects are
6:195:14182:18:18:75:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to choose high-risk strategies, but only in a simpler task.Nieken and Sliwka
6:196:14270:18:18:75:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2010) find that the relationship between ability and risk-taking may be more complex in
6:197:14358:18:18:75:246:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the presence of correlated shocks.
6:198:14392:18:18:94:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It has been long understood that information about competitors’own and peer per-
6:199:14472:18:16:88:529:134:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3In their groundbreaking paper,Bull, Schotter and Weigelt(1987) note that rank-order tournaments
6:200:14568:16:12:75:528:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:are associated with increased variance in subjects’ effort choices, which provides indirect evidence for dif-
6:201:14677:12:11:75:528:106:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ferences in risk-taking. Subsequent studies replicate these results. For a recent survey of the experimental
6:202:14785:11:0:75:407:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:literature on tournaments, seeDechenaux, Kovenock and Sheremeta(2015).
7:203:14856:0:18:75:527:708:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:formance has an impact on people’s behavior in games (e.g.,Duffy and Feltovich,1999).4
7:204:14942:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, peer effects on effort have been identified in both strategic and nonstrategic
7:205:15030:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:settings. For example,Lount Jr. and Wilk(2014) report that feedback can mitigate the
7:206:15114:18:18:74:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:free-riding problem in group production. In their experiment, subjects work better in a
7:207:15201:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:group than alone when feedback on performance is provided and worse in a group than
7:208:15284:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alone when it is not provided.Falk and Ichino(2006) demonstrate the presence of peer
7:209:15368:18:18:75:326:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects in a real-effort individual production task.
7:210:15420:18:18:94:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Several studies explore the role of information and peer effects in subjects’ risk-taking
7:211:15509:18:18:74:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decisions in nonstrategic environments.Linde and Sonnemans(2012) find that subjects
7:212:15592:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:take less risk when they earn at most as much as a peer and more riskwhen they earn at
7:213:15678:18:18:75:529:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:least as much, which is the opposite to what is predicted by the prospect theory with a so-
7:214:15769:18:18:75:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cial reference point (see alsoBault, Coricelli and Rustichini,2008).Gamba and Manzoni
7:215:15854:18:18:75:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2014) find that when subjects observe their peers’ wages, both wageleaders and wage
7:216:15938:18:17:75:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:followers take more risk in a subsequent task.Lahno and Serra-Garcia(2014) separate
7:217:16021:17:18:75:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effects of imitation of choices from relative payoff considerations and show that peers’
7:218:16113:18:18:75:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choices have a significant impact on risk-taking.Cooper and Rege(2011) suggest that
7:219:16196:18:18:75:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such imitation is driven by “social interaction effect.” That is, a person’s utility from
7:220:16285:18:18:75:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking an action increases if others take the same action; a theoryincluding social regret
7:221:16375:18:18:75:340:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explains data better than preference for conformity.
7:222:16427:18:18:94:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We are aware of only one study that explicitly compares risk-taking under competi-

7:224:16597:18:18:74:527:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focuses on different features of the environment.Eriksen and Kvaløy(2014) use a simple
7:225:16683:18:18:75:527:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lottery investment task experiment in which feedback on both strategies and outcomes
7:226:16767:18:18:75:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is provided at various frequencies. Consistent with theory, more frequent feedback leads
7:227:16855:18:18:75:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to less risk-taking under a non-competitive compensation scheme,but more risk-taking
7:228:16939:18:18:75:529:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when rewards are competitive. In contrast to these authors’ interest in the frequency of
7:229:17027:18:17:75:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:feedback, we focus on the effect of different types of informationcontained within the

8:239:17715:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:features of subjects’ decision-making (such as risk-taking), whereas a chosen effort en-

8:242:17974:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the experimental task, we motivated subjects with a hypothetical, framed scenario by ask-
8:243:18063:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing them to imagine themselves as financial analysts making projections about the future
8:244:18151:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:performance of particular stocks. Specifically, the analyst must assess whether the future
8:245:18241:18:18:75:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price will be higher or lower than the current price, and the analyst’spay reflects both

8:250:18663:18:18:94:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Each experimental session consisted of two parts. First, subjects’ risk aversion and
8:251:18747:18:17:74:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ambiguity aversion were assessed using list elicitation methods similar to those described
8:252:18837:17:18:74:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inSutter et al.(2013). During each assessment, subjects were presented with a list of20
8:253:18924:18:18:74:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choices between earning $2.00 for correctly guessing the color of aball drawn randomly
8:254:19010:18:18:74:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from an urn and a sure amount of money. The sure amounts of money increased from
8:255:19090:18:18:74:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:$0.10 to $2.00, and subjects were asked to choose the point at which they were willing
8:256:19176:18:18:74:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to switch from the draw to the sure amount. For the risk-aversionassessment, subjects
8:257:19261:18:18:74:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were informed that the urn contained 10 green balls and 10 red balls.For the ambiguity
8:258:19347:18:18:74:528:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aversion assessment, subjects were informed that the urn contained balls of the two colors,
8:259:19438:18:18:74:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but the exact number of balls of each color was not disclosed.6The results and payoffs
8:260:19524:18:18:75:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from this part of the experiment were not disclosed to subjects until the end of the session.
8:261:19617:18:18:94:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The second part of the experiment consisted of a forecasting game. Subjects partic-
8:262:19700:18:18:74:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ipated in several periods of play, divided into blocks. At the beginningof each period,
8:263:19787:18:18:74:528:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a subject was presented with an image of 15 blank cards on his or hercomputer screen.
8:264:19872:18:17:74:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:When flipped over, each card was either green or red. The color of the card was deter-
8:265:19958:17:18:74:528:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mined randomly and either color was equally likely to appear. A subject’s task was to
8:266:20043:18:18:74:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predict whether the majority of the 15 cards was green or red.  Before making his or
8:267:20127:18:18:74:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:her assessment of the majority color, a subject could choose howmany cards—between
8:268:20209:18:18:74:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:5 and 15—to flip. Flipping fewer cards is a higher-risk strategy, as the subject has less
8:269:20298:18:18:74:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information on which to base his or her assessment. The highest-risk strategy involves
8:270:20384:18:18:74:528:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flipping only 5 cards; in contrast, the lowest-risk strategy is one in which a subject reveals
8:271:20478:18:16:88:528:116:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:5Vandegrift, Yavas and Brown(2007) use a different forecasting task to study performance when sub-
8:272:20576:16:11:75:528:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:jects can choose between relative (competitive) and absolute (non-competitive) performance-based incen-
8:273:20679:11:9:75:525:89:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:tive schemes. Unlike our design, their subjects could not choose explicitly the riskiness of their actions.
8:274:20786:9:0:88:528:80:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:6Unbeknownst to subjects, the share of red balls was generated randomly from a uniform distribution.
9:275:20887:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all 15 cards and, therefore, always records a correct assessment. Once the assessment had
9:276:20976:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been submitted, all of the cards were revealed to the subject, and he or she was told if
9:277:21064:18:18:75:295:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:his or her forecast was correct or incorrect.
9:278:21109:18:18:94:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Periods were divided into blocks in which a subject was allowed to flip a total of 100
9:279:21195:18:18:74:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cards; a counter on the screen displayed the number of remaining flips. A subject repeated
9:280:21285:18:18:74:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same assessment task—forecasting the majority color—untilhe or she had exhausted
9:281:21369:18:18:74:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all 100 flips. Subjects were not constrained to follow the same strategy in each period of
9:282:21459:18:18:74:527:582:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:a block; as a result, a subject could make between 7 and 20 assessments in a given block.7
9:283:21549:18:18:94:527:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A subject’s score in a block was calculated as the number of correctassessments
9:284:21628:18:18:74:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:minus the number of incorrect assessments. At the end of each block, subjects were given
9:285:21716:18:18:74:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a complete history of their individual forecasts, including the number of green and red
9:286:21803:18:18:74:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cards flipped each period, their majority color assessment, and whether the assessment was
9:287:21893:18:18:74:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correct or incorrect. Additionally, subjects received a summary of their own performance
9:288:21981:18:17:74:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e.  their score for the block and their average risk-taking strategy, measured by the
9:289:22069:17:18:74:527:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average number of cards flipped per period). Depending on the experimental treatment,
9:290:22154:18:18:74:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects were also presented with information about other participants’ strategies and/or
9:291:22243:18:18:74:107:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores.
9:292:22250:18:18:94:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:At the beginning of the forecasting game, subjects were randomlyassigned to groups
9:293:22332:18:18:74:527:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of five participants. The identities of group members were not revealed to participants
9:294:22419:18:18:74:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and were described only by identification numbers 1 through 5.  Groups and subject
9:295:22501:18:18:74:434:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identification numbers remained the same throughout the experiment.
9:296:22568:18:18:94:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first block of periods was identical across all treatments. After the first block,
9:297:22654:18:18:74:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all subjects received information about their own performance.  We also implemented
9:298:22737:18:18:74:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one of four peer information conditions, under either a competitiveor a non-competitive

9:304:23244:18:18:94:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Subjects played a total of four blocks, and the feedback treatment was repeated after
9:305:23329:18:18:75:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the second and third blocks. To assess the impact of information about peers, the analysis
9:306:23419:18:18:75:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this paper focuses on subjects’ risk-taking in block 2 where subjects are exposed to
9:307:23506:18:18:75:256:134:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:peer information for the first time.8
9:308:23543:18:16:88:528:116:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:7Subjects were told that they could not flip fewer than five cards in each period and, for that reason,
9:309:23646:16:11:75:528:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:towards the end of the block they would not be allowed to flip a numberof cards such that fewer than
9:310:23746:11:9:75:162:89:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:five cards remained.
9:311:23766:9:0:88:528:80:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:8Because subjects are exposed to peer information again after blocks 2 and 3, the treatment effects in

10:331:24925:18:18:94:528:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:At the end of each session, participants were asked the following open-ended questions
10:332:25011:18:18:74:528:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about their strategies in the forecasting game: (i) What was your strategy? (ii) Did your
10:333:25100:18:18:74:528:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy change over time, and if so, how? (iii) Did your strategy change when you learned
10:334:25190:18:18:74:527:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what others in your group were doing, and if so, how? (iv) Did you follow/imitate anyone

11:351:26566:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preregistered for participation in the XS/FS laboratory experiments. Each subject par-

11:355:26909:18:18:75:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:90 minutes, including instructions and payment.  On average, subjects earned $22.60,

11:359:27135:30:18:75:528:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Before describing the results in Section5, we provide a brief theoretical description of the
11:360:27227:18:18:75:528:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experimental task and formulate specific conjectures. Our empirical findings suggest that
11:361:27316:18:18:75:528:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects’ choices deviate significantly from the theory predictions; even so, the framework
11:362:27407:18:39:75:482:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provides helpful structure to understanding risk-taking in the forecasting game.
11:363:27487:39:25:75:275:378:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.1  Theoretical predictions
11:364:27515:25:18:75:529:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Consider first the decision that subjects face in the non-competitive environment. A total
11:365:27605:18:18:75:528:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 100 cards are flipped in a block, and 5 to 15 cards must be flipped in each period;
11:366:27691:18:18:75:528:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thus, the total number of forecasting attempts per block is between 7 and 20.  Note
11:367:27774:18:18:75:528:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that, regardless of subjects’ underlying risk preference, the relatively large number of
11:368:27862:18:18:75:528:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecasts and accumulation of payoffs within a block effectively induces risk neutrality in
11:369:27953:18:18:75:528:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the expected utility maximization framework. That is, due to the law of large numbers,
11:370:28039:18:18:75:528:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for a large enough number of forecasts, the problem of maximization of expected utility
11:371:28126:18:18:75:387:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be approximated by the maximization of expected score.
11:372:28184:18:18:94:528:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:LetMdenote the (odd) number of cards considered in each period, and letNdenote
11:373:28262:18:18:75:528:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the total number of cards that can be flipped in one block (e.g. in ourexperiment,M= 15
11:374:28349:18:17:75:528:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:andN= 100). For simplicity, consider a stationary strategy in which a subject flipsn
11:375:28433:17:18:75:528:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cards per period and uses the majority color among the flipped cards to construct his

11:377:28604:18:18:75:528:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a subject’s score is calculated as the number of correct forecasts minus the number of
11:378:28690:18:18:75:508:102:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:incorrect forecasts. The subject’s expected score after flipping a total ofNcards is11

13:490:31503:18:18:74:527:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the parameters of the experiment (M= 15 andN= 100).  Recall that subjects
13:491:31580:18:18:74:527:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:had to flip at least 5 cards in each period. Frompn, we calculate the variance in score,
13:492:31668:18:18:75:527:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Var(S) =4Npn(1−pn)n. The error bars in the figure show one standard deviation above and
13:493:31755:18:18:74:260:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below the expected score for eachn.
13:494:31790:18:18:94:528:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As shown in Figure1, the expected score is highest whenn∗= 5—the riskiest
13:495:31863:18:18:74:528:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy—but its dependence onnis rather flat, with expected scores between 6 and
13:496:31944:18:18:75:528:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:8 for all allowed levels of risk-taking. The fluctuations in the dependence ofSonncon-
13:497:32030:18:18:75:528:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm that flipping an even number of cardsnis dominated by flippingn−1 cards. The
13:498:32111:18:18:75:528:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variance in score decreases withn, confirming the trade-off between risk and returns in
13:499:32198:18:17:75:164:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this environment.
13:500:32215:17:18:94:528:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We now turn to analyzing equilibrium behavior in the setting with a competitive re-
13:501:32298:18:18:75:528:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wards scheme. Given thatn∗= 5 maximizes a subject’s expected score, it is a natural
13:502:32381:18:18:75:528:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:candidate for a symmetric Nash equilibrium under competitive rewards. However, since
13:503:32465:18:18:75:528:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the strategyn= 5 is also the riskiest (i.e., it leads to the highest variance in performance),
13:504:32559:18:18:75:528:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is not obvious that the choice ofn= 5 by a player is the best response to all other
13:505:32645:18:18:75:528:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:players choosingn= 5. A safer strategy may decrease the player’s chances of finishing
13:506:32730:18:0:74:528:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first, but may simultaneously increase the player’s chances of not being last. That is, the
14:507:32823:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payoff from deviating from maximum risk-taking is not straightforward. Using extensive
14:508:32909:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simulations based on the parameters of the experiment, we found that such a deviation
14:509:32994:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is not profitable—all subjects in the group choosingn∗= 5 is a symmetric Nash equi-
14:510:33077:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:librium.13Indeed, it is the only symmetric equilibrium since a deviation ton= 5 is
14:511:33159:18:18:75:529:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profitable when all other players choose a safer strategy. Thus,for unboundedly rational
14:512:33247:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-neutral players, optimal (equilibrium) levels of risk-taking should be the same in all
14:513:33338:18:39:75:133:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatments.
14:514:33349:39:26:75:195:561:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.2  Conjectures
14:515:33365:26:18:75:528:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Deciding how many cards to flip each period is a complex problem. Although maximal
14:516:33447:18:17:75:528:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking is the optimal strategy for a risk-neutral subject, learning to play this strategy
14:517:33541:17:18:75:528:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through standard reinforcement mechanisms is extremely difficult,if not impossible, espe-
14:518:33630:18:18:75:528:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cially with a small number of blocks. As a result, we expect substantial heterogeneity in
14:519:33719:18:18:75:528:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects’ behavior. Moreover, in our setting, subjects will likely view information about
14:520:33808:18:18:75:409:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peers’ strategies and outcomes as valuable and will respond to it.
14:521:33874:18:18:94:528:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our experimental task has important features faced by investors and other risk-takers
14:522:33959:18:18:74:528:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the field. First, the relationship between strategies and outcomes, although it exists
14:523:34048:18:18:74:528:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically, is weak and noisy. Second, outcomes are determined to a significant extent
14:524:34137:18:18:74:423:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by luck, and disentangling luck and the effect of strategy is difficult.
14:525:34209:18:18:94:528:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The existing literature agrees that competitive incentives encourage more risk-taking
14:526:34294:18:18:74:528:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than comparable non-competitive incentives, and we expect to findthis result, on aver-
14:527:34380:18:18:74:528:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age, in our setting. However, the literature provides little specific guidance in terms of
14:528:34470:18:18:74:528:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:understanding the interaction between these incentives and the availability of information
14:529:34560:18:18:74:528:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about peers’ decisions and outcomes. Therefore, although we can lean on existing stud-
14:530:34646:18:18:74:528:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ies to build conjectures, our main research interest is the empiricalrelationship between
14:531:34735:18:17:74:197:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives and feedback.
14:532:34759:17:18:94:528:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the setting with information about peers’ risk-taking only, subjects cannot observe
14:533:34845:18:18:74:528:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effectiveness of others’ strategies and, hence, we can assess whether subjects engage
14:534:34934:18:18:74:528:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in “pure” imitation. There are several possible reasons to expect such imitation. First,
14:535:35022:18:18:74:528:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the environment is complex, and making informed decisions is difficult. Moreover, due
14:536:35107:18:18:74:528:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to reference group neglect (Moore and Cain,2007), subjects may believe that the task
14:537:35191:18:18:75:528:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is difficult for them but not for others; hence, subjects may imitatetheir peers under
14:538:35277:18:18:75:527:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the expectation that others know better.  Second, it is plausible that subjects derive
14:539:35363:18:18:75:528:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility directly from conforming to the group norm or imitate to avoid anticipated social

15:541:35491:0:18:75:527:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regret (Cialdini and Goldstein,2004;Cooper and Rege,2011). We expect any tendency
15:542:35572:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:towards the mean strategy to be especially pronounced in the setting with competitive
15:543:35657:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rewards where relative positions matter and where, by conformingto their group’s average
15:544:35745:18:18:75:427:654:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:behavior, subjects can reduce the riskiness of their overall strategy.14
15:545:35817:18:18:94:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the setting with information about peers’ scores only, there is limited scope for
15:546:35901:18:18:74:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:learning and informed strategy updating. Even though subjects do not observe how their
15:547:35987:18:18:74:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peers achieved certain outcomes, they may make broad inferences about how to change
15:548:36070:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their own strategies to improve their scores. For example, a subject pursuing a very safe
15:549:36159:18:18:74:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy who learns that his or her score is substantially lower thanthe leader’s score
15:550:36246:18:18:74:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can adopt a riskier strategy in the next round. Conversely, an extreme risk-taker may
15:551:36331:18:18:74:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:believe that he or she can mimic the group’s leader success only with a safer strategy.
15:552:36418:18:18:74:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, we expect subjects with scores further away from the group’s maximum to
15:553:36500:18:18:74:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change their strategy more dramatically. Subjects’ relative positions are salient in the
15:554:36588:18:17:74:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presence of score-only information and, hence, we expect the effects of this information
15:555:36676:17:18:74:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on strategy updating to be stronger in the setting with competitiverewards. It is also of
15:556:36765:18:18:74:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest to explore the behavior of the leader (i.e., whether the leader will choose to “play
15:557:36858:18:18:74:404:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it safe” or adopt an even riskier strategy in the following block).
15:558:36925:18:18:94:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the presence of information about peers’ strategies and scores, subjects may imitate
15:559:37012:18:18:74:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the leading scorer. The rationale is somewhat similar to imitation in the treatments with
15:560:37101:18:18:74:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information about risk-taking only, except that the score leader’sstrategy (and not the
15:561:37188:18:18:74:527:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average strategy) may be the attraction point. In the treatments with combined feedback
15:562:37275:18:18:74:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about risk-taking and scores, subjects can observe patterns and, depending on their group,
15:563:37365:18:18:74:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may observe different relationships between strategies and outcomes. Thus, learning will
15:564:37453:18:18:74:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend critically on what patterns arise (e.g., the strength and direction of correlation
15:565:37542:18:18:74:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the observed strategies and outcomes).  Again, the effect of this feedback on
15:566:37627:18:18:74:528:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy updating is expected to be stronger in the setting with competitive rewards,
15:567:37712:18:17:74:314:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when relative positions are particularly salient.
15:568:37761:17:18:94:528:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we note that luck plays an important role in this noisy experimental environ-
15:569:37847:18:18:75:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment and may influence subjects’ ability to learn. A subject who wasusing an (ex ante)
15:570:37933:18:18:75:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suboptimal strategy and was lucky (or anex anteoptimal strategy and was unlucky) will
15:571:38018:18:18:75:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be less likely to update his or her strategy correctly, relative to a subject whose luck did
15:572:38110:18:18:75:408:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not distort the signals about the theoretically superior strategies.
15:573:38178:18:16:84:528:134:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:14Under competitive rewards, it is also possible that subjects will engage in “anti-imitation,” whereby
15:574:38281:16:12:74:528:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:they attempt to break away from their peers by choosing a strategy that does not conform to the group
15:575:38382:12:11:74:528:106:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:mean. Such behavior is similar to choosing a riskier overall strategy and, therefore, it can be rationalized
15:576:38490:11:0:74:244:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in a tournament setting (Hvide,2002).

16:581:38798:18:18:75:528:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cess. Next, we describe the relationship between the uncertaintyattitude measures and
16:582:38883:18:18:75:527:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects’ choices. We then describe the main results about the effects of the incentives
16:583:38971:18:18:75:528:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and peer information on subjects’ risk-taking. Finally, we describesome patterns in the
16:584:39058:18:39:75:419:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual data that help to explain the observed treatment effects.
16:585:39126:39:25:75:261:531:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.1  Probability matching
16:586:39151:25:18:75:528:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To begin, we examine the basic properties of subjects’ decisions.  As discussed in the
16:587:39237:18:18:75:528:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous section, subjects should never choose to flip an even number of cards because
16:588:39323:18:18:75:528:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is dominated by flipping one fewer. It should be noted that at the end of each block,
16:589:39411:18:18:75:528:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects may be forced to flip an even number of cards due to the restriction that the
16:590:39497:18:18:75:528:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remaining number of cards cannot be less than five. Therefore, weexpect to see at most
16:591:39583:18:18:75:528:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one even flip per subject per block.  In fact, we observe that 33.3%of all flips in the
16:592:39670:18:18:75:528:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiment are even—on average, subjects chose to make 4.14 even flips per block. The
16:593:39755:18:18:75:528:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequency of even flips declines over time, but only moderately, from 38.4% in block 1 to
16:594:39844:18:18:75:163:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:32.4% in block 2.
16:595:39861:18:18:94:528:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The other, and perhaps more important, question is whether subjects always base their
16:596:39946:18:18:75:528:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecasts on the majority color of the flipped cards—that is, do subjects make optimal
16:597:40032:18:18:75:528:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predictions given their signals? Excluding cases in which an equal number of green and
16:598:40118:18:18:75:528:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:red cards are revealed, subjects forecast against the majoritycolor in 20.3% of their
16:599:40203:18:17:75:528:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predictions. There is a very slight decline in the frequency of non-majority guesses between
16:600:40295:17:18:75:528:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the first and second block, from 21.2% to 20.6%, but it is not statistically significant. Only
16:601:40389:18:18:75:528:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:8 of the 400 subjects (2%) never made a non-majority guess, and34.2% of subjects made
16:602:40474:18:18:75:200:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:10 or more such guesses.
16:603:40498:18:18:94:528:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The presence of suboptimal, non-majority guesses is a manifestation of the perva-
16:604:40579:18:18:75:527:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sive phenomenon ofprobability matchingthat has been studied extensively in psychology,
16:605:40665:18:18:75:528:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dating back toEstes(1950).Vulkan(2000) provides a recent survey of this literature
16:606:40747:18:18:74:527:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from an economist’s perspective. A typical experiment on probability matching involves
16:607:40833:18:18:74:528:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects observing a random sequence of two signals (e.g., red andgreen lights) that they
16:608:40922:18:18:74:528:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are told are independent draws in which the red signal appears with some probability
16:609:41006:18:18:74:528:93:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:p. Having observed a sufficiently long sequence, subjects are then asked to predict what
16:610:41094:18:0:74:528:75:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the next signal will be.  Clearly, red is the optimal prediction if and onlyif red light

17:644:41975:18:18:75:528:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many subjects randomize their predictions and predict red with a frequency close top.
17:645:42060:18:18:75:528:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This suboptimal randomizing behavior is robust to learning, althoughit can be partially
17:646:42147:18:18:75:528:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mitigated through guided deliberation and advice (Koehler and James,2009). Recently,
17:647:42231:18:18:75:528:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Gaissmaier and Schooler(2008) proposed that probability matching serves as an evolu-
17:648:42315:18:18:75:528:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tionarily “smart” heuristic whereby individuals look for patterns andserial dependence
17:649:42401:18:17:75:229:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in naturally occurring stimuli.
17:650:42432:17:18:94:527:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our forecasting task differs in two significant ways from the simple settings in which
17:651:42518:18:18:74:528:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability matching has been studied previously. First, it includes variation in the in-
17:652:42607:18:18:74:528:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tensity of the signal; our subjects see different numbers of red and green cards revealed.
17:653:42697:18:18:74:528:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, there is variation in the amount of noise; our subjects observe the differences in
17:654:42787:18:18:74:528:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the numbers of red and green cards revealed and the number of hidden cards. Suppose
17:655:42870:18:18:74:528:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that a subject flipsnout ofMtotal cards,rof which turn out to be red andgare green.
17:656:42953:18:18:75:528:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The larger the difference|r−g|and the smaller the number of hidden cardsM−n, the
17:657:43033:18:18:74:528:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely it is that the majority color forecast will be correct. Thus, while a payoff max-
17:658:43126:18:18:74:528:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imizer will choose the majority color all of the time, a probability matcher will choose the
17:659:43218:18:18:74:528:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:majority color with a probability that is increasing in|r−g|andn. Testing this formally
17:660:43305:18:18:74:528:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a probit regression, we find negative and statistically significant effects of|r−g|and
17:661:43394:18:0:75:528:70:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:non the probability of a non-majority guess. In our experiment, probability matching is
18:662:43483:0:18:75:440:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present across all of the compensation and peer information conditions.
18:663:43554:18:18:94:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the left panel in Figure2, the squares plot the observed average frequency of red
18:664:43638:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecasts against the difference between the number of red and green cards,r−g. The
18:665:43721:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal forecasting strategy is shown by a dashed line. The circles plot the average ratio
18:666:43811:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of red cards to the total number of cards,rr+g, against each value ofr−gobserved in
18:667:43894:18:18:74:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the experiment. The ratiorr+grepresents the behavior of a “pure” probability matcher.
18:668:43979:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The observed average behavior lies between pure probability matching and the optimal
18:669:44063:18:18:75:529:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior, suggesting that probability matching varies across subjects and with the level of
18:670:44154:18:18:75:527:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:noise, as observations for eachr−gare averaged over different values ofn. As expected,
18:671:44240:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the frequency of forecasting red increases monotonically inr−g, starting at zero for
18:672:44324:18:18:75:292:528:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:r−g≤−6 and reaching one atr−g≥7.
18:673:44356:18:18:94:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The pattern of choices observed in the experiment is consistent with random
18:674:44431:18:18:75:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choice models, such as the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) model introduced by

18:683:45026:18:18:74:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choose red (R) or choose green (G). Letpn,rdenote the probability that red is the ma-

18:688:45447:18:18:74:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiment yieldsλ= 1.4 (standard error of 0.02). There is little variation inλacross
18:689:45532:18:18:75:528:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:blocks and treatments, suggesting that the amount of noise in therandom choice model

18:691:45675:17:18:94:527:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Given the presence of suboptimal probability matching behavior, weconsider the

18:693:45840:18:18:74:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular, we explore how probability matching affects the trade-off between risk and
18:694:45926:18:18:74:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected returns predicted by the theory in Section4, which assumes that subjects always
18:695:46014:18:18:75:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecast the majority color.  The squares in the right panel of Figure2plot subjects’
18:696:46099:18:18:75:528:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average score in the first block against the number of forecastingattempts. The error bars
18:697:46189:18:18:75:528:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:around the squares show one standard deviation above and below the mean. The number
18:698:46272:18:18:75:528:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of forecasts ranges from 7 (the safest strategy, flipping 15 cards in each period except the
18:699:46364:18:0:75:528:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:last one) to 20 (the riskiest strategy, flipping 5 cards in each period). The dashed line
19:700:46455:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a linear regression line for the average score as a function of the number of forecasts,
19:701:46546:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including an intercept. The slope is positive and statistically significantat conventional
19:702:46636:18:18:75:529:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:levels. The circles show the expected score that a subject would have received if he or
19:703:46723:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:she always followed the majority guessing strategy. Due to suboptimal decision-making,
19:704:46809:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the average score in the experiment is approximately 0.7 lower than the expected optimal
19:705:46897:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:score, and the difference is statistically significant. However, the observed dependence
19:706:46985:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of score on the number of forecasting attempts is essentially a parallel shift down from
19:707:47073:18:18:75:527:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what fully rational theory predicts, and the trade-off between risk and returns is preserved
19:708:47165:18:39:75:305:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:despite the presence of probability matching.

19:711:47313:18:18:75:528:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Throughout our analysis, we use the number of forecasts in a blockas a measure of
19:712:47394:18:18:75:528:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects’ risk-taking. More forecasts means that the subjectassumed more risk by turn-
19:713:47480:18:18:75:528:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing over fewer cards per period, whereas fewer forecasts meansthat the subject pursued
19:714:47566:18:18:75:528:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the safer strategy of turning over more cards per period. Overall, an average subject turns
19:715:47657:18:18:75:528:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over approximately 7 cards per period, leading to roughly 13 forecasts per block. The
19:716:47742:18:18:75:528:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number of forecasts is not statistically different across treatments in block 1, a reassuring

19:719:48005:18:18:75:528:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected scores. Expected score is calculated using the theoretical probability of a cor-

19:721:48180:18:18:75:527:302:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:by subject. Subjects’ luck in the first block did not vary statistically across treatments.16

19:724:48445:18:17:74:528:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of safe choices in the risk aversion elicitation list. Ambiguity aversion (AA) is measured as
19:725:48538:17:18:74:528:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the difference between the number of safe choices in the ambiguity aversion elicitation list
19:726:48630:18:18:74:528:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and RA, where a positive difference suggests an aversion to ambiguity. Neither measure
19:727:48716:18:18:74:527:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is statistically different across treatments, suggesting that subjects’ attitudes towards
19:728:48805:18:18:74:358:177:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:uncertainty did not vary systematically by treatment.17

21:771:51721:18:18:74:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plained by individuals’ observable characteristics. Therefore, in the analysis that follows,
21:772:51813:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we use the subjects’ risk-taking in the first block (the number of forecasts in block 1) as

21:775:52020:18:18:74:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their peers, we can assess cleanly the impact of information treatments.19Across all of
21:776:52107:18:18:75:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the treatments, we find that there is a statistically significant decline in the average level

21:778:52292:18:39:75:403:474:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:to subjects who took more than average risk in the first block.20

21:794:53560:12:12:75:528:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:subject is female, zero otherwise) does not change the sign, magnitude or statistical significance of the
21:795:53665:12:12:75:528:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:coefficient estimates for the risk and ambiguity aversion measures inthe regression. The coefficient on
21:796:53768:12:8:75:377:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the gender indicator itself is negative and not statistically significant.
21:797:53842:8:16:84:529:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:19As noted above, the treatment effects in blocks 3 and 4 are confounded by the fact that subjects are
21:798:53944:16:8:75:369:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:now responding to other subjects’ responses to their earlier choices.

23:840:56047:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores. The regressions build up from a simple specification to one that captures the full
23:841:56137:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity of the experimental design. In all regressions, the dependent variable is the
23:842:56228:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number of forecasting attempts by individual subjects in the second block. Each column
23:843:56314:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reports results of a Tobit specification, accounting for the fact that forecasts are bounded
23:844:56406:18:18:75:465:618:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:between 7 and 20. Robust standard errors are clustered at the group level.21
23:845:56482:18:18:94:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We begin by examining the common notion that, in general, competitivereward
23:846:56557:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schemes lead to more risk-taking. Indeed, the results reported incolumn3.A are con-
23:847:56640:18:18:75:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sistent with the simple conclusion drawn from a comparison of means inTable2. The
23:848:56721:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated coefficient on the indicator for competitive incentives is positive and statisti-
23:849:56812:18:18:75:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cally significant (p <0.1), suggesting that relative rewards schemes are associated with
23:850:56900:18:18:74:161:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more risk-taking.
23:851:56917:18:18:94:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Drawing from our earlier discussion of subjects’ strategies and the extant literature
23:852:57002:18:17:74:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on risk-taking, we expect subjects’ to vary in terms of their underlying attitude towards
23:853:57091:17:18:74:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking and their experiences in the first block. In column3.B, we include a control
23:854:57179:18:18:75:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for each subjects’ risk-taking in the first block (the number of forecasts in block 1).
23:855:57266:18:18:75:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Again, the estimated coefficient on the indicator for competitive incentives is positive and
23:856:57358:18:18:75:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant (p <0.1). The coefficient estimate on the control itself is positive
23:857:57452:18:18:74:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and statistically significant (p <0.01), indicating that the risk-taking measure from the
23:858:57541:18:18:74:319:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first block serves as an individual “fixed effect.”
23:859:57592:18:18:94:528:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One might also ask whether subjects’ own experiences in the first block influence their
23:860:57679:18:18:74:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choices in the second block. To that end, in column3.C, we add a measure of the subject’s
23:861:57768:18:18:75:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“luck” in the first block, defined as the difference between the subject’s actual score and
23:862:57859:18:18:75:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the expected score predicted by theory, given the number of cards flipped. The coefficient
23:863:57949:18:18:75:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate for the competitive incentives indicator remains positive, but it is no longer
23:864:58036:18:18:75:528:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant at conventional levels. The luck measure itself has explanatory
23:865:58125:18:17:75:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power—the coefficient is positive and statistically significant (p <0.01), suggesting that
23:866:58215:17:18:75:425:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects increase their risk-taking in response to previous good luck.
23:867:58285:18:18:94:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While columns3.A,3.B and3.C address the question of the average impact of compet-
23:868:58366:18:18:75:527:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:itive rewards scheme, our main research question focuses on the interaction of incentives
23:869:58455:18:18:75:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and peer information. We first analyze the effect of peer information in general, without
23:870:58544:18:18:75:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:separating different types of feedback. In column3.D, we report results from a regression
23:871:58633:18:19:75:528:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that includes an indicator for the presence of any peer information(scores, strategies or
23:872:58722:19:15:84:528:115:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:21In treatments with feedback, groups are defined as the five subjects who were presented with in-
23:873:58820:15:12:75:528:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:formation about each others’ scores, strategies or both; in treatments without feedback about peers,
23:874:58920:12:12:75:528:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:groups include only a single subject, since these individuals are not exposed to information about other

24:876:59039:0:18:75:529:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both) and its interaction with the indicator for competitive incentives. When no peer in-
24:877:59128:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formation is available to subjects, competitive rewards are associated with less risk-taking
24:878:59220:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than non-competitive rewards; the coefficient on 1(Competitive) isnegative (p <0.10). In
24:879:59308:18:18:74:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, when peer information is available, competitive rewards are associated with more
24:880:59398:18:18:74:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking; the sum of the coefficients on 1(Competitive) and 1(Competitive)×1(Peer In-
24:881:59486:18:18:74:243:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formation) is positive (p <0.05).
24:882:59519:18:18:94:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can also hold the incentives fixed and isolate the effect of feedback. Peer informa-
24:883:59606:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion appears to have no significant impact on risk-taking in the non-competitive setting;

24:887:59955:18:31:75:185:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is positive (p <0.05).
24:888:59977:31:18:75:528:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Result 1(a) There is no evidence of a robust effect of competitive incentives on the
24:889:60061:18:17:75:214:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:average level of risk-taking.
24:890:60090:17:18:94:528:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:(b) In the absence of information about peers, there is less risk-taking under competi-
24:891:60177:18:18:75:349:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:tive incentives than under non-competitive incentives.
24:892:60231:18:18:94:528:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:(c) In the presence of information about peers, there is morerisk-taking under com-
24:893:60314:18:31:75:367:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:petitive incentives than under non-competitive incentives.
24:894:60372:31:18:94:528:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Results1describes a surprising finding. In contrast to the conventional view that
24:895:60453:18:18:75:528:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tournament-style incentives schemes are always associated with more risk-taking relative
24:896:60541:18:18:75:528:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to non-competitive incentives, we find that competitive rewards may lead to less risk-
24:897:60627:18:18:75:528:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking when subjects receive no information about other competitors.  This result is
24:898:60711:18:18:75:528:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overturned in the presence of peer information, when competitiverewards are associated
24:899:60797:18:18:75:528:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with more risk-taking. In short, the availability of information aboutpeers appears to
24:900:60883:18:18:75:528:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matter critically. Of course, the coarse indicator for peer information in column3.D may
24:901:60971:18:18:75:402:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obscure the heterogeneous impact of different types of feedback.
24:902:61035:18:17:94:528:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To explore the impact of different types of peer information, we report the results
24:903:61118:17:18:75:528:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a regression with indicators for feedback about peers’ strategies, scores or both under
24:904:61205:18:18:75:528:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each incentive scheme in column3.E. To begin, we compare the effect of competitive and
24:905:61291:18:18:75:528:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-competitive incentives while holding fixed the information availableto subjects. In
24:906:61378:18:18:75:528:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the absence of peer information, competitive compensation is associated with less risk-
24:907:61465:18:18:75:528:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking than a non-competitive pay scheme (p <0.1). When information about peers’
24:908:61545:18:18:74:527:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking, scores or both is available, subjects engage in more risk-taking when they
24:909:61632:18:18:74:528:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:face competitive rewards; for each type of information, the sum of the coefficients on
24:910:61718:18:0:74:528:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the indicator for competitive rewards and its interaction with the indicator for specific
25:911:61809:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information type is positive and statistically significant (p <0.1). Information appears
25:912:61897:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to matter similarly; there is no statistically significant difference between the effects of
25:913:61989:18:18:75:377:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information about strategies, scores or both on risk-taking.
25:914:62049:18:18:94:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can also estimate the impact of each type of peer information whileholding fixed
25:915:62132:18:18:74:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the incentive scheme. Under non-competitive rewards, subjectsmake less risky choices
25:916:62216:18:18:74:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:when they receive feedback about their peers’ strategies only (p <0.05) or scores only (p <
25:917:62307:18:18:74:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.1), but not about both strategies and scores. In contrast, under competitive rewards
25:918:62393:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the combined information on peers’ strategies and scores is associated with significantly
25:919:62482:18:18:74:529:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more risk-taking (p <0.01), whereas the effects of feedback on peers’ strategies only or
25:920:62570:18:24:74:292:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores only are not statistically significant.
25:921:62616:24:18:74:529:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Result 2(a) Comparing settings with competitive and non-competitive compensation,
25:922:62697:18:18:74:529:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:competitive rewards are associated with more risk-taking for each type of peer information.
25:923:62788:18:18:94:528:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:(b) In a non-competitive setting, information about eitherpeers’ risk-taking or peers’
25:924:62874:18:18:74:528:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:scores is associated with less risk-taking; however, the availability of information about
25:925:62964:18:18:74:281:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:both risk-taking and scores has no effect.
25:926:63006:18:18:94:528:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:(c) In a setting with competitive rewards, information about either peers’ risk-taking
25:927:63092:18:18:74:528:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:or peers’ scores does not affect risk-taking; however, information about both risk-taking
25:928:63181:18:24:74:310:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:and scores is associated with more risk-taking.
25:929:63228:24:18:94:528:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Result2(a) decomposes Result1(b)—competitive rewards lead to more risk-taking
25:930:63305:18:18:74:528:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than non-competitive schemes for each type of peer information,despite the fact that the
25:931:63393:18:18:75:528:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three types of feedback convey different information about the competitive environment.
25:932:63480:18:17:94:528:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our results suggest that tournament-style, competitive compensation does not inher-
25:933:63563:17:18:74:528:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ently induce more risk-taking.  In the presence of information about peers’ strategies,
25:934:63650:18:18:74:528:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores or both, subjects rewarded according to their relative performance may adopt
25:935:63733:18:18:74:528:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:riskier strategies than they would with non-competitive rewards.  However, in settings
25:936:63819:18:18:74:528:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without peer information, competitive rewards may be associated withlessrisk-taking.
25:937:63903:18:18:75:528:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Overall, the presence or absence of information matters critically interms of how com-
25:938:63989:18:18:75:527:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:petitive rewards schemes affect risk-taking. That is, to achieve a particular risk-related
25:939:64079:18:18:75:528:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:objective, one needs to consider both the incentives and the availability of information to
25:940:64170:18:18:75:528:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitors. Moreover, the nature of the feedback also matters—holding incentives fixed,
25:941:64258:18:18:75:467:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the type of peer information may affect the riskiness of competitors’ actions.
25:942:64336:18:18:94:527:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our main results suggest that the interaction of peer information and incentives
25:943:64416:18:18:75:527:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schemes is more subtle than previously discussed in the literature. Moreover, the results

25:945:64590:18:17:75:528:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-related choices in competitive and non-competitive settings. For example, does infor-
25:946:64680:17:0:75:528:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mation about peers’ scores motivate more aggressive decision-making by giving average
26:947:64767:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitors a sense of how far they lag behind the leaders? Does information on risk-
26:948:64852:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking give subjects a view into possible strategies to imitate? Does information about
26:949:64939:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategies and scores allow competitors to identify a path to success? For each type of
26:950:65026:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peer feedback, there may be different mechanisms driving the higher risk-taking that we
26:951:65113:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observe under competitive compensation schemes. In the followingsections, we shed light
26:952:65200:18:39:75:199:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on possible mechanisms.
26:953:65223:39:26:75:336:579:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.4  Information about peers’ scores
26:954:65259:26:18:75:528:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We start with an analysis of an environment in which subjects learn about peers’ outcomes,
26:955:65349:18:18:75:528:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but not the strategies that underlie those successes or failures.Outside of the laboratory,
26:956:65440:18:17:75:528:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this setting aligns with situations in which, for example, colleagues share stories about
26:957:65529:17:18:75:528:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their portfolios’ returns, the volume of completed deals, or their year-end totals, without
26:958:65620:18:18:75:528:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:describinghowthey achieved these successes. Alternatively, workers may describe their
26:959:65705:18:18:74:402:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:losses or shortfalls without explaining what led to these failings.
26:960:65772:18:18:94:528:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table4reports Tobit regression results using the number of forecasts inblock 2, our
26:961:65855:18:18:75:528:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking measure, as the dependent variable and examines the two treatments in which
26:962:65942:18:18:75:528:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects received only score-related feedback about their peers. As in Table3, a Tobit
26:963:66028:18:18:75:528:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specification accounts for the fact that forecasts are boundedbetween 7 and 20. To un-

26:965:66205:18:18:75:528:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we include a measure of the distance between a subject’s score andthe highest or lowest
26:966:66292:18:18:75:528:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:score in the group and their respective interactions with the indicator for competitive
26:967:66379:18:18:75:528:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives. To ease interpretation, for each distance measure, the sample mean is sub-
26:968:66465:18:18:75:527:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tracted from the variable before it is interacted. These coefficientestimates are presented
26:969:66556:18:18:75:528:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in columns4.A and4.B; the regression reported in column4.C includes both measures
26:970:66637:18:18:75:528:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and their respective interactions. All specifications include subject-specific controls for

26:972:66772:17:18:94:528:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In settings with non-competitive rewards, the distance between group members’ scores
26:973:66856:18:18:74:528:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appears to have little influence on risk-taking; across the three columns in Table4, the co-

26:975:67042:18:18:75:528:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, subjects facing competitive rewards may adopt riskier strategies as they fall

28:1015:69378:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores are more likely to claim that they followed a strategy, relativeto subjects in the

28:1021:69905:18:31:75:430:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no subject states that they were imitating their peers (question (iv)).

28:1023:70058:18:18:75:528:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:matter in the setting with competitive rewards, where greater distance is associated with
28:1024:70147:18:30:75:361:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:more risk-taking, but not in the non-competitive setting.
28:1025:70204:30:18:94:528:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Subjects’ position in the distribution—in this case, distance from peers’ scores—affect

28:1027:70379:18:18:75:528:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative performance. Specifically, in the setting with competitive rewards, subjects follow
28:1028:70471:18:18:75:528:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:riskier strategies when they are farther away from the highest scorer and the lowest scorer.
28:1029:70563:18:18:75:528:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests that subjects adopt riskier strategies when they need to overcome a larger
28:1030:70651:18:18:75:528:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gap to catch up with the leader and when they face a smaller chance of falling into last
28:1031:70739:18:18:75:528:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:place. In contrast, in the non-competitive setting, relative position appears to have little
28:1032:70831:18:18:75:188:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact on risk-taking.
28:1033:70853:18:18:94:528:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We also separately examined how the behavior of the highest and lowest-scoring sub-

28:1043:71723:18:22:74:528:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rewards, the lowest-scoring subject decreases his or her risk-taking (p <0.1); facing a com-

28:1045:71882:9:15:84:528:113:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:23Note that 4% and 11% do not add up to 23% because the remaining subjects did not unambiguously

29:1053:72348:18:18:74:528:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within the groups. To consider the possibility that feedback facilitates convergences in
29:1054:72436:18:18:74:528:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking strategies, we calculate the difference between the standard deviations of sub-

29:1056:72618:18:18:74:528:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the presence of feedback about risk-taking led subjects towards a common strategy.
29:1057:72705:18:18:94:528:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More specifically, we first compare the change in the dispersion of forecasting strate-

29:1059:72879:17:18:74:528:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatments without peer information, the group-level standarddeviation declines in the
29:1060:72965:18:18:74:528:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-competitive treatment and is unchanged in the competitive setting; however, the dif-
29:1061:73053:18:18:74:527:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ference between these changes is not significantly different from zero (p= 0.27). When
29:1062:73139:18:18:74:527:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects receive information about peers’ risk-taking, the difference is even smaller in
29:1063:73227:18:18:74:458:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:magnitude (both changes are negative) with an even larger standard error.
29:1064:73300:18:18:94:528:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The changes are similarly small when we consider the impact of peer information, hold-

29:1068:73644:18:18:74:528:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second blocks are small and not statistically different from zero. A comparison of treat-

29:1072:73910:18:18:94:528:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One might ask whether subjects who learn about their peers’ risk-taking then attempt
29:1073:73994:18:17:74:528:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to imitate some of those strategies. To consider this question, we examine the impact of
29:1074:74082:17:18:74:528:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the mean, median, minimum and maximum risk-taking by peers and of the difference

29:1076:74249:18:18:75:528:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores); however, we find no statistically significant relationships between subjects’ own

29:1078:74387:18:18:94:528:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, we find little evidence that the presence of information about peers’ risk-

29:1083:74828:18:0:74:528:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy (question (iii)). Moreover, when asked directly in question (iv), only 1% of the
30:1084:74919:0:18:75:527:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects indicate that they imitated other players’ strategies. This pattern of responses
30:1085:75008:18:31:75:437:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:did not vary between the competitive and non-competitive treatments.

30:1087:75162:18:18:74:528:641:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:risk-taking alone does not lead to convergence of subjects’strategies, and we find no evi-

32:1159:79818:18:18:94:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column5.C includes the correlation coefficient of the risk-taking and score data pre-
32:1160:79903:18:18:74:527:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sented in the feedback after block 1 and its interaction with the indicator for competitive
32:1161:79994:18:18:74:527:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives. The coefficient estimate on the correlation variable is positive and statistically
32:1162:80088:18:18:74:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant (p <0.01). We interpret the results by considering three cases: correlation
32:1163:80175:18:18:75:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients of -1, 0, and 1. A correlation coefficient of -1 implies thatscores decrease with
32:1164:80269:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking and conveys a noiseless and theoretically incorrect assessment of the relation-
32:1165:80360:18:18:75:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ship. Interpreting the estimates in column5.C suggests that a subject in the presence
32:1166:80445:18:18:74:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of this precise but incorrect information would take similar risk undercompetitive and
32:1167:80531:18:18:74:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-competitive rewards. In contrast, a correlation coefficient of 1 implies that scores
32:1168:80619:18:17:74:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase with risk-taking and conveys a noiseless and theoretically correct assessment of
32:1169:80708:17:18:74:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the relationship.  Presented with this information, our estimates suggest that subjects
32:1170:80795:18:18:74:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would take more risk when they face competitive compensation, relative to their risk-
32:1171:80880:18:18:74:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taking under non-competitive rewards (p <0.05). A correlation coefficient of 0 implies no
32:1172:80969:18:18:74:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observable, linear relationship between risk-taking and scores. With noisy information,
32:1173:81056:18:18:74:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our subjects again would take more risk when they face competitiverewards, rather than
32:1174:81142:18:18:74:290:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-competitive compensation (p <0.05).
32:1175:81181:18:18:94:528:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Keeping incentives fixed, the results in column5.C imply that under non-competitive
32:1176:81264:18:18:75:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives subjects exhibit a correct and statistically significant reaction to the correlation.
32:1177:81360:18:18:75:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The stronger the correlation between risk and rewards they observe in their group, the
32:1178:81446:18:18:75:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more risk they take. Under competitive incentives, however, the effect of the correlation
32:1179:81535:18:31:75:207:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on risk-taking disappears.
32:1180:81561:31:18:75:528:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Result 5Under non-competitive incentives, subjects take more riskthe stronger the ob-
32:1181:81646:18:17:75:528:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:served correlation between risk and rewards in their group.However, no similar effect is
32:1182:81734:17:31:75:323:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:found for the setting with competitive incentives.
32:1183:81784:31:18:94:528:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column5.D includes the distance and correlation variables and their respective in-

32:1185:81954:18:18:75:528:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlation variable and its interaction with the indicator for competitive incentives are

32:1189:82317:18:0:75:528:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the low scorer is not statistically significant under either compensation scheme. However,
33:1190:82409:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of changes in the distance to the highest scorer is statistically significant with
33:1191:82502:18:18:75:236:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive rewards (p <0.10).
33:1192:82532:18:18:94:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column5.E includes the measure of the correlation between risk-taking and scores
33:1193:82612:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the number of forecasts made by the best- and worst-scoring members of each group
33:1194:82697:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in block 1. In this specification, a higher highest score in the previousblock is associated
33:1195:82789:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with more risk-taking (p <0.10). Coefficient estimates on the correlation measure and
33:1196:82874:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:its interaction with the indicator for competitive rewards are both statistically significant
33:1197:82967:18:18:75:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(p <0.01 andp <0.05, respectively). We can interpret the coefficients to compare com-
33:1198:83052:18:18:75:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:petitive and non-competitive incentives treatments. When the correlation coefficient is -1
33:1199:83142:18:18:75:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(an incorrect characterization of the relationship between risk and score) or 0 (no obvi-
33:1200:83231:18:18:75:527:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ous relationship), there is more risk-taking in the competitive compensation treatments
33:1201:83318:18:18:75:529:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to the non-competitive treatments; however, when the correlation coefficient is 1
33:1202:83408:18:18:75:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(a correct characterization of the relationship), competitive incentives are associated with
33:1203:83500:18:17:75:154:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less risk-taking.
33:1204:83517:17:18:94:528:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Similar to the within-subject analysis discussed briefly in Section5.4, we examine
33:1205:83599:18:18:75:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the difference between a subject’s risk-taking in the first and second block in treatments
33:1206:83689:18:18:75:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with no peer information and information on peers’ strategies and scores. Regressing the
33:1207:83777:18:18:75:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change in risk-taking on the indicators for peer information and competitive rewards, and
33:1208:83866:18:18:75:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their interactions, along with the controls for first block risk-taking and luck, we identify
33:1209:83959:18:18:75:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:how a subject’s risk-taking is affected by learning not just that he or she has either the
33:1210:84049:18:18:75:528:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highest or lowest score but also information aboutwhythey lead or lag their group. In
33:1211:84134:18:18:74:529:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast to the treatments with information about peers’ scores only, the risk-taking of
33:1212:84222:18:18:74:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects who learn that they are the highest- or lowest-scorersin their group does not
33:1213:84308:18:18:74:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change in a statistically significant way. This is consistent with the results in columns5.B
33:1214:84400:18:18:75:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and5.D, where the risk-taking in treatments with feedback about peers’ strategies and
33:1215:84485:18:18:74:425:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scores appears unaffected by subjects’ relative position in the group.
33:1216:84555:18:17:94:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the text responses to the follow-up questions, 70% of the subjects claimed that
33:1217:84637:17:18:75:528:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their strategy changed over the rounds of the experiment (question (ii)). Approximately
33:1218:84724:18:18:75:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:35% of the subjects wrote that these changes occurred after observing peers’ risk-taking
33:1219:84812:18:18:75:527:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and scores, with 8% (15%) of the subjects stating that they switched to a safer (riskier)
33:1220:84901:18:18:75:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy (question (iii)). However, when asked directly in question(iv), nearly no subject
33:1221:84991:18:18:75:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicated that he or she imitated other players’ strategies. This pattern of responses did
33:1222:85081:18:0:75:417:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not vary between the competitive and non-competitive treatments.

34:1224:85175:30:18:75:528:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we explore the effect of incentives and peer information on risk-taking in a
34:1225:85266:18:18:75:528:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complex forecasting task. In the field, excessive risk-taking is often attributed to compet-
34:1226:85358:18:18:75:528:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:itive incentivesper se. Our results suggest that the relationship between incentives and
34:1227:85446:18:18:75:528:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking is more nuanced and depends critically on both the availability and the nature
34:1228:85536:18:18:75:528:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of peer information to which decision-makers are exposed. Specifically, we observe that,
34:1229:85624:18:18:75:528:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the absence of peer information, subjects take less risk in a setting with competitive
34:1230:85713:18:18:75:528:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives than in a setting with non-competitive incentives. At the same time, in the
34:1231:85799:18:18:75:498:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presence of peer information, subjects take more risk under competitive incentives.
34:1232:85882:18:18:94:528:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our baseline finding that competitive incentives lead to less risk-taking without peer
34:1233:85968:18:18:75:528:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information is somewhat surprising and reinforces the notion that the basic prediction of
34:1234:86057:18:17:75:528:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tournament theory may be sensitive to many features of the environment, including the
34:1235:86142:17:18:75:528:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:type of task and available information. In our experimental setting, the more cautious
34:1236:86228:18:18:75:528:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior of subjects under competition without feedback may be attributed to the com-
34:1237:86313:18:18:75:528:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plexity of the environment, underconfidence, and the fear of being last in the three-level
34:1238:86403:18:18:75:528:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prize structure: Without knowing what their peers are doing, subjects may be undercon-
34:1239:86489:18:18:75:528:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fident when completing difficult tasks due to “reference group neglect” (Moore and Cain,
34:1240:86577:18:18:75:528:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2007) and, combined with the fear of being last (Dutcher et al.,2015), subjects may be
34:1241:86663:18:18:75:528:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more inclined to make low-risk choices.  This baseline result makes the positive effect
34:1242:86750:18:18:75:528:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of competitive incentives on risk taking in the presence of peer information even more
34:1243:86836:18:18:75:528:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:striking as it reverses the baseline predisposition of subjects to respond to competition
34:1244:86925:18:18:75:203:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cautiously in our setting.
34:1245:86951:18:18:94:528:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the presence of peer information, regardless of its type, mostsubjects observe that
34:1246:87037:18:18:74:527:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their strategies and/or outcomes are not that far off from their peers’. Peer information,
34:1247:87127:18:17:74:528:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, may reduce subjects’ underconfidence and their concerns about a last-place
34:1248:87212:17:18:74:527:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finish.  Overall, feedback about others may serve as a simple mechanism that restores
34:1249:87297:18:18:74:528:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“normal” attitudes to competition and, as a result, leads to more risk-taking under com-
34:1250:87385:18:18:74:169:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:petitive incentives.
34:1251:87405:18:18:94:527:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While the effect of incentives on risk-taking does not seem to dependsystematically on
34:1252:87491:18:18:74:528:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the type of peer information (as long as it is present), different types of information affect
34:1253:87585:18:18:74:528:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differently the levels of risk-taking keeping incentives fixed. Under individual incentives,
34:1254:87677:18:18:74:528:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects take less risk, as compared to the no-feedback baseline, when provided with
34:1255:87761:18:18:74:528:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information about peers’ strategies or outcomes separately, but not when provided with
34:1256:87847:18:18:74:528:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both. In the cases of information on strategies or outcomes only,subjects do not seem to
34:1257:87935:18:18:74:528:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be reacting to the content of the feedback in any imitative manner.In the case of feedback
34:1258:88025:18:0:74:528:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on strategies, they do not imitate the highest, lowest or median levels of risk-taking, nor
35:1259:88118:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do they converge to the mean. In the case of feedback on scores, subjects’ behavior is not
35:1260:88208:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affected by the distance to their group’s highest or lowest score. Both types of partial
35:1261:88296:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information are not particularly useful and may reaffirm subjects’impression that the
35:1262:88381:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:game is complex and noisy; in the case of non-competitive incentives,partial information
35:1263:88469:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces risk-taking. At the same time, when the combined feedback on peers’ strategies
35:1264:88555:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and scores is provided, subjects react correctly to the correlation between the observed
35:1265:88643:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking and scores and, as a result, do not reduce their risk-taking relative to the
35:1266:88731:18:18:75:163:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no-feedback case.
35:1267:88748:18:18:94:528:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Under competitive incentives, there is no effect of peer informationon risk-taking when
35:1268:88835:18:18:74:528:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only peers’ strategies are provided. However, in the case of feedback on peers’ outcomes
35:1269:88923:18:18:74:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subjects react to the payoff-relevant distances between their score and the scores of the top
35:1270:89016:18:18:74:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and bottom performers in their group. Risk-taking increases in either of the two distances
35:1271:89106:18:18:74:528:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:keeping all else fixed. At the same time, when combined information is provided, unlike
35:1272:89193:18:17:74:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the case of individual incentives, subjects do not react to the correlation between the
35:1273:89283:17:18:74:271:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategies and outcomes of their peers.
35:1274:89322:18:18:94:528:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In all treatments, subjects react positively to luck, defined as the difference between
35:1275:89409:18:18:74:528:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a subject’s score and the theoretically expected score given his orher strategy in the first
35:1276:89501:18:18:74:528:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:block. The effect of luck is asymmetric: If a subject takes a lot of risk and gets lucky,
35:1277:89590:18:18:74:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is little room to increase risk-taking further; if that same subject is unlucky, he
35:1278:89679:18:18:74:528:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or she can take substantially less risk. Similarly, if a subject takes very little risk and
35:1279:89770:18:18:74:528:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is unlucky, there is no room to reduce risk-taking; if the same subject is lucky, there is
35:1280:89860:18:18:74:528:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:room to take much more risk. Of course, the difference is that the variance of score is
35:1281:89947:18:18:74:528:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much higher for high levels of risk. That is, subjects are much more likely to be lucky or
35:1282:90037:18:18:74:528:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unlucky (and the amount of good or bad “luck,” as defined above, is likely to be larger) if
35:1283:90128:18:18:74:528:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they take more risk. Therefore, the effect of prior luck on risk-taking is driven primarily
35:1284:90219:18:18:74:408:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the reduction in risk taking by the unlucky high-risk subjects.
35:1285:90285:18:17:94:528:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Some insights into the effects of peer information can be gained by analyzing sub-
35:1286:90367:17:18:74:528:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jects’ responses to the open-ended questions at the end of theexperiment. Interestingly,
35:1287:90455:18:18:74:528:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a substantial number of subjects state that they changed behavior after observing their
35:1288:90542:18:18:74:528:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peers. As one would expect, the lowest number of such subjects isobserved in the case
35:1289:90627:18:18:74:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of feedback on strategies only, whereas the highest number is observed when the com-
35:1290:90711:18:18:74:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bined information is provided.  At the same time, almost no subjects claim that they
35:1291:90795:18:18:74:528:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imitate anyone in particular. Taken along with the empirical results, subjects’ written
35:1292:90882:18:18:74:528:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responses suggest that peer information is interpreted in an aggregate, inferential manner,
35:1293:90973:18:18:74:286:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as opposed to a tool for simple imitation.
35:1294:91015:18:0:94:528:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We conclude that although incentives can be a powerful driver of risk-taking behavior,
36:1295:91103:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peer information is also important—it is the interaction of the two that leads to the highest
36:1296:91196:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:levels of risk-taking in our environment. More broadly, our results suggest that excessive
36:1297:91286:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk-taking in, for example, the financial sector may be the combined result of incentives,
36:1298:91377:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:culture, norms, and the feedback received by the decision-makers.  The nature of the
36:1299:91461:18:18:75:528:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information clearly matters, as it shapes decision-makers’ understanding of the sources
36:1300:91548:18:18:75:528:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of success in a noisy environment.  Of course, selection may distortthe availability of
36:1301:91635:18:18:75:528:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information in the field and spur increased risk-taking. In many settings, success stories
36:1302:91725:18:18:75:528:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are more likely to be propagated; in high-variance environments in which success has a
36:1303:91811:18:45:75:451:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large random component, this selection may lead to excessive risk-taking.

40:1438:100666:41:30:231:372:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:Instructions for Part 1b
40:1439:100690:30:18:75:528:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this task, your decision will generate a set of 20 choices betweena lottery that will be
40:1440:100781:18:17:75:528:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:referred to as “Urn B” and sure amounts of money. After you have made your decision,
40:1441:100865:17:0:75:378:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one of the 20 choices will be selected randomly and played.
41:1442:100926:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:F:Urn B contains 20 balls that are either green or red. The exactnumbers of
41:1443:100999:18:30:75:312:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:green and red balls are unknown to you.
41:1444:101038:30:18:75:528:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:If your preference in the choice that turns out to be actually played is Urn B, earnings
41:1445:101126:18:18:75:528:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will depend on your guess about the color of a ball randomly drawn from Urn B. If you
41:1446:101211:18:18:75:528:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:guess the color correctly, you will earn $2.00. If you guess the color incorrectly, you will
41:1447:101303:18:30:75:125:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earn zero.
41:1448:101313:30:18:75:528:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:If your preference in the choice that turns out to be actually played is a sure amount of
41:1449:101402:18:30:75:302:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:money, you will earn that amount of money.
41:1450:101444:30:18:75:528:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:On the screen, you can see all the 20 choices. This is practice screen, and all buttons are
41:1451:101535:18:18:75:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:now inactive. Urn B is on the left, and the sure amounts of money ranging from $0.10 to
41:1452:101622:18:18:75:527:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:$2.00 are on the right. Notice that the sure amounts increase fromtop to bottom. Thus,
41:1453:101708:18:17:75:528:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:you should only decide on a line where you would like to SWITCH from preferring Urn
41:1454:101791:17:30:75:232:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:B to preferring a sure amount.
41:1455:101821:30:18:75:528:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:When you click on the corresponding SWITCH HERE button, Urn B will be your choice
41:1456:101902:18:18:75:527:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:everywhere above that line, and a sure amount of money will be yourchoice everywhere
41:1457:101986:18:18:75:529:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below that line. All the 20 choices that you generate will be highlighted. If you want to

41:1462:102363:30:43:75:408:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Are there any questions before you begin making your decisions?
41:1463:102426:43:31:235:368:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:Instructions for Part 2
41:1464:102449:31:29:75:140:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The scenario
41:1465:102461:29:18:75:528:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Imagine that you are a financial analyst hired by an investment company to make pro-
41:1466:102545:18:18:75:528:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jections about the future performance of particular stocks. Your job is to assess whether
41:1467:102634:18:18:75:528:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a company’s stock price next year will be HIGHER or LOWER than the current price.
41:1468:102715:18:18:75:528:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:You are assigned one project at a time and are paid based on the volume and accuracy
41:1469:102799:18:18:75:528:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of your forecasts – your employer rewards you for correct forecasts and punishes you for
41:1470:102887:18:0:75:171:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incorrect forecasts.
42:1471:102909:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:You make your forecasts based on information that you can gather about the companies
42:1472:102993:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in question. Each piece of information provides a signal about the true direction of the
42:1473:103081:18:18:75:528:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stock price, suggesting that it is either going to be higher or lower next year. No single
42:1474:103171:18:18:75:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:signal tells the full story; however, the more signals you observe the more confident you
42:1475:103260:18:29:75:392:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be about whether the stock price will be higher or lower.
42:1476:103321:29:18:75:528:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Recall that you are paid based on thevolumeand theaccuracyof your forecasts. The
42:1477:103401:18:18:75:528:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:challenge that you face is that gathering lots of information can improve the accuracy of
42:1478:103490:18:18:75:528:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:your forecasts, but means that you cannot do many assessments. Making forecasts with
42:1479:103574:18:18:75:528:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a small amount of information means that you can complete many projects, but these
42:1480:103656:18:29:75:273:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assessments may not be very accurate.
42:1481:103693:29:30:75:171:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Decision sequences
42:1482:103711:30:18:75:528:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This part of the experiment will consist of several decision sequences. At the end of the
42:1483:103800:18:18:75:528:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiment, one of the sequences will be randomly chosen and youractual earnings will
42:1484:103885:18:29:75:213:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be based on that sequence.
42:1485:103911:29:29:75:131:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Sequence 1
42:1486:103921:29:18:75:99:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:Task
42:1487:103925:18:18:75:528:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:On the screen, you will be presented with 15 blank cards. Each card, when flipped over,
42:1488:104012:18:18:75:529:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is either GREEN or RED. The color of the card was determined randomly, and each of
42:1489:104094:18:29:75:232:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the two colors is equally likely.
42:1490:104127:29:18:75:528:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Your task is to predict themajority colorof the 15 cards (hidden and revealed).  At
42:1491:104210:18:18:74:528:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:least 8 of the 15 cards are going to be of one color, GREEN or RED. If8 or more cards
42:1492:104295:18:18:74:528:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are GREEN, then the majority color is GREEN; if 8 or more cards are RED, then the
42:1493:104376:18:29:74:191:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:majority color is RED.
42:1494:104398:29:18:74:528:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:At the bottom of the screen, you can submit your forecast of whether the majority of the
42:1495:104486:18:29:74:345:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:15 cards (hidden and revealed) are GREEN or RED.
42:1496:104534:29:18:74:528:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Before you make a forecast about the majority color, you should choose how many cards,
42:1497:104620:18:18:74:528:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:between 5 and 15, you want to flip to reveal their color. After you make a forecast,all
42:1498:104707:18:18:75:528:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cards will be revealed and you will be informed whether your forecast was correct or not.
42:1499:104796:18:30:75:265:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:You will then be given the next task.
42:1500:104833:30:17:75:528:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this sequence, you will be allowed to flip atotal of 100 cards. How many cards you
42:1501:104918:17:0:75:528:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flip before each forecast is up to you. The counter in the upper part of the screen will tell
43:1502:105013:0:18:75:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:you how many cards you have left to flip in this sequence. It starts with 100 cards and
43:1503:105100:18:18:75:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:counts down. New tasks will be generated randomly until the counter of 100 cards runs
43:1504:105185:18:30:75:95:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out.
43:1505:105189:30:18:75:528:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Note that you should reveal 5 or more cards for each forecast. Towards the end of the
43:1506:105274:18:18:75:528:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sequence when you nearly exhaust all of your 100 cards, you will not be allowed to reveal
43:1507:105363:18:29:75:453:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a number of cards such that the remaining number of cards is less than 5.
43:1508:105436:29:18:75:528:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:At the end of the sequence, you will be provided with a summary of your decisions and
43:1509:105521:18:30:75:122:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forecasts.
43:1510:105531:30:18:75:159:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:Score and payoff
43:1511:105547:18:18:75:528:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Your performance score in this sequence will be based on the net number of correct
43:1512:105629:18:30:75:265:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:majority color forecasts calculated as
43:1513:105667:30:29:75:429:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Score = (# of correct forecasts) - (# of incorrect forecasts).
43:1514:105729:29:18:75:528:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For example, if you make 3 correct forecasts and 1 incorrect forecast, your score would
43:1515:105816:18:30:75:142:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be 3−1 = 2.
43:1516:105827:30:18:75:528:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Your payoff from this sequence isyour score times $1.50. Recall that there will be
43:1517:105909:18:18:74:528:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:several sequences, and only one of them will be chosen at the end of the experiment for
43:1518:105996:18:29:74:181:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:your actual earnings.
43:1519:106017:29:30:74:290:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Are there any questions before you begin?
43:1520:106058:30:18:74:528:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:You will now start the actual decision rounds. Please do not communicate with other
