2:16:449:16:16:108:543:624:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The present study is an attempt to measure the impact of climate change on production of 
2:17:538:16:16:72:542:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agriculture  in  Haryana  over  the  period 2000-2012.  Climate  Change  in  India among  others 
2:18:634:16:16:72:543:592:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:manifests  itself  in temperature  increases,  rainfall  reduction in  the  arid  plains,  production 
2:19:736:16:16:72:543:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reduction and  increases  in  the  monsoon  areas  and accelerates the glacial  melt. The  impact  of 
2:20:835:16:15:72:542:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:climate change is studied in many aspects in different locations in the country and it was found 
2:21:932:15:16:72:543:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  there  is  high  impact  of  climate  change  on  agriculture  as  compared  to  any  other  sector.  A 
2:22:1042:16:16:72:543:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study  revealed  that  the  climatic  variation  such  as  occurrences  of  drought  have  high  level  of 
2:23:1149:16:16:72:542:513:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact on the yield of rain fed crops. About the Haryana, A study project that with short periods 
2:24:1247:16:16:72:543:497:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of exposure of wheat crops to temperatures of 28ºC to 32ºC result in significant decrease in yield 
2:25:1346:16:16:72:543:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  20%  or  more unpredictable  moisture  deficits  during crop  growth  are  a  major  constraint  to 
2:26:1447:16:16:72:542:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:productivity (HSAPCC, 2011). Further, a study claims that climate change will reduce the major 
2:27:1541:16:16:72:542:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crop yields by 4.5 to 9 percent over the period 2010-2039. Therefore, changing climatic variables 
2:28:1638:16:15:72:543:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have reduced and are reducing the agricultural productivity and thus posing a threat to long term 
2:29:1736:15:16:72:542:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:food security. This motivates to study the impact of climate change on the agriculture production 
2:30:1833:16:16:72:543:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  Haryana.  For  the  purpose,  the  data  of  wheat  production  has  been  regressed  with  the  average 
2:31:1942:16:16:72:543:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:annual rainfall and average temperature in Haryana over the period of 2000-2012. The findings 
2:32:2036:16:16:72:543:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the study reveal that there is a significant impact of climate change on agricultural production 
2:33:2136:16:16:72:130:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in Haryana.

2:51:2408:16:0:72:156:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Introduction: 
3:52:2424:0:16:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:          Climate  change  is  one  of  the  most  important  global  environmental  challenges  facing 
3:53:2527:16:16:72:543:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:humanity  with  implications  for  food  production,  natural  ecosystems,  freshwater  supply,  health, 
3:54:2632:16:16:72:543:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:etc.  Climate  is the  main  determinants  of  agricultural  production.  Throughout  the  world  there  is 
3:55:2739:16:16:72:542:661:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant concern  about  the  effects  of  climate  change  and  its  variability  on  agricultural 
3:56:2841:16:16:72:542:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production.  Researchers  and  administrators  are  concerned  with  the  potential  damages and 
3:57:2937:16:16:72:543:629:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:benefits  that  may  arise  in  future  from  climate  change  impacts  on  agriculture,  since  these  will 
3:58:3046:16:16:72:543:613:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:affect  domestic  and  international  policies,  trading  pattern,  resource  use  and  food  security.  The 
3:59:3155:16:15:72:543:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Climate  change  is  any  change  in  climate  over  time  that  is  attributed  directly  or  indirectly  to 
3:60:3265:15:16:72:543:582:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere in addition to natural climate 
3:61:3364:16:16:72:543:566:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variability  observed  over  comparable  time  periods (IPCC,  2007).Since  climatic  factors  serve  as 
3:62:3468:16:16:72:543:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:direct inputs to agriculture, any change in climatic factors is bound to have a significant impact 
3:63:3567:16:16:72:543:534:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on  crop  yields  and  production.  Climate  change  scenarios  include  higher  temperatures,  changes 
3:64:3671:16:16:72:542:518:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in precipitation, and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. There are three ways in which the 
3:65:3766:16:16:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Greenhouse   Effect   may   be   important   for   agriculture.   First,   increased   atmospheric   CO2 
3:66:3871:16:16:72:543:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concentrations  can  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  growth  rate  of  crop  plants  and  weeds.  Secondly, 
3:67:3981:16:15:72:542:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CO2-induced  changes of climate may  alter levels of temperature, rainfall  and sunshine that can 
3:68:4079:15:16:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:influence  plant  and  animal  productivity.  Finally,  rises  in  sea  level  may  lead  to  loss  of  farmland 
3:69:4192:16:16:72:411:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by inundation and increasing salinity of groundwater in coastal areas.  
3:70:4263:16:16:108:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:The  greenhouse  effect  is  a  natural  process  that  plays  a  major part in shaping the earth’s 
3:71:4362:16:16:72:543:407:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:climate.  It  produces  the  relatively  warm  and  hospitable  environment  near  the  earth’s  surface 
3:72:4467:16:16:72:542:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:where  humans  and  other  life-forms  have  been  able  to  develop  and  prosper.  However,  the 
3:73:4566:16:16:72:542:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increased  level  of  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  (carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  water  vapor  (H2O), 
3:74:4662:16:15:72:543:359:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:methane  (CH4),  nitrous  oxide  (N2O),  hydro  fluorocarbons  (HFCs),  per  fluorocarbons  (PFCs), 
3:75:4762:15:16:72:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) etc.) due to anthropogenic activities has contributed to an overall 
3:76:4860:16:16:72:543:328:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:increase of the earth’s  temperature,  leading  to  a  global  warming.  The  average  global  surface 
3:77:4963:16:16:72:543:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:temperature  have  increased  by  0.74  o  C  since  the  late  19th  Century  and  is  expected  to  increase 
3:78:5074:16:16:72:542:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  1.4  o  C - 5.8  o  C  by  2100  AD  with  significant  regional  variations  (IPCC,  2007).  The 
3:79:5175:16:16:72:542:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:atmospheric CO2  concentration  has  increased  from  280  ppm  to  395  ppm,  CH4  concentration 
3:80:5273:16:16:72:543:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increased from 715 ppb to 1882 ppb and N2O concentration from 227 ppb to 323 ppb from the 
3:81:5363:16:16:72:543:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:year  1750  and  2012.  The  Global  Warming  Potential  (GWP)  of  these  gases  i.e.,  CO2,  CH4  and 
3:82:5467:16:15:72:542:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:N2O  are  1,  25  and  310  respectively.  Projected  scenarios  of  global  warming  indicate  that  the 
3:83:5573:15:16:72:543:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:global  average  surface  temperature  could  rise  by  1.4  to  5.8°C  by  2100.  The  projected  rate  of 
3:84:5681:16:16:72:322:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:warming is unprecedented during last 10,000 years. 
3:85:5731:16:16:108:542:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The climate of Haryana is very hot in summer and cold in winters. The hottest months are 
3:86:5819:16:20:72:543:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:May and June and the coldest being December and January.  Haryana is very hot in summer and

3:100:6195:16:15:72:543:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:climatic  zones.  The  north  western  part  is  suitable  for  Rice,  Wheat,  Vegetable  and  temperate 
3:101:6300:15:0:72:543:78:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fruits and the south western part are suitable for high quality agricultural produce, tropical fruits, 
4:102:6403:0:16:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exotic  vegetables  and  herbal  and  medicinal  plants.  Major  land  use  in  Haryana  is  agriculture 
4:103:6508:16:16:72:542:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(85%),  Forest  (2.4  %),  about  7.2  %  fallow  and  5%  waste  land.  Agriculture  contributes  17%  of 
4:104:6615:16:16:72:543:677:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the state’s GDP and employs 65% of the total workforce. The net sown area is 85% of the total 
4:105:6709:16:16:72:543:661:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:geographic  area  as  compared  to  the  national  average  of  46%,  the  gross  cropped  area  is  65  lakh 
4:106:6819:16:16:72:543:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ha with a cropping intensity of 180%. The long term analysis for trends in observed temperature

4:108:7014:16:16:72:542:613:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant  trend  in  the  mean  maximum  temperature  and  minimum  temperature  shows  an 
4:109:7108:16:15:72:543:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increase of about 1.00C to 1.20C. Haryana emits nearly 2% of national greenhouse gases (GHG). 
4:110:7202:15:16:72:543:582:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Agriculture  sector  contributes  about  82%  and  91%  of  CH4  and  N2O  emissions  of  the  state. 
4:111:7304:16:16:72:543:566:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Majority of CH4 emissions occur from enteric fermentation of livestock (62%) followed by rice

4:128:8796:16:16:72:543:286:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conditions  may  deteriorate  in  terms  of  severity  of  droughts  in  some  parts  of  the  country  and 
4:129:8904:16:16:72:543:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enhanced  intensity  of  floods  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  However,  there  is  a  general  overall 
4:130:9015:16:16:72:540:254:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reduction  in  the  quantity  of  the  available  runoff  under  the  GHG  scenario.  Luni  with  the  west-

4:134:9418:16:16:72:543:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:         Raymond Guiteras (2007) analyzed the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture. The 
4:135:9515:16:16:72:542:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study analysed the impact of change in weather on agriculture output in 200 Indian districts. He 
4:136:9612:16:16:72:543:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found that climate change over the period 2010 to 2039 reduce major crop productivity from 4.5 
4:137:9707:16:16:72:543:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent to 9 percent whereas the long run (2070 to 2099) impact is reducing yield by 25 percent 
4:138:9803:16:16:72:542:127:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more  when  there  is  not  any  long  run  adaptation  the  negative impact  on  climate  change  on 
4:139:9904:16:15:72:543:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agriculture  also  have  impact  on  poverty.  He  suggested  that  climate  change  impose  significant 
4:140:10009:15:16:72:543:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cost on Indian agriculture and it can be reduced only when there is quick and appropriate strategy 
4:141:10108:16:0:72:250:80:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:use with the increase in temperature.

5:144:10333:16:16:72:542:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production  and  price.  The  study  reviewed  that  by  2080,  agriculture  output in  developing 
5:145:10432:16:16:72:543:661:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries may decline by 20 percent due to climate change, while output in industrial countries is 
5:146:10531:16:16:72:543:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expected to decrease 6 percent and  yields in developing countries is expected to decrease by 15 
5:147:10628:16:16:72:542:629:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent  on  an  average.  The  climate  is  a  primary determinant  of  agriculture  productivity.  The

5:171:12558:16:16:72:542:248:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:of earth’s atmosphere. The Haryana state also falls within the area of greatest climate sensitivity. 
5:172:12659:16:15:72:543:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  an  era  of  climate  change,  Haryana  is  likely  to  suffer  further  water  shortage  due  to  overall 
5:173:12770:15:16:72:543:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reduction in rainfall. Haryana has limited rainfall ranging from 300 mm in the southwest to 1,100 
5:174:12867:16:16:72:542:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mm in the northeast in the state. The state lies in the basins of the Indus and the Yamuna Rivers 
5:175:12965:16:16:72:543:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and receives water from Sutlej and Yamuna Rivers and its share from the surplus water of rivers 
5:176:13061:16:16:72:543:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ravi and Beas, as per various inter-state agreements.  There are no perennial rivers in Haryana; 
5:177:13158:16:16:72:543:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ghaggar  is  the  only  seasonal  river,  which  flows  through  the  northern  fringes  of  the  state.  The 
5:178:13268:16:16:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ghaggar  rises  in  the  outer  Himalayas,  between  the  Yamuna  and  the  Sutlej  and  enters  Haryana

8:295:15742:26:16:108:543:637:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Wheat is the most important food grain in the world that rank second in total production 
8:296:15831:16:16:72:543:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:as a cereal crop, behind maize and ahead of rice. Wheat is the staple food of millions of people. 
8:297:15929:16:16:72:542:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Despite recent industrial development, Haryana is primarily an agricultural state. About 70% of 
8:298:16025:16:16:72:540:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:residents  are  engaged  in  agriculture.  Wheat  and  rice  are  the  major  crops.  Haryana  is  self-
8:299:16129:16:15:72:542:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sufficient  in  food  production  and  the  second  largest  contributor  to  India's  central  pool  of  food 
8:300:16240:15:16:72:543:558:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:grains. The  main  crops  of  Haryana  are  wheat,  rice,  sugarcane,  cotton,  oilseeds,  gram,  barley, 
8:301:16345:16:16:72:542:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corn, millet etc. About 86% of the area is arable, and of that 96% is cultivated. About 75% of the 
8:302:16444:16:16:72:542:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:area  is  irrigated,  through tube  wells and  an  extensive  system  of canals.  Haryana  contributed 
8:303:16544:16:16:72:542:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significantly to the Green Revolution in  India in  the 1970s that made the  country  self-sufficient

10:377:17809:25:16:72:543:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:     The global warming effects have not even kept Haryana untouched. The earlier chapters have 
10:378:17905:16:16:72:543:562:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shown  that  the  temperature  and  rainfall  has  changed  during  past  few  decades.  The  variation  in 
10:379:18013:16:16:72:543:546:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Maximum  and  Minimum  temperature  has  increased  and  the  number  of  rainy  days  has  also 
10:380:18110:16:16:72:543:530:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decreased.  Agriculture  is  the  only  sector  which  is  highly  influenced  by  the  changing  climatic 
10:381:18217:16:16:72:543:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conditions. Multiple regression models find to what extent climatic changes have affected wheat

10:407:18990:16:0:72:543:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agricultural  production  of  Haryana  from  the  year  2000-2012 in  which Wheat  production  is 
11:408:19087:0:16:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regressed on temperature and rainfall. It is assumed that the climate variation measure in term of 
11:409:19185:16:16:72:543:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Variation  in  rainfall  and  temperature  have  an  impact  on  wheat  production  over  the  period  of 
11:410:19291:16:16:72:543:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time. The  result  of  model  reveals that  the climate  change  (increase  in  Temp  and  Decrease  in 
11:411:19393:16:16:72:543:661:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Rainfall) has a negative impact on agricultural production of Haryana. The model does not show 
11:412:19486:16:16:72:543:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:any significant impact of temperature on the wheat production of Haryana. This is because that 
11:413:19581:16:16:72:543:629:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  wheat  production  is  cultivated  in  winters  and  in  winters  the  temperature  is  below  the 10ºC 
11:414:19690:16:16:72:543:613:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  will  not  affect  the  production  of  wheat  in  Haryana.  On  the  other  hand  the  rainfall have 
11:415:19798:16:15:72:543:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant impact on wheat production, the results of model show if there is 1 percent decrease 
11:416:19894:15:16:72:350:582:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in rainfall will lead -1.25 percent decrease in production.

11:419:19984:16:16:72:75:534:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
11:420:19984:16:16:108:543:518:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As discuss earlier, the  climate  change  is  adversely  impacting  the  Haryana agriculture 
11:421:20075:16:16:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which is mainly depend on rainfall. Due to change in climate there is increase in Maximum and 
11:422:20169:16:16:72:543:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Minimum temperature, the length period of every season is also change and large uncertainties in 
11:423:20266:16:15:72:543:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rainfall  period  and  frequency  of rainfall,  heavy  rainfall  on  inappropriate  time  period  for 
11:424:20367:15:16:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agriculture and lack of rainfall when there is need of rainfall in agriculture, increasing frequency 
11:425:20468:16:16:72:150:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of droughts etc. 
11:426:20484:16:16:72:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:But  there  is  not  any  separate  policy  and  agenda  for  sustainable  development  of  agriculture.  To 
11:427:20593:16:16:72:542:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:overcome  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  agriculture  some  suggestion  are  introduce.  The  all 
11:428:20698:16:16:72:543:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suggestion is dividing into two categories Adaption and Mitigation. All Adaption and Mitigation 
11:429:20794:16:16:72:247:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for climate change are as following. 
11:430:20830:16:15:72:542:359:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Crop insurance for climate variability is necessary for overcome the loss of climate change on 
11:431:20927:15:16:88:146:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agriculture. 
11:432:20939:16:16:72:542:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2. Use  of  new  varsities  and  certified  seeds  that  cannot  very  much  affected  by  the  change  in 
11:433:21045:16:16:88:169:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:climate change.  
11:434:21061:16:16:72:543:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3. Early warning should give to the farmers so that they can use the other and alternative way to 
11:435:21158:16:16:88:289:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:protect him from these types of changes.  
11:436:21199:16:16:72:542:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:4. More   emphasizes   on   those   crops   which   are   not   much   climatic   sensitive   and   crop 
11:437:21303:16:16:88:437:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:diversification should be adopted for take the solutions of this problem.  
11:438:21377:16:15:72:543:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5. Insures farmers against climate related weather changes. Water conservation and increase in 
11:439:21471:15:16:88:207:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:efficiency of water use.  
11:440:21496:16:16:72:542:201:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:6. Agriculture sector is also contributes(about 14 percent of annual GHG’s emission) to climate 
11:441:21591:16:16:88:543:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change (Agriculture is an important source of two powerful GHGs: nitrous oxide (N2O) and 
11:442:21679:16:16:88:542:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:methane (CH4) so there is need to reduce the impact of agriculture on climate like less use of 
11:443:21774:16:16:88:304:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fertilizer, adaptation of organic farming etc.

11:446:21821:16:15:72:543:105:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  the  scientific  consensus  that  significant  climate  change,  in  particular  increased  temperatures 
11:447:21930:15:0:72:542:90:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and decrease in  rainfall,  is  very  likely  to  occur  during  the  21st  century  gathers  momentum, 
12:448:22033:0:16:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic  research  has  attempted  to  quantify  the  possible  implications  of  climate  change  on 
12:449:22136:16:16:72:542:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:society  and  agriculture.  The  vulnerability  to  climate  change  may  be  greater  in  developing 
12:450:22238:16:16:72:542:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries such as India, where agriculture typically plays a larger economic role. The study notes 
12:451:22336:16:16:72:543:661:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  the  impact  of  climate  change  will  vary  across  crops,  regions  and  climate  change  scenarios. 
12:452:22446:16:16:72:543:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The evidences indicate a decrease in production of crops in Haryana with a decrease in Rainfall. 
12:453:22542:16:16:72:543:629:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our  study  finds  that  climate  change  is  likely  to  reduce  agricultural  yields  significantly  and  the 
12:454:22654:16:16:72:543:613:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:damage could be severe unless the adaptation to higher temperatures is rapid and complete. The 
12:455:22749:16:15:72:542:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study  suggests  that  as the  impact  of  climate  change  is  intensifying  day  by  day  it  should be 
12:456:22854:15:16:72:542:582:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:addressed through policy perspective at the earliest to avoid short term effect such  as  yield  and 
12:457:22955:16:16:72:542:566:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income  loss  and long-term  effects  such  as  quitting  agricultural  profession  by  the  Rain  fed
