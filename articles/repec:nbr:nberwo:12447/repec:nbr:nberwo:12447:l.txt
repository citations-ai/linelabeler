2:39:2716:29:42:273:338:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:F:ABSTRACT
2:40:2724:42:14:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Employer matching of employee 401(k) contributions can provide a powerful incentive to save for
2:41:2819:14:15:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:retirement  and  is  a  key  component  in  pension-plan  design  in  the  United  States.    Using  detailed
2:42:2928:15:14:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:administrative contribution, earnings, and pension-plan data from the Health and Retirement Study,
2:43:3026:14:14:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:this  analysis  formulates  a  life-cycle-consistent  econometric  specification  of  401(k)  saving  and
2:44:3131:14:14:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:estimates  the  determinants  of  saving  accounting  for  non-linearities  in  the  household  budget  set
2:45:3238:14:14:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:induced by matching.  The participation estimates indicate that an increase in the match rate by 25
2:46:3337:14:14:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:cents per dollar of employee contribution raises 401(k) participation by 3.75 to 6 percentage points,
2:47:3438:14:15:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and the estimated elasticity of participation with respect to matching ranges from 0.02-0.07.  The
2:48:3536:15:14:71:539:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:parametric and semi-parametric estimates for saving indicate that an increase in the match rate by
2:49:3634:14:14:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:25 cents per dollar of employee contribution raises 401(k) saving by $400-$700 (in 1991 dollars).
2:50:3731:14:14:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:The  estimated  elasticity  of  401(k)  saving  to  matching  is  also  small  and  ranges  from  0.09-0.12
2:51:3838:14:14:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:overall, with just under half of this effect on the intensive margin.  Overall, the analysis reveals that
2:52:3943:14:43:71:462:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:matching is a rather poor policy instrument with which to raise retirement saving.

3:62:4174:28:27:126:526:669:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As  401(k)s  have  come  to  dominate  the  private  pension  landscape  in  the  United  
3:63:4264:27:28:90:525:642:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:States, researchers and policy makers have given increased attention to the impact of plan 
3:64:4355:28:27:90:525:614:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics  on  retirement-saving  decisions.1    One  important  characteristic  is  whether  
3:65:4455:27:28:90:525:587:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and to what extent the employer matches employee contributions.  A typical match might 
3:66:4542:28:28:90:526:559:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be  50  cents  for  each  dollar  of  contribution,  up  to  a  maximum  percentage  of  pay,  say,  6  
3:67:4646:28:27:90:527:531:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent.    Although  much  of  the  discussion  by  the  popular  press  and  policy  makers  
3:68:4741:27:28:90:526:504:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presumes  employer  matching  raises  saving,  there  is  actually  strikingly  little  consensus  
3:69:4840:28:27:89:525:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:among researchers.  Some studies have found that increases in the match rate raise 401(k) 
3:70:4930:27:28:89:526:449:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:saving  (Papke  and  Poterba,  1995;  Clark  and  Schieber,  1998;  VanDerhei  and  Copeland,  
3:71:5025:28:28:89:525:421:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2001; and Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick, 2002).  Others have found that it is not 
3:72:5113:28:27:89:526:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  match  rate  per  se  that  matters,  but  whether  the  firm  offers  a  match  at  all  (Even  and

3:74:5306:28:27:89:526:338:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and  Wilcox,  1998).    That  is,  providing  a  match  raises  401(k)  saving,  but  an  increase  in  
3:75:5410:27:28:89:526:311:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  level  of  the  match  rate  (conditional  on  providing  a  match)  does  not.    Finally,  still  
3:76:5515:28:28:89:527:283:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other  studies  (Employee  Benefit  Research  Institute,  1994;  Andrews,  1992;  Munnell,  
3:77:5607:28:27:89:526:255:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Sunden,  and  Taylor,  1998;  and  GAO,  1997)  have  suggested  that,  conditional  on  being  
3:78:5703:27:28:89:526:228:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:eligible  for  a  match,  an  increase  in  the  match  rate  lowers  401(k)  contributions,  which,  
3:79:5805:28:27:89:525:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when interpreted in the context of a simple two-period model of saving, suggests that the 
3:80:5895:27:53:89:526:173:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income  effect  dominates  the  substitution  effect  from  the  higher  rate  of  return  matching

3:82:6044:7:16:90:526:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1  This  includes  work  on  automatic  enrollment  (Madrian  and  Shea,  2001;  Choi,  Laibson,  Madrian,  and

4:86:6398:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provides.2    Overall,  this  ambiguity  has  emerged  as  an  important  empirical  puzzle  in  the  
4:87:6500:27:28:89:327:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature on saving behavior (Bernheim, 2003).   
4:88:6550:28:27:125:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A central shortcoming in this literature has been the failure to exploit the fact that 
4:89:6637:27:28:89:528:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  matching,  based  either  on  multiple-match-rate  schedules  or  caps  on  the  
4:90:6728:28:28:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:generosity  of  the  match,  results  in  a  non-linear household budget set.  As has been long 
4:91:6824:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recognized in the study of taxation on labor supply, reduced-form estimates of behavioral 
4:92:6914:27:28:90:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities are biased and inconsistent unless the non-linearity is accounted for explicitly 
4:93:7008:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Hausman, 1985; Moffitt, 1990; Blundell and MaCurdy, 1999).  Indeed, the presence of 
4:94:7093:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:budget-set kinks may reconcile some of the findings of previous studies: for example, the 
4:95:7183:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provision  of  a  match  may  raise  401(k)  saving  if  the  substitution  effect  dominates,  but  
4:96:7284:28:27:90:454:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variation in match rates may not matter if employees are bunched at kinks.  
4:97:7360:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Unlike previous studies, this paper includes a detailed theoretical framework that 
4:98:7443:28:27:90:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:models  the  budget  set  defined  by  employer  matching  and  federal  tax  treatment  as  twice  
4:99:7543:27:28:90:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:continuously  differentiable  and  then  uses  the  first-order  conditions  from  the  consumer’s

5:119:9284:28:27:90:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:  Empirically,  the  paper  makes  four  additional  contributions.    First,  to  circumvent  
5:120:9379:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:difficulties with measurement error in 401(k) contributions and matching incentives that 
5:121:9468:28:28:90:529:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have   plagued   previous   studies,   administrative   data   from   three   sources   are   used:   
5:122:9570:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions from W-2 earnings records provided by the Social Security Administration 
5:123:9657:27:28:90:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(SSA)  and  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS);    detailed  matching  formulas  from  pension

5:125:9835:27:28:90:530:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Study   (HRS)   respondents;   and,   a   combination   of   Social-Security-covered-earnings   
5:126:9931:28:27:90:521:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:histories  for  1951-1991  and  W-2  earnings  for  1980-1991,  pension  SPDs,  and  pension-
5:127:10024:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit calculators to construct public and private pension entitlements and accruals.  The 
5:128:10116:28:28:90:531:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample  consists  of  1,042  individuals  in  1991  eligible  for  401(k)  plans  in  the  HRS.    
5:129:10215:28:27:90:527:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second,  the  analysis  includes  a  calculation  of  the  dollar  amount  of  unused  employer  
5:130:10312:27:28:90:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:matching  contributions  due  to  workers’  failure  to  contribute  at  least  until  the  point  at  
5:131:10415:28:27:90:522:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which   the   employer   match   is   exhausted.      Most   of   this   occurs   because   of   non-
5:132:10516:27:28:89:528:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation.    For  non-participants,  the  unclaimed  employer  match  represented  3.7  
5:133:10609:28:28:89:525:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of pay.  However, even participants left “money on the table” equal to 1 percent 
5:134:10698:28:0:90:525:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of pay in unclaimed employer match.  Based on measures of liquidity constraints used by 
6:135:10787:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:others  in  the  literature,  reduced-form  evidence  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  presence  of  
6:136:10889:27:28:90:528:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity  constraints  as  a  potential  explanation  for  this  phenomenon.    Third,  unlike  
6:137:10986:28:27:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:previous pension studies that have used the employer-provided SPDs in the HRS, which 
6:138:11071:27:28:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are available only for a non-random sub-sample of HRS respondents, the estimation uses 
6:139:11158:28:28:90:527:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:methods  laid  out  in  Vella  (1992)  and  Das,  Newey,  and  Vella  (2003)  to  correct  for  
6:140:11254:28:27:90:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:potential  sample  selection  using  a  set  of  plausible  exclusion  restrictions  derived  from  
6:141:11354:27:28:90:527:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  Form  5500  administrative  pension-plan  filings.    The  
6:142:11448:28:27:90:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exclusions  have  substantial  predictive  power  for  determining  who  is  in  the  analysis  
6:143:11544:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample.  There is statistically significant evidence of selection, but the economic impact 
6:144:11635:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  selection  on  the  estimates  is  mixed:  the  bias  is  small  in  the  censored  regression  
6:145:11740:28:27:90:530:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specifications  of  saving,  but  larger  in  the  discrete  choice  participation  specifications.    
6:146:11843:27:28:90:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Finally,  there  is  substantial  evidence  of  the  bunching  of  401(k)  contributions  around  
6:147:11941:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:budget-set kink points induced by employer matching: about 25 percent of match-eligible 
6:148:12029:27:28:90:264:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals are bunched at the kink. 
6:149:12066:28:27:90:533:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:    The    estimates    from    the    life-cycle-consistent    discrete    choice    regression    
6:150:12166:27:28:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specifications  for  participation  indicate  that  the  estimated  marginal  effect  of  an  increase  
6:151:12270:28:28:90:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the employer match rate by 25 cents per dollar of employee contribution raises 401(k) 
6:152:12359:28:27:90:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation by 3.75 to 6 percentage points.  When the estimates are expressed in terms 
6:153:12448:27:28:90:525:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of elasticities, the results suggest that the impact of the match rate on 401(k) participation 
6:154:12543:28:27:90:524:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is quite inelastic: the estimated elasticity of 401(k) participation with respect to the match 
6:155:12638:27:28:89:526:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate  ranges  from  0.02-0.07.    In  addition,  the  parametric  and  semi-parametric  estimates  
6:156:12737:28:28:89:525:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from the two-limit censored regression specifications indicate that the estimated marginal 
6:157:12828:28:0:89:527:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect  of  an  increase  in  the  employer  match  rate  by  25  cents  per  dollar  of  employee  
7:158:12929:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribution  raises  401(k)  contributions  by  $400-$700  dollars  (in  constant  calendar  year  
7:159:13029:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1991 dollars).  Comparing the Tobit and SCLS estimates using the Hausman-type test in 
7:160:13115:28:27:90:527:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Newey  (1987a),  the  validity  of  the  Tobit  model  cannot  be  rejected.    When  the  Tobit  
7:161:13213:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates are expressed in terms of elasticities, the results suggest that the impact of the 
7:162:13306:28:28:90:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match  rate  on  401(k)  saving  is  quite  inelastic:  the  estimated  elasticity  of  401(k)  saving  
7:163:13410:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with respect to the match rate ranges from 0.09-0.12 overall, with just under one half of 
7:164:13500:27:28:90:479:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this effect on the intensive (contributions conditional on participation) margin.    
7:165:13585:28:27:90:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:  Overall,  because  of  this  very  inelastic  response  on  both  the  intensive  and  the  
7:166:13679:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extensive margins, the analysis reveals that for employers and policy makers interested in 
7:167:13770:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:promoting  retirement  saving  by  older  workers  through  greater  401(k)  participation  and  
7:168:13867:28:27:90:527:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:saving,  matching  is  a  rather  poor  policy  instrument.    Roughly  speaking,  the  estimated  
7:169:13966:27:28:90:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal  effects  in  this  paper  suggest  that  an  increase  in  the  employer  match  rate  of  $1  
7:170:14071:28:27:90:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:per  $1  of  employee  contribution  would  be  needed  to  achieve  the  same  increase  in  
7:171:14165:27:28:90:527:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation  as  the  implementation  of  automatic  enrollment,  based  on  the  estimates  in

7:173:14348:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analysis also suggests that government matching of voluntary contributions to any type of

7:175:14535:28:27:89:349:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account contributions (Engelhardt and Kumar, 2005). 
7:176:14587:27:28:125:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.    Sections  II  and  III  lay  out  the  theoretical  
7:177:14682:28:27:89:526:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model  and  first-order  conditions  that  directly  motivates  the  empirical  analysis.    Section  
7:178:14784:27:28:89:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:IV lays out the econometric framework and construction of the key variables.  Sections V 
7:179:14873:28:28:89:524:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and VI describe the data.  Section VII describes the empirical analysis of the relationship 
7:180:14965:28:0:89:526:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between  matching  and  measures  of  liquidity  constraints.    For  purposes  of  comparison  
8:181:15062:0:27:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with  our  more  structural  approach,  Section  VIII  presents  estimation  results  for  ad  hoc

8:183:15258:28:27:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discusses the identification of the structural model, and section X presents the estimation 
8:184:15350:27:28:90:264:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:results.  There is a brief conclusion.

8:186:15392:28:27:90:233:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:II. Theoretical Framework 
8:187:15417:27:28:126:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Previous  studies  have  had  two  important  shortcomings.    First,  they  have  not  
8:188:15505:28:27:90:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:couched  their  analyses  in  formal  models  of  intertemporal  choice,  even  though  saving  
8:189:15601:27:28:90:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:involves  the  substitution  of  resources  across  time.    This  means  that  previous  estimates  
8:190:15702:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cannot  be  interpreted  as  estimates  of  life-cycle-consistent  determinants  of  401(k)  saving  
8:191:15803:28:27:90:528:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily,  because  the  empirical  specifications  may  not  have  been  consistent  with  
8:192:15898:27:28:90:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:underlying  utility  maximization.    So,  while  the  existing  literature  has  provided  quite  
8:193:15997:28:27:90:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:informative descriptive analyses, it has said little about how 401(k) saving may respond 
8:194:16086:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to prospective changes in employer matching or what the optimal match rate should be to 
8:195:16174:28:27:90:527:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:achieve  a  saving  target.  Second,  with  the  exception  of  Choi,  Laibson,  Madrian,  and  
8:196:16270:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Metrick (2002), Mitchell, Utkus, and Yang (2005), and VanDerhei and Copeland (2001), 
8:197:16355:28:28:90:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:previous  studies  have  failed  to  exploit  the  fact  that  multiple-match-rate  schedules  and  
8:198:16455:28:27:90:334:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:B:caps on matching induce kinks in the budget set.

8:200:16597:28:27:90:524:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:departure from the previous literature.  In an effort to shorten the exposition, the model is

8:202:16780:28:19:108:529:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:1) Intratemporal   direct   utility,   );,(zlCU,   is   derived   from   leisure,   l,   with   an

9:207:17106:14:16:108:524:694:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:2) The  consumer  faces  a  per  period  probability  of  survival  of  ρ,  with  period  T 
9:208:17196:16:19:125:528:678:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:being  the  known  maximum  length  of  life,  and  with  probability  ρ−1, the 
9:209:17276:19:19:126:526:659:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:consumer  dies  and  receives  the  terminal  payoff  )(TWΦ,  the  utility  of  bequests,  
9:210:17367:19:14:126:327:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:which is a function of total wealth, TW.

9:212:17410:14:14:108:524:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:3) The lifetime is composed of two parts: from periodNtoΤ, the consumer is retired 
9:213:17492:14:14:125:527:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:and  no  hours  of  labor  are  supplied  to  the  market,  so  leisure  equals  the  time  
9:214:17584:14:14:125:527:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:endowment,  and  from  period  0  to 1-N,  the  consumer  works;  the  timing  of  
9:215:17666:14:14:126:320:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:retirement in period N is endogenous.

9:234:18841:14:14:107:526:305:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:7) There  are  four  liquidity  constraints:  a)  non-401(k)-DC,  DB  and  Social  Security

9:238:19192:13:14:126:521:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:c)  401(k)  wealth  is  assumed  illiquid  until  retirement;  and  d)  there  is  a  cash-on-
9:239:19286:14:14:126:525:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:hand constraint, such that total per period full expenditure (also referred to as “full

10:280:21070:28:28:90:522:395:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions to 401(k), IRA, or taxable assets; adjustments can be made to the mortgage-
10:281:21159:28:27:90:526:367:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:debt position as well.  However, the primary technology for smoothing resources across 
10:282:21246:27:28:90:526:340:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:periods when working is through taxable-asset saving, because 401(k) saving is illiquid; 
10:283:21335:28:27:90:526:312:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:IRA contributions are not necessarily illiquid because of the availability of withdrawals,

10:286:21607:28:27:90:526:229:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:optimization  does  not  imply  automatically  that  all  active  saving  be  allocated  first  to  the

10:288:21816:28:27:90:476:174:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consumer must balance the desire for a high return with the need for liquidity.

16:562:31956:27:28:90:527:221:100:Courier:144:g_d0_f3:B:   Previous  research  primarily  has  used  nationally  representative,  individual-level  
16:563:32047:28:27:90:527:193:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survey  data,  such  as  the  Current  Population  Studies  (CPS)  and  Surveys  of  Consumer

16:565:32237:28:28:90:527:138:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:First,  even  though  the  researcher  must  know  the  entire  match  schedule  for  a  plan  to  
16:566:32336:28:27:90:528:110:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account  for  the  individual’s  full  opportunity  set,  as  well  as  whether  the  match  is

17:568:32527:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in accurately conveying even relatively simple pension provisions to interviewers, no less

17:570:32717:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantial  reporting  error.    In  addition,  as  the  theoretical  framework  showed,  the  data

17:574:33111:27:28:90:524:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pensions, which require lifetime and job earnings histories, respectively.  Previous studies 
17:575:33204:28:27:90:242:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have not had all of these data.   
17:576:33238:27:28:126:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In  this  paper,  these  problems  are  overcome  by  using  remarkably  detailed  data  
17:577:33327:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from the first wave of the HRS, a nationally representative random sample of 51-61 year 
17:578:33415:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:olds and their spouses (regardless of age).  The first wave asked detailed questions about 
17:579:33506:27:28:90:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealth  (including  IRA  and  taxable  assets),  demographics,  and  spousal  characteristics  in  
17:580:33605:28:27:90:530:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1992.      The   survey   also   asked   detailed   questions   about   household   income,   tax   
17:581:33705:27:28:90:527:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information,  and  IRA  contributions,  but,  as  is  true  in  many  household  surveys,  these  
17:582:33803:28:28:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:questions were for the previous calendar year, 1991.  So, for the purposes of the empirical 
17:583:33895:28:27:90:414:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analysis, periods t and 1+t refer to 1991 and 1992, respectively.   
17:584:33963:27:28:125:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Questions on employment were asked for the job (if any) held at the time of the 
17:585:34043:28:28:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interview, as well as previous jobs.  A unique feature of these data is that the HRS used 
17:586:34133:28:27:90:525:211:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  job  rosters  from  the  household  interviews  and  collected  Summary  Plan  Descriptions

18:596:35017:28:27:89:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:job  in  which  the  respondent  was  employed  in  1991  was  identified  and  then  SPDs  
18:597:35109:27:28:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:associated with that job that had dates of adoption after 1991 were excluded.  In addition,

18:600:35379:27:28:89:390:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:changed between 1991 and the time the SPD was collected.     
18:601:35440:28:27:125:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  HRS  also  asked  in  the  first  wave  the  respondents’  permission  to  link  their

18:603:35631:28:28:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:administrative  data  include  Social  Security  covered-earnings  histories  from  1951-1991  
18:604:35726:28:27:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and W-2 earnings records for jobs held from 1980-1991, and were made available for use 
18:605:35813:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:under a restricted-access confidential data agreement.  They are the basis for two critical

18:607:36005:27:28:90:528:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:earnings  and  401(k)  contributions  for  1991.    Unlike  the  contributions  data  used  in  
18:608:36101:28:27:90:529:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:previous  studies,  these  data  are  not  subject  to  measurement  error,  as  they  are  the

19:629:37782:28:27:89:527:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expressed  as  a  percent  of  annual  pay.    About  19  percent  of  these  plans  had  caps  on  
19:630:37882:27:28:89:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  matching  that  were  less  than  four  percent  of  pay.    The  median  cap  was  6  
19:631:37979:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of pay, but 15 percent of plans had higher caps.  Plans also vary according to the 
19:632:38070:27:28:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match  rate.  Table  2  shows  the  distribution  of  “first-dollar”  match  rates  in  the  analysis  
19:633:38173:28:27:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample.    Columns  1  and  2  indicate  that  these  match  rates  were  clustered  at  25,  50,  and  
19:634:38277:27:28:89:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:100  percent,  where  the  median  match  rate  was  50  percent.    However,  27  percent  of  the  
19:635:38378:28:28:89:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plans offered matches of 100 percent, and three plans offered match rates of 200 percent.

19:639:38739:27:28:89:526:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of  mostly  white,  married  individuals  in  their  mid-50s,  with  some  college  education  and

19:641:38941:28:0:90:527:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(defined  as  having  made  a  positive  contribution)  in  1991.      The  sample  mean  401(k)  
20:642:39041:0:27:90:528:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribution  in  calendar  year  1991  was  $1,377,  but  among  contributors,  the  average  
20:643:39136:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribution  was  $2,446  (shown  in  column  4).    Only  3  percent  of  the  sample  made  the

20:645:39260:27:28:126:528:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Figure  1  plots  the  distribution  of  401(k)  contributions  for  the  match-eligible  
20:646:39350:28:28:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals in the sample in intervals of $200 relative to the kink amount.  As illustrated 
20:647:39442:28:27:90:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  figure,  there  is  substantial  bunching  of  contributions  at  the  kink  (measured  as  the  
20:648:39548:27:28:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:value 0 on the horizontal axis).  About 25 percent of match-eligible individuals locate at 
20:649:39639:28:27:90:324:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or within $400 of the kink on their budget sets.

20:652:39880:28:27:89:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:matching contributed just over $400 more on average than those without matching (i.e., 
20:653:39967:27:28:89:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:$1,640-$1,232=$408).    The  difference  in  the  median  contributions  between  these  two  
20:654:40061:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:groups was $800.    Therefore, just based on a comparison of means, it would appear that 
20:655:40150:27:28:89:355:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there is a small response of 401(k) saving to matching. 
20:656:40206:28:27:126:527:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A  comparison  of  columns  2  and  3  in  Table  3  also  indicates  that  plans  with  
20:657:40295:27:28:89:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  matching  differ  along  other  dimensions  that  may  make  saving  attractive.    For  
20:658:40394:28:28:89:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example, if there is an employer match, the individual is much more likely to be able to 
20:659:40483:28:27:89:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:borrow  against  the  plan  balance,  direct  the  investment  of  plan  balances,  less  likely  to  
20:660:40585:27:28:89:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have  another  traditional  pension  plan,  more  likely  to  have  the  plan  annual  contribution  
20:661:40686:28:27:89:527:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:limit  lower  than  the  federal  limit,  and  more  likely  to  be  allowed  to  make  after-tax

21:665:40870:0:27:125:528:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Because  the  typical  employer  match  yields  a  return  far  exceeding  that  on  
21:666:40955:27:28:89:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:alternative  investments,  401(k)  participation  would  be  predicted  to  be  100  percent  if  all  
21:667:41058:28:27:89:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals  were  fully  informed,  financially  rational,  with  access  to  perfect  capital  
21:668:41155:27:28:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:markets  and  no  transactions  costs.    In  addition,  at  a  minimum,  all  participants  would  be  
21:669:41259:28:28:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predicted  to  maximize  total  compensation  and  contribute  up  to  the  point  at  which  the  
21:670:41358:28:27:89:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  match  was  exhausted  and  then  engage  in  a  set  of  borrowing  and  lending  
21:671:41451:27:28:89:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:arrangements to achieve the desired level of consumption and leisure.7   Yet in Table 3, 
21:672:41540:28:27:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:401(k)  participation  is  56.4  percent  among  all  sample  individuals,  and  only  54  percent  
21:673:41640:27:28:89:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:among those offered a match.  This suggests that individuals left “money on the table” by 
21:674:41730:28:28:89:326:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not capturing the total potential employer match. 
21:675:41780:28:27:125:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Column 1 of Table 4 shows the total potential employer match in the sample for 
21:676:41859:27:28:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals eligible for a match.  The mean potential match was $1,249, or 3.8 percent of 
21:677:41949:28:27:89:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:annual  pay.    The  average  employer  match  that  went  unused  because  contributions  were  
21:678:42046:27:28:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not  made  up  to  the  level  of  the  match  cap  was  $550,  or  1.9  percent  of  pay.    Naturally,  
21:679:42152:28:27:89:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-participants accounted for most of this, with the unused match equal to 3.7 percent of 
21:680:42243:27:28:89:527:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pay  (column  3).    Even  more  striking,  though,  is  that  among  participants  the  average  
21:681:42341:28:28:89:413:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unused employer match represented 1 percent of pay (column 2).8  
21:682:42406:28:27:125:524:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As described in the theoretical framework, one possible explanation for this is that 
21:683:42491:27:28:89:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals  were  liquidity  constrained.    To  explore  this,  ad  hoc  reduced-form  models  
21:684:42588:28:27:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were  estimated  measuring  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  401(k)  contribution  was  less  
21:685:42686:27:25:89:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than  the  cap  on  the  employer  match  as  a  function  of  a  set  of  explanatory  variables  that  
21:686:42791:25:8:89:237:132:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
21:687:42839:8:16:90:525:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:7 A similar argument would imply that all individuals would be predicted to contribute up to the plan limit, 
21:688:42948:16:11:90:525:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and engage in a set of borrowing and lending arrangements to achieve the desired consumption and leisure, 
21:689:43054:11:7:90:432:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and thus exploit the tax arbitrage from deferral to minimize the lifetime tax liability.  
21:690:43144:7:16:90:526:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:8  Choi  et  al.  (2005)  and  Mitchell,  Utkus,  and  Yang  (2005)  have  similar  findings  using  various  sets  of  
21:691:43264:16:0:90:151:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:company data.

22:705:44491:27:28:90:529:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly  less  likely  to  have  contributed  below  that  match  cap,  whereas  those  
22:706:44585:28:27:90:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals who had financial distress from unanticipated medical expenses or no capital

22:710:44970:27:46:90:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:qualitatively  similar.      These  results  are  not  inconsistent  with  the  theoretical  result  that

23:724:46121:28:28:126:528:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To  compare  the  non-linear  budget  set  approach  with  that  from  the  previous  
23:725:46207:28:27:89:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature,  this  section  gives  the  estimation  results  from  a  series  of  ad  hoc  reduced-form  
23:726:46312:27:28:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specifications similar in spirit to those in the literature, using the same estimators as used 
23:727:46407:28:27:90:524:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the literature, but with the HRS data.  Selected parameter estimates are shown in Table 
23:728:46498:27:28:90:279:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:6.  Standard errors are in parentheses.   
23:729:46540:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:    Column 1 shows a probit specification for the decision to contribute to the 401(k) 
23:730:46626:28:27:90:529:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan   in   1991.      In   columns   2-4,   the   dependent   variable   is   the   dollar   amount   of   
23:731:46734:27:28:90:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions.    Contributions  are  modeled  as  a  function  of  earnings,  demographics,  a  
23:732:46831:28:27:90:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dummy  for  whether  the  firm  matches  contributions  and  the  marginal  match  rate  in  
23:733:46924:27:28:90:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:column  2.    Column  3  expands  the  specification  to  include  quartic  functions  in  age  and  
23:734:47025:28:27:90:528:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:earnings.    Column  4  presents  one-limit  Tobit  estimates.    Like  previous  studies,  all  
23:735:47122:27:28:90:530:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specifications  in  the  table  indicate  that  the  presence  of  a  match  raises  contributions.    
23:736:47225:28:28:90:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:However,  conditional  on  offering  a  match,  the  point  estimates  suggest  that  increases  in  
23:737:47326:28:27:90:527:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  match  rate  may  increase  or  decrease  contributions,  but  none  of  these  effects  are

23:739:47527:28:27:90:526:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match rate (conditional on having been offered a match) is shown in the last row of the

24:743:47758:0:27:90:529:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:  The  estimation  of  the  parameters  in  (15)  employs  an  instrumental-variable

25:781:49880:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:capital income and net (dis-)saving terms embodied in AΔ are sufficient statistics for the

25:783:50059:27:25:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  non-linear  structure  of  matching  and  marginal  tax  rates,  the  tax  and  match  prices,

25:785:50246:38:27:90:525:563:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal match rate or tax rate changes), and, hence, the taxes-paid measure, T, which, 
25:786:50334:27:28:89:521:536:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  turn,  incorporates  the  dollar  amount  of  the  implicit  tax  liability  from  the  employer-
25:787:50435:28:29:89:528:508:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:matching and tax subsidies, will change depending upon the budget-set segment as well.  
25:788:50523:29:32:89:525:479:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, full income is actually measured as “virtual” full income, vy, according to the

25:790:50703:28:27:90:528:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is  calculated  by  numerically  integrating  the  estimated  kernel-smoothed  implicit  tax

25:792:50824:28:27:126:525:364:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Unfortunately, the explanatory variables in (18) have components based on choice 
25:793:50905:27:31:90:525:337:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variables.  Therefore, the instrument set, Z, includes the vector of demographics, z, and 
25:794:50995:31:31:89:526:306:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three additional variables, FCitZ1−, IRAzmzpp⋅, and kzp401: the first is a dummy variable if 
25:795:51088:31:28:90:526:275:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  household  was  in  poor  financial  condition  in  1990,  and  the  second  and  the  third  are

25:797:51295:30:30:89:525:217:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There are two primary sources of variation in the instruments.  First, mzp varies by plan, 
25:798:51386:30:33:94:528:187:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f3:B:j.  That is, it is assumed that the variation  in  matching  schedules  across  plans  is  
25:799:51477:33:22:89:526:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous.  Second, IRAzp and kzp401 vary across synthetic individuals because the tax 
25:800:51564:22:8:90:237:132:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
25:801:51612:8:16:90:525:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:11  We  also  estimated  the  model  by  additionally  controlling  for  directly  for  demographic  characteristics  by  
25:802:51734:16:11:89:524:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:including the vector z in x.  We could not reject the null hypothesis that these additional variables jointly 
25:803:51844:11:12:89:524:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:had no impact on 401(k) participation.  This suggests that the demographic characteristics do not have an 
25:804:51950:12:11:89:524:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:effect separate from their interactions with the matching terms.  We do not report these results, but they are

26:809:52319:27:28:89:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:      A  final  issue  is  that  the  sample  is  likely  non-random  because  it  is  based  on  
26:810:52417:28:28:89:527:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals  for  whom  the  HRS  was  able  to  obtain  an  employer-provided  SPD  for  the

26:812:52597:27:28:89:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have  not  corrected  for  selection  because  of  the  lack  of  plausible  exclusion  restrictions,  
26:813:52700:28:27:89:524:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two exclusion restrictions based on IRS Form 5500 data were used to estimate the model 
26:814:52787:27:28:89:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:using a number of methods to correct for selection.  The first exclusion is the incidence of

26:818:53177:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the HRS is less likely to obtain an SPD from the employer if (on average in its cell) 
26:819:53268:27:28:89:527:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan  administration  is  outsourced,  because  more  than  one  contact  is  needed  (first  the  
26:820:53367:28:27:89:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer,  then  the  plan  administrator)  to  receive  the  SPD.    The  second  exclusion  is  the  
26:821:53470:27:28:89:527:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incidence  of  pension-plan  consolidation  due  to  mergers  and  acquisitions  by  cell  from  
26:822:53567:28:28:89:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1988-1992.  The intuition is that the HRS is less likely either to obtain an SPD from the 
26:823:53657:28:27:89:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  or  match  it  to  the  employee  if  (on  average  in  its  cell)  there  has  been  a  lot  of  
26:824:53765:27:28:89:528:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan consolidation, because plan names and detail are often changed upon consolidation.  
26:825:53854:28:27:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, two other variables based on HRS data were used as exclusions in the selection 
26:826:53942:27:28:89:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equations: dummies for whether the individual left the job because the business closed or 
26:827:54032:28:28:89:526:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:was laid off, respectively.  These help to measure whether the employer possibly was in 
26:828:54120:28:0:89:525:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial difficulty at severance, which, if that resulted in a business failure, would have 
27:829:54215:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:made  it  more  difficult  for  the  HRS  to  have  obtained  an  SPD.    The  construction  of  the  
27:830:54317:27:28:89:456:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exclusions and the selection equation are discussed in detail in Appendix B.

27:836:54686:28:27:89:527:510:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lists  the  set  of  additional  explanatory  variables  in  the  models.    Column  1  shows  the

27:838:54885:28:28:89:526:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect  for  a  one  unit  change  in  the  match  rate  represents  an  increase  of  one  dollar  of  
27:839:54989:28:27:89:528:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match  per  dollar  of  employee  contribution  and  is  shown  in  Panel.13    The  estimated

27:844:55472:28:27:90:527:289:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal  effect  for  virtual  full  income  is  negative,  consistent  with  consumption  and  
27:845:55569:27:28:90:527:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leisure  as  normal  goods,  statistically  significantly  different  than  zero,  but,  again,  the  
27:846:55671:28:27:90:385:234:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economic magnitude of the income elasticity is very small.    
27:847:55733:27:28:126:525:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Column 2 gives the instrumental-variable estimates.  In panel B, an increase in the

27:849:55907:28:27:90:527:151:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is  statistically  different  than  zero.    This  estimate  is  substantially  larger  than  the  one  in  
27:850:56015:27:15:90:528:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:column  1  without  instrumenting,  which  indicates  substantial  downward  bias  in  the

28:856:56477:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicates that an increase of one unit in virtual full income, which represents an increase 
28:857:56569:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of $100,000, results in an estimated reduction in the probability of participation of eight 
28:858:56661:27:28:89:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage  points.    The  income  effect,  as  well  as  the  impact  of  the  net  wage  and  the  
28:859:56763:28:28:89:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal tax rate, are all significant at less than the 0.0001 level of significance for all of 
28:860:56859:28:27:89:236:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the specifications in Table 7.   
28:861:56892:27:28:126:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To get a better sense of the economic magnitude of these marginal effects, Panel 
28:862:56973:28:27:90:524:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:D shows the estimated elasticity of participation with respect to the employer match rate, 
28:863:57064:27:28:90:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evaluated  at  the  sample  means.    In  column  2,  the  estimated  elasticity  is  0.07:  if  the  
28:864:57166:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  match  were  raised  from  twenty-five  to  fifty  cents  (i.e.,  doubled),  participation  
28:865:57268:28:27:90:528:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would  rise  by  seven  percent  (not  percentage  points).14      Thus,  401(k)  participation  
28:866:57365:27:28:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be quite inelastic with respect to the employer match.  The estimated income 
28:867:57453:28:28:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity is -0.10; the estimated net wage elasticity is 04.0−; and the estimated elasticity 
28:868:57547:28:27:89:526:349:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with  respect  to  the  marginal  tax  rate  is  0.04,  so  that  401(k)  participation  also  is  very  
28:869:57652:27:28:89:280:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:inelastic with respect to the tax price.    
28:870:57696:28:27:126:526:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Panel  A  also  shows  the  parameter  estimates  on  the  exclusion  restrictions  in  the  
28:871:57789:27:28:89:527:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:selection  model.15  The p-value  for  the  test  of  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  exclusions  
28:872:57889:28:28:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:jointly do not explain who has a matched SPD, though not shown in the table, is less than 
28:873:57979:28:27:90:525:211:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:0.01, which indicates the exclusions have predictive power for who is in the sample.  In 
28:874:58068:27:28:90:531:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particular,   greater   plan   outsourcing,   consolidation,   business   closure   and   layoffs   
28:875:58168:28:27:90:525:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly decrease the likelihood  of  having  a  matched  SPD.    The  parameter  estimate  
28:876:58265:27:32:90:528:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on  the  selection  term  in  the  participation  equation  is  negative,  and,  based  on  the

28:878:58410:7:12:90:434:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:14 The estimated elasticities are very similar when based on individual characteristics. 
28:879:58499:12:0:90:404:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:15  Parameter estimates for the full selection model are available upon request.

29:881:58675:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent level of significance.  This is evidence of selection: high savers are less likely to 
29:882:58769:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have  an  employer-provided  SPD  in  the  HRS,  consistent  with  the  reduced-form  analysis  
29:883:58865:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of  Gustman  and  Steinmeier  (1999).    To  gauge  whether  this  selection  is  economically  
29:884:58961:28:28:90:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:important,  column  3  shows  the  IV  results  without  selection  correction.    The  estimated  
29:885:59060:28:27:90:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation  elasticity  with  respect  to  the  match  rate  in  Panel  E  is  now  0.19,  which  is  
29:886:59165:27:28:90:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more  than  double  the  selection-corrected  elasticity  of  0.07  in  column  2.    This  indicates  
29:887:59268:28:27:90:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  bias  from  estimating  the  determinants  of  401(k)  participation  on  the  selected

29:889:59455:28:28:89:378:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the economic magnitude of the employer match estimates.

29:893:59631:27:28:89:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  theoretical  framework.    First,  firms  may  offer  employer  matching  contributions  as  a  
29:894:59732:28:27:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:way  to  try  to  avoid  failing  federal  pension  non-discrimination  rules  because  they  have  
29:895:59832:27:28:89:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:low-saving  employees  (McGill,  et  al.,  1996).  This  would  tend  to  bias  downward  the  
29:896:59927:28:28:89:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated  match  elasticity.    Second,  firms  that  match  may  adopt  other  plan  features  to  
29:897:60028:28:27:89:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stimulate employee saving (e.g., allow for borrowing against plan balances, self-directed 
29:898:60118:27:28:89:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment,  offer  after-tax  saving  options,  offer  retirement  seminars,  etc.)  or  offer

29:900:60306:27:28:89:436:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match.  This would tend to bias upward the estimated match elasticity.

30:914:61597:27:28:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relative to that for a non-highly-compensated worker.  This tax-difference-weighted share 
30:915:61687:28:27:90:529:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:was  used  as  a  measure  of  the  non-discrimination  “pressure”  faced  by  the  typical

30:923:62355:27:0:90:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and after-tax saving options had significantly higher first-dollar employer match rates, as 
31:924:62449:0:27:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:was  suggested  in  the  comparison  of  unconditional  means  in  Table  3  of  the  current

31:936:63439:28:27:89:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particular, in panel B, the estimated marginal effect of a one-dollar increase in the match 
31:937:63531:27:28:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate  is  an  increase  in  participation  of  0.09,  or  nine  percentage  points.    The  estimated  
31:938:63634:28:27:89:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match rate elasticity, Panel E, is 0.02, compared to 0.07 in column 2, so that the addition 
31:939:63726:27:28:89:530:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the fringe benefit and other plan characteristics has an important impact on the results.   
31:940:63821:28:28:89:527:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The  estimated  marginal  effects  for  income,  net  wage,  and  the  marginal  tax  rate  also

31:946:64305:8:16:90:524:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:16 Another potential concern is that high-saving individuals, such as those with long horizons, might sort to 
31:947:64415:16:11:89:526:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:firms  that  offer  employer  matching  contributions  (Ippolito,  1997).  This  would  tend  to  bias  upward  the  
31:948:64532:11:12:89:525:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:estimated elasticity of voluntary contributions to matching.  However, the estimation results in Engelhardt 
31:949:64640:12:11:89:524:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and Kumar (2004a) showed no correlation of the employer match rate with measures of the demographics 
31:950:64741:11:0:89:330:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and horizon and offered no support for endogenous sorting.

32:953:65001:28:27:90:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:status.    These  additional  employment  characteristics  were  interacted  with  the  fringe  
32:954:65097:27:28:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit and plan characteristics described above to allow a more flexible functional form 
32:955:65187:28:28:90:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for xα  in  (15).    The  estimated  marginal  effects  for  the  match  rate,  income,  net  wage,  
32:956:65288:28:28:90:527:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and  marginal  tax  rate  are  shown  in  column  5,  respectively,  are  similar  to  those  in  the  
32:957:65391:28:27:90:527:542:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:baseline  specifications  in  columns  2  and  4,  respectively.    The  estimated  elasticity  of  
32:958:65491:27:28:90:360:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation to the match rate rises to 0.05 in Panel E.   
32:959:65551:28:28:126:525:487:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, to allow for a significantly more flexible functional form for xα in (15), 
32:960:65635:28:27:89:528:459:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  column  6,  occupation  dummies  were  added;  the  fringe  benefit,  plan,  and  other  
32:961:65728:27:28:89:530:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employment   characteristics   were   interacted   with   occupation;   and,   the   other   plan   
32:962:65828:28:28:89:525:404:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics were interacted with the fringe benefit variables.  Hence, the specification 
32:963:65921:28:27:89:525:376:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in column 6 is essentially fully interactive in the elements of x.  The estimated elasticity 
32:964:66014:27:28:89:422:349:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of participation to the match rate rises to 0.06 (column 6, Panel E).    
32:965:66087:28:27:126:524:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As noted in section IV, the demographic characteristics enter (15) parsimoniously,

32:967:66267:28:28:90:526:266:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:demographic groups.  Across columns in Table 7, the demographic group for which the 
32:968:66351:28:27:90:526:238:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  match  consistently  appears  to  have  statistically  significant  differential  effects

33:974:66937:0:27:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated  22.6  and  17.5  percentage  points,  respectively.    However,  the  estimated  95%  
33:975:67034:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:confidence intervals around these estimates overlap substantially and these effects are not

33:982:67499:27:28:89:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1987b),  which  allowed  us  to  decompose  the  overall  saving  responses  between  the

33:992:68345:11:12:89:524:217:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:effects are higher. This is due to lower match rate and higher participation rates at which the elasticity has

34:1030:69332:28:27:89:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimated responses is very similar to those from the binary choice specification in Table

34:1035:69825:28:27:89:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parametric and semi-parametric estimates in these two columns indicate that an increase

34:1043:70542:7:16:90:525:297:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:18  The estimation uses methods laid out in Vella (1992) and Das, Newey, and Vella (2003) for the Tobit 
34:1044:70646:16:12:89:525:281:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and  SCLS  estimators,  respectively,  to  correct  for  potential  sample  selection.    Parameter  estimates  for  the  
34:1045:70768:12:11:89:524:269:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:full selection model are available upon request.   The first-stage regressions for the endogenous variables in 
34:1046:70879:11:7:89:241:258:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:(15) were selection corrected as well. 
34:1047:70918:7:16:90:526:251:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:19  One  drawback  of  the  SCLS  estimator  is  that  the  total,  extensive-,  and  intensive-margin  match  rate  
34:1048:71035:16:12:90:528:235:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:elasticities  shown  in  panel  E  cannot  be  calculated  from  the  estimates.    In  addition  to  SCLS,  the  
34:1049:71149:12:11:90:525:223:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:specifications were estimated using an instrumental-variable version of Powell’s CLAD estimator extended 
34:1050:71254:11:12:90:527:212:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:to  allow  for  two  limits,  with  the  upper  limit  varying  across  individuals,  as  is  dictated  by  these  data,  
34:1051:71376:12:11:90:528:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:accounting  for  selection  using  the  method  of  Blundell  and  Powell  (2004)  for  semiparametric  estimators.    
34:1052:71495:11:12:90:527:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:The  CLAD  point  estimates  produced  marginal  effects  that  were  very  similar  to  the  SCLS  and  Tobit  
34:1053:71607:12:11:90:527:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:estimated  marginal  effects  shown  in  Table  8.    However,  when  bootstrapping  the  standard  errors,  the  
34:1054:71721:11:12:90:525:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:estimator frequently failed to converge.  In particular, as is well-known for LAD estimators, the estimator 
34:1055:71829:12:11:90:525:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:can  fail  to  converge  when  the  specification  becomes  more  and  more  saturated  with  control  variables  and  
34:1056:71948:11:12:90:527:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the  cells  become  thin,  as  in  the  richer  specifications  in  subsequent  columns  in  Table  8.    This  is  a  
34:1057:72067:12:11:90:526:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:particularly  severe  problem  for  CLAD  estimators  that  rely  on  iterative  trimming  of  the  data  when  the  
34:1058:72184:11:12:90:526:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:analysis  dataset  is  not  large,  because  the  estimation  dataset  becomes  smaller  with  each  iteration,  even  
34:1059:72303:12:11:90:525:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:though the number of explanatory variables remains the same.  In this application, the estimation algorithm 
34:1060:72411:11:12:90:524:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:trimmed the original 1,042 observations down to around 400 by the last iteration.  For this reason, reliable 
34:1061:72520:12:11:90:525:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:bootstrapped  standard  errors  were  not  able  to  be  obtained  for  CLAD  estimates  and  they  are  not  shown  in  
34:1062:72641:11:0:90:133:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Table 8.    
35:1063:72655:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation model in Table 7.  Finally, Based on a Hausman-type test (Newey, 1987a), 
35:1064:72742:27:28:89:469:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we could not reject the IV Tobit model in favor of the IV SCLS specification.

35:1067:73000:28:28:89:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of  Table  9.  In  columns  1  and  2  of  Table  10,  an  increase  in  the  match  rate  of  one  dollar  
35:1068:73108:28:27:89:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases  contributions  of  females  and  males  by  an  estimated  $1,153  and  $1,752,  
35:1069:73200:27:28:89:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:respectively.    The  results  for  the  education  groups  echo  those  from  the  discrete  choice  
35:1070:73302:28:27:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model of participation in Table 8, both marginal effects and elasticities rise sharply with

35:1074:73436:27:28:126:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Previous  studies  have  produced  a  puzzling  array  of  estimates  of  the  impact  of  
35:1075:73527:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer matching on 401(k) saving.  This probably stemmed from the use of less than 
35:1076:73612:27:28:89:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ideal data and, more importantly, the failure to incorporate into estimation match-induced 
35:1077:73703:28:27:89:527:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:kinks  in  the  budget  set.    Overall  in  this  analysis,  based  on  the  life-cycle  consistent  
35:1078:73805:27:28:89:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specification  derived,  the  estimated  elasticity  of  401(k)  participation  with  respect  to  the  
35:1079:73909:28:28:89:528:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match  rate  ranged  from  0.02-0.07,  and,  hence,  participation  was  quite  inelastic  with  
35:1080:74006:28:27:89:524:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:respect to employer matching, a pattern that was apparent even in a simple comparison of 
35:1081:74095:27:28:89:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:means.  The  estimated  elasticities  of  401(k)  saving  from  a  censored  regression  model  
35:1082:74191:28:27:89:498:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ranged from 0.09-0.12 with just under half of this response on the intensive margin.  
35:1083:74277:27:28:125:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There are two obvious limitations of these findings.  First, the focus was on older 
35:1084:74361:28:28:89:525:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:workers,  for  whom  the  very  detailed  data  for  this  type  of  study  were  available;  whether  
35:1085:74464:28:0:89:527:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  estimates  apply  to  younger  workers  is  an  open  question.    Second,  this  study  has  
36:1086:74565:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nothing to say about the broader question of to what extent 401(k) saving constitutes new 
36:1087:74655:27:28:90:384:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private saving, a point of substantial debate in the literature.  
36:1088:74721:28:27:90:529:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:  Given  these  caveats,  there  are  a  number  of  potential  implications  of  these  
36:1089:74810:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:findings.  First, because of the estimated inelastic response on both the intensive and the 
36:1090:74902:28:28:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extensive margins, the analysis reveals that for employers and policy makers interested in 
36:1091:74993:28:27:90:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:promoting  retirement  saving  by  older  workers  through  greater  401(k)  participation  and  
36:1092:75090:27:28:89:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:saving,  matching  is  a  rather  poor  policy  instrument.    Roughly  speaking,  the  estimated  
36:1093:75189:28:27:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal  effects  in  this  paper  suggest  that  an  increase  in  the  employer  match  rate  of  $1  
36:1094:75294:27:28:89:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:per  $1  of  employee  contribution  would  be  needed  to  achieve  the  same  increase  in  
36:1095:75388:28:28:89:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation  as  the  implementation  of  automatic  enrollment,  based  on  the  estimates  in

36:1097:75581:27:28:89:529:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Automatic  enrollment  would  seem  to  be  a  much  more  effective  way  to  increase  
36:1098:75670:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement saving.  Second, a number of commonly-advocated reforms to Social Security 
36:1099:75756:27:28:89:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:call for the introduction of voluntary private accounts, to which individuals could choose 
36:1100:75847:28:27:90:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to contribute additional funds toward Social Security.  Under some proposals, the federal 
36:1101:75937:27:28:90:528:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:government  would  match  those  contributions  as  an  incentive.    In  designing  such  a  
36:1102:76031:28:28:90:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:system, it would be instrumental for policy makers to know how individual contributions 
36:1103:76119:28:27:90:528:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would  respond  to  the  government  match.    Our  analysis  suggests  that  government  
36:1104:76209:27:28:90:528:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:matching  of  voluntary  contributions  to  any  type  of  Social  Security  personal  account  
36:1105:76305:28:27:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would  be  relatively  ineffective  in  promoting  personal-account  contributions  (Engelhardt

36:1107:76504:28:28:89:527:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  government  provision  of  matching  contributions  designed  to  stimulate  targeted

37:1113:77074:28:28:89:532:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:experiments,    have    shown    substantially    more    elastic    responses    from    matching    
37:1114:77176:28:27:90:378:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions on IDA and IRA contributions, respectively.

37:1117:77422:27:28:90:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reasons.    First,  eligible  employees  in  401(k)  plans  are  not  typically  lower  income  
37:1118:77518:28:28:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals.    They  are  more  likely  to  be  substantially  better  off  economically.    For  
37:1119:77617:28:27:90:526:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example,  individuals  in  the  Mills  et  al.  analysis  had  incomes  below  150  percent  of  the  
37:1120:77719:27:28:90:531:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poverty   line.      Second,   institutional   features   differ   substantially.      For   example,   
37:1121:77823:28:27:90:527:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions  to  a  401(k)  plan  that  are  matched  are  typically  done  through  automatic  
37:1122:77921:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:payroll deduction, whereas contributions to IDAs and IRAs in the Mills, et al. and Duflo, 
37:1123:78011:28:27:90:526:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:et  al.  analyses  were  not.    Third,  the  matching  contributions  in  the  Duflo,  et  al.  analysis  
37:1124:78118:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were offered as part of an unannounced, take-it-or-leave-it decision, whereas employees 
37:1125:78206:28:28:90:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in a 401(k) can respond to a match by contributing at any point in a given calendar year, 
37:1126:78296:28:27:90:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or  even  a  different  calendar  year,  without  foregoing  the  option  of  being  eligible  for  a  
37:1127:78399:27:28:90:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match.      Overall,   although   these   are   fascinating   studies   that   will   have   important   
37:1128:78504:28:27:90:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implications for policy targeted to lower income households and, through randomization, 
37:1129:78592:27:28:90:526:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have  convincingly  addressed  important  issues  in  the  econometric  identification  of  the  
37:1130:78689:28:28:90:528:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:causal  effects  of  matching,  these  studies  are  of  limited  use  in  formulating  policy  
37:1131:78785:28:0:90:219:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concerning 401(k) plans.   
38:1132:78814:0:28:125:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  a  number  of  prominent  companies  have  reduced  or  eliminated  matching  
38:1133:78902:28:30:89:524:680:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions recently due to declining profits.Although it remains to be seen if this is a 
38:1134:78994:30:28:89:526:650:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:long-term  trend,  understanding  the  impact  of  matching  is  critical  to  understanding  the  
38:1135:79093:28:27:89:527:622:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impact  of  these  changes  on  retirement  income  security  for  a  workforce  increasingly  
38:1136:79188:27:28:89:527:595:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dependent  on  401(k)  plans  for  retirement.    The  fact  that  the  estimated  response  of  
38:1137:79285:28:27:89:524:567:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions to the employer match in this paper was quite inelastic suggests that overall 
38:1138:79377:27:28:89:526:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:401(k) activity at these firms might not be greatly affected by these changes in matching.

48:1522:98938:13:14:126:528:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Previous  studies  have  had  two  important  shortcomings.    First,  they  have  not  
48:1523:99026:14:14:89:526:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:couched  their  analyses  in  formal  models  of  intertemporal  choice,  even  though  saving  
48:1524:99122:14:14:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:involves  the  substitution  of  resources  across  time.    This  means  that  previous  estimates  
48:1525:99223:14:14:89:525:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cannot  be  interpreted  as  estimates  of  life-cycle-consistent  determinants  of  401(k)  saving  
48:1526:99324:14:13:89:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily,  because  the  empirical  specifications  may  not  have  been  consistent  with  
48:1527:99419:13:14:89:527:557:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:underlying  utility  maximization.    So,  while  the  existing  literature  has  provided  quite  
48:1528:99518:14:14:89:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:informative descriptive analyses, it has said little about how 401(k) saving may respond 
48:1529:99607:14:14:89:524:529:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to prospective changes in employer matching or what the optimal match rate should be to

48:1532:99885:13:14:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exploit the fact that multiple-match-rate schedules and caps on matching induce kinks in

48:1544:100827:19:18:89:526:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:axis, are matched at a fixed rate, VOLm,  up  to  a  cap,  matchQ, based on the amount of the 
48:1545:100921:18:19:90:524:282:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:voluntary contributions.  The upper limit on voluntary contributions is maxQ.  The budget

48:1549:101260:8:16:90:527:216:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:20  Both  of  these  studies  examined  the  impact  of  match  rates  and  caps  on  401(k)  participation  and  
48:1550:101374:16:11:89:526:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:contributions,  but  from  rather  different  perspectives  than  in  this  paper.    Specifically,  Choi,  Laibson,  
48:1551:101492:11:12:89:524:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Madrian, and Metrick (2002) examined large samples of employee administrative data from two firms, one 
48:1552:101595:12:11:89:524:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:that introduced a match of 25 percent up to 4 percent of pay and another that held the match rate constant 
48:1553:101702:11:12:89:524:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:but increased the match cap.  Their reduced-form estimates were not inconsistent with a relatively moderate 
48:1554:101810:12:11:89:524:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:substitution effect and a very small income effect.  Copeland and VanDerhei (2001) estimated the impact of 
48:1555:101917:11:12:89:527:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:match  rates  and  caps  using  a  reduced-form  sequential-response  regression  model  for  137  matching  
48:1556:102026:12:11:89:526:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:formulas  and  a  very  large  sample  of  participants,  in  which  a  separate  equation  was  estimated  for  each  
48:1557:102145:11:12:89:527:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:match  rate  the  participant  faced.    They,  too,  found  evidence  that  matching  raised  participation  and  
48:1558:102260:12:11:89:526:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:contributions.    Probably  the  biggest  difference  between  these  studies  and  the  current  paper  is  that  the  
48:1559:102380:11:12:89:524:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:analysis below is based on a life-cycle-consistent empirical specification, constructs the household’s budget

49:1564:102889:17:14:89:372:670:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:there is a kink point, k, at which the match is exhausted.   
49:1565:102950:14:14:125:528:656:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:A:The  introduction  of  the  employer  match  with  a  cap  has  differential  effects

49:1568:103238:14:14:89:525:615:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:for higher levels of contributions, the budget set shifts out in parallel, and there is only an 
49:1569:103334:14:16:89:533:601:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:income   effect,   for   which   contributions   fall   with   the   imposition   of   the   match.

49:1576:103892:13:14:126:528:496:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:A:By  specifying  a  detailed  theoretical  framework,  this  paper  represents  a  stark  
49:1577:103981:14:14:89:526:482:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:departure  from  the  previous  literature.    There  were  eight  criteria  that  guided  the  model  
49:1578:104084:14:14:89:529:468:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:detailed  below.    First,  it  should  incorporate  non-linear  budget  sets  explicitly.    In  
49:1579:104182:14:14:89:526:454:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:particular,  the  budget  sets  individuals  actually  face  are  substantially  more  complicated  
49:1580:104282:14:13:90:522:440:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:than the ones depicted in Figure 1, because they may have multiple kinks due to variable-
49:1581:104371:13:14:90:526:427:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:rate  matches,  and  there  may  be  multiple  kinks  because  there  are  multiple  marginal  tax  
49:1582:104471:14:14:90:525:413:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:rates, and contributions are tax-deductible, so that making a contribution may change the 
49:1583:104561:14:14:90:524:399:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:marginal tax rate.  Surprisingly, none of the previous studies even have accounted for the 
49:1584:104652:14:13:90:526:385:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:effect  of  taxation  on  401(k)  saving.    Second  and  third,  respectively,  the  model  should  
49:1585:104753:13:14:90:527:372:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:allow  for  goods  other  than  consumption,  such  as  leisure,  that  enter  utility—because  a  
49:1586:104852:14:14:90:526:358:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:change  in  the  match  rate  may  induce  intratemporal  substitution  across  goods—and  for  
49:1587:104948:14:14:90:525:344:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:uncertain lifetimes and bequests, facets that are important to individuals of the ages found 
49:1588:105041:14:14:90:526:330:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  HRS.    Fourth,  the  model  should  allow  for  wealth  accumulation  in  many  forms,  
49:1589:105139:14:13:90:528:316:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:because  401(k)  plan  participants  can  save  through  means  that  differ  from  401(k)s  in  
49:1590:105236:13:14:90:529:303:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:terms  of  tax  treatment  and  liquidity,  especially  those  that  have  been  identified  by

49:1598:105979:14:14:89:525:192:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:leisure.  This is a critical part of the analysis because the non-linear-budget-set estimation 
49:1599:106074:14:13:90:526:178:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:requires  that  non-linearities  be  well  specified,  and  it  is  something  that  has  been  omitted

50:1649:110384:11:16:90:525:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:23  The  obvious  exception  to  this  result  is  that  tax-exempt  municipal  bonds  should  be  held  in  the  taxable

51:1652:110623:13:14:90:526:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:forms  of  saving,  in  that  contributions  are  not  taxed  when  made,  they  allow  for  inside

51:1655:110929:14:14:90:527:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:between  vehicles.24      Second,  federal  law  allows  an  employee  to  roll  a  DC  or  401(k)  
51:1656:111029:14:13:89:525:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:account balance over to an IRA upon job severance, so, in practice, assets that were once

59:2282:138332:14:13:90:528:158:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:note  the  manner  in  which  the  HRS  obtained  the  SPDs  and  administrative  earnings  data.    
59:2283:138433:13:14:90:524:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The HRS asked all respondents who reported being in a (current or past) pension-covered

59:2286:138711:14:14:90:525:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pension(s), but more generally as part of a survey of pension providers in which the HRS 
59:2287:138800:14:13:90:527:89:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:requested  copies  of  SPDs  for  the  universe  of  pensions  the  employer  provided  (to  all  
59:2288:138898:13:0:90:526:76:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees).    The  HRS  then  “matched”  from  this  universe  the  appropriate  pension(s)  to  
60:2289:138998:0:13:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the respondent based on the respondent’s characteristics, e.g., union status, method of pay

60:2291:139192:14:14:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were  well  below  100  percent:  65  percent  of  those  currently  working  in  pension-covered  
60:2292:139291:14:14:90:526:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:jobs, 66 percent for the last job for those not working, and 35 percent for jobs held five

60:2295:139464:13:14:125:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There  are  a  number  of  important  reasons  for  the  failure  to  match  an  SPD  to  the  
60:2296:139559:14:14:90:528:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:respondent.    First,  the  respondent  may  not  have  given  correct  employer  name  and  
60:2297:139652:14:14:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:address.  Second, the HRS may have failed to receive the SPD because the employer may 
60:2298:139738:14:14:90:527:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have  refused  to  comply  with  the  pension  provider  survey,  the  employer  could  not  be  
60:2299:139835:14:13:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:located at the address given, or the employer went out of business or merged with another 
60:2300:139925:13:14:90:527:557:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company  and  no  longer  existed  under  the  name  given  by  the  respondent.    Third,  the  
60:2301:140022:14:14:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer may have submitted an SPD, but the HRS was unable to match the SPD to the 
60:2302:140105:14:14:90:526:529:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:respondent  based  on  the  plan  detail  and  the  respondent’s  characteristics.    This  is  less  
60:2303:140207:14:14:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely for union and public sector workers, who are easy to identify and whose plans are 
60:2304:140296:14:13:90:525:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:easy to obtain, and more likely for workers whose employers had undergone mergers and 
60:2305:140382:13:14:90:333:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions with subsequent plan modifications.

60:2307:140433:14:14:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The exclusion restrictions were constructed as follows.  First, Form 5500 data for 
60:2308:140516:14:14:90:525:446:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1988-1992 from the Department of Labor, Employee Benefit Security Administration, on 
60:2309:140601:14:13:90:527:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  universe  of  pension  plans  with  100  or  more  participants  and  a  5  percent  random  
60:2310:140699:13:14:89:527:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample  of  plans  with  less  than  100  participants  were  obtained.    Second,  plans  were  
60:2311:140796:14:14:89:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:divided  into  cells  defined  by  Census  region,  employment  size  category,  one-digit  SIC  
60:2312:140893:14:14:90:525:391:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:code,  year,  and  union  status  (union  plan  vs.  non-union  plan).    The  first  exclusion  is  the  
60:2313:140999:14:14:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incidence of pension plan outsourcing by cell in 1992, where outsourcing means the plan 
60:2314:141087:14:13:90:525:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:was administered by an entity other than the employer (weighted using sampling weights 
60:2315:141174:13:14:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provided by DOL). The intuition here is that the HRS was less likely to have obtained an 
60:2316:141262:14:14:89:526:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:SPD  from  the  employer  if  (on  average  in  its  cell)  plan  administration  was  outsourced,  
60:2317:141362:14:14:89:529:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because   more   than   one   contact   was   needed   (first   the   employer,   then   the   plan   
60:2318:141464:14:13:89:527:308:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:administrator)  to  have  received  the  SPD.  (It  may  well  have  been  that  plans  that  were  
60:2319:141564:13:14:89:524:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outsourced were better administered and, therefore, employers that outsourced were more 
60:2320:141652:14:14:89:525:281:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to have returned the pension provider survey.  However, this was likely more than 
60:2321:141741:14:14:90:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:offset  because  the  SPD  request  was  significantly  less  likely  to  have  been  fulfilled  when  
60:2322:141844:14:14:90:526:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:multiple  entities  needed  to  be  contacted.) The  second  exclusion  was  the  incidence  of  
60:2323:141940:14:13:89:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pension  plan  consolidation  due  mergers  and  acquisitions  by  cell  from  1988-1992.    The  
60:2324:142038:13:14:89:526:226:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intuition  here  is  that  the  HRS  was  less  likely  either  to  have  obtained  an  SPD  from  the  
60:2325:142142:14:14:89:525:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer or to have matched it to the employee if (on average in its cell) there had been a 
60:2326:142234:14:14:89:527:198:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lot  of  plan  consolidation,  because  plan  names  and  detail  were  often  changed  upon  
60:2327:142328:14:14:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consolidation.  Two other variables were used as exclusions for pensions on past jobs in

60:2330:142613:14:14:89:526:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer  possibly  was  in  financial  difficulty  at  severance,  which,  if  that  resulted  in  a  
60:2331:142716:14:14:90:528:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:business failure, would have made it more difficult for the HRS to have obtained an SPD.   
60:2332:142807:14:14:90:93:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
60:2333:142807:14:14:126:526:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There were three important considerations in constructing the instruments.  First, 
60:2334:142890:14:0:90:527:87:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  instruments  were  drawn  from  the  information  set  tΩ.      Because  t  is  1991,  all  
61:2335:142989:0:13:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information  from  1989  and  1990  is  in  the  information  set  and  orthogonal  to  decisions  
61:2336:143088:13:17:90:525:695:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:made in 1991 under rational expectations.  Second, because the observed marginal match 
61:2337:143175:17:16:90:525:678:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and tax rates depend upon 401(k) and IRA contributions, IRAzmzpp⋅ and kzp401 are based 
61:2338:143262:16:14:90:528:662:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on  first-dollar  measures:  the  employer  match  on  the  first  dollar  contributed  and  the  
61:2339:143360:14:14:90:526:648:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal tax rate at which the first dollar contributed is deductible (which equals the tax 
61:2340:143452:14:14:90:524:634:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate on the last dollar of earnings).   Third, to minimize dependence on individual-specific 
61:2341:143545:14:13:90:527:620:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income  and  family  size  that  might  be  correlated  with  saving  behavior,  the  first-dollar  
61:2342:143645:13:14:90:525:607:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rates were calculated for a synthetic individual of each marital status assumed to have no

61:2344:143831:14:14:90:524:579:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marital status is assumed exogenous—with synthetic annual labor earnings constructed as 
61:2345:143919:14:14:90:531:565:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:follows:   individuals   were   divided   into   cells   based   on   exogenous   demographic   
61:2346:144015:14:19:90:525:551:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics, and the cell mean gross hourly wage rate, 2−•tw, was multiplied by 2,000

61:2356:144732:16:14:89:524:369:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is different because it is based on the tax system in 1989 (indicated by the subscript 2−t 
61:2357:144822:14:14:89:525:355:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in (B.2)-(B.3) above).  Figure 2 plots the federal marginal tax rate by real AGI (in 1991

61:2359:145014:13:14:89:527:328:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:below  $50,000,  the  functions  are  essentially  the  same,  but  differ  for  those  above  this  
61:2360:145115:14:14:89:525:314:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:level.  Specifically, above this income level in 1989, the marginal tax rate increased from 
61:2361:145207:14:14:89:525:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:28  to  33  percent  due  to  the  phase-out  of  the  personal  exemption.    However,  the  Budget  
61:2362:145309:14:14:89:526:286:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Act of 1990 raised the top marginal tax rate to 31 percent and changed the phase-out of

61:2364:145496:13:14:90:525:259:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differs from that for the endogenous regressor due to the tax-law change, which is taken
