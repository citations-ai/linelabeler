2:34:1857:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:There  are  three  primary  measures  of  teaching  performance:  student  test-based  measures  (i.e., 
2:35:1961:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:value added), classroom observations, and student surveys. Although all three types of measures 
2:36:2056:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:could  be biased  by  unmeasured  traits  of  the  students  in  teachers’  classrooms,  prior  research  has 
2:37:2165:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:largely focused on the validity of value-added measures. We conduct an experiment involving 66 
2:38:2259:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:mathematics teachers in four school districts and test the validity of all three types of measures. 
2:39:2358:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:Specifically, we test whether a teacher’s performance on each measure under naturally occurring 
2:40:2453:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:(i.e.,  non-experimental)  settings predicts  performance  following  random  assignment  of  that 
2:41:2551:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:teacher to a class of students. Combining our results with those from two previous experiments, 
2:42:2646:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:we  provide  further  evidence  that  value-added measures  are  unbiased  predictors  of  teacher 
2:43:2744:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:performance.  In  addition,  we  provide  the  first  evidence that  classroom  observation  scores  are 
2:44:2848:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:unbiased  predictors  of  teacher  performance  on  a  rubric  measuring the  quality  of  mathematics 
2:45:2950:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:instruction.  Unfortunately,  we  lack  the  statistical  power  to  reach  any  similar conclusions 
2:46:3050:14:28:72:419:406:12:Times:12:Times:regarding the predictive validity of a teacher’s student survey responses.

3:72:3675:0:27:267:347:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:I. Introduction 
3:73:3690:27:28:108:526:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:For decades, researchers have documented heterogeneity in student achievement gains 
3:74:3774:28:27:72:539:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across teachers’ classrooms (e.g., Gordon, Kane, & Staiger, 2006; Jacob & Lefgren, 2005; Kane, 
3:75:3868:27:28:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Rockoff, & Staiger, 2008; McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, & Hamilton, 2004; Rivkin, 
3:76:3955:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Hanushek, & Kain, 2005; Rockoff, 2004). Such findings have inspired recent efforts to measure 
3:77:4048:28:27:72:499:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and reward teacher performance based primarily on three types of measures: student test 
3:78:4133:27:28:72:512:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achievement gains, classroom observations, and student surveys. In fact, between 2008 and 
3:79:4223:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2014, nearly every state reformed their teacher evaluation policies to include one or more of such 
3:80:4321:27:28:72:496:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures (Minnici, 2014). Yet, legitimate questions have been raised about whether the 
3:81:4408:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures are valid reflections of teachers’ performance, or are instead driven by unmeasured 
3:82:4500:28:27:72:522:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics of the students they teach. Although the test-based measures (i.e., value-added 
3:83:4595:27:28:72:505:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates) have been most controversial in this regard, the same questions could be raised 
3:84:4684:28:27:72:336:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regarding classroom observations and student surveys. 
3:85:4737:27:28:108:531:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In this study, we test whether a teacher’s performance on each measure, when collected 
3:86:4824:28:28:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:under naturally occurring settings (i.e., non-experimentally), is a valid predictor of that teacher’s 
3:87:4926:28:27:72:537:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance on the same measure following random assignment. The study was conducted over 
3:88:5015:27:28:72:516:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:three academic years. In the first two years, we observed a sample of fourth- and fifth-grade 
3:89:5104:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mathematics teachers and collected a series of measures—end-of-year student standardized test 
3:90:5196:27:28:72:527:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achievement, classroom observations conducted by external raters, and student surveys. In the 
3:91:5290:28:28:72:527:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:third year of the study, we randomly assigned participating teachers to classrooms within their 
3:92:5385:28:27:72:514:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:schools and then again collected all three measures. Using those data, we ask two questions 
3:93:5475:27:0:72:320:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regarding the predictive validity of these measures: 
4:94:5528:0:27:90:507:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1. Do teachers with higher scores on these performance measures during the first two 
4:95:5611:27:28:108:536:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:years—when teachers were not randomly assigned to students—score higher in the third 
4:96:5695:28:27:108:283:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:year following random assignment? 
4:97:5727:27:28:90:528:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2. To what degree does the magnitude of teachers’ scores on these performance measures 
4:98:5812:28:28:108:453:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from the first two years predict their scores under random assignment?  
4:99:5882:28:27:108:539:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:If the distinctions drawn between teachers during the first two years are largely driven by 
4:100:5974:27:28:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unmeasured characteristics of their students, we would not expect performance from the prior 
4:101:6067:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period to predict performance following random assignment. Moreover, the magnitude of the 
4:102:6156:27:28:72:536:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relationship will illustrate the degree of forecast bias (henceforth referred to simply as “bias”) in 
4:103:6256:28:28:72:507:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates of teaching performance measured under naturally occurring settings (i.e., when 
4:104:6346:28:27:72:267:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:classrooms are not randomly assigned).  
4:105:6383:27:28:108:525:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To date, predictive validity studies have focused largely on value added.1 Specifically, 
4:106:6470:28:27:72:534:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:two experimental studies randomly assigned teachers to classrooms within schools to assess the 
4:107:6564:27:28:72:541:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:predictive validity of these test-based measures of teacher effectiveness. Kane and Staiger (2008) 
4:108:6663:28:28:72:532:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomly assigned teachers to 156 classrooms within Los Angeles schools and found that prior-
4:109:6756:28:27:72:541:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:year value-added estimates were unbiased predictors of average student test score growth in their 
4:110:6854:27:28:72:521:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomly assigned classrooms. As part of the Measures of Effective Teaching Project, Kane, 
4:111:6945:28:27:72:517:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:McCaffrey, Miller, and Staiger (2013) randomly assigned over 1,100 teachers to classrooms 
4:112:7034:27:28:72:525:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across six school districts. Kane et al. (2013) used scores on state and project-developed tests, 
4:113:7132:28:52:72:531:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:classroom observations, and student surveys to form a composite measure of effectiveness, and 
4:114:7226:52:7:72:219:132:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
4:115:7273:7:17:72:532:125:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:1 One notable exception exploits a nearly random student teacher assignment mechanism for kindergarten students 
4:116:7383:17:11:72:530:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:in Ecuador to test the relationship between teacher observation scores and student achievement (Araujo, Carneiro, 
4:117:7497:11:12:72:523:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Cruz-Aguayo, & Schady, 2016). Although they do not explicitly test for forecast bias in performance on teacher 
4:118:7607:12:11:72:526:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:effects based on classroom observations, they find that differences in teacher observation scores are predictive of 
4:119:7723:11:0:72:345:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:differences in student achievement gains under random assignment. 
5:120:7789:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:found that this combined measure was an unbiased predictor of average state test score growth.2 
5:121:7883:27:28:72:510:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Glazerman and Protik (2014) conducted the only study so far to use random assignment of 
5:122:7971:28:27:72:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers across schools to test the validity of teacher value-added estimates in predicting student 
5:123:8071:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance across schools. For elementary teachers, they could not reject the hypothesis that 
5:124:8166:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers’ value-added measures from one school were unbiased predictors of teachers’ students’ 
5:125:8260:28:27:72:493:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance after transferring to another school, but they lacked precision to reach any 
5:126:8349:27:28:72:317:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:meaningful conclusion for middle school teachers. 
5:127:8398:28:27:108:536:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In addition to the results from random assignment experiments, three recent studies used 
5:128:8487:27:28:72:513:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a quasi-experimental design to test the predictive validity of teacher effectiveness measures 
5:129:8581:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:derived from student test performance. This quasi-experimental method, introduced by Chetty, 
5:130:8674:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Friedman, and Rockoff (2014a), predicts changes in student test scores using naturally occurring 
5:131:8771:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:variation in teacher assignments as teachers move from school to school and from grade to grade. 
5:132:8866:28:27:72:532:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Using this method, Chetty et al. (2014a) found that teachers’ value-added scores were unbiased 
5:133:8961:27:28:72:529:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimators of changes in student achievement when there were changes in the specific teachers 
5:134:9053:28:28:72:540:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:working in a given grade and subject. Two replication studies applied the same quasi-experiment 
5:135:9147:28:27:72:534:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in different samples and found similar results (Bacher-Hicks, Kane, & Staiger, 2014; Rothstein, 
5:136:9241:27:66:72:113:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2014).3

5:138:9295:8:16:72:538:193:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:2 Kane et al. (2013) also explored the validity of a non-experimental composite measure in predicting student scores 
5:139:9411:16:11:72:508:177:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:on their project-developed supplemental test and on student survey responses following random assignment. 
5:140:9516:11:12:72:514:166:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:However, this composite measure was estimated specifically to predict student state test performance, and not 
5:141:9625:12:11:72:522:154:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:supplemental test performance or student survey responses. With a third year of data in our study, we can create 
5:142:9738:11:12:72:503:143:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:non-experimental estimates tailored specifically to predict supplemental test performance or student survey 
5:143:9846:12:11:72:75:131:97:g_d0_f2:42:g_d0_f2:responses following random assignment. 3
5:144:9884:11:12:75:541:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2: Rothstein (2014) finds little evidence of forecast bias in value added when replicating the preferred specification in 
5:145:10001:12:11:72:527:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Chetty et al. (2014a). However, Rothstein argues that the quasi-experiment itself is not a valid test, since it fails a 
5:146:10121:11:12:72:523:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:placebo test correlating changes in value added with changes in prior test scores. Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 
5:147:10232:12:11:72:512:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:(2014b) respond to this criticism arguing that the placebo test is influenced by a mechanical effect rather than 
5:148:10344:11:0:72:130:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:selection bias. 
6:149:10360:0:27:108:512:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Because the quasi-experiments utilize large, pre-existing administrative data, which 
6:150:10445:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:include many teacher transitions over multiple years, these studies generate substantially more 
6:151:10539:28:27:72:520:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:precise estimates than the experimental evaluations. However, questions about the additional 
6:152:10630:27:28:72:480:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assumptions of these quasi-experiments—specifically that annual changes in teacher 
6:153:10713:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:composition do not correspond with changes in student baseline characteristics—have fueled an 
6:154:10807:28:27:72:497:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ongoing debate on the validity of the quasi-experimental test itself (Chetty et al., 2014b; 
6:155:10898:27:28:72:535:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Goldhaber & Chaplin, 2015; Rothstein, 2010, 2014). Because of this, the current study employs 
6:156:10991:28:27:72:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:random assignment to provide additional experimental evidence on the predictive validity of 
6:157:11082:27:28:72:199:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher quality measures.  
6:158:11108:28:28:108:296:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We make three primary contributions.  
6:159:11143:28:27:108:520:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:First, we provide additional experimental evidence on the predictive validity of value 
6:160:11228:27:28:72:487:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:added in a setting where there were high rates of compliance with randomized teacher 
6:161:11313:28:27:72:533:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assignments. Although some level of non-compliance caused by student and teacher movement 
6:162:11402:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is unavoidable, previous experiments (i.e., Kane et al., 2013) experienced higher levels of non-
6:163:11498:28:28:72:521:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:compliance, as teachers and students subsequently switched classrooms. In the current study, 
6:164:11591:28:27:72:512:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:71% of students and teachers comply with their randomized assignments. Accordingly, our 
6:165:11679:27:28:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:results are less susceptible to the questions about the generalizability of effects to non-compliers. 
6:166:11780:28:27:72:537:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Our results are consistent with previous evidence: test-based value-added measures are unbiased 
6:167:11874:27:28:72:488:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:predictors of teachers’ impacts on student achievement following random assignment. 
6:168:11957:28:28:108:541:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Second, we present the first evidence on the predictive validity of classroom observations 
6:169:12048:28:27:72:515:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and student surveys. Because students are typically not randomly assigned to teachers, such 
6:170:12140:27:28:72:540:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures are potentially susceptible to the same selection biases as the test-based measures. (It is 
6:171:12241:28:0:72:506:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:puzzling that potential bias in classroom observation scores has received so little attention 
7:172:12335:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relative to test-based measures, given that classroom observations typically receive more weight 
7:173:12432:27:28:72:492:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in teacher evaluation systems.)  We find evidence that a teacher’s score on a classroom 
7:174:12520:28:27:72:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observation conducted when students are assigned naturally is an unbiased predictor of the 
7:175:12610:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher’s score on the same rubric when students are assigned randomly. Unfortunately, we lack 
7:176:12705:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the statistical power to draw any conclusions about the predictive validity of student surveys 
7:177:12800:28:27:72:218:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:collected non-experimentally. 
7:178:12829:27:28:108:538:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Finally, we use meta-analytic methods to combine the results from the current study with 
7:179:12918:28:27:72:517:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:those from the two existing within-school random assignment experiments. By doing so, we 
7:180:13005:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:provide a more precise, pooled experimental estimate of the predictive validity of value added. 
7:181:13099:28:28:72:523:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The pooled coefficient indicates that value added is a valid predictor of students’ average test 
7:182:13195:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:scores following random assignment, and is more precise than existing experimental evidence.

7:185:13306:27:28:108:530:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We use data collected for the National Center for Teacher Effectiveness (NCTE) study, 
7:186:13392:28:28:72:503:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which was funded by IES to develop and test the validity of multiple measures of teacher 
7:187:13480:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectiveness. The study comprised four large east coast school districts and spanned three school 
7:188:13578:27:28:72:534:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:years, from 2010-11 through 2012-13. During all three school years, the study collected data on 
7:189:13672:28:27:72:514:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers and students. In the third year, eligible and participating teachers were additionally 
7:190:13768:27:28:72:524:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigned randomly to classroom rosters. Across the four school districts, 316 fourth- and fifth-
7:191:13861:28:28:72:533:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:grade teachers were eligible for and agreed to participate in at least one of the three years of the 
7:192:13960:28:27:72:511:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:study, and 66 teachers were eligible for and agreed to participate in the random assignment 
7:193:14050:27:32:72:258:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:portion of the study in the third year.4

7:195:14136:7:16:72:531:90:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:4 Several factors contributed to the smaller sample of teachers in the random assignment portion of this study. The 
7:196:14250:16:0:72:541:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:most important was teacher movement during the course of the study. Of the 316 teachers who participated in any of 
8:197:14366:0:27:108:484:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:NCTE collected pre-existing administrative data, including classroom rosters,

8:217:15941:12:11:72:511:154:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:high levels of teacher movement are not atypical, especially in urban districts (Papay, Bacher-Hicks, Page, & 
8:218:16051:11:12:72:514:143:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Marinell, 2015). Further, leadership changed in some schools, resulting in a smaller number of principals who 
8:219:16161:12:11:72:528:131:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:remained interested in participating in the random assignment part of the study. Of the 132 teachers, 78 remained 
8:220:16275:11:12:72:530:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:interested in participating and were in schools where leadership remained interested. Among these 78 teachers, 66 
8:221:16388:12:11:72:530:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:satisfied all other conditions for eligibility (e.g., must teach a class of no fewer than five students with current and 
8:222:16509:11:7:72:521:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:baseline state standardized test scores, not be the only remaining teacher in the random assignment block, etc.).  
8:223:16623:7:16:72:536:90:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:5 We present reliability estimates for the four project-administered (i.e., non-state test) measures in Appendix Table 
8:224:16741:16:0:72:374:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:A1. Cronbach’s alpha ranges from 0.78 to 0.91 across these four measures. 
9:225:16815:0:27:108:535:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Students’ scores on state standardized tests came from three different tests, as two of the 
9:226:16907:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:four participating districts were situated in the same state. There was considerable variability in 
9:227:17007:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the format and cognitive demand of items across tests. For example, students in one district took 
9:228:17105:27:28:72:508:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assessments that were completely composed of multiple-choice items, whereas students in 
9:229:17193:28:28:72:510:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:another district took assessments with open-ended items that were markedly more difficult

9:231:17377:27:28:72:510:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:student test scores by district, grade, and academic year using van der Waerden rank-based

9:238:17960:27:28:72:536:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:choice items. Similar to the state test scores, we standardized these test scores to have a mean of 
9:239:18057:28:28:72:516:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:zero and a standard deviation of one, within grade and school year. Because the test was the 
9:240:18150:28:27:72:528:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:same across districts (unlike the state test scores), we preserved between-district differences in 
9:241:18248:27:28:72:177:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:means and variances. 
9:242:18268:28:27:108:536:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The MQI and CLASS teacher observation measures were based on up to three video and 
9:243:18349:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:audio recordings of mathematics lessons per teacher per year. Teachers selected which lessons to 
9:244:18445:28:28:72:502:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:record, under the condition that they choose lessons typical of their teaching; on average, 
9:245:18536:28:27:72:519:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:recorded lessons lasted approximately one hour.6 The videos were scored on two established 
9:246:18626:27:20:72:522:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observation instruments: MQI (Hill et al., 2008) and CLASS (La Paro et al., 2012). The MQI 
9:247:18714:20:7:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
9:248:18761:7:17:72:538:102:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:6 No sanctions or rewards were associated with the study, so teachers had no explicit incentive to strategically select 
9:249:18879:17:11:72:534:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:when to record their lessons. Ho and Kane (2013) find that teacher rankings, based on classroom observation, were 
9:250:18991:11:0:72:329:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:stable between teachers’ self-selected lessons and other lessons. 
10:251:19057:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:instrument was designed to assess teacher proficiency in delivering rich, error-free, reform-based 
10:252:19156:27:28:72:534:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mathematics instruction. It comprised 14 codes, which capture practices during instruction such 
10:253:19250:28:27:72:527:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as: using multiple approaches to solve problems; (in)correctly using mathematical language or 
10:254:19344:27:28:72:450:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:notation; and remediating student mathematical difficulties (Hill et al., 2008).  
10:255:19425:28:28:108:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The CLASS, which measures general pedagogical practice and is agnostic to the subject-
10:256:19511:28:27:72:511:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:matter of instruction, comprised 12 codes and assesses teachers on more general classroom 
10:257:19600:27:28:72:526:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:practices and features such as: the positive or negative climate of the classroom; the quality of 
10:258:19697:28:27:72:520:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the feedback provided by the teacher; the behavior management skills of the teacher; and the 
10:259:19789:27:28:72:539:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:level of engagement of students during instruction (La Paro et al., 2012). To generate a teacher’s 
10:260:19888:28:28:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:annual overall MQI observation score, we first averaged scores across codes within a lesson, and 
10:261:19984:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:then across lessons within a year for each teacher. Because the instrument was the same across 
10:262:20077:27:28:72:528:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fourth and fifth grade and across districts, we standardized these teacher-level scores to have a 
10:263:20174:28:27:72:495:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mean of zero and a standard deviation of one within school year. We followed the same 
10:264:20259:27:28:72:367:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:procedure to estimate a teacher’s CLASS observation score.7 
10:265:20317:28:28:108:537:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Finally, we derived a measure from student responses to a perception survey, comprising 
10:266:20404:28:27:72:538:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:26 Likert-scale items based on the Tripod survey (Ferguson, 2009). These items covered a range 
10:267:20497:27:28:72:525:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of topics, such as whether students felt that: the mathematics presented by his/her teacher was 
10:268:20589:28:27:72:537:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:engaging; his/her teacher cared about the students; his/her teacher challenged students to engage 
10:269:20685:27:28:72:521:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with the mathematics; his/her teacher presented mathematical content clearly; his/her teacher 
10:270:20777:28:28:72:503:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regularly assessed the understanding of material presented during lessons; his/her teacher 
10:271:20867:28:47:72:528:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:provided useful feedback; or the classroom stayed productive during mathematics lessons. We 
10:272:20959:47:7:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
10:273:21006:7:17:72:532:102:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:7 MQI and CLASS observation measures are standardized at the teacher level since student-level data do not exist; 
10:274:21119:17:11:72:509:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:the measures derived from students’ state test scores, project-developed test scores, and survey responses are 
10:275:21230:11:0:72:204:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:standardized at the student level. 
11:276:21266:0:27:72:520:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:calculated the simple average across responses to all 26 items and standardized these student-
11:277:21357:27:28:72:482:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:level scores to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one within school year. 
11:278:21439:28:27:108:529:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:For the three measures with student-level data (i.e., state test scores, project test scores, 
11:279:21533:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Tripod responses), we generated an estimate of teacher quality as the teacher-year level 
11:280:21624:28:28:72:377:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:average residuals from the following OLS regression equation:

11:284:21924:30:29:72:530:482:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the following control variables: !",%'(, a cubic polynomial of student i’s baseline achievement;

11:289:22411:30:30:72:522:337:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:typical in value-added models, we estimated teacher-year residuals (3$,%5%6%7_97:%) by averaging

11:291:22598:29:30:72:532:278:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher k in year t. We followed an analogous process to generate teacher-year residuals for the 
11:292:22693:30:30:72:536:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:project-developed test (3$,%;<=>7?%_97:%) and for the student survey results (3$,%5@<A7B) using Equation 
11:293:22798:30:28:72:484:218:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1 by changing the dependent variable to standardized test scores on the project test or 
11:294:22885:28:27:72:239:190:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:standardized scores on the survey. 
11:295:22919:27:28:108:501:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Because student-level data did not exist for the two measures based on classroom 
11:296:23000:28:27:72:520:135:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observations, we generated teacher-year residuals for those measures by fitting the following

12:301:23330:27:29:72:527:652:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:test scores and averages of the student characteristics, +",%. We estimated this model separately 
12:302:23426:29:30:72:540:623:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for the standardized MQI and the CLASS classroom observations scores in order to generate two

12:304:23620:30:27:72:437:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these teacher-year residuals to generate predictions of teacher performance.

12:307:23746:28:27:108:540:480:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:During the second year of data collection (2011-12), the NCTE project team worked with 
12:308:23833:27:28:72:527:453:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:staff at participating schools to identify the teachers who met the necessary requirements to be 
12:309:23930:28:27:72:513:425:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:part of the random assignment sample in the third year of the study (2012-13). The primary 
12:310:24020:27:28:72:512:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:eligibility conditions to participate in the random assignment part of the study were that (a) 
12:311:24115:28:28:72:536:370:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers had to be part of a group of two or more NCTE project teachers who were scheduled to 
12:312:24209:28:27:72:537:342:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teach the same grade in that school, and (b) principals had to view the teachers within this group 
12:313:24308:27:28:72:524:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as being capable of teaching any of the classroom rosters designated for the group of teachers 
12:314:24403:28:27:72:233:287:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:without any major adjustments.8  
12:315:24434:27:28:108:541:260:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Teachers satisfying these two conditions were placed into a randomization block of either 
12:316:24524:28:28:72:531:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:two or three teachers. School administrators generated one classroom roster per teacher in each 
12:317:24619:28:27:72:491:204:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomization block. For example, if a randomization block had three teachers, school 
12:318:24705:27:34:72:515:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:administrators would construct three rosters of students. After school administrators created 
12:319:24799:34:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
12:320:24846:7:16:72:519:136:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:8 In some cases, certain students were required to be paired with specific teachers within a randomization block 
12:321:24958:16:12:72:530:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:(e.g., if only one teacher was certified to instruct students with limited English proficiency). In these cases, NCTE 
12:322:25075:12:11:72:528:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:staff allowed these students to be paired non-randomly with the appropriate teacher, and then filled the remaining 
12:323:25190:11:12:72:505:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:seats in the classroom randomly. We exclude these non-randomly-placed students from all analyses that are 
12:324:25296:12:11:72:535:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:restricted to the random assignment sample, but we include them when generating aggregate peer control variables. 
12:325:25409:11:0:72:474:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Approximately 7% of the students in the random assignment classrooms were paired non-randomly. 
13:326:25505:0:27:72:516:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these rosters, they were submitted to the NCTE study team, who randomly matched eligible 
13:327:25594:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers with classrooms and then returned the matched rosters to school administrators. Of the 
13:328:25690:28:27:72:503:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:29 total randomization blocks, 21 contained two teachers, and 8 contained three teachers. 
13:329:25778:27:28:108:510:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In an ideal setting, every randomly assigned student would have been taught by the 
13:330:25861:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher to whom they were randomly assigned. However, since these rosters were constructed 
13:331:25952:28:27:72:537:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:before the start of the random assignment year, a certain amount of movement was unavoidable. 
13:332:26046:27:28:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Table 1, we document the disposition of the 1,177 students in the random assignment sample. 
13:333:26141:28:27:72:519:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Notably, 71% of these students remained in their randomly assigned classroom for the entire 
13:334:26233:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school year. This is a significant improvement from prior randomization studies. For example, 
13:335:26325:28:28:72:534:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across the six sites described in Kane et al. (2013), between 27% and 66% of students remained 
13:336:26420:28:27:72:257:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in their randomly assigned classroom.

13:339:26482:27:28:108:519:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Tables 2 and 3, we present a series of descriptive statistics to examine whether the 
13:340:26570:28:28:72:526:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:students and teachers who participated in this study were representative of those from the four 
13:341:26665:28:27:72:526:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:NCTE districts. We use data from the first two years of the study, which allows us to examine 
13:342:26758:27:28:72:535:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the characteristics of students naturally assigned by schools to the teachers in our sample, rather 
13:343:26858:28:27:72:441:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:than the characteristics of those who were subsequently randomly assigned.  
13:344:26930:27:28:108:518:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Table 2, we explore these student characteristics among three distinct subsamples: 
13:345:27016:28:28:72:531:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:students assigned to teachers who subsequently participated in random assignment (column 1); 
13:346:27109:28:27:72:539:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:students assigned to teachers who participated in the project in any of the three years, but did not 
13:347:27210:27:0:72:516:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:participate in random assignment (column 2); students assigned to all other fourth- and fifth-
14:348:27305:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:grade mathematics teachers in these four districts (column 3).9 Compared to teachers who did not 
14:349:27401:27:28:72:541:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:participate in the project (column 3), teachers who participated in random assignment (column 1) 
14:350:27498:28:27:72:515:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were more likely to have been assigned white students and less likely to have been assigned 
14:351:27590:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:special education and FRPL-eligible students. In addition, the average baseline test score of 
14:352:27683:28:28:72:515:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:students assigned to teachers who participated in random assignment was 0.12 student-level 
14:353:27773:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:standard deviations higher than other project non-random assignment project teachers (column 2) 
14:354:27868:27:28:72:526:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and 0.07 standard deviations higher than non-project teachers (column 3). These results imply 
14:355:27962:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that teachers included in the random assignment experiment tended to be assigned—in the years 
14:356:28054:27:28:72:535:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prior to random assignment—classrooms with somewhat more advanced students. This is likely 
14:357:28143:28:28:72:517:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:an artifact of our sample design: eligibility required that teachers be capable of teaching any 
14:358:28237:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:classroom within their randomization block, which generally excluded specialized teachers (e.g., 
14:359:28333:27:28:72:494:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:special education teachers). As such, we caution against over-interpreting our results as 
14:360:28423:28:27:72:207:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:extending to these teachers. 
14:361:28450:27:28:108:523:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Table 3, we present means and standard deviations for our five measures of teacher 
14:362:28536:28:28:72:523:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:quality. We again report these statistics for three distinct groups of teachers and use data only 
14:363:28634:28:29:72:540:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from the two years prior to random assignment. In the first row, we report teacher-level residuals 
14:364:28733:29:29:72:504:265:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:based on students’ state test performance (i.e., 3$,%5%6%7_97:% from Equation 1). Although the 
14:365:28827:29:28:72:524:236:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:average teacher residuals are nearly identical for the project teachers who were not part of the 
14:366:28924:28:28:72:534:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomized experiment and all other fourth and fifth grade teachers, they were somewhat lower 
14:367:29018:28:27:72:531:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for the teachers who participated in the randomized experiment. Since the other measures were 
14:368:29112:27:28:72:521:153:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:only collected for teachers who participated in the NCTE project, we can only compare them 
14:369:29203:28:28:72:542:125:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across the random assignment sample and the non-random assignment project sample. Unlike for 
14:370:29295:28:7:72:219:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
14:371:29342:7:16:72:537:90:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:9 Although we determine the three subsamples based on whether teachers participated in the experiment in the third 
14:372:29456:16:0:72:492:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:year of the study, all of the student data used in Table 2 comes only from the first two years of the study. 
15:373:29566:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the state test residuals, the random assignment teachers had somewhat higher mean residuals on 
15:374:29661:27:28:72:516:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the project-developed test, but lower mean residuals for the two observation metrics and the 
15:375:29754:28:27:72:208:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:student perception surveys.  
15:376:29782:27:28:108:514:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the middle panel of Table 3, we present standard deviations for the five measures 
15:377:29867:28:28:72:522:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across the three subsamples of teachers. Although the random assignment group exhibits less 
15:378:29959:28:27:72:529:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:variation in the MQI observation measure and the student survey measure, they exhibit similar 
15:379:30053:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:variation to the other project teachers in the other three measures. Finally, in the lower panel of 
15:380:30153:28:27:72:515:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 3, we estimate the persistent component of a teacher’s effectiveness estimate (i.e., the 
15:381:30247:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“signal” standard deviation) for each of the five measures, by calculating the square root of the 
15:382:30345:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:covariance in the first two years of the study for each of the five measures. The signal is virtually 
15:383:30447:28:27:72:496:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:identical across the three samples for the state test measure. However, for the other four 
15:384:30538:27:28:72:521:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures the signal is considerably less in the random assignment sample. This suggests that 
15:385:30631:28:27:72:530:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:although the random assignment sample of teachers had a similar distribution of “true” teacher 
15:386:30726:27:28:72:493:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effects based on the state test, they were a more homogeneous sample on the other four 
15:387:30812:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures. Unfortunately, this reduced variation in true effects on the other four measures reduces 
15:388:30910:28:27:72:512:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the precision for our validation test, especially for the CLASS observation measure and the 
15:389:31002:27:28:72:114:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surveys. 
15:390:31010:28:27:108:513:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Finally, in Table 4, we explore whether there were systematic differences in student 
15:391:31094:27:28:72:517:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:compliance. We present characteristics of the students who did not remain in their randomly 
15:392:31186:28:28:72:511:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigned classrooms (“switchers”) and compare them to the students who remained in their 
15:393:31274:28:27:72:502:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomly assigned classrooms for the duration of the 2012-13 school year (“compliers”). 
15:394:31362:27:28:72:528:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Although the switchers and compliers were not statistically significantly different, on average, 
15:395:31459:28:0:72:530:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across seven of the eight observable characteristics in Table 4, the switchers were less likely to 
16:396:31559:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be classified as having limited English proficiency. However, because this result may be driven 
16:397:31655:27:28:72:538:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:by multiple hypothesis testing, we also conduct a test of joint significance.10 The p-value for this 
16:398:31755:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:joint hypothesis test was 0.40, meaning we could not reject the null hypothesis that these eight 
16:399:31851:27:28:72:497:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics are jointly unrelated to compliance. We also note that most of the student 
16:400:31941:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:movement occurred early in the school year, before students had much of a chance to experience 
16:401:32034:28:27:72:515:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a teacher’s effectiveness (79% of non-compliers moved before the first time NCTE verified 
16:402:32123:27:28:72:497:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:classroom rosters in the fall semester) and many students who did not comply with their 
16:403:32211:28:27:72:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomly assigned classroom left the school or the district, which is unlikely to be driven by 
16:404:32306:27:28:72:511:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher assignments. We, therefore, conclude that there is little evidence that compliers are 
16:405:32397:28:28:72:281:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantially different from non-compliers.

16:407:32440:27:28:247:367:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:III. Empirical Strategy 
16:408:32463:28:27:108:500:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Our empirical strategy involves two steps. First, we generate estimates of teacher 
16:409:32544:27:28:72:528:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance in the years prior to the experiment. Second, we evaluate whether these estimates 
16:410:32637:28:28:72:502:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:accurately predict teacher performance following random assignment.11 We describe this 
16:411:32723:28:27:72:241:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:empirical strategy in detail below.  
16:412:32758:27:28:108:111:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
16:413:32758:28:15:72:300:239:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A. Predicting teachers’ expected performance 
16:414:32802:15:8:72:219:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
16:415:32849:8:16:72:524:216:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:10 To test for joint significance, we use a randomization omnibus test, which is preferred to a conventional F-test 
16:416:32963:16:11:72:524:200:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:with a small number of clusters (Young, 2015). We first draw 1000 block-bootstrapped samples (clustered at the 
16:417:33074:11:12:72:536:189:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:random assignment block level) and within each draw, we reassign each student’s compliance status randomly. For 
16:418:33186:12:11:72:528:177:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:each bootstrapped sample, we calculate the conventional F-statistic of joint significance. Then, we generate our p-
16:419:33301:11:12:72:533:166:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:value as the fraction of bootstrapped null F-statistics that are greater than the actual F-statistic. We use this general 
16:420:33423:12:7:72:299:154:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:approach for joint hypothesis tests throughout the paper. 
16:421:33479:7:16:72:533:147:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:11 This strategy assumes that the teachers who participate in the random assignment experiment were not already—
16:422:33590:16:11:72:508:131:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:in the years prior to random assignment—being assigned classrooms under a process that was random. If the 
16:423:33696:11:12:72:529:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:participating teachers were limited to those who were already effectively assigned classrooms at random, then the 
16:424:33810:12:11:72:534:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:results of this test would not be generalizable to settings in which classrooms are not randomly assigned. However, 
16:425:33925:11:12:72:530:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:similar to Kane et al. (2013), we find strong evidence that the teachers who participated in the random experiment 
16:426:34040:12:11:72:539:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:were—in the years prior to the experiment—not already being assigned students under a random process. Please see 
16:427:34153:11:0:72:167:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Appendix B for details. 
17:428:34178:0:27:108:536:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To generate predictions of teacher performance, we use the two years of data prior to the 
17:429:34268:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experiment to identify the best linear combination of teacher measures from one year to predict 
17:430:34363:28:27:72:496:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher performance in an adjacent year. Specifically, we use the five teacher-year level 
17:431:34453:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures from the second year of the study to predict each of these five measures in the first year 
17:432:34553:28:30:72:511:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:using a separate OLS equation of the following form for each of the five teacher measures: 
17:433:34642:30:32:108:439:568:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                  3$,J(K=,(K3$,JL5%6%7_97:%+,LK3$,JL;<=>7?%_97:%+,MK3$,JL5@<A7B+

17:435:34792:30:32:72:538:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The outcome variable, 3$,J(K, is the mean residual for teacher k on measure m in the first year and 
17:436:34886:32:30:72:513:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the predictor variables, 3$,JL5%6%7_97:%, 3$,JL;<=>7?%_97:%, 3$,JL5@<A7B, 3$,JLDEF, and 3$,JLGHI55, are the average 
17:437:35002:30:28:72:520:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residuals for teacher k in the second year. In addition to these predictor variables, we include 
17:438:35097:28:29:72:533:416:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:indicators for novice teachers (RSTUVW$,JL) and teachers with a master’s degree (CYZ[W\Z$,JL), 
17:439:35191:29:28:72:328:387:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and district fixed effects (12K). The error term is ]$K.  
17:440:35244:28:28:108:540:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Then, we apply these coefficients from Equation 3 to the teacher-level measures from the 
17:441:35332:28:27:72:503:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:second year to generate predictions of teacher performance in the third year—the random 
17:442:35420:27:28:72:509:304:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assignment year. We generate five different predictions—one for each of the five outcome 
17:443:35509:28:29:72:497:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures, m—and denote them as _$,JMK.12 Note that as measurement error increases, the 
17:444:35595:29:28:72:523:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coefficients will tend to zero. Thus, by generating a linear combination of measures from one 
17:445:35688:28:41:72:522:219:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:year to predict another year, we not only combine information across several types of teacher 
17:446:35782:41:8:72:219:178:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
17:447:35829:8:16:72:530:170:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:12 For teachers who do not have scores on all five predictor measures, we estimate separate models only including 
17:448:35941:16:11:72:523:154:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:the predictors that were not missing for those teachers. Using this algorithm, we predict a teacher’s performance 
17:449:36055:11:12:72:515:143:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:using all of the available information. For example, although all teachers have value-added estimates, teachers 
17:450:36165:12:11:72:542:131:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:entering the project in 2012-13 do not have observation or survey scores in the years prior to random assignment. To 
17:451:36281:11:12:72:509:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:generate predictions for these teachers we only include value-added as a predictor and fit the model using all 
17:452:36392:12:11:72:528:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:teachers who also had value-added estimates (including those who also may have had scores on other predictors). 
17:453:36504:11:12:72:531:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:First-year teachers in 2012-13 do not have any of the five measures of effectiveness from 2011-12 or 2012-13, but 
17:454:36618:12:11:72:541:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:we can still generate coarse predictions of their third year effectiveness using indicators for having a master’s degree 
17:455:36739:11:0:72:301:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:and indicators for the school district in which they teach. 
18:456:36800:0:27:72:477:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance measures, we also produce a “shrunken” estimate that accounts for the 
18:457:36879:27:28:72:412:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measurement error (Mihaly, McCaffrey, Staiger, & Lockwood, 2013).

18:460:37020:28:28:72:514:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: To estimate the relationship between our predictions of teacher performance and the 
18:461:37103:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:actual outcomes following random assignment, we use an instrumental variables (IV) estimator. 
18:462:37195:27:28:72:519:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:While we are confident that the effectiveness of a student’s randomly assigned teacher is not 
18:463:37288:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:correlated with observable or unobservable student characteristics, we cannot be sure that the 
18:464:37383:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectiveness of the actual teacher is not. For example, as we documented in Table 1, although 
18:465:37477:28:28:72:531:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:our compliance was higher than in past random assignment studies, there was some reshuffling 
18:466:37570:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of students to different classrooms within the school, which may not have been random (e.g., it 
18:467:37666:27:28:72:538:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:could have followed the same sorting that occurs in a typical year). Therefore, we instrument for 
18:468:37764:28:27:72:531:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the effectiveness of a student’s actual teacher with the effectiveness of their randomly assigned

19:479:38618:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that a one standard deviation unit increase in assigned teacher performance was associated with

19:486:39163:28:27:72:343:500:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:project-based test scores, and student survey responses.  
19:487:39218:27:28:108:534:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The IV model described in Equations 4 and 5 requires student-level data, so it cannot be 
19:488:39307:28:27:72:513:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:used to estimate the relationship between teachers’ predicted and actual observation scores, 
19:489:39400:27:28:72:504:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which vary at the teacher level. Instead, we use the following teacher-level OLS model to 
19:490:39489:28:28:72:511:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimate the relationship between of teachers’ predicted observation scores and their actual

19:494:39799:29:30:72:533:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Equation 2 and the predictor, _$,JMK, is the teacher-level prediction for measure m from Equation 
19:495:39895:30:28:72:539:246:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:3. The coefficient dfH5Kis the OLS estimate for the two teacher-level outcomes: MQI and CLASS 
19:496:39987:28:27:72:519:218:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observations. Although the IV estimates in Equation 5 are not biased by students who do not 
19:497:40076:27:28:72:538:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:comply with their random teacher assignments, the OLS estimates in Equation 6 could be biased 
19:498:40168:28:27:72:519:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:if students selectively move from their randomly assigned classrooms. As we documented in 
19:499:40257:27:28:72:486:136:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 4, we find little evidence that non-compliance is related to students’ observable 
19:500:40345:28:28:72:514:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics. Of course, non-compliance could be related to unobserved differences (e.g., 
19:501:40437:28:0:72:496:80:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:motivation, parental involvement), but the balance on observable characteristics and the 
20:502:40526:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relatively high compliance rates suggest that these OLS estimates are unlikely to be substantially 
20:503:40624:27:28:72:108:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:biased.

20:507:40682:28:27:108:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Table 5, we report estimates of Equation 3 for the sample of teachers who have data on 
20:508:40770:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:all five predictor measures. The five columns present the coefficients used to predict each of the 
20:509:40866:28:27:72:524:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:five teacher measures, using the best linear combination of all five measures from an adjacent 
20:510:40961:27:28:72:521:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:year. By fitting different models to predict each of the five measures, we highlight how these 
20:511:41056:28:28:72:273:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:weights differ depending on the measure. 
20:512:41096:28:27:108:514:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Although the weights differ substantially across the five outcomes, one clear pattern 
20:513:41182:27:28:72:537:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:emerges: the most weight is always assigned to the measure that is the same as the outcome. For 
20:514:41276:28:27:72:523:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:example, in the first column, we present coefficients from the regression of 2010-11 state test 
20:515:41372:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:value-added on the five 2011-12 measures. Among the five predictor measures, we find that the 
20:516:41466:28:28:72:526:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2011-12 state test value-added receives the most weight (0.504) and is statistically significant. 
20:517:41563:28:27:72:515:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The coefficient of 0.504 implies that for each student-level standard deviation that a teacher 
20:518:41658:27:28:72:537:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generated this year, we estimate approximately half a student-level standard deviation next year, 
20:519:41756:28:27:72:516:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:controlling for other teacher measures. The other four measures follow a similar pattern: the 
20:520:41850:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:most weight is placed on the predictor that comes from the same measure as the outcome and the 
20:521:41943:28:28:72:525:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coefficients on these predictors are always statistically significant. However, the magnitude is 
20:522:42038:28:27:72:507:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:lower than for the state test, ranging from 0.242 to 0.391. The attenuation in these weights 
20:523:42130:27:28:72:526:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:indicates more year-to-year volatility in these four teacher residuals, relative the those derived 
20:524:42228:28:0:72:166:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from the state test.  
21:525:42250:0:27:108:523:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Although the predictor that comes from the same measure as the outcome is given the 
21:526:42333:27:28:72:500:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:most weight, in some cases other predictor variables are also statistically significant. For 
21:527:42424:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:example, although the 2011-12 project-developed test is the strongest predictor of the 2010-11 
21:528:42516:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:project-developed test (0.274), the 2011-12 state test is also a statistically significant predictor 
21:529:42613:28:28:72:523:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(0.184). This highlights the benefit of using additional information from multiple measures to 
21:530:42708:28:27:72:183:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generate predictions.13

21:533:42806:27:28:108:528:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Table 6, we present the results from Equations 5 and 6, which represent the effect of

21:535:42987:28:27:72:494:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We follow Kane et al. (2013) and include controls for students’ baseline test scores and 
21:536:43073:27:28:72:513:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:background characteristics, but not peer characteristics.14 Recall from our discussion of our 
21:537:43165:28:27:72:483:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:empirical strategy, the predicted teacher outcomes have been “shrunk” to account for 
21:538:43250:27:28:72:531:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measurement error. Thus, we would expect—if there were no bias—that the coefficients on the 
21:539:43341:28:28:72:383:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shrunken predictions of teacher performance to be equal to one.  
21:540:43405:28:28:108:530:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the first three columns of Table 6, we report the IV estimates of dFeK for the state test, 
21:541:43497:28:27:72:501:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the project-developed test, and student perception scores, based on Equation 5. The most 
21:542:43586:27:38:72:514:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:precisely estimated coefficient is in column 1, where we constructed a prediction of teacher

21:544:43725:8:16:72:533:193:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:13 We note that the coefficient on the project-based test is negative (-0.184) when predicting CLASS. Since all five 
21:545:43841:16:11:72:536:177:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:predictor variables are measures of classroom quality, we expect a certain amount of multicollinearity to impact the 
21:546:43957:11:12:72:507:166:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:estimates in Table 5. This would be concerning if we were interested in identifying the causal impacts of the 
21:547:44067:12:11:72:515:154:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:individual predictor variables. However, since this step of the analysis simply solves a prediction problem, the 
21:548:44180:11:12:72:507:143:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:coefficients on each predictor are not a major focus. We caution against the over-interpretation of individual 
21:549:44291:12:11:72:79:131:97:g_d0_f2:42:g_d0_f2:parameter estimates, especially the negative relationship between CLASS and project-based test. 14
21:550:44388:11:12:78:515:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2: In theory, the coefficients should remain unchanged by the introduction of students’ baseline test scores and 
21:551:44498:12:11:72:520:108:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:background characteristics and including additional student-level controls will increase precision. However, we 
21:552:44610:11:12:72:519:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:choose not to include peer controls because peers were not randomly assigned and any subsequent non-random 
21:553:44716:12:11:72:537:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:student movement of actual peers could introduce bias if we controlled for peers. However, we provide results from 
21:554:44831:11:0:72:398:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:a taxonomy of models in Table 7 and the results are robust to each specification.  
22:555:44915:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:impacts as it relates to students’ state test performance. Using this measure of teacher effects, the 
22:556:45014:27:28:72:512:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coefficient on predicted teacher effectiveness on student achievement is 0.847 with a block-
22:557:45106:28:27:72:507:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:bootstrapped standard error of 0.228.15  Thus, we are able to reject the hypothesis that this 
22:558:45196:27:28:72:508:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coefficient is zero and fail to reject the hypothesis that this coefficient is one (i.e., the 95% 
22:559:45294:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:confidence interval of this estimate contains one, but not zero). In other words, we cannot reject 
22:560:45392:28:27:72:500:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the hypothesis that a one-unit increase in a teacher’s predicted effectiveness, on average, 
22:561:45483:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:produces a one-unit change in student state test outcomes after random assignment. This finding 
22:562:45578:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is consistent with the two previous within-school random assignment studies (Kane et al., 2013; 
22:563:45674:27:28:72:500:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Kane & Staiger, 2008) and is the third piece of experimental evidence that teacher effect 
22:564:45764:28:28:72:532:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates, based on students’ state standardized test scores, are a forecast unbiased estimator of 
22:565:45862:28:27:72:234:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:student achievement, on average. 
22:566:45894:27:28:108:536:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the second column of Table 6, we present the IV estimate using the project-developed 
22:567:45982:28:27:72:487:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:test instead of the state standardized test scores.16 The coefficient on predicted teacher 
22:568:46072:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectiveness on student achievement in the project-developed test is 1.486 with a standard error 
22:569:46168:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of 0.267. Similar to the state test outcomes, we reject the hypothesis that this coefficient was zero 
22:570:46267:28:27:72:538:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and fail to reject the hypothesis that this coefficient was one (i.e., the 95% confidence interval of 
22:571:46369:27:28:72:527:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this estimate contains one, but not zero). In the third column, we present the IV estimate using 
22:572:46464:28:27:72:499:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the student perception survey to construct the non-experimental prediction of a teacher’s 
22:573:46552:27:28:72:531:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectiveness and as the post-randomization student outcome. Unfortunately, the point estimate 
22:574:46646:28:18:72:508:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for this measure (-0.228) is imprecise, with a standard error of 0.778. The 95% confidence 
22:575:46733:18:7:72:219:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
22:576:46780:7:16:72:539:159:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:15 Since we have a small number of randomization blocks, we present block-bootstrapped standard errors, which are 
22:577:46893:16:12:72:534:143:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:preferred to cluster-robust standard errors when there are a small number of clusters (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller, 
22:578:47008:12:11:72:506:131:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:2008). We use 1000 bootstrap draws, clustered at the random assignment block level. This approach is used 
22:579:47114:11:12:72:506:120:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:throughout the paper to generate standard errors when we cluster at the random assignment block level. The 
22:580:47219:12:11:72:79:108:97:g_d0_f2:42:g_d0_f2:bootstrapped standard errors are slightly larger than those obtained using asymptotic theory.  16
22:581:47315:11:12:78:515:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2: Note that both the outcome of the IV model changes from the state to the project-developed test and that the 
22:582:47423:12:11:72:506:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:prediction of teacher effects is also based on the best linear combination of measures that predict the project-
22:583:47535:11:0:72:252:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:developed test score residuals (see Table 5).  
23:584:47583:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:interval of this estimate contains both zero and one and the imprecision of this estimate prevents 
23:585:47680:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:us from reaching any meaningful conclusions on the validity of this measure. This imprecision is 
23:586:47775:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:likely due in part to the fact that we are unable to control for students’ baseline survey responses 
23:587:47876:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the model represented by Equation 5. While we control for the same vector of variables as we 
23:588:47971:28:28:72:502:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:did in the first two columns (including, notably, students’ baseline state test scores) these 
23:589:48065:28:27:72:508:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:controls fail to explain a substantial portion of variation in students’ survey responses. We 
23:590:48158:27:28:72:503:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:comment on this limitation and provide suggestions for future research in the conclusion. 
23:591:48247:28:28:108:538:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the last two columns of Table 6, we present the OLS estimates of dfH5K (from Equation 
23:592:48335:28:28:72:528:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:6) for MQI and CLASS. For MQI, we find that the non-experimental scores have an estimated 
23:593:48423:28:27:72:542:459:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:impact of 0.926 on MQI scores following random assignment, with a standard error of 0.284. For 
23:594:48515:27:28:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:CLASS, the coefficient is 0.877, with a substantially larger standard error of 0.543. Thus, similar 
23:595:48613:28:27:72:525:404:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to the findings for state and project test scores, we find no evidence that the non-experimental 
23:596:48709:27:28:72:507:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:classroom observation predictions are biased for MQI. However, the standard error on the 
23:597:48795:28:28:72:521:349:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimate for the CLASS observation metric is large and the 95% confidence interval contains 
23:598:48884:28:27:72:526:321:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:both zero and one. As a result, we are unable to reach any meaningful conclusions on possible 
23:599:48978:27:28:72:507:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:presence of bias in those non-experimental estimates based on teacher performance on the 
23:600:49066:28:27:72:535:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:CLASS observation metric. As noted above, this is likely driven by the lower “signal” variation 
23:601:49159:27:28:72:340:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in CLASS, relative to the other measures (see Table 3). 
23:602:49214:28:27:72:524:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In Table 7, we explore the impact of including different student and peer controls. We 
23:603:49301:27:28:72:492:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:focus this analysis on our most precisely estimated outcome: the state mathematics test 
23:604:49387:28:28:72:528:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance. In theory, since students were randomly assigned, the inclusion (or exclusion) of 
23:605:49481:28:27:72:535:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:student-level controls should not substantially change our estimates. However, to the extent that 
23:606:49578:27:0:72:538:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:additional control variables explain a significant portion of residual variation in the outcome, we 
24:607:49680:0:27:72:517:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expect precision to improve. In the first column, we only include controls for randomization 
24:608:49773:27:28:72:521:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:block, which resulted in a coefficient of 0.755. In the second column, we include controls for 
24:609:49866:28:27:72:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:students’ baseline achievement on state mathematics tests, which produced a coefficient of 
24:610:49955:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:0.848. The third column presents our preferred specification (also reported Table 6), which 
24:611:50046:28:28:72:500:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:additionally includes controls for students’ demographics characteristics and generated a 
24:612:50135:28:27:72:539:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coefficient of 0.847. Finally, in the fourth column, we include additional controls for the average 
24:613:50233:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics of the students’ in each student’s classroom; the coefficient was 0.715.17 Although 
24:614:50331:28:27:72:529:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:all four models generate substantively similar point estimates, the inclusion of baseline student 
24:615:50429:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achievement controls (column 2) reduces the standard errors substantially from the model with 
24:616:50523:28:28:72:510:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:only fixed effects for random assignment block (column 1), highlighting the importance of 
24:617:50613:28:27:72:325:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:including baseline controls for this type of analysis.

24:620:50711:27:28:108:538:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In order to facilitate comparison between our study and the existing studies exploring the 
24:621:50802:28:28:72:493:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:predictive validity of test-based teacher quality, in Figure 1 we present our main results 
24:622:50891:28:27:72:515:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:alongside the main results from the five previous validation studies. Each bar represents the 
24:623:50985:27:28:72:533:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coefficient on teachers’ value-added in predicting outcomes following random or quasi-random 
24:624:51078:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assignment. A value of one indicates that the non-experimental estimates are unbiased predictors. 
24:625:51174:27:28:72:509:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In addition to point estimates, we plot the 95% confidence intervals around each estimate.  
24:626:51265:28:28:108:504:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The first three bars in Figure 1 report the findings from previous large-scale quasi-
24:627:51350:28:36:72:509:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experimental studies that applied the teacher-switching identification strategy proposed by 
24:628:51442:36:7:72:219:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                
24:629:51489:7:16:72:539:113:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:17 Although students were randomly assigned, because of student movement following random assignment, the peer 
24:630:51599:16:12:72:529:97:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:group that remained in the classroom is not guaranteed to be random. We explore this possibility in the Threats to 
24:631:51714:12:11:72:532:85:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Validity section and find that the actual peer characteristics are unrelated to assigned teacher quality. Moreover, in 
24:632:51833:11:0:72:396:74:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:Table 7 we find that our main estimates are similar across all four specifications. 
25:633:51918:0:27:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Chetty et al. (2014a) to data on mathematics and English test scores from grades four through 
25:634:52010:27:28:72:519:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:eight from three different datasets. Each of these studies provides a precise estimate with the 
25:635:52105:28:27:72:541:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:confidence interval including one, implying that, in each independent study, they could not reject 
25:636:52204:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the null hypothesis that the non-experimental estimates are unbiased predictors of teacher effects. 
25:637:52302:28:28:72:538:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The next three bars report the findings from the two previous within-school experimental studies 
25:638:52397:28:27:72:541:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and from the current study, each of which are based on randomly assigning mathematics teachers 
25:639:52492:27:28:72:515:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to classrooms. The confidence intervals for each of these estimates also include one, but are 
25:640:52586:28:27:72:508:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantially wider than the corresponding intervals for the large-scale quasi-experimental 
25:641:52678:27:28:72:114:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:studies.  
25:642:52687:28:28:108:535:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the last bar in Figure 1, we use meta-analytic methods to combine the results from the 
25:643:52777:28:27:72:537:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:three random assignment studies. Using a chi-squared test, we find no evidence of heterogeneity 
25:644:52872:27:28:72:513:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the coefficient across the three studies (Higgins & Thompson, 2002), suggesting that our 
25:645:52964:28:27:72:526:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:results are consistent with the two existing within-school random assignment studies. Because 
25:646:53057:27:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:there is no heterogeneity across studies, we generate the pooled estimate reported in the last bar 
25:647:53156:28:28:72:509:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:simply as a precision-weighted average of the estimates from the three random assignment 
25:648:53244:28:27:72:499:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:studies. The pooled estimate (0.946) is more precise (the standard error is 0.098) and the 
25:649:53333:27:28:72:535:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:confidence interval continues to include one. Together, these random assignment studies yield a 
25:650:53427:28:27:72:447:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:pooled estimate with precision much closer to the quasi-experimental studies.

26:657:53826:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:balanced across teachers within a randomization block. Specifically, we estimate the relationship 
26:658:53923:28:27:72:524:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between assigned teachers’ predicted effectiveness in 2012-13 and students’ characteristics in

26:665:54313:31:29:72:535:503:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher (based on state test scores) and ∅c` are fixed effects for randomization blocks. We report 
26:666:54411:29:28:72:534:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the coefficients, h`, and standard errors for each of eight baseline characteristics in Table 8. We 
26:667:54510:28:27:72:503:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:find that none of the eight student characteristics were statistically significantly related to 
26:668:54604:27:28:72:222:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigned teacher effectiveness.

26:671:54652:28:28:108:521:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The characteristics of the actual peers in a classroom are not randomly assigned in all 
26:672:54740:28:27:72:523:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cases, since non-randomly assigned students enter classrooms throughout the school year and 
26:673:54831:27:28:72:530:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:randomly assigned students exit. Thus, our random assignment process does not guarantee that 
26:674:54924:28:27:72:530:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigned teacher effectiveness is unrelated to actual peer characteristics. To test for the balance 
26:675:55024:27:28:72:540:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of predicted teacher effectiveness by classroom-level averages of peer characteristics, we use the 
26:676:55122:28:28:72:522:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:same regression model presented in Equation 7 to examine the relationship between assigned 
26:677:55213:28:27:72:528:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers predicted effectiveness and average actual peer characteristics. In Table 9, we present 
26:678:55310:27:28:72:529:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the coefficients on teacher effectiveness. We find that seven of the eight student characteristics 
26:679:55408:28:27:72:532:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are not statistically significantly related to assigned teacher effectiveness, but lower preforming 
26:680:55506:27:0:72:520:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teachers are assigned classrooms with higher concentrations of students with limited English 
27:681:55598:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:proficiency. However, a joint hypothesis test that all eight coefficients are zero has a p-value of 
27:682:55698:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:0.442, meaning we cannot reject the null hypothesis that these eight characteristics are jointly 
27:683:55795:28:27:72:236:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unrelated to teacher performance.

27:686:55839:28:27:108:514:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Because the random assignment rosters were generated prior to the beginning of the 
27:687:55922:27:28:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2012-13 school year, before new students may have signed up and before teachers may have had 
27:688:56015:28:27:72:525:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to be reshuffled to other schools, some amount of student attrition was unavoidable. Although 
27:689:56107:27:28:72:541:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:our study maintained a relatively low level of attrition, we examine whether student movement is 
27:690:56204:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:related to the predicted performance of the randomly assigned teacher. To do so, we estimate a 
27:691:56298:28:27:72:517:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:model similar to that in Equation 7, but the dependent variable instead indicates whether the 
27:692:56392:27:28:72:528:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:student remained in the sample in 2012-13 and had student outcomes in that year. In Table 10, 
27:693:56486:28:27:72:507:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:we present the coefficients from this regression along with the percentage of students who 
27:694:56577:27:28:72:472:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:remained in the sample and had achievement scores. As shown in the first column, 
27:695:56658:28:28:72:535:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:approximately 88% of students from the random assignment sample have state standardized test 
27:696:56750:28:27:72:534:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:scores, approximately 74% of students have scores on the project-developed test and responded 
27:697:56843:27:28:72:514:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to the student survey. In the second column, we present the coefficients on assigned teacher 
27:698:56935:28:27:72:534:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectiveness from three separate regressions, one for each of these three outcomes. In all cases, 
27:699:57034:27:28:72:477:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the coefficients are not statistically significantly different from zero at the 5% level.

27:702:57137:27:28:108:541:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Reforms of teacher evaluation systems have inevitably raised questions about the validity 
27:703:57227:28:0:72:499:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the performance measures being used. Our findings are the latest in a series of studies 
28:704:57318:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:suggesting that the most controversial measure—the test-based value-added measure—is a valid 
28:705:57411:27:28:72:477:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:predictor of teacher impacts on student achievement following random assignment.  
28:706:57490:28:27:108:526:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Until now, much of the public controversy—and all of the predictive validity studies—
28:707:57575:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have focused on the test-based value-added estimates. However, more than two-thirds of teachers 
28:708:57671:28:28:72:522:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are in non-tested grades and subjects, where such value-added measures do not apply (Papay, 
28:709:57762:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2012). As a result, most teachers are evaluated on measures other than test-based value-added 
28:710:57855:27:28:72:517:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures—such as classroom observations and student surveys. Above, we provide the first 
28:711:57944:28:27:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:evidence testing for bias in classroom observations and student surveys, measuring a teacher’s 
28:712:58039:27:28:72:525:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance before and after students were randomly assigned. Although our estimates of the 
28:713:58131:28:28:72:509:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:CLASS observation instrument were too imprecise to draw meaningful conclusions on the 
28:714:58217:28:27:72:532:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:validity of that measure, our evidence suggests that the MQI classroom observation measure is, 
28:715:58311:27:28:72:486:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:like the test-based value-added measure, an unbiased predictor of teachers’ classroom 
28:716:58394:28:27:72:502:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observation following random assignment. In other words, the MQI measure seems to be 
28:717:58478:27:28:72:518:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:identifying variation in teaching practice, and does not seem to be biased by the unmeasured 
28:718:58570:28:28:72:539:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics of students the teacher typically teaches. Unfortunately, like the CLASS measure, 
28:719:58666:28:27:72:396:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:our evidence on the validity of student surveys was not conclusive. 
28:720:58733:27:28:108:509:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:One of the limitations of this study lies in the imprecision in our validity estimates, 
28:721:58821:28:27:72:525:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:particularly for the measure based on student survey responses. As mentioned above, this was 
28:722:58913:27:28:72:527:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:due—at least in part—to our inability to control for students’ baseline survey responses. Since 
28:723:59009:28:28:72:521:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:we did not follow students longitudinally, we were unable to control for any baseline student-
28:724:59103:28:27:72:487:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:level variables that were not contained in administrative records. Based on this, future 
28:725:59192:27:28:72:516:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experiments may consider following students longitudinally in order to control for students’ 
28:726:59284:28:0:72:510:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:baseline responses on all outcome variables. In addition, the precision on all outcomes will 
29:727:59378:0:27:72:508:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:improve as the sample increases. Future studies may consider testing for bias in classroom 
29:728:59468:27:28:72:517:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observations and student survey responses by applying the quasi-experimental identification 
29:729:59560:28:27:72:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:strategy of Chetty et al. (2014a) to large administrative databases. Finally, we note that the 
29:730:59652:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:properties of any measure of teaching performance could change as those measures are used for 
29:731:59746:28:28:72:510:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increasingly high stakes purposes, and so we hope that future work explores the validity of 
29:732:59838:28:27:72:290:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:teacher effects under different environments.

33:859:65558:12:11:72:517:394:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:effects. In addition, we present the results of the current study using state mathematics test scores and a pooled 
33:860:65673:11:12:72:517:383:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:estimate using precision-weighted average of the estimates from the current study and the two existing random 
33:861:65779:12:11:72:523:371:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:assignment studies. Each column plots the coefficient from a regression of the (quasi-) experimental student test 
33:862:65893:11:12:72:500:360:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:scores outcomes on non-experimental teacher value-added and the associated 95% confidence intervals. A 
33:863:65995:12:11:72:502:348:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:coefficient of one indicates that the non-experimental estimates contain zero bias, on average, in predicting 
33:864:66105:11:12:72:528:337:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:outcomes following random assignment. Estimates and standard errors are collected from reported values in each 
33:865:66215:12:11:72:539:325:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:paper. Since the two random assignment studies report findings separately by mathematics and ELA, we report only 
33:866:66328:11:12:72:530:314:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:the mathematics coefficients. The three quasi-experimental studies only present combined results for mathematics 
33:867:66438:12:13:72:442:302:97:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f3:and ELA, so we present the combined estimates across both subjects for those three studies.

37:996:71042:11:11:72:714:286:97:g_d0_f12:97:g_d0_f12:13 who remained in classrooms to which they were randomly assigned for the duration of the school year. The second group (N=339) includes students in 2012-

37:998:71353:12:11:72:671:263:97:g_d0_f12:97:g_d0_f12:errors with 1000 draws, clustered at the random assignment block level. The p-value on the joint null hypothesis test is generated using a Fisher-style 
37:999:71503:11:12:72:706:252:97:g_d0_f12:97:g_d0_f12:permutation test, where we draw 1000 block bootstrapped (clustered at the random assignment block level) and we re-assign each student’s compliance status 
37:1000:71658:12:12:72:718:240:97:g_d0_f12:97:g_d0_f12:randomly. We calculate the F-statistic in each ‘null’ bootstrapped sample, and the p-value presented in this table is the fraction of null F-statistics that are greater

45:1220:80033:27:28:108:538:681:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:In this appendix, we present information on the extent to which students were sorted non-
45:1221:80122:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:randomly to teachers in the years prior to randomization. If the teachers who participated in the 
45:1222:80220:27:28:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:random assignment portion of our study were already randomly assigned classroom rosters, our 
45:1223:80313:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:validation test would not generalize to other settings where the students are systematically sorted 
45:1224:80413:28:27:72:531:570:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:to teachers. However, we find that our experimental sample of teachers appears subject to such 
45:1225:80508:27:28:72:275:543:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:sorting in the years before randomization. 
45:1226:80550:28:27:108:534:515:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:In the two years prior to the random assignment, the between-teacher standard deviation 
45:1227:80637:27:28:72:531:488:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:in average test scores was 0.412 for the sample of randomized teachers, compared to 0.550 and 
45:1228:80728:28:28:72:527:460:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:0.662 for the non-randomized project teachers and for the non-project teachers, respectively.18 
45:1229:80823:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:This indicates that there was a considerable amount of sorting of students to teachers based on 
45:1230:80919:27:28:72:517:405:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:prior achievement in all three groups of classrooms, but there was somewhat less sorting for 
45:1231:81012:28:27:72:402:377:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:teachers who agreed to be randomized in the third year of our study. 
45:1232:81080:27:28:108:495:350:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:Sorting in a single year does not necessarily lead to bias in teacher effectiveness 
45:1233:81163:28:28:72:509:322:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:measures. For example, imagine that students are systematically sorted into classrooms by 
45:1234:81253:28:27:72:519:294:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:ability, but then randomly assigned to teachers. In this scenario, end-of-year achievement, in 
45:1235:81348:27:28:72:519:267:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:expectation, would still be an unbiased measure of a teacher’s effect on student achievement 
45:1236:81441:28:27:72:518:239:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:since no teacher would be more likely to receive the most- or least-able students. Only when 
45:1237:81533:27:28:72:516:212:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:sorting persists across years does failing to control for baseline achievement lead to bias. To 
45:1238:81629:28:40:72:494:184:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:estimate the extent of persistent student-teacher sorting in the years prior to the random

45:1240:81766:7:16:72:537:137:42:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:18 Under normality assumptions, sorting students to teachers perfectly on prior test scores would produce a between-
45:1241:81881:16:11:72:528:121:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:teacher standard deviation in teacher-level average baseline test scores that is similar to the student-level standard 
45:1242:81999:11:13:72:535:110:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:deviation (i.e., a standard deviation of one). Alternatively, if there were no sorting (i.e., assignments were random), 
45:1243:82119:13:12:72:541:97:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:the coefficient would not be zero, but 1", where n is the number of students per classroom. Assuming 25 students 
45:1244:82232:12:11:72:508:85:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:per classroom, this would be approximately 0.2. Therefore, our estimates suggest some amount of sorting on 
45:1245:82338:11:0:72:390:74:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:baseline test scores in all three samples in the years before random assignment. 
46:1246:82420:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:assignment experiment, we calculate the square root of the covariance across the first two years 
46:1247:82517:27:28:72:538:681:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:of the study in the average baseline test scores for students in a teacher’s classroom (the “signal” 
46:1248:82618:28:27:72:513:653:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:standard deviation in the baseline test scores). We also estimate the within-school signal by 
46:1249:82712:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:adjusting the baseline scores for school-by-year fixed effects.19 If there were no sorting the signal 
46:1250:82813:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:would be zero, but we find that signal standard deviation in baseline sorting for the randomized 
46:1251:82910:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:teachers is 0.346 and the within-school signal standard deviation is 0.306, indicating the presence 
46:1252:83010:27:28:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:of persistent within- and between-school sorting of students to teachers across the two pre-
46:1253:83100:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:randomization years. We observe even higher persistent sorting for the non-randomized project 
46:1254:83194:27:28:72:516:488:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:teachers (0.495 overall and 0.408 within school) and for the non-project teachers (0.652 and 
46:1255:83287:28:28:72:509:460:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:0.544 within-school). We also estimate within-random assignment block signal in baseline 
46:1256:83376:28:27:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:sorting by adjusting for random-assignment block fixed effects. This estimation yields a standard 
46:1257:83474:27:28:72:539:405:144:g_d0_f15:144:g_d0_f15:deviation (0.150) smaller than the within-school or overall standard deviations, but still indicates

46:1261:83721:7:17:72:532:197:42:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:19 We remove the school-by-year fixed effects from the full sample, as opposed to the school-by-year fixed effects 
46:1262:83835:17:11:72:79:180:97:g_d0_f15:42:g_d0_f15:within each of the three sub-samples. 20
46:1263:83874:11:12:78:538:169:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15: Since there are at most three teachers within a random assignment block, we correct the within-block estimates of 
46:1264:83988:12:11:72:534:157:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:variance and signal variance in baseline scores to account for the degrees of freedom. Specifically, we first remove 
46:1265:84105:11:12:72:517:146:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:the randomization block-by-year fixed effect from each baseline score and then calculate the square root of the 
46:1266:84217:12:11:72:526:134:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:variance and the square root of the covariance in these demeaned baseline scores across the first two years in our 
46:1267:84331:11:14:72:525:123:97:g_d0_f15:97:g_d0_f15:sample of teachers.  To correct for the loss of degrees of freedom, we multiply the square root of the variance by 
46:1268:84446:14:12:79:483:109:97:g_d0_f19:97:g_d0_f15:("−1)("−&), where n is the number of observations across the two years and k is the number of
