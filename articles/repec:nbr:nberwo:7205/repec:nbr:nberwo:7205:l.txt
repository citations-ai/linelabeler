2:18:660:29:28:273:338:623:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:19:668:28:21:108:539:595:12:Times:12:Times:C:By 1993, over 70% of all Americans with health insurance were enrolled in some form of
2:20:754:21:22:72:539:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:managed  care  plan.    The  term  managed  care  encompasses  a  diverse  array  of  institutional
2:21:853:22:21:72:539:552:12:Times:12:Times:C:arrangements, which combine various sets of mechanisms, that, in turn, have changed over time. The
2:22:951:21:21:71:540:531:12:Times:12:Times:C:chapter  reviews  these  mechanims,  which,  in  addition  to  the  methods  employed  by  traditional
2:23:1053:21:21:71:539:510:12:Times:12:Times:C:insurance plans, include the selection and organization of providers, the choice of payment methods
2:24:1152:21:21:72:467:489:12:Times:12:Times:C:(including capitation and salary payment), and the monitoring of service utilization.
2:25:1237:21:22:108:540:468:12:Times:12:Times:C:Managed care has a long history.  For an extended period, this form of organization was
2:26:1324:22:21:72:539:446:12:Times:12:Times:C:discouraged by a hostile regulatory environment.  Since the early 1980s, however, managed care has
2:27:1422:21:21:72:539:425:12:Times:12:Times:C:grown dramatically.  Neither theoretical nor empirical research have yet provided an explanation for
2:28:1522:21:21:72:539:404:12:Times:12:Times:C:this pattern of growth. The growth of managed care may be due to this organizational form’s relative
2:29:1622:21:22:72:539:383:12:Times:12:Times:C:success in responding to underlying market failures in the health care system - asymmetric information
2:30:1724:22:21:72:539:361:12:Times:12:Times:C:about health risks, moral hazard, limited information on quality, and limited industry competitiveness.
2:31:1827:21:21:72:446:340:12:Times:12:Times:C:The chapter next explores managed care’s response to each of these problems.
2:32:1903:21:21:108:539:319:12:Times:12:Times:C:The chapter then turns to empirical research on managed care.  Managed care plans appear
2:33:1991:21:22:72:540:298:12:Times:12:Times:C:to attract a population that is somewhat lower cost than that enrolled in conventional insurance.  This
2:34:2094:22:21:72:540:276:12:Times:12:Times:C:complicates analysis of the effect of managed care on utilization.  Nonetheless, many studies suggest
2:35:2195:21:21:72:540:255:12:Times:12:Times:C:that managed care plans reduce the rate of health care utilization somewhat.  Less evidence exists on
2:36:2296:21:36:72:340:234:12:Times:12:Times:C:their effect on overall health care costs and cost growth.

3:44:2513:0:19:108:532:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care dominates the United States health insurance marketplace.  By 1993, over 70% of
3:45:2605:19:19:72:523:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:all Americans with health insurance were enrolled in some form of managed care plans (Quinn, 1998).
3:46:2704:19:18:72:518:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:The term managed care encompasses a diverse array of institutional arrangements.  There is no single
3:47:2804:18:19:72:531:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:broadly accepted definition of the term nor do any existing definitions persuasively distinguish managed
3:48:2908:19:19:72:526:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:care from other types of health insurance.  Many definitions of managed care focus on the nature of the
3:49:3011:19:19:72:501:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:contract, arguing, in effect, that managed care arrangements are more complete contingent claims
3:50:3107:19:19:72:514:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:contracts than traditional health insurance contracts.   For example, managed care organizations may
3:51:3207:19:20:72:511:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:intervene in the relationship between the provider and the insured individual, limiting service use in
3:52:3309:20:18:72:534:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:particular circumstances, or they may selectively contract with a defined set of providers, limiting choice
3:53:3416:18:19:72:537:539:11:Times:11:Times:B:of provider.  This broad definition of managed care includes arrangements in which insurance and service
3:54:3520:19:19:72:525:520:11:Times:11:Times:B:delivery are fully integrated, such as staff and group model health maintenance organizations (HMOs);
3:55:3621:19:19:72:519:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements in which insured people are restricted to a defined set of providers, such as independent
3:56:3723:19:19:72:507:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:practice associations (IPAs);  and arrangements in which the choice of providers is unrestricted but
3:57:3823:19:19:72:517:463:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurers provide incentives to use selected providers and monitor the care provided, such as preferred
3:58:3925:19:31:72:449:444:11:Times:11:Times:B:provider organizations (PPOs) that conduct utilization review of costly services (UR).
3:59:4011:31:19:108:534:413:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care is often viewed as a particularly American phenomenon associated with voluntary
3:60:4103:19:19:72:526:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance purchase in a private market.  The public sector in the United States, however, has also made
3:61:4206:19:19:72:523:375:11:Times:11:Times:B:increasing use of managed care.  Furthermore, many systems with compulsory national insurance have
3:62:4304:19:19:72:532:356:11:Times:11:Times:B:always used or have begun to adopt the same mechanisms used by American managed care plans.  Since
3:63:4402:19:19:72:518:337:11:Times:11:Times:B:1980, several countries, including Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Israel, have formally
3:64:4503:19:19:72:518:318:11:Times:11:Times:B:incorporated elements of managed care into their national health systems and other countries, such as
3:65:4604:19:19:72:538:299:11:Times:11:Times:B:France, are contemplating such changes (Brown, 1998).  In this discussion, I focus on the U.S. experience
3:66:4709:19:19:72:519:280:11:Times:11:Times:B:with managed care plans, but much of the analysis is equally relevant when the same mechanisms are
3:67:4807:19:31:72:171:261:11:Times:11:Times:B:used in other contexts.
3:68:4830:31:19:108:538:230:11:Times:11:Times:A:Most of the health economics literature on managed care is an empirical literature.  This literature
3:69:4930:19:19:72:514:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:seeks to answer the question:  How do managed care arrangements perform relative to other types of
3:70:5028:19:19:72:518:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance arrangements?  Economic theory offers an equivocal answer to this question.  As discussed
3:71:5127:19:19:72:522:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:below, managed care arrangements are one set of responses to the range of informational asymmetries
3:72:5226:19:19:72:533:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:and other market failures that characterize health care delivery.  Other institutional arrangements address
3:73:5333:19:19:72:523:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:the same problems in other ways.  There is no theoretical reason to expect managed care arrangements
3:74:5433:19:19:72:515:116:11:Times:11:Times:B:always to perform better or worse across dimensions of performance than should other arrangements
3:75:5530:19:19:72:509:97:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Ramsey and Pauly, 1997).  This theoretical indeterminacy is consistent with both the highly varied
3:76:5629:19:0:72:535:78:11:Times:11:Times:B:nature of managed care in practice and the rather mixed results of the extensive empirical literature along
4:77:5737:0:19:72:495:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:most (though not all) dimensions of performance of managed care plans relative to conventional
4:78:5831:19:31:72:261:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance arrangements (discussed below).
4:79:5872:31:18:108:522:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:One of the most striking features about managed care – and one that is hardly addressed in the
4:80:5966:18:19:72:495:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:existing economic literature -- has been its remarkably rapid growth as a share of the health care
4:81:6064:19:19:72:508:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:marketplace.  Beginning in the mid-1980s, enrollment in managed care plans in the U.S. grew very
4:82:6160:19:19:72:524:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:rapidly, more than 10 % per year (AAHP, 1998). By the end of 1995, over 91 million privately insured
4:83:6260:19:19:72:511:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:Americans were enrolled in HMO, PPO and hybrid managed care plans and almost all conventional
4:84:6353:19:20:72:538:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurers incorporated some managed care practices into their plans (Managed Care, 1997) [See Figure 1 –
4:85:6456:20:18:72:513:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:Enrollment in Managed Care in the United States].  An increasing proportion of the publicly insured
4:86:6555:18:19:72:503:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:population is also enrolled in managed care.  By 1996, 12% of Medicare beneficiaries and 39% of
4:87:6650:19:19:72:535:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:Medicaid beneficiaries belonged to managed care plans (Physician Payment Review Commission, 1997).
4:88:6748:19:19:72:510:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:The theory of managed care should provide some answers to the question of why managed care has
4:89:6842:19:19:72:529:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:grown so quickly.  If managed care is understood as a response to particular problems of market failure,
4:90:6946:19:19:72:509:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:the growth of managed care should be understood as a response to exacerbations of these particular
4:91:7044:19:19:72:509:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:problems (see, for example, Baumgardner, 1991).    In the discussion of the theoretical literature on
4:92:7145:19:19:72:504:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care below, I assess the potential strengths of existing theory in explaining the growth of
4:93:7244:19:31:72:135:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care.
4:94:7257:31:19:108:521:363:11:Times:11:Times:A:While market failures are undoubtedly important, the development, early stagnation, and later
4:95:7350:19:19:72:495:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:growth of managed care, in the United States and elsewhere, are not only a product of economic
4:96:7444:19:19:72:501:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:efficiency but also a consequence of the regulatory and institutional environment.  In the past, the
4:97:7544:19:19:72:505:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:regulatory and institutional environment has at times discouraged the growth of managed care (for
4:98:7641:19:19:72:532:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:example, through anti-selective contracting legislation) and encouraged the growth of managed care (for
4:99:7744:19:19:72:530:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:example, through passage of the 1973 HMO Act).  Furthermore, the future of managed care will depend
4:100:7843:19:19:72:530:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:substantially on the regulatory environment in which it must operate.  Both the theoretical and empirical
4:101:7948:19:19:72:529:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:literature on managed care can only be understood within this historical context.  I begin this chapter by
4:102:8054:19:19:72:497:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:defining managed care.  Section III describes the origins of managed care and the regulatory and
4:103:8150:19:19:72:512:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:institutional environment in which it came to exist.  Section IV is a discussion of how managed care
4:104:8250:19:19:72:527:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:addresses imperfections in health care markets.  Section V presents empirical evidence on the effects of
4:105:8354:19:19:72:508:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care.  Section VI describes some economic problems created by the rise of managed care.
4:106:8449:19:31:72:176:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:Section VII concludes1.
4:107:8472:31:0:72:196:104:11:Times:11:Times:B:II.  What is Managed Care?
5:108:8499:0:19:108:521:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:As the broad definition above suggests, the nature of managed care plans varies tremendously
5:109:8591:19:19:72:526:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:across plans and the degree of variation has been increasing over time (Feldman, Kralewski and Dowd,
5:110:8691:19:18:72:519:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:1989).   As one writer puts it:  “If you’ve seen one managed care plan, you’ve seen one managed care
5:111:8791:18:19:72:507:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:plan.”  This tremendous variation makes it difficult to assess the economics of managed care either
5:112:8890:19:19:72:524:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:theoretically or empirically.  It makes more sense to think of managed care plans as combining various
5:113:8992:19:19:72:535:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:sets of mechanisms, although these mechanisms, too, have changed over time (Miller and Luft, 1991).  In
5:114:9095:19:19:72:533:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:theory and in practice, different combinations of mechanisms may generate different outcomes and some
5:115:9196:19:32:72:378:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:combinations may work together better than others (Robinson, 1993).
5:116:9263:32:18:108:525:545:11:Times:11:Times:A:In traditional health insurance, a contract can be defined along three dimensions:  a premium, a
5:117:9359:18:19:72:529:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:set of covered benefits (such as inpatient hospitalization), and a set of cost-sharing provisions that apply
5:118:9467:19:19:72:511:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:to these benefits (possibly including an out-of-pocket payment limit and limits on annual or lifetime
5:119:9568:19:19:72:515:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:payments).  In addition to these, the mechanisms at the disposal of managed care plans consist of the
5:120:9669:19:19:72:539:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:selection and organization of providers, the methods used for paying providers (in addition to the levels of
5:121:9777:19:19:72:510:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:payment), and the methods used for monitoring service utilization.  Several authors have developed
5:122:9875:19:19:72:525:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:taxonomies of these plans that describe how they combine these mechanisms (Robinson, 1993; Weiner
5:123:9972:19:19:72:498:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:and deLissovoy, 1993; Miller and Luft, 1994).  While these taxonomies are helpful, the observed
5:124:10067:19:19:72:525:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:combinations of these mechanisms are constantly changing.  There is, as yet, no single clearly superior
5:125:10170:19:31:72:199:375:11:Times:11:Times:B:combination of mechanisms.
5:126:10196:31:19:108:533:344:11:Times:11:Times:A:The variation in combinations of mechanisms makes it difficult to characterize managed care.  It
5:127:10292:19:19:72:522:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:also makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of any single mechanism.  Few plans incorporate just
5:128:10396:19:19:72:519:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:one managed care mechanism.  Furthermore, managed care mechanisms differ in their stringency and
5:129:10492:19:19:72:526:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:design in ways that may be hard for researchers to observe.   Two plans may cover similar benefits, but
5:130:10595:19:19:72:531:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:limit access in different ways.  They may incorporate cost-sharing, but at very different rates.  They may
5:131:10701:19:19:72:532:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:contract with the same providers and hospitals, but one may pay discounted fee-for-service and the other
5:132:10805:19:19:72:532:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:may use capitation payments.  They may use utilization review, but differ in how stringently they review
5:133:10909:19:31:72:103:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:claims.
5:134:10916:31:31:108:184:180:11:Times:11:Times:A:Covered Benefits
5:135:10932:31:19:108:536:149:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans contracts often cover a broader scope of benefits than do indemnity plans (in
5:136:11028:19:19:72:505:130:11:Times:11:Times:B:part, as a consequence of Federal regulations described below).  In particular, managed care plans,
5:137:11127:19:19:72:528:111:11:Times:11:Times:B:especially the more integrated forms, offer more generous preventive services than do traditional health
5:138:11231:19:0:72:522:92:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance plans (Weiner and deLissovoy, 1993).  Prior to the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination
6:139:11332:0:19:72:532:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:Act (1979), managed care plans also offered better coverage for maternity care.  This better coverage for
6:140:11437:19:19:72:535:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:preventive and maternity services is sometimes explained as a natural outgrowth of the fact that managed
6:141:11541:19:18:72:538:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plans take on a larger share of the financial risk of health care than do indemnity plans (Pauly, 1970).
6:142:11650:18:19:72:488:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:If plans prevent disease, proponents argue, overall health care costs to the plan will be reduced
6:143:11747:19:19:72:528:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Duston, 1978).  While this argument is appealing in principle, relatively few preventive health services
6:144:11852:19:19:72:508:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:are medical care cost saving (Russell, 1986).  The investment value of preventive services from the
6:145:11951:19:19:72:513:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:perspective of the managed care plan is even more limited because members can, and frequently do,
6:146:12048:19:32:72:393:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:change plans before the payoffs would become evident  (Doherty, 1979).
6:147:12118:32:18:108:528:545:11:Times:11:Times:A:Others have argued that providing better coverage for preventive (and maternity) services helps
6:148:12213:18:19:72:509:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans (managed care or traditional) attract a healthier than average population (Frank, McGuire and
6:149:12312:19:19:72:537:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:Glazer, 1998).  If the correlation between the demand for these services and total health care expenditures
6:150:12419:19:31:72:354:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:is negative, then the plan may benefit from expanding coverage.
6:151:12482:31:19:108:501:458:11:Times:11:Times:A:In other areas, the scope of benefits formally covered by managed care plans is also more
6:152:12571:19:19:72:520:439:11:Times:11:Times:B:generous than under indemnity plans.   For example, managed care plans are less likely to incorporate
6:153:12672:19:19:72:531:420:11:Times:11:Times:B:lifetime coverage limits (Jensen et al., 1997).  This difference in formal definition, however, may be less
6:154:12779:19:19:72:534:401:11:Times:11:Times:B:meaningful than it appears.  In indemnity plans, the scope of services is normally defined by service type
6:155:12885:19:19:72:481:382:11:Times:11:Times:B:(e.g., all inpatient hospitalization costs, a specific number of psychiatrist visits).  This type of
6:156:12985:19:19:72:522:363:11:Times:11:Times:B:specification describes both the upper and lower bounds of coverage when patients themselves choose
6:157:13084:19:19:72:538:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:services.  If providers or plans decide whether or not to authorize an admission or service, formal terms of
6:158:13192:19:31:72:497:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:this type may define only the upper bound of services available under the contract (Glied, 1998).
6:159:13289:31:31:108:215:294:11:Times:11:Times:A:Consumer Cost-Sharing
6:160:13310:31:19:108:520:263:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans generally rely less on cost-sharing than do conventional indemnity plans.
6:161:13402:19:19:72:536:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:They use cost-sharing in two ways.  First, like indemnity insurers, they use cost-sharing to control the use
6:162:13510:19:19:71:507:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:of services within their restricted networks of providers. Historically, group and staff model HMOs
6:163:13609:19:19:71:521:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:eschewed such consumer cost-sharing altogether.  Empirical evidence, however, suggests that, as with
6:164:13709:19:19:71:499:187:11:Times:11:Times:B:conventional insurers, cost-sharing can reduce the use of services in managed care plans (see, for
6:165:13807:19:19:71:517:168:11:Times:11:Times:B:example, Cherkin, Gothaus and Wagner, 1989).  Nominal cost-sharing requirements in managed care
6:166:13902:19:19:71:515:149:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans quadrupled between 1987-1993 (Gabel, 1997).  Today, most plans, even group and staff model
6:167:13998:19:31:71:436:130:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans, have adopted small copayments for routine, non-preventive physician visits.
6:168:14080:31:19:107:516:99:11:Times:11:Times:A:The second way that cost-sharing is used by managed care plans is as a financial incentive to
6:169:14173:19:0:71:533:80:11:Times:11:Times:B:encourage members to use services provided by the plan’s own network of providers.  Preferred provider
7:170:14276:0:19:72:524:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:organizations, and looser HMOs (such as point-of-service plans), offer members the choice of network
7:171:14376:19:31:72:390:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:services with low co-pays or out-of-network services with high co-pays.
7:172:14447:31:30:108:271:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:Provider Selection and Organization
7:173:14482:30:19:108:527:629:11:Times:11:Times:A:The relatively low use of cost-sharing in managed care plans means that plans (or the providers
7:174:14577:19:19:71:528:610:11:Times:11:Times:B:with whom they contract) bear a higher share of the financial risks of medical care use.  This risk, borne
7:175:14683:19:19:71:528:591:11:Times:11:Times:B:across all types of medical services, gives the plans (or providers) an incentive to encourage the optimal
7:176:14789:19:19:71:502:572:11:Times:11:Times:B:use of a range of services and to substitute less costly for more costly services (as well as to select
7:177:14892:19:20:71:503:553:11:Times:11:Times:B:healthier patients).  One way that the plans can do this is through the selection and organization of
7:178:14993:20:30:71:174:533:11:Times:11:Times:B:participating providers.
7:179:15017:30:19:107:530:503:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans may require or encourage patients to use selected providers.   Several of the
7:180:15113:19:19:71:510:484:11:Times:11:Times:B:earliest managed care plans were almost fully vertically integrated organizations, in which a limited
7:181:15214:19:19:71:528:465:11:Times:11:Times:B:number of hospitals and physicians were employees of organizations that took on insurance risk.  These
7:182:15316:19:19:71:537:446:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans are often referred to as “staff model” HMOs.  Closely related to these plans are those (often referred
7:183:15424:19:19:71:520:427:11:Times:11:Times:B:to as “group model” HMOs) in which a fixed group of physicians (and sometimes hospitals) contracts
7:184:15522:19:31:71:339:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:exclusively with an organization that takes on insurance risk.
7:185:15584:31:19:107:517:377:11:Times:11:Times:A:Much of the early literature on HMOs illustrated the advantages of these vertically integrated
7:186:15678:19:19:71:527:358:11:Times:11:Times:B:delivery systems (Luft, 1981).  Nonetheless, these forms have shrunk in importance, suggesting that the
7:187:15781:19:19:71:539:339:11:Times:11:Times:B:advantages of formal vertical integration have declined over time (or that consumer preferences for choice
7:188:15887:19:19:71:529:320:11:Times:11:Times:B:have increased).  Staff and group model HMOs dominated the managed care marketplace through 1983,
7:189:15984:19:19:71:529:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:but their market share has since declined considerably (Feldman, Kralewski and Dowd, 1989).  In 1995,
7:190:16085:19:19:72:498:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:only 25% of those enrolled in HMOs reported that they belonged to a group or staff model HMO
7:191:16177:19:19:72:513:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Managed Care, 1997).   New forms of vertical integration, such as hospital- or physician-sponsored
7:192:16276:19:19:72:494:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:networks and plans have begun to develop, but the economic literature has not yet evaluated the
7:193:16371:19:19:72:499:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:efficiency of these organizations or the extent to which these forms of vertical integration behave
7:194:16470:19:31:72:326:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:differently from traditional staff and group model HMOs.
7:195:16526:31:19:108:504:175:11:Times:11:Times:A:An alternative form of organization is through contractual arrangements with independent
7:196:16614:19:19:72:520:156:11:Times:11:Times:B:providers.  Several early HMOs, known as “independent practice associations” operated through non-
7:197:16712:19:19:72:521:137:11:Times:11:Times:B:exclusive contracts with providers who also treated indemnity patients.  These IPAs now dominate the
7:198:16812:19:19:72:514:118:11:Times:11:Times:B:HMO segment of the managed care market.  Many other managed care forms also use non-exclusive
7:199:16905:19:19:72:526:99:11:Times:11:Times:B:contracts with providers, but do not share all the features of IPA HMOs.  The largest of these forms are
7:200:17009:19:0:72:517:80:11:Times:11:Times:B:the preferred provider organizations (PPOs), which negotiate discounted rates with a defined panel of
8:201:17111:0:19:72:524:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:providers.  In addition to selecting providers, plans may also restrict access to pharmaceuticals through
8:202:17216:19:19:72:534:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:the use of formularies.  Under formulary arrangements, insurers cover the cost of pharmaceuticals only if
8:203:17321:19:30:72:427:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:they are selected from among those on a predetermined (usually discounted) list.
8:204:17401:30:19:108:534:641:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans can select the physicians, non-physician providers, and hospitals with whom
8:205:17495:19:19:72:539:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:they contract.  Manipulating the composition of provider panels to reduce costs and improve quality could
8:206:17600:19:19:72:532:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:be a valuable tool for managed care plans, but there is very little evidence that they do so systematically.
8:207:17708:19:19:72:530:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:A limited body of research has examined the characteristics of these providers.  Physicians participating
8:208:17813:19:20:72:523:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:in managed care plans are more likely to be board-certified than average (Brown, 1983).  Early studies
8:209:17915:20:18:72:513:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:suggested that their specialty composition resembled that of the U.S. population (Luft, 1981).  Some
8:210:18015:18:19:72:535:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:subsequent studies found that managed care plans were likely to employ fewer physicians per patient and
8:211:18118:19:19:72:528:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:a lower proportion of specialist physicians than the U.S. average (Weiner, 1994).  More recent evidence
8:212:18221:19:19:72:496:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:suggests that as the populations in plans more closely resemble the US population, the physician
8:213:18317:19:19:72:539:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:composition also more closely resembles U.S. averages (although the U.S. average is itself affected by the
8:214:18423:19:19:72:526:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:spread of managed care) (Hart et al., 1997).  Group and staff model HMOs employ more non-physician
8:215:18521:19:19:72:515:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:providers than the U.S. average (Hart et al., 1997).  Some evidence suggests that managed care plans
8:216:18621:19:19:72:524:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:choose providers with low-cost practice styles (Robinson, 1993).  Some studies find that managed care
8:217:18722:19:19:72:534:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans contract with higher volume hospitals than do other plans (Chernew, Hayward and Scanlon, 1996);
8:218:18823:19:31:72:350:375:11:Times:11:Times:B:other studies find the opposite (Escarce, Shea and Chen, 1997).
8:219:18886:31:31:108:185:344:11:Times:11:Times:A:Paying Providers
8:220:18902:31:19:108:519:313:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans use a wide range of methods to pay physicians and a somewhat narrower
8:221:18990:19:19:72:499:294:11:Times:11:Times:B:range (similar to those used by traditional plans) for paying hospitals. The three basic methods of
8:222:19089:19:19:72:483:275:11:Times:11:Times:B:physician payment are salaries, fee-for-service, and capitation.  Plans may also combine these
8:223:19183:19:19:72:528:256:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanisms, as well as bonuses, withholds, and other incentives, into tailored incentive schemes.  Each
8:224:19286:19:19:72:528:237:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanism generates a set of incentives and a distribution of financial risk (Gaynor, 1994).  Under pure
8:225:19390:19:19:72:515:218:11:Times:11:Times:B:salary payment, physicians have no incentive to see more patients or to provide more services of any
8:226:19490:19:19:72:523:199:11:Times:11:Times:B:particular type.  Under fee-for-service payment, providers collect more revenue the more services they
8:227:19592:19:19:72:534:180:11:Times:11:Times:B:provide and, if fees exceed costs, earn more as they provide more services  (Pauly, 1970).  Particularly in
8:228:19699:19:19:72:530:161:11:Times:11:Times:B:combination with limited consumer cost-sharing, fee-for-service payment (at fees that exceed costs) can
8:229:19802:19:19:72:536:142:11:Times:11:Times:B:generate excessive service utilization.  Nonetheless, many managed care plans continue to pay physicians
8:230:19906:19:0:72:326:123:11:Times:11:Times:B:on a (discounted) fee-for-service basis (Gold et al., 1995).
9:231:19967:0:19:108:537:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Under capitation payment, providers receive a fixed periodic payment for each patient they enroll
9:232:20064:19:19:72:524:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:and can earn more by enrolling more patients (if the capitation fee exceeds expected costs).  Capitation
9:233:20168:19:18:72:538:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:makes providers face the full financial cost of their patients’ service use, which gives them an incentive to
9:234:20277:18:19:72:526:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:reduce utilization (Pauly, 1970; Gaynor and Gertler, 1995).  To the extent that they are also responsible
9:235:20382:19:19:72:491:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:for patients’ future service use (which depends on the expected duration of the provider-patient
9:236:20478:19:19:72:530:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:relationship), capitation payment can also encourage the provision of preventive services that reduce the
9:237:20583:19:19:72:537:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:total costs of health care.  Capitation arrangements vary according to the scope of services covered within
9:238:20690:19:20:72:507:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:the capitation contract.  If the scope of services is very narrow, providers paid a capitation fee have
9:239:20793:20:18:72:532:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:incentives to refer patients to other providers whose services are not included in the capitation fee.  Such
9:240:20901:18:19:72:525:539:11:Times:11:Times:B:contracts typically incorporate additional mechanisms to restrict such referrals.  Under broad capitation
9:241:21006:19:19:72:520:520:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements, providers may also be financially responsible for the costs of services obtained through
9:242:21108:19:31:72:186:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:referral or hospitalization.
9:243:21136:31:19:108:534:470:11:Times:11:Times:A:Capitation arrangements require providers to share in the financial risk of illness.  Thus, they can
9:244:21236:19:19:72:534:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:be thought of as a form of supply-side cost-sharing (Ellis and McGuire, 1993).   Supply-side cost-sharing
9:245:21341:19:19:72:537:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:has several advantages over demand-side cost sharing as a means of using financial risk to control the use
9:246:21447:19:19:72:506:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:of services.  Providers, especially if they form groups, are better able to bear financial risk than are
9:247:21551:19:19:72:511:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:consumers (though risk averse providers also experience disutility from risk bearing).  Furthermore,
9:248:21651:19:19:72:536:375:11:Times:11:Times:B:providers generally have more information about risks and benefits than do consumers and are better able
9:249:21755:19:19:72:505:356:11:Times:11:Times:B:to make efficient tradeoffs (Ellis and McGuire, 1993).  Nonetheless, capitation, like other forms of
9:250:21855:19:19:72:518:337:11:Times:11:Times:B:supply-side cost sharing poses two serious problems.  First, if patients are ill-informed, capitation can
9:251:21960:19:19:72:524:318:11:Times:11:Times:B:lead to underprovision of necessary services (Blomqvist, 1991).  Capitation also gives providers strong
9:252:22063:19:31:72:474:299:11:Times:11:Times:B:incentives to avoid costly cases (Newhouse, 1996; Ellis and McGuire, 1993; Selden, 1990).
9:253:22152:31:19:108:514:268:11:Times:11:Times:A:The choices available for paying physicians vary widely, and depend, to some extent, on the
9:254:22243:19:19:72:521:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:extent of vertical integration within the plans.  In fully vertically integrated plans, physicians are often
9:255:22351:19:19:72:519:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:paid using salaries (Gold et al., 1995 report that 28% of group and staff model plans pay primary care
9:256:22453:19:19:72:507:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:physicians salaries without further financial incentives).  Where groups of physicians contract with
9:257:22553:19:19:72:539:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care providers, the group may be paid on a capitation basis, per member enrolled with the group.
9:258:22657:19:19:71:507:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:Within these groups, individual physicians may be paid using capitation or salaries.  This three-tier
9:259:22758:19:19:72:461:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:system makes it particularly difficult to assess the incentives facing a particular provider
9:260:22850:19:19:72:528:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Hillman, Welch and Pauly, 1992).  When individual physicians contract with managed care plans, they
9:261:22950:19:19:72:511:116:11:Times:11:Times:B:may be paid using capitation, discounted fee-for-service, or on an incentive basis.  In less integrated
9:262:23053:19:0:72:510:97:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements, such as PPOs, discounted fee-for-service is the usual (though not exclusive) payment
10:263:23153:0:19:72:495:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanism.  These arrangements can be combined with bonuses, withholds, and other incentive
10:264:23244:19:31:72:294:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements (see Gold et al., 1995 for examples).
10:265:23294:31:18:108:537:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:There is very little empirical evidence on the behavior of physicians paid using different payment
10:266:23392:18:19:72:504:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements.  In a study of partnerships, Gaynor and Gertler (1995) find that systems that reward
10:267:23490:19:19:72:517:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:physicians for effort (such as fee-for-service payment) induce substantially more effort than salary or
10:268:23593:19:19:72:502:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:capitation mechanisms.  Hillman, Pauly, and Kerstein (1989) find mixed evidence on the effect of
10:269:23689:19:19:72:517:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:financial incentives.  Physicians paid capitation or salary used hospitalization less frequently than did
10:270:23794:19:20:72:533:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:those paid fee-for-service, but other measures were inconsistent with theory.  Stearns, Wolfe, and Kindig
10:271:23899:20:18:72:516:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:(1992) find evidence that the same physicians, when paid on a capitation rather than a fee-for-service
10:272:24001:18:31:72:382:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:basis, used significantly fewer hospital admissions in treating patients.
10:273:24074:31:19:108:534:496:11:Times:11:Times:A:Plans can also combine these payment mechanisms.  For example, plans may pay fee-for-service
10:274:24166:19:19:72:531:477:11:Times:11:Times:B:rates but withhold a portion of the payment if utilization exceeds a predetermined level (Hillman, 1987).

10:295:24659:44:19:108:514:192:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans typically rely less on complex financial incentives for hospitals than for
10:296:24752:19:19:72:524:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:physicians (Luft, 1981), and pay hospitals in much the same way that traditional plans do.  Many plans
10:297:24854:19:19:72:530:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:pay hospitals on a per-diem basis based on negotiated rates.  Some plans pay using prospective payment
10:298:24956:19:19:72:499:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanisms (Zelman, 1996).  Those vertically-integrated managed care plans that own their own
10:299:25049:19:19:72:534:116:11:Times:11:Times:B:hospitals use internal pricing mechanisms to pay them (Newhouse, 1993).   There are no existing surveys
10:300:25152:19:0:72:288:97:11:Times:11:Times:B:of managed care hospital payment arrangements.
11:301:25200:0:31:108:243:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Monitoring Service Utilization
11:302:25230:31:19:108:507:678:11:Times:11:Times:A:In addition to altering the financial incentives affecting providers, managed care plans also
11:303:25323:19:18:72:525:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:directly monitor service utilization.  They do this by placing limits on which providers an enrollee may
11:304:25427:18:19:72:525:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:see and by placing limits on what those providers can do.  Plans with strong ownership and contractual
11:305:25529:19:19:72:535:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:ties over providers focus on the former type of restriction, while looser plans emphasize the latter.  Under
11:306:25637:19:19:72:511:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:capitation or salary payment, physicians may have incentives to underservice patients relative to the
11:307:25738:19:19:72:508:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:health plan’s optimum.  Plans may also monitor utilization to ensure that it meets minimum quality
11:308:25836:19:20:72:510:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:standards.  Finally, plans use a range of management techniques, such as feedback mechanisms and
11:309:25932:20:18:72:513:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:continuous quality improvement programs, that provide information to physicians and assist them in
11:310:26030:18:31:72:239:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:improving quality and reducing costs.
11:311:26067:31:19:108:531:496:11:Times:11:Times:A:More strongly integrated plans limit enrollee choice by restricting reimbursement to the services
11:312:26164:19:19:72:527:477:11:Times:11:Times:B:of those providers who belong to or contract with the plan.  All managed care plans may further restrict
11:313:26268:19:19:72:513:458:11:Times:11:Times:B:choice through the use of “gatekeeper” arrangements.  Gatekeeper arrangements require enrollees to
11:314:26366:19:19:72:494:439:11:Times:11:Times:B:obtain a referral from a specified primary care physician before consulting a specialist.  In some
11:315:26464:19:19:72:524:420:11:Times:11:Times:B:specialized health plans, such as managed mental health plans, the referral source may be a specialized
11:316:26567:19:19:72:505:401:11:Times:11:Times:B:referral screener, rather than a primary care doctor.  Gatekeeper arrangements permit plans to hold
11:317:26666:19:19:72:510:382:11:Times:11:Times:B:primary care physicians financially responsible for the magnitude of referrals, and so strengthen the
11:318:26767:19:19:72:532:363:11:Times:11:Times:B:power of existing financial incentives.  Furthermore, to the extent that specialist treatment is more costly
11:319:26875:19:19:72:516:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:than generalist treatment, gatekeepers may reduce total treatment costs, even if they face no financial
11:320:26978:19:31:72:194:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:incentives to limit referrals.
11:321:27008:31:19:108:501:294:11:Times:11:Times:A:In addition to limiting enrollee choice of provider, most managed care plans also monitor
11:322:27097:19:19:72:480:275:11:Times:11:Times:B:utilization directly.  Utilization review is particularly common for high cost services, such as
11:323:27193:19:19:72:496:256:11:Times:11:Times:B:hospitalizations and surgical procedures.   About 80% of insurers in 1990 required that enrollees
11:324:27290:19:19:72:433:237:11:Times:11:Times:B:(or their physicians) obtain pre-admission insurer authorization for hospitalization
11:325:27374:19:19:72:508:218:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Sullivan and Rice, 1991).  Many plans also directly limit the number of days that patients spend in
11:326:27474:19:19:72:495:199:11:Times:11:Times:B:hospital.  More recently (and particularly for mental health services), plans have begun applying
11:327:27571:19:19:72:525:180:11:Times:11:Times:B:guidelines for the outpatient treatment of particular conditions.  In plans with contractual relations with
11:328:27678:19:19:72:533:161:11:Times:11:Times:B:providers, financial incentives may be tied to compliance with these guidelines.  Some plans also require
11:329:27783:19:31:72:307:142:11:Times:11:Times:B:patients who seek surgery to obtain a second opinion.
11:330:27836:31:19:108:523:111:11:Times:11:Times:A:Early studies of utilization review suggested that it had little effect on utilization (IOM, 1976).
11:331:27935:19:0:72:534:92:11:Times:11:Times:B:Some more recent research suggests that utilization review can reduce hospital expenses by about 7-10%
12:332:28039:0:19:72:511:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Wheeler and Wickizer, 1990; IOM, 1989; Wickizer, 1992; Wickizer, Wheeler and Feldstein, 1989,
12:333:28133:19:19:72:524:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:Khandker and Manning, 1992).  Again, however, the results are not unequivocal (Ermann, 1988).  One
12:334:28231:19:18:72:512:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:controlled trial of the use of utilization review in a fee-for-service context found that it had no effect
12:335:28337:18:19:72:529:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:whatsoever on utilization (Rosenberg et al., 1995).  Even in studies where utilization review is shown to
12:336:28442:19:19:72:529:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:reduce utilization, the source of this reduction in expenses differs across studies.  Some studies find that
12:337:28550:19:19:72:532:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:utilization review reduces admissions (Wickizer, 1992; Feldstein, Wickizer and Wheeler, 1988; Wheeler
12:338:28651:19:19:72:536:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:and Wickizer, 1990).  Other studies find that the effects occur mainly through reductions in length of stay
12:339:28758:19:32:72:213:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Khandker and Manning, 1992).
12:340:28787:32:18:108:504:545:11:Times:11:Times:A:A similar lack of concrete evidence characterizes the literature on second surgical opinion
12:341:28878:18:19:72:521:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:programs.  The empirical effectiveness of these programs is unknown (Lindsey and Newhouse, 1990).
12:342:28975:19:19:72:519:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:Furthermore, as Newhouse and Lindsey (1988) point out, if those who provide second opinions are as
12:343:29073:19:31:72:491:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:likely to make mistakes as the initial physician, these programs may actually worsen outcomes.
12:344:29167:31:31:72:205:458:11:Times:11:Times:B:III.  History of Managed Care
12:345:29196:31:19:108:522:427:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care has a long history.  Arrangements where individuals (often employers) contract
12:346:29287:19:19:72:529:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:with a number of physicians to provide services for a preset fee to a defined population have been noted
12:347:29391:19:19:72:534:389:11:Times:11:Times:B:since 1849 (Friedman, 1996).  Large prepaid group practices, such as the Kaiser health plan, date back to
12:348:29496:19:31:72:472:370:11:Times:11:Times:B:the 1930s (Starr, 1981).  Nonetheless, these plans did not grow quickly until quite recently.
12:349:29589:31:19:108:534:339:11:Times:11:Times:A:Many physicians and physician associations disapproved of these “contract medicine” plans, and
12:350:29683:19:19:72:529:320:11:Times:11:Times:B:beginning in the 1920s, they pursued both informal and regulatory efforts to ban the practice of contract
12:351:29788:19:19:72:532:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:medicine.  For example, in some states physicians who participated in prepaid plans were excluded from
12:352:29890:19:19:72:539:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:medical associations and were denied hospital admitting privileges (Friedman, 1996).  Over half the states
12:353:29996:19:19:72:506:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:at some point banned consumer-controlled medical plans and 17 required free choice of physician,
12:354:30092:19:19:72:535:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:effectively eliminating most forms of managed care (IOM, 1993).  Indeed, efforts to thwart the growth of
12:355:30196:19:19:72:524:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:prepaid, consumer-controlled group practice plans even led to the formation of other types of managed
12:356:30297:19:19:72:528:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plans.  These “foundation plans” consisted of physicians in private, independent practice, and were
12:357:30401:19:19:72:526:187:11:Times:11:Times:B:the precursors of today’s highly successful independent practice associations (IOM, 1993; Starr, 1981).
12:358:30504:19:19:72:515:168:11:Times:11:Times:B:Together, these efforts to limit the growth of prepaid practice were largely successful, preventing the
12:359:30607:19:19:72:518:149:11:Times:11:Times:B:establishment of more than a handful of prepaid practices (fewer than 40) through the 1960s (Gruber,
12:360:30707:19:19:72:530:130:11:Times:11:Times:B:Shadle and Polich, 1988; IOM, 1993).  In the 1950s and 1960s, court and legislative decisions gradually
12:361:30810:19:19:72:522:111:11:Times:11:Times:B:relaxed these restrictions on physician practice, and most studies find no evidence that remaining state
12:362:30914:19:0:72:532:92:11:Times:11:Times:B:legislation limited HMO formation subsequently (Goldberg and Greenberg, 1981; Morrissey and Ashby,
13:363:31014:0:19:72:538:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:1982; but see Welch 1985 for some contrary evidence).  Nonetheless, between 1930 and 1970, enrollment
13:364:31115:19:19:72:524:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:in these plans in the United States remained small as a proportion of the insured population.  As late as
13:365:31220:19:30:72:503:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:1980, just 5% of Americans were enrolled in managed care plans (Weiner and deLissovoy, 1993).
13:366:31313:30:19:108:518:641:11:Times:11:Times:A:Medical reformers as early as the 1930s had pointed to prepaid practices as an ideal model of
13:367:31406:19:19:72:510:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:medical practice (IOM, 1993).  After the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, as the Federal
13:368:31503:19:19:72:538:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:government became more directly affected by the rising cost of health care, political interest in this model
13:369:31611:19:19:72:527:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:grew.  In 1973, the Federal government passed the HMO Act.  The Act signaled a substantial change in
13:370:31711:19:20:72:517:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:the regulatory environment.  Rather than discouraging (or tolerating) managed care, the Act provided
13:371:31811:20:18:72:510:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:start-up funds to encourage the development of HMOs, overrode State anti-managed care laws, and
13:372:31906:18:19:72:514:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:required large firms to offer an HMO choice to their employees (Brown, 1983).  At the same time, it
13:373:32005:19:19:72:523:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:placed restrictions on the HMOs that were permitted to use these new funds and privileges (these were
13:374:32106:19:19:72:522:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:relaxed somewhat by amendments in 1976).  Qualified HMOs were required to offer open enrollment,
13:375:32202:19:19:72:521:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:community rating of health insurance premiums, and comprehensive benefit packages (Brown, 1983).
13:376:32298:19:19:72:532:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:The HMO Act was somewhat successful in encouraging the growth of HMOs.  Between 1970 and 1975,
13:377:32392:19:19:72:512:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:the number of HMOs increased from 37 to 183 and HMO membership doubled (Gruber, Shadle and
13:378:32482:19:31:72:134:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:Polich, 1988).
13:379:32496:31:19:108:534:382:11:Times:11:Times:A:Despite these advances, HMO enrollment remained small as a fraction of the insured population.
13:380:32590:19:19:72:523:363:11:Times:11:Times:B:HMO custom, Federal rules, and employer practices contributed to this stagnation.  In an effort to gain
13:381:32693:19:19:72:537:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:employer acceptance of its prepaid group practice, the Kaiser health plan had insisted that employers who
13:382:32798:19:19:72:533:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:offered it also offer a conventional insurance alternative (Starr, 1981).  This policy was entrenched in the
13:383:32906:19:19:72:534:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:Federal HMO act, which required that employers who offered a Federally-qualified HMO plan also offer
13:384:33006:19:19:72:512:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:their employees a conventional insurance alternative (Feldman, Kralewski and Dowd, 1989).  When
13:385:33101:19:19:72:521:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:employers did offer multiple competing plans, they typically contributed a fixed share of the premium
13:386:33202:19:19:72:522:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:(often 100%) to both types of plans, regardless of plan cost (Enthoven, 1980).  This practice continues
13:387:33305:19:19:72:504:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:today, with only 28% of employers contributing an equal dollar amount to all health plans in 1997
13:388:33402:19:19:72:533:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Center for Studying Health System Change, 1998).   This structure meant that HMO plans had a limited
13:389:33503:19:19:72:535:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:incentive to control the cost of care relative to competing indemnity insurers.  Since employees bore little
13:390:33611:19:19:72:535:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:of the incremental cost of more expensive health plans, they showed little inclination to switch to HMOs.
13:391:33716:19:19:72:530:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:Estimates of the elasticity of employee demand with respect to price were quite low (-0.2 -- -0.5;  Cutler
13:392:33822:19:19:72:524:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:and Reber, 1997).  Instead, plans competed principally by offering lower out-of-pocket costs than their
13:393:33925:19:0:72:174:116:11:Times:11:Times:B:indemnity competitors.
14:394:33949:0:19:108:538:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Looser selective contracting arrangements between plans and providers, such as PPOs, are a more
14:395:34044:19:19:72:525:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:recent phenomenon than HMOs, emerging in the early 1980s.  They too faced legal restrictions.  Many
14:396:34143:19:18:72:523:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:states restricted the ability of insurers to selectively contract with physicians and hospitals, and several
14:397:34251:18:19:72:513:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:required all insurers to offer individuals a free choice of qualified providers.  In 1980, the regulatory
14:398:34356:19:19:72:514:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:structure in most states effectively prohibited such selective contracting.  In 1982, California relaxed
14:399:34460:19:19:72:530:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:selective contracting limits and between 1981-1984, 15 other states passed laws encouraging the growth
14:400:34562:19:19:72:538:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:of PPOs (Gabel et al., 1986).  Almost immediately, growth in PPO plans escalated rapidly.  While data on
14:401:34666:19:20:72:504:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:PPO membership are notoriously unreliable, in 1983, physicians reported that 5% of their patients
14:402:34763:20:18:72:538:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:contacts were governed by a PPO contract; just two years later, they reported that PPO patients accounted
14:403:34868:18:31:72:259:539:11:Times:11:Times:B:for ¼ of their contacts (Gabel et al., 1986).
14:404:34913:31:19:108:531:508:11:Times:11:Times:A:The growth of PPOs also led to changes in the more traditional HMO market.  The popularity of
14:405:35006:19:19:72:521:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:PPOs encouraged the growth of independent practice association model HMOs.  IPA, group, and staff
14:406:35103:19:19:72:533:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:model plans began to allow “point-of-service” options, which provide partial reimbursement for services
14:407:35206:19:31:72:313:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:that enrollees receive from providers outside the plans.
14:408:35262:31:19:108:534:420:11:Times:11:Times:A:Through 1990, managed care participation was almost exclusively confined to the private sector.
14:409:35357:19:19:72:495:401:11:Times:11:Times:B:Medicare permitted enrollment in HMOs from its inception, but plans had few incentives to join
14:410:35451:19:19:72:529:382:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Adamache and Rossiter, 1986).  Reimbursement was cost-based and retrospective and HMOs provided
14:411:35547:19:19:72:514:363:11:Times:11:Times:B:physician (Part B) services only (Gruber, Shadle and Polich, 1988).  In 1983, only 1.5% of Medicare
14:412:35646:19:19:71:509:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:beneficiaries belonged to HMOs (Bonnano and Wetle, 1984).   From 1982 on, changes in Medicare
14:413:35739:19:19:71:501:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:legislation began to authorize prospective contracts with Federally-qualified HMOs.   Prospective
14:414:35836:19:19:71:509:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:reimbursement was set based on the age-sex adjusted average per capita cost of Medicare’s fee-for-
14:415:35934:19:19:71:479:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:service program in each county, a practice that generated wide variation in Medicare’s HMO
14:416:36024:19:19:71:515:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:reimbursement across the country (Physician Payment Review Commission, 1997).   This legislation
14:417:36120:19:19:71:534:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:encouraged some HMOs to join, but requirements remained relatively onerous.  Only Federally-qualified
14:418:36221:19:19:71:518:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans could participate and hybrid plans, such as point-of-service plans, were generally not permitted.
14:419:36324:19:19:71:506:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:Furthermore, most Medicare beneficiaries held supplementary coverage that effectively eliminated
14:420:36420:19:19:71:525:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:Medicare cost-sharing.  As long as costs of supplementary coverage remained relatively low, Medicare
14:421:36520:19:19:71:508:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:beneficiaries given the choice between traditional Medicare with limited cost-sharing and restricted
14:422:36620:19:19:71:520:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care proved understandably reluctant to switch to managed care plans.  As late as 1990, only
14:423:36720:19:19:71:536:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:5.4% of Medicare beneficiaries belonged to HMOs (Physician Payment Review Commission, 1997).   As
14:424:36817:19:19:71:509:116:11:Times:11:Times:B:premiums for supplementary insurance increased, however, managed care became a more attractive
14:425:36911:19:19:71:528:97:11:Times:11:Times:B:option for Medicare beneficiaries.  By 1996, one in eight Medicare beneficiaries belonged to a managed
14:426:37013:19:0:71:515:78:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plan (Physician Payment Review Commission, 1997).  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
15:427:37109:0:19:72:526:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:forms of managed care other than traditional HMOs (such as some point-of-service plans and provider-
15:428:37209:19:31:72:343:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:sponsored plans) will be permitted to participate in Medicare.
15:429:37271:31:18:108:537:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:Under Medicaid, a joint state-federal program, states have always been permitted to contract with
15:430:37368:18:19:72:501:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans who could provide services to those who voluntarily enrolled (Brown, 1983).
15:431:37462:19:19:71:531:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:Through the early 1980s, only a few states pursued such contacts (16 had contracts in 1980), and several
15:432:37566:19:19:71:505:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:of the early efforts were poorly managed (Brown, 1983).  These voluntary plans attracted very few
15:433:37663:19:19:71:516:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:beneficiaries (only 1.3% of all beneficiaries in 1980) both because of difficulties in administering the
15:434:37767:19:20:71:522:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans and because Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries already received comprehensive services and
15:435:37867:20:18:71:537:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:had little cost-sharing (Brown, 1983; Luft, 1981)2.    Legislation in 1981 created the possibility of waivers
15:436:37976:18:19:72:500:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:for mandatory HMO enrollment (Gruber, Shadle and Polich, 1988).  In 1982, Arizona entered the
15:437:38069:19:19:72:517:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:Medicaid program with an all-HMO plan and enrollment in managed care grew somewhat during the
15:438:38162:19:19:72:536:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:1980s.  By 1991, nearly 10% of Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in managed care plans.  Since then,
15:439:38265:19:19:72:533:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:States have been increasingly turning to managed care.  By 1996, all States except Utah and Alaska used
15:440:38368:19:19:72:517:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care as a component of their Medicaid programs, and nearly 40% of Medicaid beneficiaries
15:441:38464:19:19:72:523:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:were enrolled in managed care (Physician Payment Review Commission, 1997;  Holahan et al., 1998).
15:442:38561:19:19:72:515:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:The 1997 Balanced Budget Act eliminated the requirement that states seek a Federal waiver to begin
15:443:38659:19:19:72:506:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:mandatory Medicaid managed care programs.  While HMOs dominate the Medicaid managed care
15:444:38747:19:19:72:533:375:11:Times:11:Times:B:business, other forms of managed care are also in use.  For example, California implemented a system of
15:445:38850:19:31:72:382:356:11:Times:11:Times:B:selective contracting for its Medicaid fee-for-service program in 1982.
15:446:38921:31:19:108:514:325:11:Times:11:Times:A:Efforts to manage care within traditional health insurance directly were encouraged from the
15:447:39013:19:19:72:512:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:1950s on (IOM, 1993).  By the early 1960s, many Blue Cross plans reviewed hospital claims (IOM,
15:448:39108:19:19:72:530:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:1993).  The initial Medicare legislation incorporated a requirement of hospital utilization review.  These
15:449:39214:19:19:72:525:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:requirements have been amended several times, but continue in the form of PROs, which examine both
15:450:39312:19:19:72:535:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:quality and hospital costs (Ermann, 1988).  Second surgical opinion programs were attempted in the mid-
15:451:39415:19:19:72:523:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:1950s and but were not successfully implemented until the mid-1970s.  By 1984, 76% of conventional
15:452:39513:19:31:72:340:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurers had implemented second surgical opinion programs.
15:453:39571:31:19:108:533:180:11:Times:11:Times:A:Today, managed care is well established in the US health care market, yet the legal requirements
15:454:39667:19:19:72:538:161:11:Times:11:Times:B:that limited the initial growth of these contracts have by no means disappeared.  A managed care backlash
15:455:39772:19:19:72:532:142:11:Times:11:Times:B:has led to the passage of new requirements that may (or may not) have desirable effects on the quality of
15:456:39877:19:19:72:521:123:11:Times:11:Times:B:care, but are also likely to inhibit the formation or operation of these arrangements.  In 1995, 27 states
15:457:39983:19:19:72:533:104:11:Times:11:Times:B:required state-regulated insurers to permit “any willing provider” to participate in a health plan, although
15:458:40091:19:0:72:527:85:11:Times:11:Times:B:often these requirements only apply to pharmacists (Zelman, 1996).   Some states require managed care
16:459:40194:0:19:72:535:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans to permit those holding coverage a free choice of provider or mandate that plans must offer a point-
16:460:40300:19:19:72:504:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:of-service option, sometimes at a defined premium level (Marsteller et al., 1997; Hellinger, 1996).
16:461:40399:19:18:71:520:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:Overall, in 1996, nearly 1/3 of the states had strong or medium-strong restrictions on the operations of
16:462:40503:18:19:71:525:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:state-regulated managed care plans (Marsteller et al., 1997).  At this writing, the Federal government is
16:463:40608:19:31:71:472:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:considering similar legislation that would apply to coverage exempt from state-regulation3.
16:464:40699:31:31:71:245:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:IV.  Managed Care and Market Failure
16:465:40735:31:19:107:521:572:11:Times:11:Times:A:Through the use of the mechanisms described above, managed care organizations can respond
16:466:40824:19:20:71:529:553:11:Times:11:Times:B:differently than did traditional health insurers to the underlying characteristics of the health care system.
16:467:40933:20:18:71:521:533:11:Times:11:Times:B:This section considers four well-known features of the health care system and describes how managed
16:468:41032:18:19:71:519:515:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plans respond to them:  asymmetric information about health risks (leading to adverse selection),
16:469:41134:19:19:71:505:496:11:Times:11:Times:B:moral hazard, information about health care quality, and industry competitiveness.   The growth of
16:470:41232:19:19:71:534:477:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care may be due to this organizational form’s relative success in responding to these underlying
16:471:41336:19:19:71:534:458:11:Times:11:Times:B:features of the health care system.  If so, recent changes either in underlying economic problems or in the
16:472:41443:19:19:71:526:439:11:Times:11:Times:B:technology available to address them, should favor managed care.  In each case, I assess this possibility
16:473:41548:19:31:71:194:420:11:Times:11:Times:B:and discuss its implications.
16:474:41577:31:31:107:301:389:11:Times:11:Times:A:Asymmetric Information about Health Risks
16:475:41618:31:19:107:535:358:11:Times:11:Times:A:A fundamental problem in the health care market is that individuals have more information about
16:476:41713:19:19:71:539:339:11:Times:11:Times:B:their propensity to use services than do insurers (Arrow, 1963).  This informational asymmetry can lead to
16:477:41819:19:19:71:496:320:11:Times:11:Times:B:adverse selection, and adverse selection can lead to segmentation of the health insurance market.
16:478:41916:19:19:71:527:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:Managed care may be a response to these informational asymmetries and managed care plans may have
16:479:42013:19:19:71:497:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:an advantage over traditional insurers in segmenting the market according to risk (and utilization
16:480:42111:19:19:71:496:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:preferences).  Managed care changes the way health care services are rationed.  Since people are
16:481:42207:19:19:71:516:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:heterogeneous (both in their preferences and in their health-related characteristics), these changes are
16:482:42311:19:19:71:518:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:more desirable to some consumers than to others.  Patients with long-standing ties to providers do not
16:483:42413:19:19:71:525:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:want to switch doctors, while those who are newly arrived in communities may prefer to choose from a
16:484:42513:19:19:71:481:187:11:Times:11:Times:B:pre-selected list of physicians.  Patients who expect to use routine preventive care may prefer
16:485:42608:19:19:71:514:168:11:Times:11:Times:B:organizations that cover such care and do not require consumer cost-sharing while those who require
16:486:42707:19:19:71:533:149:11:Times:11:Times:B:specialty care may prefer organizations that do not require gatekeeper authorization for such care.  These
16:487:42813:19:19:71:510:130:11:Times:11:Times:B:differences imply that the populations enrolled in managed care organizations will differ from those
16:488:42913:19:0:71:269:111:11:Times:11:Times:B:enrolled in traditional health insurance plans.
17:489:42962:0:19:108:478:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:By designing packages that appeal to some consumers and not others, managed care
17:490:43042:19:19:72:517:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:organizations can make consumers reveal information about their expected use of health services and
17:491:43141:19:18:72:512:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:encourage consumers with lower expected use to choose different plans than consumers with higher
17:492:43237:18:19:72:530:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:expected use.  Differences in cost-sharing rules under indemnity insurance can have the same effect, but
17:493:43341:19:19:72:495:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:the multiplicity of managed care mechanisms may lead to more market segmentation than under
17:494:43432:19:19:72:532:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:indemnity insurance.  Managed care plans can use both explicit prices (consumer cost-sharing rules) and
17:495:43535:19:19:72:517:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:implicit prices (provider selection and incentives) to set different shadow prices for different services
17:496:43640:19:32:72:233:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Frank, Glazer and McGuire, 1998 ).
17:497:43675:32:18:108:517:545:11:Times:11:Times:A:Segmentation of the health care market through adverse selection means that consumers with
17:498:43765:18:19:72:509:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:high expected use pay high prices while consumers with low expected use pay less.  The normative
17:499:43861:19:19:72:502:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:consequences of this risk segmentation are controversial. By generating separating equilibria, risk
17:500:43960:19:19:72:527:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:segmentation may preserve otherwise unstable insurance markets and increase coverage among healthy
17:501:44058:19:19:72:527:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:populations (Pauly, 1985).  At the same time, risk segmentation limits the amount of risk spreading that
17:502:44162:19:19:72:531:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:goes on in health insurance markets.  Since risk averse people want insurance against the possibility that
17:503:44268:19:19:72:493:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:they will develop an adverse health condition, segmentation of this type can lead to inefficiency
17:504:44365:19:19:72:521:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Cochrane, 1995).  In practice, risk segmentation can also generate welfare losses by leading generous
17:505:44467:19:31:72:532:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans that are preferred by some segment of the population to leave the market (Cutler and Reber, 1997).
17:506:44571:31:19:108:530:363:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans may (or may not) attract lower utilizers than traditional insurance plans at a
17:507:44668:19:19:72:502:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:point in time (an empirical question addressed in Section V below), but can the superior ability of
17:508:44767:19:19:72:533:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans to sort people according to expected utilization explain the growth of managed care?
17:509:44870:19:19:72:522:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:If consumers have more private information about health risks than they did previously, managed care
17:510:44970:19:19:72:536:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans’ advantage in segmenting risk may have become more valuable.   In practice, it is unclear that there
17:511:45076:19:19:72:527:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:have been such improvements in private information, so there is little reason to expect the advantage of
17:512:45180:19:19:72:520:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans in risk segmentation to have become more important over time. Furthermore, this
17:513:45278:19:19:72:532:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:advantage should have led managed care plans to increase overall coverage among low risk populations.
17:514:45379:19:19:72:506:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the growth of managed care has increased total health
17:515:45478:19:31:72:295:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance coverage rates among these populations.
17:516:45527:31:19:108:528:161:11:Times:11:Times:A: To the extent that managed care plans do operate by segmenting the market and selecting good
17:517:45620:19:19:72:535:142:11:Times:11:Times:B:risks, they are likely to drive up the costs of their competitors.   Overall health care costs will not fall as a
17:518:45733:19:19:72:532:123:11:Times:11:Times:B:consequence of the introduction of managed care (Luft, 1981)4.  Instead, health care costs will simply be
17:519:45838:19:0:72:229:104:11:Times:11:Times:B:distributed differently among plans.
18:520:45876:0:31:108:172:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Moral Hazard
18:521:45888:31:19:108:519:678:11:Times:11:Times:A:Under moral hazard, people with insurance may use more services than they otherwise would
18:522:45977:19:18:72:525:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Arrow, 1963).  They may also use more costly services than do those without insurance.  Finally, they
18:523:46079:18:19:72:530:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:may prefer relatively more quality-enhancing but cost-increasing technologies than would those without
18:524:46181:19:31:72:514:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance (Goddeeris, 1984).  This last effect may lead to higher rates of growth of health care costs.
18:525:46284:31:19:107:522:591:11:Times:11:Times:A:Traditional health insurance responds to moral hazard through demand-side cost-sharing – co-
18:526:46376:19:19:72:489:572:11:Times:11:Times:B:payments and deductibles that require consumers to bear a share of the cost of their health care
18:527:46472:19:20:72:485:553:11:Times:11:Times:B:consumption.  By contrast, managed care combines cost-sharing with a range of provider-side
18:528:46563:20:30:72:367:533:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanisms and direct supply constraints to control moral hazard5.
18:529:46629:30:19:108:522:503:11:Times:11:Times:A:One set of mechanisms consists of supply-side cost-sharing arrangements (Ellis and McGuire,
18:530:46720:19:19:72:507:484:11:Times:11:Times:B:1990; Ellis and McGuire, 1993).  Under these arrangements, which include capitation payment and
18:531:46815:19:19:72:507:465:11:Times:11:Times:B:financial penalties for the use of services, providers bear part of the risk of increased utilization.  A
18:532:46920:19:19:72:521:446:11:Times:11:Times:B:second set of arrangements, which include provider guidelines and utilization review procedures, uses
18:533:47021:19:19:72:534:427:11:Times:11:Times:B:administrative regulations, rather than financial incentives, to control use of health care resources.  These
18:534:47130:19:19:72:515:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements correspond closely to the theoretical concept of monitoring utilization to control moral
18:535:47231:19:19:72:539:389:11:Times:11:Times:B:hazard.  A final set of rationing arrangements focuses on the choice of provider for a given service.  These
18:536:47339:19:19:72:520:370:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements, which include gatekeepers, closed panels, and preferred provider organizations, seek to
18:537:47440:19:31:72:523:351:11:Times:11:Times:B:address that aspect of moral hazard associated with the use of more costly care under health insurance.
18:538:47543:31:19:108:512:320:11:Times:11:Times:A:As the discussion above suggests, consumer-side cost-sharing can perform exactly the same
18:539:47632:19:19:71:504:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:functions as managed care in controlling moral hazard.  The results of the RAND health insurance
18:540:47728:19:19:71:521:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:experiment, which, in part, compared a staff model health maintenance organization that used no cost-
18:541:47829:19:19:71:497:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:sharing with a series of indemnity plans that used different rates of cost-sharing, suggest that this
18:542:47930:19:19:71:535:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:particular managed care form led to utilization rates equal to those under a 95% cost-sharing plan with an
18:543:48036:19:31:71:296:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:out-of-pocket cap of $1,000 (in late 1970s dollars).
18:544:48088:31:19:107:535:194:11:Times:11:Times:A:The optimal choice between these mechanism depends on the distribution of decision making, on
18:545:48181:19:19:71:530:175:11:Times:11:Times:B:risk bearing abilities, and on administrative costs (Ellis and McGuire, 1993).   No single study examines
18:546:48286:19:19:71:538:156:11:Times:11:Times:B:the efficiency of using these three sets of managed care mechanisms together; but the theoretical literature
18:547:48394:19:19:71:521:137:11:Times:11:Times:B:taken as a whole points to the result that neither consumer cost-sharing, nor producer cost-sharing, nor
18:548:48498:19:19:71:537:118:11:Times:11:Times:B:quantity restrictions alone is likely to be optimal  (Blomqvist, 1991; Newhouse, 1996; Ellis and McGuire,
18:549:48603:19:0:72:278:99:11:Times:11:Times:B:1993; Ramsey and Pauly, 1997; Selden, 1990).
19:550:48649:0:19:108:519:709:11:Times:11:Times:A: Mechanisms that control moral hazard at a point in time can also directly affect the choice of
19:551:48744:19:19:72:536:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:technologies and may change the nature and extent of technological innovation in health care.  High cost-
19:552:48849:19:18:72:534:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:sharing provisions in indemnity insurance will encourage patients to choose less costly technologies, just
19:553:48955:18:19:72:501:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:as high supply-side cost sharing arrangements will encourage providers to recommend less costly
19:554:49050:19:19:72:523:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:technologies.  Managed care arrangements that directly control the providers and technologies used by
19:555:49151:19:19:72:517:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:patients can also reduce the use of costly technologies  (Baumgardner, 1991), a result that can also be
19:556:49254:19:19:72:519:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:obtained through coverage restrictions in conventional contracts (Ramsey and Pauly, 1997). Managed
19:557:49352:19:20:72:520:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:care responses to moral hazard, such as supply-side cost-sharing and utilization monitoring, may have
19:558:49453:20:18:72:521:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:become more valuable over time, helping to explain the growth in this organizational form.  As health
19:559:49554:18:19:72:535:539:11:Times:11:Times:B:care costs rise, the disutility associated with the financial risks of a given consumer-side cost-sharing rule
19:560:49664:19:19:72:528:520:11:Times:11:Times:B:also increase.  The RAND health insurance experiment incorporated an out-of-pocket limit of $1,000 in
19:561:49765:19:19:72:528:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:the late 1970s, roughly equal to mean expenditures in the free care plan and under 5% of median family
19:562:49867:19:19:72:500:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:income in 1980 (Newhouse, 1993; Census, 1996).  Given medical care cost inflation since then, a
19:563:49962:19:19:72:526:463:11:Times:11:Times:B:comparable out-of-pocket limit in 1996 would exceed 9% of median family income.  To the extent that
19:564:50061:19:19:72:536:444:11:Times:11:Times:B:providers are better able than consumers to pool these risks, we would expect the growth in medical costs
19:565:50166:19:19:72:526:425:11:Times:11:Times:B:to lead to a shift toward provider-side cost-sharing.  Similarly, if the costs of administering a utilization
19:566:50275:19:19:72:533:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:monitoring system rise more slowly than consumer financial risks, we would expect to see a shift toward
19:567:50378:19:19:72:528:387:11:Times:11:Times:B:this approach to the management of moral hazard.  Consistent with this hypothesis, the strongest effects
19:568:50482:19:19:72:533:368:11:Times:11:Times:B:of managed care occur in circumstances where services are very high cost (e.g., hospital care) and where
19:569:50586:19:19:72:487:349:11:Times:11:Times:B:the price elasticity of demand for services is very high (e.g., mental health care).  In both these
19:570:50685:19:19:72:514:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:circumstances, the out-of-pocket expenditures necessary to reduce moral hazard may impose greater
19:571:50782:19:31:72:421:311:11:Times:11:Times:B:financial risk costs on consumers than the costs of directly monitoring services.
19:572:50863:31:19:108:537:280:11:Times:11:Times:A:In functioning as a control on moral hazard, managed care can reduce the cost of health insurance
19:573:50960:19:19:72:510:261:11:Times:11:Times:B:for its members.  Indeed, if managed care leads to a proliferation of less intensive practice styles, or
19:574:51064:19:19:72:534:242:11:Times:11:Times:B:reduces the returns to investments in the development of new technology, it might also reduce the cost of
19:575:51169:19:31:72:305:223:11:Times:11:Times:B:health care provided in the non-managed care sector.
19:576:51221:31:19:108:537:192:11:Times:11:Times:A:Similarly, the growth of managed care may lead conventional insurers to adjust their cost-sharing
19:577:51318:19:19:72:539:173:11:Times:11:Times:B:or utilization management procedures to keep costs low (Enthoven, 1978).  If health care providers induce
19:578:51423:19:19:71:529:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:demand for their services (or raise prices), however, managed care may lead to an increase in the cost of
19:579:51528:19:19:71:508:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:health care in the non-managed sector.  Under managed care, providers no longer have an incentive
19:580:51625:19:19:71:524:116:11:Times:11:Times:B:(under capitation) or no opportunity (under gatekeeping and utilization review) to induce demand from
19:581:51726:19:19:71:519:97:11:Times:11:Times:B:their patients.  If this reduction in moral hazard also reduces provider incomes, they might respond by
19:582:51829:19:0:71:524:78:11:Times:11:Times:B:increasing demand inducement among their non-managed care patients (Enthoven, 1978; McGuire and
20:583:51926:0:19:72:527:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:Pauly, 1991).  Finally, some argue that the growth of managed care may lead to intensified competition
20:584:52028:19:31:72:273:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:among managed care plans (Enthoven, 1978).
20:585:52070:31:30:107:160:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:Information
20:586:52081:30:19:107:521:629:11:Times:11:Times:A:It is difficult for consumers to assess the quality of the health care that they purchase.  Several
20:587:52180:19:19:71:521:610:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanisms in the health care system serve to improve consumers’ knowledge of the quality of health
20:588:52279:19:19:71:519:591:11:Times:11:Times:B:care.  Patients may rely on general practitioners whose quality they can judge to recommend specialty
20:589:52380:19:19:71:533:572:11:Times:11:Times:B:care (Pauly, 1978).  Physicians may affiliate with hospitals that promise to screen doctors.  Hospitals and
20:590:52487:19:20:71:502:553:11:Times:11:Times:B:physician groups may develop brand names that are associated with quality.  Managed care plans,
20:591:52582:20:18:71:526:533:11:Times:11:Times:B:particularly those that use restricted provider panels, may act as effective agents, offering another set of
20:592:52690:18:31:71:299:515:11:Times:11:Times:B:mechanisms for assessing the quality of health care.
20:593:52742:31:19:107:482:484:11:Times:11:Times:A:In order to operate, managed care plans must have the capacity to collect and transfer
20:594:52828:19:19:71:531:465:11:Times:11:Times:B:administrative data within an internal market.  This information collection capacity means that plans can
20:595:52933:19:19:71:532:446:11:Times:11:Times:B:collect information on the process and outcomes of care offered by many different providers to a defined
20:596:53037:19:19:71:503:427:11:Times:11:Times:B:population of enrollees (Miller and Luft, 1994; Luft, 1981).  If firms disseminate this information,
20:597:53137:19:31:71:445:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:consumers can use it to compare performance across competing managed care plans.
20:598:53217:31:19:107:523:377:11:Times:11:Times:A:The type of information generated under managed care is distinct from the type of information
20:599:53310:19:19:71:534:358:11:Times:11:Times:B:available under traditional health insurance.  While information about the quality of services provided by
20:600:53416:19:19:72:516:339:11:Times:11:Times:B:specific physicians and hospitals could be generated under indemnity insurance, the use of restrictive
20:601:53518:19:19:72:537:320:11:Times:11:Times:B:panels and defined populations allows managed care plans to generate information both about the process
20:602:53621:19:19:72:509:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:of care and about the outcomes experienced by those enrollees who did and did not receive specific
20:603:53719:19:19:72:525:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:services (e.g., population level hospitalization rates).  Plans, in turn, can use their control over provider
20:604:53828:19:19:72:539:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:patterns and practice guidelines to improve their performance on these quality measures, although it is not
20:605:53935:19:31:72:269:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:yet clear to what extent they actually do this.
20:606:53982:31:19:108:503:213:11:Times:11:Times:A:The growth of managed care has coincided with renewed efforts to measure the quality of
20:607:54069:19:19:72:539:194:11:Times:11:Times:B:medical services.  In part, this information collection dissemination responds to direct consumer demands,
20:608:54175:19:19:72:517:175:11:Times:11:Times:B:including requirements of regulatory agencies.  In addition to this consumer- and regulator-mandated
20:609:54275:19:19:72:539:156:11:Times:11:Times:B:dissemination, most managed care plans routinely collect some data related to quality, particularly data on
20:610:54382:19:19:72:519:137:11:Times:11:Times:B:consumer satisfaction (McGlynn, 1997).  Quality report cards developed by private groups and public
20:611:54481:19:19:71:533:118:11:Times:11:Times:B:payers, are increasingly used to measure the output of managed care plans.  In 1997, about one quarter of
20:612:54586:19:0:71:516:99:11:Times:11:Times:B:large employers disseminated information about plan quality to their employees (Center for Studying
21:613:54687:0:19:72:534:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:Health System Change, 1998).   There is less evidence that firms or their employees actually make use of
21:614:54791:19:31:72:367:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:this information in making health plan choices (Gabel et al., 1998).
21:615:54859:31:18:108:513:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care plans can also generate information about quality through the development of
21:616:54948:18:19:72:514:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:brand names (Klein and Leffler, 1981).  While health care delivery is inherently local, managed care
21:617:55048:19:19:72:535:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans may be able to develop national reputations based on the quality of their provider panels, the nature
21:618:55155:19:19:72:495:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:of their incentive systems, and the types of guidelines and utilization mechanisms they use.  The
21:619:55252:19:19:72:537:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:development of brand names in health care is consistent with the growing predominance of national firms
21:620:55355:19:32:72:290:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:in the managed care marketplace (Zelman, 1996).
21:621:55402:32:18:108:534:533:11:Times:11:Times:A:One element in the rise of managed care may be cost-reducing and quality-improving changes in
21:622:55495:18:19:72:529:515:11:Times:11:Times:B:the technology of administration, such as the development of computer systems, which make it possible
21:623:55596:19:19:72:531:496:11:Times:11:Times:B:to monitor transactions and processes across a range of providers.   The advantage of managed care over
21:624:55699:19:19:72:535:477:11:Times:11:Times:B:indemnity insurance in generating information about quality in health care markets depends on the extent
21:625:55803:19:19:72:528:458:11:Times:11:Times:B:to which the information generated through these measures meaningfully describes the quality of health
21:626:55905:19:19:72:524:439:11:Times:11:Times:B:care.  This question is the focus of considerable research.  The answer will help economists understand
21:627:56008:19:19:72:488:420:11:Times:11:Times:B:whether managed care can offer an increase in the efficiency of the health care market through
21:628:56102:19:31:72:249:401:11:Times:11:Times:B:improvements in consumer information.
21:629:56139:31:31:108:220:370:11:Times:11:Times:A:Industry Competitiveness
21:630:56163:31:19:108:516:339:11:Times:11:Times:A:Several features of health care have historically limited the extent of price competition in the
21:631:56259:19:19:72:512:320:11:Times:11:Times:B:industry (Arrow, 1963).  First, the industry has maintained formal barriers to competition.  As noted
21:632:56360:19:19:72:507:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:above, for many years, the growth of many forms of managed care was stymied by barriers such as
21:633:56455:19:19:72:530:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:prohibitions on contracting and on prepaid practice.  Second, the rules of professional practice have also
21:634:56561:19:19:72:534:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:limited competition.  In most states, advertising by professionals, particularly price advertising, was until
21:635:56670:19:19:72:533:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:recently prohibited and professional organizations have combined to limit price competition among their
21:636:56773:19:19:72:517:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:members.  While these regulatory barriers to competition have been struck down, incentives for price
21:637:56873:19:19:72:519:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:competition were – and continue to be – muted by the provision of public subsidies (including the tax
21:638:56974:19:19:72:528:187:11:Times:11:Times:B:treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance and public programs), which protect consumers from
21:639:57073:19:19:72:531:168:11:Times:11:Times:B:the full cost of their health insurance and health service decisions.  Finally, in some areas of the country,
21:640:57182:19:19:72:538:149:11:Times:11:Times:B:small numbers of providers still share considerable market power.  Managed care may provide a means to
21:641:57284:19:31:72:375:130:11:Times:11:Times:B:overcome some of these formal and informal barriers to competition.
21:642:57351:31:19:108:536:99:11:Times:11:Times:A:In a perfectly competitive marketplace where search is costless, price-sensitive consumers should
21:643:57448:19:0:72:489:80:11:Times:11:Times:B:efficiently seek out low cost producers.  In practice, search is costly, especially where provider
22:644:57548:0:19:72:524:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:advertising is prohibited.  Furthermore, under indemnity coverage with limited copayments, individual
22:645:57649:19:19:72:524:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:consumers gain only a small fraction of the total benefits of search for lower prices (Newhouse, 1978).
22:646:57752:19:30:72:475:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:Finally, providers may collude to keep prices uniformly high, limiting the benefit of search.
22:647:57845:30:19:108:539:641:11:Times:11:Times:A:Certain managed care techniques, particularly selective contracting, can allow consumers to act in
22:648:57943:19:19:72:520:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:combination and exert countervailing pressure against the price setting power of health care providers
22:649:58045:19:19:72:525:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Dranove, Shanley and White, 1993; although note that managed care may lead to new inefficiencies if
22:650:58145:19:19:72:537:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care firms become monoposonist purchasers).  Furthermore, managed care plans that selectively
22:651:58246:19:20:72:535:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:contract with providers and sell services to large numbers of consumers can reduce the cost of search and
22:652:58351:20:18:72:519:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:seek out low cost producers.  Since they bear (almost) the full cost of services used by their enrollees,
22:653:58456:18:19:72:516:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:they benefit fully from search.  Finally, they gain a further advantage in generating price competition
22:654:58559:19:19:72:519:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:because they can promise producers a large volume of service in exchange for lower prices.  This last
22:655:58660:19:19:72:537:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:point means that managed care is most likely to be effective in obtaining discounts from prevailing health
22:656:58766:19:19:72:520:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:care prices when producers have substantial excess capacity (see, for example, Kralewski et al., 1992;
22:657:58868:19:31:72:201:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:Morrissey and Ashby, 1982).
22:658:58895:31:19:108:512:420:11:Times:11:Times:A:Can the advantages of selective contracting explain the rise in managed care?  There is little
22:659:58989:19:19:72:521:401:11:Times:11:Times:B:empirical evidence on this point.  Nonetheless, the steep reductions in inpatient occupancy rates in the
22:660:59093:19:19:72:528:382:11:Times:11:Times:B:early 1980s may have generated this type of excess capacity, encouraging the growth of plans that were
22:661:59195:19:31:72:266:363:11:Times:11:Times:B:able to negotiate substantial price discounts.
22:662:59241:31:19:108:511:332:11:Times:11:Times:A:Even if only a few managed care plans are able to search more effectively in the health care
22:663:59333:19:19:72:531:313:11:Times:11:Times:B:marketplace, they may (under restrictive assumptions) lower costs to themselves and to competing plans
22:664:59435:19:19:72:514:294:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Salop, 1976).  If managed care plans are able to obtain discounts by offering health care providers a
22:665:59537:19:19:72:500:275:11:Times:11:Times:B:steady flow of business, they may lower their own costs without affecting the costs faced by their
22:666:59635:19:19:72:531:256:11:Times:11:Times:B:competitors.  If, however, health care providers offset reduced prices paid by managed care providers by
22:667:59739:19:19:72:525:237:11:Times:11:Times:B:raising prices or inducing demand among those with traditional health insurance, total health care costs
22:668:59843:19:19:72:518:218:11:Times:11:Times:B:may be unaffected by the growth of managed care (see Mathewson and Winter, 1997 for a theoretical
22:669:59940:19:31:72:517:199:11:Times:11:Times:B:discussion of this point; for some evidence consistent with this hypothesis, see Feldman et al., 1986).
22:670:60043:31:31:71:257:168:11:Times:11:Times:B:V.  Empirical Research on Managed Care
22:671:60081:31:19:107:505:137:11:Times:11:Times:A:The theoretical structure above suggests that managed care might be expected to affect the
22:672:60171:19:19:71:531:118:11:Times:11:Times:B:utilization of health care services, the quality of health care services, the total cost of health care, and the
22:673:60283:19:19:71:533:99:11:Times:11:Times:B:rate of growth of health care costs.  The magnitude of these effects has been the subject of a considerable
22:674:60390:19:0:71:191:80:11:Times:11:Times:B:body of empirical research.
23:675:60419:0:19:108:535:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Empirical research on managed care is complicated by two factors.  First, as discussed above, the
23:676:60516:19:19:72:537:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:term managed care incorporates many different combinations of mechanisms.  Even plans that apparently
23:677:60617:19:18:72:495:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:share common mechanisms may vary in the specifics of their provider or consumer cost-sharing
23:678:60709:18:19:72:512:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:arrangements or in the stringency of their utilization review procedures.  Plans often will not release
23:679:60812:19:19:72:534:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:detailed information about these arrangements to researchers, citing competitive concerns.  Conventional
23:680:60916:19:19:72:536:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance plans used as comparisons in these studies also vary in their cost-sharing arrangements.  By the
23:681:61022:19:19:72:512:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:mid-1980s, many apparently conventional insurance arrangements incorporated some managed care
23:682:61115:19:20:72:525:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:features, particularly utilization review, so that organizational complexity can obscure both sides of the
23:683:61221:20:30:72:295:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care-conventional insurance comparison.
23:684:61268:30:19:108:539:527:11:Times:11:Times:A:In addition to their use of these specific mechanisms, plans also vary in their organization in ways
23:685:61368:19:19:72:527:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:that might be expected to affect their performance, although the direction of the effects may be unclear.
23:686:61473:19:19:72:526:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:Some plans are for-profit, others are not-for-profit.  Some plans have existed for a long time, others are
23:687:61579:19:19:72:496:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:brand new.  Some plans are insurer-based, others are provider-based.  This substantial, and often
23:688:61676:19:19:72:532:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:unobservable, heterogeneity means that it is very difficult to generalize from the results of managed care
23:689:61782:19:31:72:105:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:studies.
23:690:61790:31:19:108:520:401:11:Times:11:Times:A:Second, risk segmentation through managed care substantially complicates the analysis of the
23:691:61882:19:19:72:537:382:11:Times:11:Times:B:effects of managed care.  If managed care enrollees differ from enrollees of conventional insurance plans,
23:692:61988:19:19:72:527:363:11:Times:11:Times:B:differences in observed utilization at a point in time, growth in utilization over time, and outcomes may
23:693:62093:19:19:72:537:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:be a consequence of the underlying characteristics of the enrolled population, rather than the management
23:694:62198:19:19:72:538:325:11:Times:11:Times:B:of care itself.   Furthermore, if managed care is correlated with overall insurance coverage, even measures
23:695:62305:19:19:72:515:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:of costs that combine information from the conventional insurance and managed care sectors may be
23:696:62402:19:19:72:514:287:11:Times:11:Times:B:misleading (Glied, Sparer and Brown, 1995).  A small study in St. Louis in the early 1970s (Perkoff,
23:697:62502:19:19:72:516:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:Kahn and Haas, 1976) and the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Manning, Leibowitz, Goldberg,
23:698:62594:19:19:72:533:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:Rogers and Newhouse, 1984) are the only studies in which people were randomly assigned to a managed
23:699:62693:19:19:72:526:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plan .  A few other studies are able to exploit natural experiments that minimize the effects of self-
23:700:62800:19:19:72:516:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:selection  (Buchanan, Leibowitz, Keesey, Mann and Damberg, 1992; Cutler and Reber, 1997).  Most
23:701:62895:19:31:72:490:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:studies rely on multivariate controls to attempt to remove the effects of selection on the results.
23:702:62994:31:31:108:148:161:11:Times:11:Times:A:Selection
23:703:63003:31:19:108:508:130:11:Times:11:Times:A:A considerable empirical literature has documented differences between managed care and
23:704:63090:19:19:72:534:111:11:Times:11:Times:B:conventional insurance enrollees (Hellinger, 1995; Physician Payment Review Commission, 1996).  This
23:705:63190:19:0:72:538:92:11:Times:11:Times:B:literature is summarized in Table 2.   Differences across plans are complex and vary across studies.  Some
24:706:63298:0:19:72:489:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans attract more young families (Berki et al., 1977).   Some plans attract fewer
24:707:63393:19:19:72:534:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:chronically ill people (Hill and Brown, 1990).  Managed care plans often attract new migrants and do not
24:708:63497:19:18:72:537:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:attract people with long-standing ties to physicians (Luft, 1981).  Many studies find differences in rates of
24:709:63606:18:19:72:508:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:prior health service utilization.  The results, however, are not uniform.  Several studies find reverse
24:710:63709:19:19:72:537:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:selection, especially with respect to maternity care (e.g., Hudes et al., 1980; Robinson, Gardner, and Luft,
24:711:63817:19:19:72:528:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:1993).   Some authors have speculated that managed care plan members might differ from conventional
24:712:63916:19:19:72:530:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance enrollees in terms of their health attitudes and behaviors, but there is little evidence to support
24:713:64025:19:20:72:534:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:this conjecture (Feldman, Finch and Dowd, 1989; Lairson and Herd, 1987).  The RAND health insurance
24:714:64124:20:18:72:538:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:experiment found no statistically significant differences in the expenditures of those randomly assigned to
24:715:64231:18:31:72:422:539:11:Times:11:Times:B:an HMO and those who had voluntarily chosen the plan (Manning et al., 1984).
24:716:64307:31:19:108:516:508:11:Times:11:Times:A:The results of selection studies depend on how selection is measured.  Some studies measure
24:717:64398:19:19:72:534:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:selection according to particular conditions (such as maternity or chronic disease).  Since patterns of care
24:718:64506:19:19:72:534:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:differ by system of care, it is possible for both types of plans to have unfavorable selection of this type at
24:719:64616:19:19:72:526:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:the same time (Frank, Glazer and McGuire, 1998).  Access to hospital care is easier under conventional
24:720:64718:19:19:72:516:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance, so those who expect to use high levels of inpatient care may select conventional coverage.
24:721:64819:19:19:72:522:413:11:Times:11:Times:B:Access to general practitioners is easier under managed care, so those who expect to use high levels of
24:722:64922:19:19:72:531:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:outpatient services may select managed care coverage.  Families who expect to need maternity care may
24:723:65023:19:19:72:525:375:11:Times:11:Times:B:choose HMOs, while those with heart disease may choose conventional insurance. Consistent with this
24:724:65122:19:19:72:538:356:11:Times:11:Times:B:possibility, Robinson and Gardner (1995) find that the pattern of selection on health characteristics differs
24:725:65231:19:19:72:522:337:11:Times:11:Times:B:according to whether the costs of these characteristics are assessed based on HMO practice patterns or
24:726:65333:19:31:72:252:318:11:Times:11:Times:B:conventional insurance practice patterns.
24:727:65374:31:19:108:500:287:11:Times:11:Times:A:Prior utilization measures of selection more accurately capture the effect of sets of health
24:728:65466:19:19:72:525:268:11:Times:11:Times:B:characteristics on costs.  These measures, however, may overstate selection (especially if they focus on
24:729:65570:19:19:72:525:249:11:Times:11:Times:B:plan switchers).  This will occur if prior utilization includes both transitory and permanent components
24:730:65674:19:19:72:528:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:and there is regression to the mean in overall expenditures (Welch, 1985).   As discussed further below,
24:731:65778:19:19:72:527:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:the growing literature on risk adjustment attempts to provide better estimates of differences in expected
24:732:65883:19:31:72:257:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:health care utilization among populations.
24:733:65925:31:19:108:533:161:11:Times:11:Times:A:Overall, the results of selection studies suggest that managed care plans in the private sector tend
24:734:66025:19:19:72:524:142:11:Times:11:Times:B:to enjoy a 20-30% prior utilization advantage over conventional indemnity plans while Medicare plans
24:735:66125:19:19:72:520:123:11:Times:11:Times:B:enjoy a similar advantage over traditional Medicare.   The degree to which managed care plans attract
24:736:66226:19:19:72:524:104:11:Times:11:Times:B:healthier people will depend, of course, on the generosity of the conventional insurance alternative and
24:737:66330:19:0:72:528:85:11:Times:11:Times:B:the stringency of managed care limitations on use.  Selection may be more severe (or less severe) as the
25:738:66436:0:19:72:536:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:price differential faced by consumers increases.  In practice, the financial implications to the consumer of
25:739:66544:19:19:72:530:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:choosing managed care rather than an alternative depend on employer practices.  Since many employers
25:740:66644:19:18:72:519:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:continue to pay a fixed proportion of costs, the cost advantage to an employee of selecting a managed
25:741:66745:18:19:72:531:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plan may be relatively small.   While less clear, the selection studies also suggest that differences in
25:742:66854:19:19:72:518:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:health outcomes between managed care and conventional insurance enrollees may also depend on the
25:743:66950:19:19:72:530:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:underlying characteristics of these populations.  The wide range of estimates and the complicated nature
25:744:67054:19:19:72:528:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:of selection between managed care and non-managed care suggests caution in interpreting the results of
25:745:67156:19:44:72:439:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:non-randomized studies of managed care utilization and quality (Newhouse, 1996).

27:898:69785:31:19:108:534:608:11:Times:11:Times:A:Analyses of the effects of managed care on utilization examine its effects on inpatient, outpatient
27:899:69884:19:19:72:538:589:11:Times:11:Times:B:and total utilization.  Comprehensive review of this literature are provided in  Luft, 1981; Miller and Luft,
27:900:69993:19:19:72:520:570:11:Times:11:Times:B:1994; and Miller and Luft, 1997.  Luft (1981) reviewed studies of managed care utilization conducted
27:901:70093:19:19:72:523:551:11:Times:11:Times:B:between 1959 and 1975.  Most of these studies compared people in group or staff model managed care
27:902:70191:19:19:72:536:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans with those in conventional insurance arrangements.  Since conventional arrangements in this period
27:903:70295:19:19:72:516:513:11:Times:11:Times:B:rarely incorporated utilization review, while managed care plans rarely incorporated cost-sharing, the
27:904:70397:19:19:72:520:494:11:Times:11:Times:B:results are somewhat easier to generalize than those from studies conducted after 1980.  The managed
27:905:70497:19:19:72:523:475:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plans in Luft’s survey include plans that manage only outpatient care (HIP), IPA plans, and group
27:906:70599:19:19:72:524:456:11:Times:11:Times:B:and staff plans.  The characteristics of the comparison group of conventional insurance plans are rarely
27:907:70703:19:30:72:153:437:11:Times:11:Times:B:specified in detail.
27:908:70723:30:19:108:528:407:11:Times:11:Times:A:The study of utilization effects is further complicated by the problem of measuring costs within
27:909:70819:19:19:72:534:388:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care.  Managed care plans often do not collect cost information that is comparable to traditional
27:910:70924:19:20:72:534:369:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance claims costs.  Mechanisms such as capitation and salary payment make it especially difficult to
27:911:71029:20:19:71:526:349:11:Times:11:Times:B:measure costs at the level of the individual visit.  Instead, many studies impute costs based on observed
27:912:71134:19:18:71:529:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:patterns of utilization measured at traditional insurance claim rates.  To the extent that these rates do not
27:913:71243:18:19:71:513:312:11:Times:11:Times:B:accurately reflect costs within a managed care setting (whether because of production efficiencies or
27:914:71344:19:31:71:493:293:11:Times:11:Times:B:volume discounts), estimates of the cost of service use within managed care may be misleading.
27:915:71438:31:19:107:510:262:11:Times:11:Times:A:In general, Luft finds that managed care plans reduced inpatient admission rates, had mixed
27:916:71529:19:19:71:531:243:11:Times:11:Times:B:effects on length of inpatient stays, and reduced total inpatient costs. The overall effect on inpatient days
27:917:71638:19:19:71:537:224:11:Times:11:Times:B:was a reduction of 5-25% for IPA plans and 35% for group and staff model plans.  Results were generally
27:918:71741:19:19:71:505:205:11:Times:11:Times:B:more robust for group and staff plans.  Managed care plans, especially IPAs, tended to have higher
27:919:71839:19:19:71:523:186:11:Times:11:Times:B:outpatient visit rates, especially for patient-initiated visits.  Overall costs were 10-40% lower for group
27:920:71946:19:31:71:516:167:11:Times:11:Times:B:and staff model plans, but IPA plans did not appear to be less costly than conventional arrangements.
27:921:72047:31:19:107:521:136:11:Times:11:Times:A:In 1985, the RAND health insurance experiment group published the results of its randomized
27:922:72138:19:19:71:532:117:11:Times:11:Times:B:study of the effects of managed care. The study assigned 1149 people to Group Health of Puget Sound, a
27:923:72240:19:19:71:532:98:11:Times:11:Times:B:staff-model HMO in Seattle, Washington.  It also observed the behavior of 733 people who were already
27:924:72341:19:0:71:497:79:11:Times:11:Times:B:enrolled in the plan.  In addition to randomizing enrollees, the RAND experiment was unusual in
28:925:72438:0:19:72:540:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:capturing the characteristics of both the managed care plan (which used no consumer cost-sharing), and of

28:927:72641:19:18:72:513:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:study are broadly consistent with the non-randomized studies summarized in Luft (1981).  Enrollees
28:928:72739:18:19:72:536:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:randomized to the managed care plan had inpatient admission levels 40% lower than those randomized to
28:929:72840:19:19:72:493:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:the conventional insurance plan with no cost-sharing.  Outpatient spending was slightly, but not
28:930:72936:19:31:72:514:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:significantly higher, than under free care.  Total imputed costs were 28% lower than under free care.
28:931:73037:31:19:108:529:584:11:Times:11:Times:A:Since 1981, many studies have been conducted comparing utilization in managed care and non-
28:932:73128:19:20:72:508:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans.  These studies, mainly collected in Miller and Luft (1994) and Miller and Luft
28:933:73226:20:18:72:514:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:(1997) are summarized in Table 3.  Miller and Luft limited their analysis to studies included in peer-
28:934:73328:18:19:71:526:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:reviewed publications that made some effort to control for differences in the characteristics of managed

33:1671:81483:42:19:108:530:240:11:Times:11:Times:A:There are several major problems in interpreting the results of the studies.  First, while all of the
33:1672:81584:19:19:72:537:221:11:Times:11:Times:B:studies use some form of statistical control for differences in characteristics (such as health status), only a
33:1673:81695:19:19:72:515:202:11:Times:11:Times:B:few use random assignment to managed care.  Some of the studies examine patients with a particular
33:1674:81793:19:19:72:522:183:11:Times:11:Times:B:condition, but there may be difficult-to-observe differences in the health status of patients with similar
33:1675:81899:19:19:72:533:164:11:Times:11:Times:B:conditions.  As the selection studies above suggest, differences between managed care and non-managed
33:1676:82000:19:19:72:480:145:11:Times:11:Times:B:care enrollees can take a wide variety of forms (and operate in both directions).  Many of the
33:1677:82094:19:19:72:539:126:11:Times:11:Times:B:characteristics associated with selection, such as preferences over intensity of treatment, are unlikely to be
33:1678:82204:19:19:72:532:107:11:Times:11:Times:B:measurable by the researcher.  Few of the non-randomized studies describe the terms of the choice faced
33:1679:82307:19:0:72:420:88:11:Times:11:Times:B:by potential enrollees, which may also affect the extent and nature of selection.
34:1680:82390:0:19:108:516:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Second, most of these studies do not fully describe the characteristics of either managed care
34:1681:82484:19:19:72:520:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans or comparison traditional insurance arrangements.  While many studies separate group and staff
34:1682:82584:19:18:72:530:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:model plans from network or IPA model plans, there is no empirical or theoretical reason to believe that
34:1683:82688:18:19:72:515:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:this is the most important distinction among plans.  Some studies compare conventional Medicaid or
34:1684:82786:19:19:72:517:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:Medicare to managed care, and in this case, the characteristics of the non-managed care plan are well
34:1685:82887:19:31:72:533:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:known.  Others, however, simply compare an HMO or PPO to a poorly defined conventional alternative.
34:1686:82986:31:19:108:506:584:11:Times:11:Times:A:Third, many of the studies rely on information from a small number of plans, providers, or
34:1687:83076:19:20:72:523:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:employers.  Since few details about the contents of plans are provided, it is difficult to generalize from
34:1688:83182:20:30:72:129:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:these results.
34:1689:83196:30:19:108:522:515:11:Times:11:Times:A:Finally, there is no consistent metric for measuring the effects of managed care.  Some studies
34:1690:83291:19:19:72:502:496:11:Times:11:Times:B:examine utilization differences in detail, while others report only differences in some measures of
34:1691:83390:19:31:72:119:477:11:Times:11:Times:B:utilization.
34:1692:83402:31:19:108:529:446:11:Times:11:Times:A:In general, the results of earlier studies continue to hold in the more recent research, but there is
34:1693:83503:19:19:72:525:427:11:Times:11:Times:B:enormous variation in the results.  HMO-type managed care plans reduce hospital utilization, primarily
34:1694:83605:19:19:72:530:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:through reductions in length of stay and admissions, and tend to increase outpatient utilization.  Overall,
34:1695:83712:19:19:72:526:389:11:Times:11:Times:B:total charges tend to be about 10-15% lower under these plans than under conventional insurance.  One
34:1696:83813:19:19:72:518:370:11:Times:11:Times:B:important difference between the more recent results and the earlier findings is that the form of HMO
34:1697:83914:19:19:72:530:351:11:Times:11:Times:B:appears to be less important in generating the results.  Plans that contract with dispersed providers (such
34:1698:84021:19:31:72:457:332:11:Times:11:Times:B:as IPAs) appear to be as successful in controlling costs as more tightly integrated plans.
34:1699:84111:31:19:108:513:301:11:Times:11:Times:A:Some studies since 1982 compare utilization in preferred provider organizations with that in
34:1700:84203:19:19:72:530:282:11:Times:11:Times:B:conventional insurance plans.  The results for these plans are less clear.  Some studies find reductions in
34:1701:84310:19:19:72:531:263:11:Times:11:Times:B:unit costs under preferred provider plans (e.g., Smith, 1997), but others find that PPO plans, which often
34:1702:84416:19:19:72:532:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:offer lower cost-sharing than conventional insurance, actually have higher costs than other arrangements
34:1703:84520:19:31:72:226:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Hosek, Marquis and Wells, 1990).
34:1704:84553:31:31:108:141:194:11:Times:11:Times:A:Quality
34:1705:84560:31:19:108:513:163:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care may be a means of generating contracts that offer lower quality at lower cost.
34:1706:84651:19:19:72:522:144:11:Times:11:Times:B:Alternatively, managed care may be a means of producing care of equivalent or better quality at lower
34:1707:84752:19:19:72:529:125:11:Times:11:Times:B:cost.  The literature on outcome differences for enrollees in managed care plans relative to conventional
34:1708:84857:19:19:72:532:106:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurance arrangements, summarized in Luft (1981), Miller and Luft (1994), and Miller and Luft (1997),
34:1709:84959:19:0:72:525:87:11:Times:11:Times:B:suggests that there are few consistent differences between the quality of care provided in managed care
35:1710:85064:0:19:72:522:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:plans and conventional insurance arrangements.  Similarly, the results of the RAND experiment found
35:1711:85163:19:19:72:520:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:generally equivalent outcomes among HMO and conventional insurance enrollees (Ware et al., 1987).
35:1712:85260:19:18:72:524:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:Both the Miller and Luft reviews and the RAND study, however, suggest that managed care plans may
35:1713:85357:18:19:72:522:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:perform less well than conventional insurance arrangements for groups with serious health conditions,
35:1714:85458:19:31:72:232:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:particularly those with low incomes.
35:1715:85494:31:19:108:484:603:11:Times:11:Times:A:Subjective measures of quality, such as consumer satisfaction with care, tend to favor
35:1716:85580:19:19:72:522:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:conventional insurance arrangements over managed care for most (but not all) populations (Miller and
35:1717:85680:19:20:72:538:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:Luft, 1997).   This result is consistent with the nature of rationing in managed care plans.  While enrollees
35:1718:85789:20:18:72:500:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:in conventional insurance arrangements self-ration through consumer cost-sharing, managed care

35:1720:85989:19:19:72:520:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:access to a service, but the insurer or provider denies such access.   Furthermore, enrollees who prefer
35:1721:86093:19:19:72:496:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:restrictions on access to high premiums ex ante may be dissatisfied with their choice afterwards.
35:1722:86190:19:19:72:522:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:Restrictions on access to providers, limitations on length of stay, and other barriers to care in managed
35:1723:86295:19:19:72:534:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:care plans have provoked the widespread regulatory efforts (described above) that would limit the ability
35:1724:86400:19:31:72:320:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:of managed care to ration care through such restrictions.
35:1725:86457:31:31:108:261:401:11:Times:11:Times:A:Spillover Effects of Managed Care
35:1726:86490:31:19:108:521:370:11:Times:11:Times:A:Costs of care in managed care may be low relative to conventional insurance, but if these cost
35:1727:86584:19:19:72:526:351:11:Times:11:Times:B:reductions occur as a consequence of selection, or if they lead to demand inducement, apparent savings
35:1728:86686:19:19:72:520:332:11:Times:11:Times:B:may be illusory.  Total health care costs may rise (or not fall) through the entry of managed care.  The
35:1729:86790:19:19:72:533:313:11:Times:11:Times:B:potential effects of managed care on the conventional insurance market make it important to look at total
35:1730:86895:19:31:72:534:294:11:Times:11:Times:B:costs as a measure of the effectiveness of managed care.  Table 4 summarizes the results of these studies.
35:1731:87001:31:19:108:529:263:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care effects on the total cost of health care in a market are less likely to be affected by
35:1732:87100:19:19:72:538:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:selection problems at the level of the individual (as long as there is no change in the size or characteristics
35:1733:87211:19:19:72:496:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:of the overall insured population).  Selection may, however, occur at the level of the health plan.
35:1734:87310:19:19:72:511:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:Managed care plans may be more likely to enter markets where overall costs are low or are likely to
35:1735:87409:19:19:72:517:187:11:Times:11:Times:B:decelerate (Welch, 1985).  Some early studies acknowledge this problem  (for example, McLaughlin,
35:1736:87506:19:19:72:513:168:11:Times:11:Times:B:Merrill and Freed, 1983 and Hay and Leahy, 1984), but it is difficult to correct.  More recent studies
35:1737:87608:19:19:72:517:149:11:Times:11:Times:B:sometimes use instrumental variable methods to adjust for the entry decisions of managed care firms.
35:1738:87708:19:19:72:523:130:11:Times:11:Times:B:Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify factors that should affect the entry of managed care plans while
35:1739:87815:19:0:72:178:111:11:Times:11:Times:B:not affecting total costs.
36:1740:87843:0:19:108:530:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Early studies of the effects of managed care on total costs were generally case studies, and most
36:1741:87940:19:19:72:538:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:found no effect.  As Frank and Welch (1985) point out, few of these studies address problems of selection
36:1742:88045:19:18:72:516:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:bias at the individual level.  Most also do not consider selection at the health plan level.  More recent
36:1743:88150:18:19:72:537:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:studies focus on the rate of cost growth in areas with high managed care penetration.  Most, but not all, of
36:1744:88258:19:19:72:529:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:the more recent studies find that increases in managed care penetration are associated with reductions in
36:1745:88363:19:19:72:523:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:the rate of growth of  total costs.  While these studies mainly support the hypothesis that managed care
36:1746:88467:19:19:72:505:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:can reduce total costs, they do not yet conclude the issue. Indeed, one study found that the entry of
36:1747:88568:19:20:72:531:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans drove total employer health insurance costs up (Feldman, Dowd and Gifford, 1993).
36:1748:88668:20:18:72:531:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:Furthermore, most of the results are identified mainly from managed care penetration in California (four
36:1749:88772:18:19:72:517:539:11:Times:11:Times:B:of the recent studies rely exclusively on data from California).  To the extent that managed care takes
36:1750:88875:19:19:72:528:520:11:Times:11:Times:B:different, and perhaps less effective, forms in other parts of the country (see, for example, Remler et al.,
36:1751:88983:19:19:72:492:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:1997), or that California’s health care climate differs for other reasons, these results may not be
36:1752:89082:19:44:72:133:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:generalizable.

38:1898:91688:76:31:108:164:439:11:Times:11:Times:A:Cost Growth
38:1899:91699:31:19:108:503:408:11:Times:11:Times:A:A few studies have examined the rate of growth of costs within managed care plans.  This
38:1900:91787:19:19:72:538:389:11:Times:11:Times:B:research addresses the question of whether managed care plans are a superior way of addressing problems
38:1901:91890:19:19:72:506:370:11:Times:11:Times:B:of dynamic moral hazard in health insurance.  Again, the results may be contaminated by selection
38:1902:91987:19:19:72:522:351:11:Times:11:Times:B:problems.  In particular, if managed care plans benefit from positive selection, adverse selection could
38:1903:92091:19:19:72:514:332:11:Times:11:Times:B:lead premiums in conventional insurance plans to grow very rapidly as managed care plans enter the
38:1904:92189:19:19:72:526:313:11:Times:11:Times:B:market.  This rapid growth could mistakenly suggest that managed care plans were better at controlling
38:1905:92291:19:31:72:126:294:11:Times:11:Times:B:cost growth.
38:1906:92303:31:19:108:508:263:11:Times:11:Times:A:Studies of cost growth using data through the early 1980s generally find equivalent or very
38:1907:92394:19:19:72:512:244:11:Times:11:Times:B:slightly slower rates of growth in managed care plans (Christianson and McClure, 1979; Luft, 1980;
38:1908:92492:19:19:72:540:225:11:Times:11:Times:B:Newhouse et al., 1985).  More recent studies find that managed care rates of growth are slightly slower, as
38:1909:92599:19:19:72:531:206:11:Times:11:Times:B:much as 1 percentage point per year slower than traditional insurance premium growth (Miller and Luft,
38:1910:92701:19:31:72:101:187:11:Times:11:Times:B:1997).
38:1911:92707:31:18:108:524:156:11:Times:11:Times:A:Another way of examining cost growth is by looking at the effects of managed care on choices
38:1912:92799:18:19:71:534:138:11:Times:11:Times:B:about the use of technology.   Several studies examine how managed care affects technological diffusion.
38:1913:92903:19:19:71:528:119:11:Times:11:Times:B:Higher managed care penetration appears to reduce the number of facilities and increase the volume per
38:1914:93005:19:19:71:530:100:11:Times:11:Times:B:facility of mammography equipment (Baker and Brown, 1997); and reduce the rate of Cesarean sections
38:1915:93104:19:0:71:530:81:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Tussing and Wojtowycz, 1994).  Not all studies point in this direction, however.  Chernew (1997) finds
39:1916:93209:0:19:72:525:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:that HMOs have had as much difficulty in controlling the diffusion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as
39:1917:93310:19:31:72:147:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:have other plans.
39:1918:93327:31:18:108:529:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:Lower rates of technological diffusion may lead to lower costs at a point in time (or over a brief
39:1919:93425:18:19:72:532:641:11:Times:11:Times:B:period).  If managed care is able to reduce dynamic moral hazard, it should do so by changing the rate of
39:1920:93530:19:19:72:537:622:11:Times:11:Times:B:adoption of new technologies.  Only one study to date examines this question, and it finds that the growth
39:1921:93636:19:19:72:537:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:of managed care reduced the rate of adoption of new technologies (Cutler and Sheiner, 1997).  In general,
39:1922:93741:19:19:71:537:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:the finding that managed care may have led to a lower overall rate of cost growth is still tentative, but it is
39:1923:93852:19:20:71:510:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:buttressed by evidence of lower rates of technological adoption and diffusion in areas dominated by
39:1924:93951:20:30:71:134:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care.
39:1925:93964:30:31:71:345:515:11:Times:11:Times:B:VI.  Economic Issues Related to the Growth of Managed Care
39:1926:94022:31:19:107:534:484:11:Times:11:Times:A:Managed care operates quite differently from conventional insurance policies.  These differences
39:1927:94118:19:19:71:530:465:11:Times:11:Times:B:imply that the institutional structures established to address concerns in the insurance market may not be
39:1928:94224:19:19:71:514:446:11:Times:11:Times:B:equally appropriate in response to problems in the managed care marketplace.  Theory and empirical
39:1929:94322:19:19:71:523:427:11:Times:11:Times:B:research suggest three areas where the advent of managed care may alter economic research in broader
39:1930:94422:19:31:71:407:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:areas: competition policy, malpractice litigation, and public program design.
39:1931:94499:31:31:107:293:377:11:Times:11:Times:A:Competition Among Managed Care Plans
39:1932:94535:31:19:107:511:346:11:Times:11:Times:A:Conventional insurers have relatively few dimensions of performance on which to compete.
39:1933:94623:19:19:71:516:327:11:Times:11:Times:B:Under conventional insurance, competition in the health care market occurs mainly at the level of the
39:1934:94724:19:19:71:524:308:11:Times:11:Times:B:health care provider.  Correspondingly, antitrust scrutiny has focused on health care provider behavior.
39:1935:94828:19:19:71:527:289:11:Times:11:Times:B:Managed care, by contrast, is characterized by relationships between insurers and health care providers.
39:1936:94932:19:19:71:538:270:11:Times:11:Times:B:The conventional insurance model of competition may not apply in managed care markets.  This literature
39:1937:95035:19:19:71:495:251:11:Times:11:Times:B:is summarized in the chapters on Antitrust (Gaynor and Vogt, 1999) and Industrial Organization
39:1938:95129:19:31:71:226:232:11:Times:11:Times:B:(Dranove and Satterthwaite, 1999).
39:1939:95163:31:19:107:527:201:11:Times:11:Times:A:As in other arenas, the competitiveness of managed care markets will depend on the underlying
39:1940:95256:19:19:71:527:182:11:Times:11:Times:B:extent of economies of scope and scale in managed care operations and on the extent to which managed
39:1941:95356:19:19:71:518:163:11:Times:11:Times:B:care markets are contestable.  There may be scale economies in the performance of key managed care
39:1942:95454:19:19:71:528:144:11:Times:11:Times:B:functions, such as utilization review or guideline formation.  Plans may be able to achieve economies of
39:1943:95558:19:19:71:536:125:11:Times:11:Times:B:scope (across markets or market segments), by transferring expertise gained in one area; or by developing
39:1944:95663:19:0:72:265:106:11:Times:11:Times:B:a brand name that has value across markets.
40:1945:95708:0:19:108:520:709:11:Times:11:Times:A:Empirical research has begun to investigate the extent of economies of scope and scale across
40:1946:95801:19:19:72:528:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care plans.  Two studies using data from the late 1970s and early 1980s find some evidence of
40:1947:95902:19:18:72:490:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care economies of scale in outpatient visits (Bothwell and Cooley, 1982; Schlesinger,
40:1948:95995:18:19:72:524:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:Blumenthal and Schlesinger, 1986).   More recent studies that examine overall economies of scale find
40:1949:96096:19:19:72:530:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:that such economies are present, but at relatively low levels.  Given (1996) finds that economies of scale
40:1950:96202:19:19:72:526:615:11:Times:11:Times:B:occur up to about 115,000 enrollees; while Wholey et al., (1996) find similar results up to about 50,000
40:1951:96306:19:19:72:521:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:enrollees.  Most managed care plan enrollees are members of much bigger plans.  In 1997, the median
40:1952:96405:19:32:72:260:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:HMO had 40,000 members (HCIA, 1997).
40:1953:96441:32:18:108:529:545:11:Times:11:Times:A:Other analyses suggest that managed care plans do compete with one another, so that premiums
40:1954:96533:18:19:72:527:527:11:Times:11:Times:B:fall as the HMO market share rises (Wholey, Feldman and Christianson, 1995).  Together with minimal
40:1955:96632:19:19:72:521:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:evidence of scale economies, these results suggest that mergers in the managed care industry might be
40:1956:96733:19:19:72:512:489:11:Times:11:Times:B:expected to have anti-competitive effects (Feldman, 1994).  The only empirical analysis of mergers,
40:1957:96832:19:19:72:500:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:however, suggests that they have had little effect on health care costs (Christianson, Feldman and
40:1958:96930:19:19:72:537:451:11:Times:11:Times:B:Wholey, 1997).  In the past, competition in the health care sector focused on quality, not costs.  Economic
40:1959:97037:19:44:72:518:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:research to date has not investigated the role of quality competition in the managed care marketplace.
40:1960:97139:44:31:108:162:388:11:Times:11:Times:A:Malpractice
40:1961:97150:31:19:108:537:357:11:Times:11:Times:A:The malpractice litigation system, like other tort systems, is intended to encourage providers (and
40:1962:97249:19:19:72:525:338:11:Times:11:Times:B:patients) to minimize the cost of potential negligent injuries (see Handbook Chapter by Danzon, 1999).
40:1963:97351:19:19:72:525:319:11:Times:11:Times:B:The existing model of malpractice in medicine separates decisions about the quality of care received or
40:1964:97454:19:19:72:524:300:11:Times:11:Times:B:not received (suits against health care providers) from decisions about coverage (contract cases against
40:1965:97558:19:19:72:501:281:11:Times:11:Times:B:insurers).  This model may have less applicability when providers bear financial risk for coverage
40:1966:97656:19:19:72:535:262:11:Times:11:Times:B:decisions and insurers provide guidelines for treatment.   Furthermore, the standard analysis is predicated
40:1967:97763:19:19:72:526:243:11:Times:11:Times:B:on the assumption that providers generally have incentives to provide too many services.  To the extent
40:1968:97866:19:19:72:506:224:11:Times:11:Times:B:that the incentives in managed care operate in the opposite direction, new analyses of the design of
40:1969:97966:19:31:72:342:205:11:Times:11:Times:B:malpractice insurance systems are needed (Blomqvist, 1991).
40:1970:98025:31:31:108:179:174:11:Times:11:Times:A:Risk Adjustment
40:1971:98040:31:18:108:509:143:11:Times:11:Times:A:Risk segmentation complicates the evaluation of the effectiveness of managed care and has
40:1972:98129:18:19:72:522:125:11:Times:11:Times:B:potentially undesirable normative consequences (as discussed above).  Furthermore, risk segmentation
40:1973:98229:19:19:72:527:106:11:Times:11:Times:B:makes it difficult to design managed care policy.  Consider a payer, such as the Medicare program, that
40:1974:98332:19:0:72:527:87:11:Times:11:Times:B:operates its own indemnity plan and contracts with managed care plans.  If the payer sets managed care
41:1975:98436:0:19:72:520:709:11:Times:11:Times:B:payment rates based on the indemnity population, while the managed care plans enroll healthier-than-
41:1976:98536:19:19:72:529:690:11:Times:11:Times:B:average enrollees, total costs under the program may increase.  If risk segmentation is important, payers
41:1977:98641:19:18:72:499:671:11:Times:11:Times:B:must ensure that the rates they pay to managed care plans accurately reflect the risk profile of the
41:1978:98741:18:31:72:201:653:11:Times:11:Times:B:population these plans enroll.
41:1979:98771:31:19:108:511:622:11:Times:11:Times:A:For all of these reasons, the increased diversity of insurance plans that has characterized the
41:1980:98866:19:19:72:510:603:11:Times:11:Times:B:growth of managed care has encouraged the development of methods that capture differences in the
41:1981:98962:19:19:72:523:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:characteristics of enrollees in different plans.  These techniques, or risk adjustment methodologies, are
41:1982:99067:19:32:72:452:565:11:Times:11:Times:B:summarized in the handbook chapter on risk adjustment (Van de Ven and Ellis, 1999).
41:1983:99150:32:30:72:163:533:11:Times:11:Times:B:VI.        Conclusions
41:1984:99172:30:19:108:538:503:11:Times:11:Times:A:The nature of health insurance in the United States has become much more complex over the past
41:1985:99266:19:19:72:535:484:11:Times:11:Times:B:20 years.  Economic theory and empirical research have not entirely kept pace with these changes.   Very
41:1986:99370:19:19:72:524:465:11:Times:11:Times:B:little theory explores the relative efficiency of consumer cost-sharing, provider cost-sharing, and direct
41:1987:99476:19:19:72:533:446:11:Times:11:Times:B:monitoring of service utilization.  In consequence, economic theory has little to say about the reasons for
41:1988:99583:19:19:72:524:427:11:Times:11:Times:B:the recent growth in managed care arrangements.  Empirical research on managed care is hampered by
41:1989:99681:19:19:72:537:408:11:Times:11:Times:B:the extraordinary variety of plans that fall into the general category.  Research is needed to identify which
41:1990:99790:19:19:72:537:389:11:Times:11:Times:B:characteristics of managed care generate economically meaningful differences in outcomes and which are
41:1991:99892:19:19:72:510:370:11:Times:11:Times:B:only superficial.  The regulation of managed care practice, antitrust and malpractice law concerning
41:1992:99992:19:19:72:495:351:11:Times:11:Times:B:managed care, and the integration of managed care into public programs are proceeding rapidly.
41:1993:100086:19:0:72:452:332:11:Times:11:Times:B:Theoretical and empirical research in this area are of critical public policy importance.

56:2413:130986:7:27:72:532:679:6:Times:10:Times:F:1  Managed care has been particularly important in mental health care.  This literature is described in the Handbook
56:2414:131102:27:19:72:331:652:10:Times:10:Times:F:chapter on mental health economics (Frank and McGuire, 1999).
56:2415:131163:19:27:72:515:633:6:Times:10:Times:F:2 .  Low payment levels, however, may have made it difficult for fee-for-service Medicaid beneficiaries to gain
56:2416:131274:27:19:72:145:606:10:Times:10:Times:F:access to services.

56:2418:131388:23:27:72:519:564:6:Times:10:Times:F:4 If risk segmentation allows previously uninsured healthy people to obtain health insurance, managed care may
56:2419:131498:27:23:72:530:537:10:Times:10:Times:F:slightly increase total health care costs.  If risk segmentation encourages people with poor health habits to improve
56:2420:131615:23:19:72:341:514:10:Times:10:Times:F:their behavior, managed care could decrease total health care costs.
56:2421:131683:19:27:72:537:495:6:Times:10:Times:F:5 .  Note that conventional insurers may also use direct supply constraints to limit access to technology (Ramsey and
56:2422:131800:27:0:72:126:468:10:Times:10:Times:F:Pauly, 1997).
