2:31:1449:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The French Revolution of 1789 had a momentous impact on neighboring countries. The French Revolutionary
2:32:1552:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:armies during the 1790s and later under Napoleon invaded and controlled large parts of Europe. Together
2:33:1655:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:with invasion came various radical institutional changes. French invasion removed the legal and economic
2:34:1759:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:barriers that had protected the nobility, clergy, guilds, and urban oligarchies and established the principle
2:35:1868:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:of equality before the law. The evidence suggests that areas that were occupied by the French and
2:36:1965:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth,
2:37:2065:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:especially after 1850. There is no evidence of a negative effect of French invasion. Our interpretation
2:38:2168:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:is that the Revolution destroyed (the institutional underpinnings of) the power of oligarchies and elites
2:39:2273:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:opposed to economic change; combined with the arrival of new economic and industrial opportunities
2:40:2371:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:in the second half of the 19th century, this helped pave the way for future economic growth. The evidence
2:41:2476:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:does not provide any support for several other views, most notably, that evolved institutions are inherently
2:42:2584:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:superior to those 'designed'; that institutions must be 'appropriate' and cannot be 'transplanted'; and
2:43:2687:14:42:72:451:420:12:Times:12:Times:that the civil code and other French institutions have adverse economic effects.

3:72:3246:0:29:79:192:671:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1    Introduction
3:73:3263:29:19:79:525:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The recent literature on comparative development has emphasized that underdevelopment is
3:74:3351:19:18:79:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:caused by institutions that do not create the right incentives for economic growth.  But there
3:75:3445:18:19:79:525:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is  disagreement  about  which  specific  institutions  are  important.   Some  scholars  emphasize
3:76:3544:19:18:79:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:property rights (North and Thomas, 1973, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2001, Acemoglu
3:77:3631:18:18:79:525:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Johnson, 2005), some legal institutions (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny,
3:78:3725:18:19:79:461:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1998) and others barriers to entry or oligarchies (Olson, 1982, Acemoglu, 2008).
3:79:3805:19:18:96:525:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Another unresolved issue is whether institutions can be designed,  and relatedly whether
3:80:3893:18:19:79:525:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they can be reformed externally.  Hayek (1960) argued that institutions cannot be designed
3:81:3983:19:18:79:525:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and have to evolve organically (and that this was the major reason for the inferiority of the
3:82:4076:18:19:79:525:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:civil code), and a recent literature has claimed that institutions have to be ‘appropriate’ to the
3:83:4174:19:18:79:524:457:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:specific circumstances of countries (Berkowitz, Pistor and Richard, 2003a,b, Rodrik, 2007).1
3:84:4266:18:18:79:525:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These problems are amplified when such reforms are implemented ‘Big Bang’ style.  Propo-
3:85:4354:18:19:79:525:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nents of these views argue that enforced institutional change is likely to reduce prosperity, a
3:86:4449:19:18:79:525:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:claim that receives some support from the apparent failures of institutional reforms in Latin
3:87:4542:18:19:79:525:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:America, Africa, the former Soviet Union in the 1980s and 1990s, and the recent experiences in
3:88:4636:19:18:79:525:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Afghanistan and Iraq.  Not all external reform are failures, however, as evidenced, for example,
3:89:4732:18:18:79:416:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the successful US-imposed reforms in postwar Germany and Japan.
3:90:4798:18:19:96:525:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper we exploit the variation in institutional reform created in Europe by the French
3:91:4892:19:18:79:525:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Revolution to investigate the consequences of radical, externally-imposed reform on subsequent
3:92:4986:18:19:79:525:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economic growth.  After 1792 French armies invaded and reformed the institutions of many
3:93:5074:19:18:79:525:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:European countries.  The lessons from this episode are central to some of the current debates on
3:94:5170:18:19:79:525:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:institutions. First, the package of reforms the French imposed on areas they conquered included
3:95:5265:19:18:79:525:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the civil code, the abolition of guilds and the remnants of feudalism, and the introduction of
3:96:5359:18:18:79:525:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equality before the law and the undermining of aristocratic privilege. These reforms thus clearly
3:97:5456:18:19:79:525:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relate to the above-mentioned debates.  If oligarchies were the main barrier to economic growth
3:98:5551:19:18:79:525:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Europe at the turn of the 19th century, then we would expect the Revolutionary reforms
3:99:5640:18:19:79:525:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to unleash more rapid economic growth in affected areas.  If, on the other hand, externally-
3:100:5732:19:16:79:525:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imposed  radical  reform  is  generally  costly  or  if  the  civil  code  creates  major  distortions,  the
3:101:5840:16:14:91:525:128:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:1Relatedly, a dominant paradigm in economics maintains that institutions efficiently—albeit slowly—adapt
3:102:5944:14:11:79:525:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:to the underlying characteristics of society (e.g., Demsetz, 1967, Djankov, Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes
3:103:6055:11:0:79:157:103:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:and Shleifer, 2003).
4:104:6076:0:18:79:257:671:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:reforms should have negative effects.2
4:105:6114:18:19:96:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We investigate the economic consequences of the French Revolution, and particularly, the
4:106:6202:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms that it imposed on the rest of Europe, by using two sources of historical data.  The first
4:107:6300:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is cross-national.  French armies invaded and reformed some parts of Europe but not others,
4:108:6391:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so we can take those invaded as the ‘treatment group’ and compare their relative economic
4:109:6480:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:success before and after the revolutionary period.  Nevertheless, there is a substantial amount
4:110:6575:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of heterogeneity in this sample.  For instance, the French tended to have a greater impact on
4:111:6668:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries in Western Europe compared to Eastern Europe and even though we show that there
4:112:6757:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is no evidence of pre-trends, this does not rule out potential unobserved differences between
4:113:6850:19:18:79:241:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the treatment and control groups.
4:114:6883:18:19:96:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition to cross-national variation, we also examine variation within Germany.  Parts
4:115:6972:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Germany,  primarily the west and northwest,  were invaded and reformed,  while the south
4:116:7063:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the east were not.  Therefore we can construct more comparable treatment and control
4:117:7151:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:groups within Germany.  In addition, we collected data to develop several series of institutional
4:118:7248:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms  across  German  polities.   This  enables  us  both  to  verify  that  the  French  did  indeed
4:119:7352:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform various aspects of institutions and to utilize a two-stage least squares strategy,  with
4:120:7447:19:18:79:353:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French invasion as an instrument for institutional reform.
4:121:7505:18:19:96:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Crucially for our identification strategy, European countries or parts of Germany did not
4:122:7594:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:choosethe French institutions, but those institutions wereimposedon them first by the Revo-
4:123:7685:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lution and then by Napoleon.3Moreover, territorial expansion by French armies did not target
4:124:7777:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:places with a greater future growth potential.  Instead, it had two major objectives.  The first
4:125:7873:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was defensive, especially, in response to the threat of Austrian or Prussian (or later British)
4:126:7968:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attempts to topple the Revolutionary regime.  The second was expansionary.  This was partly
4:127:8059:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because of resource needs of the French Republic, and partly because of the ideology of the
4:128:8150:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French Revolution.  In addition,  in the early 1790s,  the French sought to establish France’s
4:129:8244:19:16:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:‘natural frontiers.’4Finally, the purpose of the institutional reforms of the French Revolution
4:130:8339:16:14:91:525:194:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:2These issues are also related to the classic historical debate about the extent to which the institutions of
4:131:8448:14:11:79:525:180:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:theancien r ́egimeimpeded capitalism and economic growth and whether or not the French Revolution played a
4:132:8554:11:11:79:525:169:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:constructive or destructive role in European political development. The historical debate about the consequences
4:133:8666:11:11:79:525:158:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:of the French Revolution is also about its impact on political institutions and democracy, which is beyond the
4:134:8776:11:7:79:188:147:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:scope of the current paper.
4:135:8803:7:15:91:525:140:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:3In most cases, there were local Jacobin (local radical) forces in the countries invaded by the French armies,
4:136:8913:15:11:79:525:125:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:but the presence of such forces did not play a major role in determining which countres and cities were invaded
4:137:9024:11:7:79:313:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:by the French.  See, for example, Doyle (1989, Chapter 9).
4:138:9082:7:15:91:525:107:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:4For  example,  the  Revolutionary  leader  George  Danton  stated:  “Les  limites  de  la  France  sont  marqu ́ees
4:139:9198:15:0:79:525:92:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:par  la  nature,  nous  les  atteindrons  des  quatre  coins  de  l’horizon,  du  cˆot ́e  du  Rhin,  du  cˆot ́e  de  l’Oc ́ean,  du
5:140:9332:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was  not  to  foster  industrialization  per  se,  though  they  may  have  achieved  this  objective  as
5:141:9437:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a  by-product  of  its  major  goal  of  destroying  the  grip  of  the  aristocracy,  oligarchy,  and  the
5:142:9544:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:clergy on political and economic power.5Therefore, to a first approximation, we can think of
5:143:9636:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the imposition of the institutions of the French Revolution as an ‘exogenous treatment’ and
5:144:9727:19:18:79:402:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigate the economic implications of the radical French reforms.
5:145:9795:18:19:96:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  distinguish  three  definitions  of  ‘French  treatment:’  (1)  length  of  French  occupation
5:146:9893:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(in  years),  (2)  a  dummy  for  French  control  during  the  Revolutionary  period  prior  to  the
5:147:9994:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:take-over of Napoleon in 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire in the revolutionary calendar), (3)
5:148:10083:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a  dummy  for  French  control  during  the  Napoleonic  period  up  until  1815.   Using  all  three
5:149:10184:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:definitions,  we find reduced-form evidence,  both across countries and within Germany,  that
5:150:10277:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our main proxy for economic prosperity,  urbanization rates,  increased significantly faster in
5:151:10372:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treated areas during the second half of the 19th century.  We also supplement our cross-country
5:152:10467:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis with Maddison’s GDP data.  Maddison reports data for ‘Germany’ and ‘Italy’ prior
5:153:10556:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to their unification,  rather than the independent polities which subsequently unified.  Much
5:154:10649:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  the  variation  in  French  treatment,  however,  is  within  what  became  Germany  and  Italy,
5:155:10749:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so Maddison’s data are much less appropriate than the urbanization data for our purposes.
5:156:10838:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, the findings with GDP per-capita are similar, though on the whole weaker than
5:157:10929:18:19:79:226:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those using urbanization rates.
5:158:10960:19:18:96:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Within  Germany,  we  provide  supporting  evidence  using  the  expansion  of  railways  and
5:159:11053:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sectoral composition of employment, again suggesting that treated parts of Germany grew
5:160:11144:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more rapidly—in fact, industrialized more rapidly—after 1850.  Using German data, we further
5:161:11236:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:show a strong association between our measures of institutional reforms and French invasion
5:162:11327:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or  control.   Using  this  association  as  a  first  stage,  we  also  estimate  instrumental-variables
5:163:11432:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:models,  which indicate large effects of institutional reforms on subsequent growth.  Overall,
5:164:11526:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our results show no evidence that the reforms imposed by the French had negative economic
5:165:11615:19:19:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consequences.  On the contrary, there is fairly consistent evidence from a variety of different

5:167:11827:11:11:79:525:180:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:1793; quoted in Blanning 1983, p.  2).  Grab (2003, p.  1) summarizes these motives and arguments as:  “The
5:168:11934:11:11:79:525:169:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:revolutionary governments justified the occupation of foreign lands, using the theory of ‘natural frontiers’ and
5:169:12046:11:7:79:406:158:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:declaring their intention or liberating oppressed people from tyrannical regimes.”
5:170:12128:7:15:91:525:151:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:5It is unlikely that the reforms were made specifically to encourage industrial growth.  Most likely, no one
5:171:12236:15:11:79:525:136:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:at the turn of the 19th century could have anticipated the new technologies that were to arrive a few decades
5:172:12345:11:11:79:525:125:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:later.  The exception to this statement is textiles.  By 1800 the British and others had established some new
5:173:12454:11:11:79:525:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:technologies that increased productivity (e.g., in spinning) by an order of magnitude.  Textiles are an important
5:174:12567:11:11:79:525:103:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:part of the story in the Rhineland, discussed below, but there is no evidence that the French changed institutions
5:175:12681:11:0:79:460:92:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:in the Rhineland specifically because they foresaw great potential in the manufacture of cloth.
6:176:12777:0:18:79:317:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical strategies that they had positive effects.
6:177:12829:18:19:96:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An important aspect of our findings is that the positive effects of institutional reforms are
6:178:12922:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only visible in the second half of the 19th century.  By 1850, treated areas show no differential
6:179:13019:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth or in some specifications, slight (and insignificant) negative growth.  This is not sur-
6:180:13114:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prising.  The French reforms were accompanied by the disruptions caused by invasion and war
6:181:13205:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and this often had quite destructive and exploitative aspects (see, for instance, Blanning, 1983,
6:182:13302:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1986).  Grab (2003, p.  1), for example, writes “the French armies requisitioned provisions and
6:183:13397:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imposed heavy war contributions on occupied regions, thereby alienating their populations.”
6:184:13488:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus,  the  short-term  impact  of  French  invasion  may  have  been  negative.   But  this  is  unin-
6:185:13591:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formative about the impact of Revolution-imposed institutional changes.  The most plausible
6:186:13682:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hypothesis—and our starting point—is that the major role of the reforms was in creating an
6:187:13772:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurial activity.  This environment mattered
6:188:13864:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most in the dissemination of the industrial revolution, which took place in Continental Europe
6:189:13958:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the second half of the 19th century.6Our evidence of positive effects in the second half of
6:190:14052:18:18:79:323:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 19th century is consistent with this hypothesis.
6:191:14104:18:19:96:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are several main conclusions from the evidence presented in this paper.  First, the
6:192:14193:19:18:79:524:376:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:results emphasize the role of institutions and institutional reforms in economic development.7
6:193:14287:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:Second, our findings are consistent with the view that the institutions of theancien  r ́egime
6:194:14381:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(guilds,  feudal  legacy  in  countryside,  absence  of  equality  before  the  law)  impeded  growth.
6:195:14483:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, the fact that French reforms came as a bundle does not allow us to assess the rel-
6:196:14574:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ative importance of, for example, the abolition of guilds compared to the abolition of feudal
6:197:14667:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:privileges.  Third, they do not support the view that civil code and French institutions have
6:198:14760:18:16:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:detrimental  economic  effects.8Fourth,  the  evidence  does  not  support  the  thesis  that  insti-
6:199:14861:16:15:91:525:250:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:6This argument is similar to that of Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson
6:200:14961:15:11:79:525:235:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(2002) who argue that the divergence of institutions in colonial societies, which took place between 1500 and
6:201:15070:11:7:79:314:224:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:1800, had little economic impact until the age of industry.
6:202:15129:7:15:91:525:217:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:7Also noteworthy is that unlike the experience of European colonialism in the wider world, the French did
6:203:15234:15:11:79:525:202:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:not settle after 1815 in the parts of Europe they reformed and they did not build schools, so during this episode
6:204:15347:11:11:79:525:191:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:there were large changes in institutions with culture, human capital and the ethnic composition of the population
6:205:15460:11:7:79:197:180:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:remaining largely unchanged.
6:206:15488:7:15:91:525:173:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:8This statement is subject to two obvious caveats, firstly, that the comparison is not to the common law,
6:207:15593:15:11:79:525:158:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:and secondly,  that it could be that the imposition of the civil code did have negative effects, but these were
6:208:15704:11:11:79:525:147:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:more than compensated for by positive effects emanating from reforms simultaneously implemented with the
6:209:15808:11:11:79:525:136:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:civil code.  These caveats notwithstanding, if the civil code and other aspects of French institutions were highly
6:210:15922:11:11:79:525:125:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:damaging to growth,  particularly if imposed on other countries,  we would expect to find significant negative
6:211:16032:11:11:79:525:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:effects in treated areas.  In addition, apart from parts of the world that voluntarily adopted the civil code, such
6:212:16147:11:11:79:525:103:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:as Latin America, existing evidence on the consequences of the civil code comes from former French colonies
6:213:16254:11:0:79:495:92:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:which, like the Europe we study, had the civil code imposed simultaneously with other French reforms.
7:214:16356:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tutions are efficiently adapted to the underlying characteristics of a society and that evolved
7:215:16451:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:institutions are superior to those that are designed or externally imposed.  The French Revolu-
7:216:16546:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tionary armies imposed new and radically different institutions from those existing previously,
7:217:16641:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and did so in extreme ‘Big Bang’ style.  Nevertheless, our evidence suggests that this was an
7:218:16734:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:‘economic  success’.   Taken  together,  these  findings  are  interesting  for  those  who  favor  radi-
7:219:16839:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cal institutional reforms.  They suggest these may be successful, at least in certain historical
7:220:16935:19:18:79:121:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contexts.
7:221:16944:18:18:96:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  success  of  the  French  reforms  raises  the  question:   why  did  they  work  when  other
7:222:17042:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:externally-imposed reforms often fail?  Most likely this is because the reforms were much more
7:223:17136:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:radical than is typically the case.9The French reformed simultaneously in many dimensions
7:224:17225:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and weakened the powers of local elites, making a return to the status quo ante largely impossi-
7:225:17321:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ble.  Even when some pre-revolution elites returned to power after 1815, there was a permanent
7:226:17415:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change in the political equilibrium.  This scope and radicalism of the French reforms are com-
7:227:17509:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mon with the post-war reform experiences in Germany and Japan and stand in contrast with
7:228:17597:18:18:79:229:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many other reform experiences.
7:229:17627:18:19:96:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition to the literature on the implications and desirability of different types of insti-
7:230:17722:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tutional reforms, discussed above, our paper is related to a large literature on the consequences
7:231:17819:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the French Revolution.  The debate on the French Revolution was started in its modern form
7:232:17912:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the pamphlet published by the conservative English philosopher Edmund Burke in 1790,
7:233:17999:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entitledReflections  on  the  Revolution  in  France,which initiated controversies about institu-
7:234:18096:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tional  change  which  continue  today.   In  this  pamphlet,  Burke  condemned  the  brutality,  the
7:235:18197:18:26:79:451:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interventionist spirit and the radicalism of the French Revolution and argued:
7:236:18275:26:19:122:497:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“It is with infinite caution that any man should venture upon pulling down an
7:237:18352:19:18:106:498:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:edifice, which has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes of
7:238:18435:18:18:106:498:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:society, or on building it up again without having models and patterns of approved
7:239:18517:18:27:106:315:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:utility before his eyes” Burke (1969, p.152).
7:240:18562:27:18:79:525:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  conclusion  Burke  drew  from  these  events  was  that  the  negative  impacts  of  the  French
7:241:18663:18:18:79:525:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Revolution  would  be  felt  not  only  in  France  and  not  only  in  its  immediate  aftermath,  but
7:242:18766:18:19:79:489:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would potentially change the world for many more decades or even centuries to come.
7:243:18849:19:18:96:525:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:On the other side, the positive reception of the French Revolution was as enthusiastic as
7:244:18938:18:15:79:525:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Burke’s condemnation.  Thomas Paine, in a book that would subsequently become a classic for
7:245:19029:15:0:91:497:88:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:9See Acemoglu and Robinson (2008) for a model in which limited reforms can be counterproductive.
8:246:19126:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the democratization movements of the 19th-century Europe,The Rights of Man, responded to
8:247:19214:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Burke in 1791.  Paine hailed the French Revolution as the harbinger of freedom and equality
8:248:19305:19:30:79:496:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before the law, a role that it achieved by demolishing theancien r ́egime.  Paine argued:
8:249:19394:30:19:122:497:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“It was . . .  against the despotic principles of the government, that the nation
8:250:19475:19:18:106:498:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:revolted.  These principles had . . .  become too deeply rooted to be removed, and
8:251:19557:18:19:106:498:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Augean stable of parasites and plunderers too abominably filthy to be cleansed,
8:252:19640:19:30:106:482:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by anything short of a complete and universal revolution” Paine (1969, p.  69).
8:253:19719:30:18:79:525:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:According to Paine, the French Revolution was exactly the kind of radical institutional reform
8:254:19813:18:19:79:525:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:necessary  to  break  the  hold  on  land  and  people  exercised  by  theancien  r ́egime,  which  was
8:255:19916:19:18:79:525:481:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not  only  morally  abhorrent,  but  also  the  source  of  significant  economic  inefficiencies.   The
8:256:20020:18:19:79:525:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Revolution would therefore pave the way for modern freedoms and democratic institutions by
8:257:20110:19:18:79:525:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:removing serfdom, aristocratic privileges, the Church’s domination over politics and land, and
8:258:20204:18:18:79:192:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inequity before the law.
8:259:20228:18:19:96:525:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The debate between Burke and Paine has not been resolved by academic research and there
8:260:20315:19:18:79:525:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is no consensus about the economic consequences of the French Revolution.  On the one hand,
8:261:20406:18:19:79:525:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many economic historians, like Landes (1969, p.  142), view the French Revolution as “a po-
8:262:20497:19:18:79:525:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:litical roadblock” to technological adoption for Continental countries, and conclude that as a
8:263:20591:18:19:79:525:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consequence of the Revolution, “the gap in technique [between the Continent and Britain] had
8:264:20683:19:18:79:525:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:widened, while most of the fundamental educational, economic, and social obstacles to imita-
8:265:20775:18:18:79:525:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion remained” (Landes, 1969, p.  147).  Similarly, Buyst and Mokyr (1990, p.  64, 74) write: “it
8:266:20872:18:19:79:525:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is our contention . . .  that the Dutch economy in the years of the French and Napoleonic Wars
8:267:20966:19:18:79:525:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was another example of a small open commercial economy whose prosperity was disrupted by
8:268:21054:18:19:79:525:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:world events . . .  The French period . . .  [was] disastrous for the Dutch economy.” Crouzet’s
8:269:21149:19:18:79:525:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2001, p.  121) view is similar, noting “the French Revolution and the wars that followed greatly
8:270:21246:18:16:79:251:205:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:slowed the transfer of technology.”10
8:271:21283:16:15:87:525:189:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:10Within the history profession the economic impact of the French Revolution has become inexorably inter-
8:272:21388:15:11:79:525:174:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:twined with the Marxist interpretation of the revolution as marking the ‘rise of the bourgoisie’.  Most historians
8:273:21502:11:11:79:525:163:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:now reject a Marxist interpretation of the Revolution, but have not articulated an alternative assessment of its
8:274:21614:11:11:79:525:152:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:implications.  Other economic historians simply ignore the Revolution.  In the literature on 19th century German
8:275:21726:11:11:79:525:141:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:industrialization, for example, though it is common to argue that the Stein-Hardenberg Reforms in Prussia after
8:276:21837:11:11:79:525:130:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:1807, which were induced by the defeat of Prussia by Napoleon at Jena, helped to modernize agriculture and
8:277:21943:11:11:79:525:119:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:facilitate the reallocation of labor to industrial areas (e.g., Tilly, 1996), little mention is made of any potential
8:278:22060:11:11:79:525:108:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:impact of French institutional reforms in Germany.  The institutional reform most mentioned is the formation
8:279:22168:11:0:79:241:97:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:of the Zollverein customs union in 1833.
9:280:22209:0:18:96:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:On the other hand, many other economic historians also agree with Mokyr’s assessments
9:281:22294:18:19:79:526:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  “the  Revolution’s  long-term  effect  was  to  clear  up  the  debris  of  theancien  r ́egimeon
9:282:22397:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Continent, thus assuring Europe’s ability eventually to follow Britain in revolutionizing its
9:283:22494:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:productive system” (1990, p.  259), and that   “the French Revolution and Napoleon installed
9:284:22586:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more forward looking governments in Europe” (1990, p.  253). Even Landes, who generally em-
9:285:22677:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:phasizes the negative effects of the Revolution, also mentions in passing that such institutional
9:286:22774:19:18:79:419:560:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:changes as the abolition of guilds were beneficial (1969, pp.  144-145).11
9:287:22848:18:18:96:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the history of
9:288:22943:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the French Revolution and the subsequent invasion of Europe by the French. Section 3 discusses

9:293:23352:29:19:79:525:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we provide a brief sketch of certain aspects of the French Revolution and the
9:294:23446:19:18:79:525:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:situation in various neighboring countries and cities before the Revolution that are relevant
9:295:23539:18:19:79:525:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to our investigation.  We also recount how expansion by the French Revolutionary armies and
9:296:23630:19:18:79:526:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:later by Napoleon affected these areas.12Further historical details are provided in Acemoglu,
9:297:23723:18:18:79:269:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Cantoni, Johnson and Robinson (2009).
9:298:23760:18:19:96:525:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The Revolution was precipitated by a long-running fiscal crisis which led to the convening
9:299:23850:19:18:79:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:of theEstates-Generalin 1789 for the first time since 1614.  The initial meeting of theEstates-
9:300:23945:18:19:79:525:276:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:Generalin  Versailles  on  May  5,  1789  ended  with  the  decision  to  convene  a  more  powerful
9:301:24045:19:18:79:525:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:body,  theNational  Assembly,  which  initiated  a  process  of  radicalization  culminating  in  the
9:302:24146:18:19:79:526:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789.  The newly-formedNational  Constituent  Assembly
9:303:24237:19:18:79:525:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:abolished feudalism and all of the special privileges and rights of theFirstandSecond Estates
9:304:24330:18:18:79:525:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on August 4, 1789.  This was followed by the abolition of the Church’s authority to levy special
9:305:24426:18:19:79:525:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taxes, and later turning the clergy into employees of the state, thus starting the process of the
9:306:24523:19:16:79:525:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separation of church and state.  It subsequently passed a constitution on September 29, 1791,

9:308:24735:15:11:79:525:134:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(1964), Kisch (1962), Trebilcock (1981), Doyle (1989), or Grab (2003) also argue that the French reforms were
9:309:24844:11:10:79:525:123:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:significant improvements relative to the situation at the time.  None of these works systematically investigates
9:310:24956:10:8:79:403:113:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the economic consequences of the Revolution either in the short or the long run.
9:311:25036:8:14:87:525:105:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:12This section draws on Doyle (1989), Palmer (1959, 1964), Rud ́e (1988), Grab (2003), and Blanning (1983,
9:312:25142:14:0:79:128:91:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:1986, 1996).
10:313:25155:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:making France a constitutional monarchy.  This constitution also removed the major power of
10:314:25246:18:19:79:188:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the guilds in the cities.
10:315:25271:19:18:96:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The radicalization of the Revolution led to theTerrorwhich ended with the execution of
10:316:25357:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Robespierre and Saint-Just in July 1794.  There followed a phase of relative stability, first in
10:317:25453:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the form of collective government under the Directory between 1795 and 1799, and then with
10:318:25543:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more concentrated power in the form of a three person Consulate, consisting of Ducos, Sieyes
10:319:25635:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  Napoleon  Bonaparte.   Already  during  the  directory,  the  young  general  Bonaparte  had
10:320:25732:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:become famous for his military successes and statesmanship.  His influence was only to grow
10:321:25823:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after 1799.  The Consulate soon became personal rule by Napoleon, who initially engineered
10:322:25913:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:his election as First Consul in November 1799 with the coup of the 18th of Brumaire and then
10:323:26005:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:declared himself emperor in 1804.  The years between 1799 and the end of Napoleon’s reign,
10:324:26095:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1815, witnessed a series of great victories, including those at Austerlitz, Jena-Auerstedt, and
10:325:26190:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Wagram, bringing continental Europe to its knees.  They also allowed Napoleon to impose his
10:326:26281:19:29:79:350:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will (and his legal code) across a wide swath of territory.
10:327:26340:29:25:79:287:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2.1    Europe Before the Revolution
10:328:26375:25:19:79:525:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Before the age of the French Revolution, much of Europe was dominated by two kinds of oli-
10:329:26465:19:18:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garchies, the landed nobility in agriculture and the urban-based oligarchy controlling commerce
10:330:26560:18:19:79:385:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and various occupations, with explicit or implicit entry barriers.
10:331:26626:19:18:96:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:By  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century,  feudalism  in  its  most  rigid  form  had  disappeared
10:332:26726:18:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in many parts of Europe, but a lot of its remnants remained.  Serfdom—the system through
10:333:26814:18:19:79:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which peasants are tied to the land and cannot sell their labor in free markets or engage in
10:334:26906:19:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other occupations without the permission of landowners—still continued in much of Eastern
10:335:26995:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Europe (see Blum, 1978), while it had been replaced by various forms of taxes and tributes to
10:336:27088:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:landowners in other areas, which could nonetheless be quite onerous.13For example, in the
10:337:27177:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rhineland,  the  first  area  in  Germany  to  come  under  French  control,  an  attenuated  form  of
10:338:27279:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:serfdom (Grundherrschaft) which severely restricted freedom of movement was still practiced

10:340:27465:18:19:79:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Elbe where serfdom still prevailed.  But even in many western regions where serfdom had
10:341:27556:19:16:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:declined and peasants were freer and better off, they were often still subject to landlords to
10:342:27650:16:14:87:525:121:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:13Since one could be concerned that including Eastern Europe in the sample leads the control group to be
10:343:27754:14:11:79:525:107:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:very  heterogeneous,  in  the  empirical  work  we  show  that  all  our  results  hold  when  we  restrict  our  sample  to
10:344:27878:11:0:79:181:96:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Europe West of the Elbe.
11:345:27903:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whom they owed seigneurial fees and labor obligations.  In addition they had to pay taxes and
11:346:27996:18:19:79:311:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:support their parishes and village communities.”
11:347:28044:19:18:96:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Even when serfdom in its classic form was absent, various rights of the nobility and clergy
11:348:28135:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:created  a  very  unequal  political  and  economic  situation  in  rural  areas.   These  groups  were
11:349:28238:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:frequently exempt from taxation by the state and enjoyed the right of taxation of the peasants
11:350:28332:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:under their control.  Lenger (2004, p.  92), for example, describes this as:  “besides the origi-
11:351:28429:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nal obligations to provide services and dues to the lord the agricultural labor force was also
11:352:28523:18:26:79:316:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:burdened with personal servitude”.  He continues:
11:353:28572:26:19:106:498:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“In the small territory of Nassau-Usingen around 1800 there were no less than 230
11:354:28653:19:18:106:498:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:different payments, dues, and services that the peasants living there had to provide
11:355:28737:18:18:106:498:479:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the lords.  Dues included . . .  the ‘blood tithe’ to be paid after an animal was
11:356:28821:18:19:106:498:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:slaughtered, a ‘bee tithe’, a ‘wax tithe’ . . .  as well as large fees owed to the lord
11:357:28908:19:26:106:433:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whenever a piece of property changed hands.” (Lenger, 2004, p.  96).
11:358:28976:26:18:79:525:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Moreover, in places where some form of seigneurial privilege remained, it was usual for nobility
11:359:29072:18:19:79:525:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and clergy to be subject to different laws and courts.  The principle of equality before the law
11:360:29168:19:18:79:395:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was quite alien (or even revolutionary) in most of Europe in 1789.
11:361:29234:18:19:96:525:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  urban  oligarchy  was  perhaps  even  more  pernicious  to  industrialization.   Almost  all
11:362:29331:19:18:79:525:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:major occupations were controlled by guilds, significantly limiting entry into those professions
11:363:29427:18:19:79:525:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by others, and often restricting adoption of new technologies (see White, 2001, for examples
11:364:29519:19:18:79:525:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from French guilds).  For example, Cipolla (1970) argues that the guilds stopped innovation
11:365:29610:18:18:79:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Italy, in particular they forbade the production of exactly the type of lower quality goods
11:366:29704:18:19:79:525:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that were taking their markets.  In Venice (p.  206) “for almost the whole of the 17th century,
11:367:29799:19:18:79:525:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  statutes  of  the  guild  prevented  cloth  from  being  made  of  the  English  and  Dutch  type,
11:368:29902:18:19:79:525:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which had had so much success on the international markets.  Moreover, the guild statutes not
11:369:29995:19:18:79:525:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only demanded the production of a traditional type of goods, but also prevented the adoption
11:370:30087:18:19:79:525:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of new methods of making these old products.” Braudel’s (1992, p.  136) and Rapp’s (1976)
11:371:30176:19:18:79:525:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis is similar.  For the  case of Germany,  a similar argument  is made by  Ogilvie  (2004,
11:372:30272:18:18:79:525:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2007)  and  Kisch  (1989)  for  the  Rhineland.   In  the  major  cities  of  Cologne  and  Aachen  the
11:373:30375:18:19:79:525:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adoption of new textile (spinning and weaving) machines were significantly delayed because
11:374:30465:19:18:79:525:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  guild  restrictions.   In  addition,  many  cities  were  controlled  by  a  few  families  for  many
11:375:30570:18:19:79:525:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generations, amassing wealth at the expense of potential new entrants with greater ability or
11:376:30663:19:0:79:172:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:better technologies.

12:378:30709:26:18:79:525:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Despite the fact that the French Revolution was immediately seen as threatening to Europe’s
12:379:30800:18:18:79:525:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elite, war—the so-called War of the First Coalition—did not break out until 1792.14Contrary
12:380:30891:18:19:79:525:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to almost everyone’s expectations,  after some early defeats,  the armies of the new Republic
12:381:30984:19:18:79:525:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were victorious in an initially defensive war.  There were serious organizational problems to
12:382:31077:18:19:79:525:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:overcome, but particularly after the introduction of mass conscription (thelev ́ee en masse) in
12:383:31172:19:18:79:451:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:August 1793, the French had a military advantage than verged on supremacy.
12:384:31246:18:18:96:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Initial military success encouraged the Republic’s leadership to expand France’s borders,
12:385:31335:18:19:79:525:517:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with  an  eye  towards  creating  an  effective  buffer  between  the  new  Republic  and  the  hostile
12:386:31438:19:18:79:525:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:monarchs  of  Prussia  and  Austria.   The  French  quickly  seized  present-day  Belgium  and  the
12:387:31537:18:19:79:525:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Netherlands (where ice famously allowed French cavalry to capture a large part of the Dutch
12:388:31628:19:18:79:525:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:navy).  The French also gained effective control over much of modern-day Switzerland.  In all
12:389:31721:18:19:79:377:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:three places, the French had strong control through the 1790s.
12:390:31783:19:18:96:525:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Germany was initially hotly contested but by 1795 the French had firm control over the
12:391:31869:18:18:79:525:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rhineland (the west or left bank of the Rhine), and the Prussians were forced to recognize this
12:392:31964:18:19:79:525:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fact under the Treaty of Basle.15Between 1795 and 1802, the French firmly held the Rhineland,
12:393:32057:19:18:79:525:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but not any other part of Germany.  In 1802 the Rhineland was officially incorporated into
12:394:32147:18:19:79:114:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:France.
12:395:32154:19:18:96:525:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Italy remained the main seat of war in the second half the 1790s, with the Austrians as
12:396:32241:18:19:79:525:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  main  opponents.   Savoy  was  annexed  by  France  in  1792,  and  a  stalemate  was  reached
12:397:32340:19:18:79:525:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:until Napoleon’s invasion in April 1796.  In his first major continental campaign, by early 1797
12:398:32436:18:18:79:525:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon had swept up almost all of Northern Italy, except for Venice (which was taken by
12:399:32525:18:19:79:525:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  Austrians).   The  Treaty  of  Campo  Formio,  signed  with  the  Austrians  in  October  1797,
12:400:32625:19:18:79:525:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ended the War of the First Coalition and recognized a number of French-controlled republics
12:401:32716:18:19:79:163:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Northern Italy.
12:402:32734:19:18:96:525:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However,  the  French  continued  to  expand  their  control  over  Italy  even  after  this  treaty.
12:403:32835:18:19:79:525:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In March 1798 the French invaded the Papal States and established the Roman Republic.  In

12:405:33017:16:14:87:525:150:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:14The  initial  reaction  in  European  capitals  was  amazement  but  there  was  no  perceived  need  to  intervene.
12:406:33135:14:11:79:525:136:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:This changed with the execution of Louis XVI. See Doyle (1989) for general background and Blanning (1986)

12:410:33511:11:0:87:525:96:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:16The Parthenopean Republic was short-lived, but the French were soon back and—under Napoleon—seem to

13:413:33806:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pean).  There was further back-and-forth in the War of the Second Coalition (1798-1801), but
13:414:33898:18:30:79:363:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this ended with the French essentially remaining in control.

13:416:34022:25:18:79:525:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Many  of  the  most  radical  institutional  changes  were  undertaken  during  the  invasion  of  the
13:417:34124:18:19:79:525:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French  Revolutionary  armies.   This  included  the  abolition  of  all  the  remaining  vestiges  of
13:418:34226:19:18:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:serfdom  and  quasi-feudal  land  relations,  the  hold  of  the  clergy  over  economic  and  political
13:419:34330:18:19:79:525:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:power,  the  domination  of  the  guilds  in  urban  areas,  and  legal  changes  establishing  equality
13:420:34434:19:18:79:150:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before the law.
13:421:34449:18:19:96:525:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Belgium “The clergy and the nobility, the two upper estates, enjoyed many privileges
13:422:34536:19:18:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and possessed considerable wealth and political power . . .  Urban guilds and corporations, the
13:423:34631:18:18:79:525:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dominant element in the Third Estate, also possessed important privileges and controlled the
13:424:34723:18:19:79:525:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:towns” (Grab, 2003, p.  75).  France annexed Belgium in 1795 and ruled for 20 years.  Equality
13:425:34817:19:18:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before the law was established and seigneurial rights, the tithe, noble privileges, and the guilds
13:426:34915:18:19:79:525:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were abolished; in fact, from December 1796, any new French legislation became applicable in
13:427:35007:19:18:79:218:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Belgium (Grab, 2003, p.  78).
13:428:35036:18:19:96:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the Netherlands (or United Provinces), the existing institutions were more those of en-
13:429:35126:19:18:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trenched urban oligarchies in the various cities.  These oligarchies were effectively expropriated
13:430:35224:18:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the French and, after considerable upheaval, the Batavian Republic was established along
13:431:35315:18:19:79:258:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French lines (Grab, 2003, Chapter 4).
13:432:35352:19:18:96:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Switzerland, the situation was similar to the Netherlands.  Before 1789, “Feudal priv-
13:433:35441:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ileges persisted in many rural communities.  Peasants owed the Church and landlords tithe,
13:434:35531:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seigneurial fees, and labor services.  Many Swiss lacked the freedom to settle where they wanted
13:435:35627:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to or choose the occupation they desired.” (Grab,  2003,  p.  113).  With the coming of Rev-
13:436:35719:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:olutionary  armies,  existing  oligarchs  were  dispossessed  or  forced  to  cede  power,  and  feudal
13:437:35822:19:18:79:223:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:privileges largely disappeared.
13:438:35853:18:19:96:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Germany, the only real changes during this period were in the Rhineland (West Bank
13:439:35938:19:18:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the Rhine).  While the impact of the French on the Rhineland during the 1790s remains
13:440:36026:18:20:79:525:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:controversial, especially because of the great deal of plunder and the resulting resentment by
13:441:36120:20:11:79:525:99:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:have had a great impact on some institutions in the south of Italy, on which see Davis (1991, 2003) or Gregory

14:444:36332:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the revolutionary reforms in Rhineland is not in question.  Even a critic of the French, such
14:445:36428:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as Blanning (1983), admits the significant institutional reforms undertaken by the French in
14:446:36520:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Rhineland.  Most significantly, in 1798 the seigneurial regime and the guilds were abolished
14:447:36616:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Blanning, 1983, pp.  137 and 155), and this paved the way to a relatively free labor market.
14:448:36709:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This was a major reform and meant that master artisans could (and did) set up their shops
14:449:36798:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when  they  wished  to  do  so  (Diefendorf  1980,  p.   164).   Equally  important  were  the  legal
14:450:36899:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes.  For example, the French created a commercial court in Aachen in 1794, and followed
14:451:36991:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with similar courts elsewhere in the Rhineland (Diefendorf, 1980, pp.  159-160), which were to

14:453:37179:18:19:79:110:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:follow.
14:454:37186:19:18:96:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Italy, several new Republics were established with French-style constitutions, parliaments
14:455:37279:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(on a property-based franchise), and more efficient systems of administration.  Extensive aris-
14:456:37374:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tocratic privileges were abolished and the notion of equality before the law was introduced in
14:457:37468:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnest for the first time (see Doyle, 1989, Chapter 15, Grab, 2003, Chapter 10, Broers, 1997,

14:460:37595:25:19:79:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:After Napoleon’s takeover, the French impact spread much wider throughout Europe.  In Ger-
14:461:37685:19:18:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many, where the direct control of the Revolutionary armies had been limited to the Rhineland,
14:462:37778:18:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon constructed a string of satellite buffer states on France’s northeastern border.  There
14:463:37874:18:19:79:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were  several  iterations,  but  the  big  break  point  followed  the  Peace  of  Lun ́eville  (February
14:464:37979:19:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1801), with a massive reorganization of the territories that comprised the Holy Roman Empire
14:465:38071:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(roughly Austria and Germany in their 1914 borders).  Much of the astonishing variety of the
14:466:38163:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Empire disappeared—literally hundreds of independent states, ecclesiastical territories and free
14:467:38259:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imperial cities vanished and were consolidated into a cluster of larger kingdoms, principalities,
14:468:38356:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and duchies; ultimately, their number shrank to fewer than 40 states (Grab, 2003, pp.  89-90).
14:469:38450:19:18:79:525:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The main beneficiaries were the Grand Duchy of Baden and the kingdoms of W ̈urttenberg and
14:470:38540:18:19:79:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bavaria (all in the South of Germany).  These and most other German states except Prussia
14:471:38629:19:18:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were brought together in 1806 in theRheinbund, known in English as the Confederation of the
14:472:38720:18:19:79:206:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rhine (see Schmitt, 1983).
14:473:38746:19:0:96:525:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At the same time, Napoleon proceeded to reorganize the territories in northwest Germany
15:474:38835:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:into satellite states under his control.  The Duchy of Berg on the right bank of the Rhine was
15:475:38929:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formed  in  March  1806  (it  was  supposed  to  be  ruled  by  his  infant  nephew  Louis  Napoleon),
15:476:39031:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Kingdom of Westphalia (ruled by his brother J ́erˆome) in August 1807, and the Duchy of
15:477:39122:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Frankfurt in February 1810 (it was planned that Napoleon’s stepson, Eugene de Beauharnais,
15:478:39212:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would  inherit  it).   These  were  run  by  the  French  and  persisted  until  the  collapse  following
15:479:39317:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon’s invasion of Russia.  During this period Napoleon also took over parts of Northern
15:480:39409:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Germany,  including in December 1810 the annexation into France of Hamburg,  L ̈ubeck and
15:481:39498:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bremen (Hanseatic cities) and the plains of Lower Saxony, which would later comprise most
15:482:39587:18:19:79:212:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the Kingdom of Hanover.
15:483:39613:19:18:96:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Elsewhere  the  French  maintained  their  control  over  the  Low  Countries,  and  in  1808  in-
15:484:39711:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vaded Spain.  In Italy Napoleon re-created the Cisalpine (subsequently Italian) and Ligurian
15:485:39803:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Republics and created the satellite state of the Kingdom of Etruria comprising the larger part
15:486:39897:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Tuscany.  By March 1802 the French commanded all of Italy except again the Papal States,
15:487:39988:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Naples  and  Venice.   Piedmont  was  annexed  to  France  in  early  1803,  and  in  1805  Napoleon
15:488:40088:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:turned the Italian Republic into the Kingdom of Italy (1805 to 1814) and the Ligurian Repub-
15:489:40180:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lic and Parma were made part of France.  In 1806, the French again invaded southern Italy and
15:490:40273:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon installed his brother Joseph as the King of Naples.  The Papal States were invaded
15:491:40364:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the French in 1808,  and most was annexed to France,  forming the departments of Tiber
15:492:40453:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Trasimene.  In 1808, Joseph was made King of Spain, and the Kingdom of Naples passed
15:493:40541:18:29:79:298:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to Napoleon’s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat.
15:494:40585:29:26:79:228:292:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2.5    Napoleon’s Reforms
15:495:40610:26:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although Napoleon was an Emperor seeking to solidify his control, ruthlessly when necessary, in
15:496:40705:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:France and throughout the French Empire, he nonetheless continued to implement the reforms
15:497:40795:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:initiated by the Revolutionary armies (see Grab, 2003, Connolly, 1965, and Woolf, 1991).  As
15:498:40887:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Grab (2003, p.  xi) puts it:  “Revolutionary France had initiated many of these changes and
15:499:40978:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon exported them throughout Europe.” Napoleon himself saw the imposition of the civil
15:500:41069:19:18:79:525:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:code (Code  Napol ́eon) in the areas he controlled as his most important reform (Lyons, 1994,
15:501:41162:18:19:79:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:p.  94).  In practice Napoleon’s institutional legacy outside of France is complicated, especially
15:502:41260:19:18:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:since he was more inclined to compromise with local elites at some times, but in most places
15:503:41352:18:19:79:521:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there was a genuine attempt to continue and deepen the reforms brought by the Revolution.
15:504:41441:19:0:96:525:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The motivation for the reforms seems to have been several.  First, Napoleon had himself
16:505:41530:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:been deeply involved with the reforms of the Revolutionary period and seems to have shared the
16:506:41624:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ideological commitment of the early reformers.  Second, like them, he wished to build a series
16:507:41718:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of buffer states around France.  Finally, reforms such as abolishing elites, feudal privileges and
16:508:41816:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:introducing equality before the law undermined existing elites and made it easier for Napoleon
16:509:41910:19:18:79:339:597:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:to establish control over the areas rule he conquered.17
16:510:41966:18:19:96:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Germany, Napoleon sustained the reforms already introduced into the Rhineland par-
16:511:42051:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ticularly introducing theCode  Napol ́eon.  Kisch emphasizes the economic importance of this
16:512:42143:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1989,  p.   212):  “When  the  many  strands  of  commercial  legislation  were  subsequently  con-
16:513:42243:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:solidated in theCode  Napol ́eon, the Rhineland (on the left bank) was not only given a most
16:514:42335:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:up-to-date legal framework, but also a system of government in close harmony with the needs
16:515:42426:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a buoyantly industrializing society.” The consequence of all of these changes was the trans-
16:516:42521:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formation of the Rhineland from an oligarchy-dominated area to one open to new business and
16:517:42612:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:new entrants.  Instead of the traditional oligarchy, in 1810 merchants/manufacturers comprised
16:518:42706:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:about half the members ofConseil General(municipal administrations) in leading Rhineland
16:519:42794:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:towns (Diefendorf, 1980, p.  115), and businesspeople were also well represented in the higher
16:520:42888:18:19:79:241:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:department-levelConseil General.
16:521:42920:19:18:96:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Reforms  were  also  systematically  introduced  into  the  German  satellite  kingdoms.   For
16:522:43014:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:example,  Connelly  (1965,  p.   184)  notes  that  in  the  constitution  of  Westphalia,  which  was
16:523:43116:19:30:79:304:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:issued at Fontainebleau on November 15, 1807,
16:524:43161:30:18:106:498:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“  . . .  the  king’s  subjects  were  guaranteed  equality  before  the  law  and  religious

16:526:43338:19:18:106:498:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were to command no special rights, privileges or offices.  Taxes were to fall equally
16:527:43423:18:19:106:498:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on all classes in all parts of the kingdom.  Provision was made for a ministry, council
16:528:43510:19:18:106:498:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of state, and a parliament of one hundred (seventy landowners, fifteen merchants
16:529:43590:18:19:106:498:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and manufacturers, fifteen savants and distinguished citizens) . . .  Effective January

16:532:43844:18:31:106:188:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:every five years.”
16:533:43862:31:16:79:525:131:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:He later notes (p.  189) that “all vestiges of feudal law, together with seigneurial and church
16:534:43957:16:15:87:525:115:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:17Prussia’s desire to establish its own control seems to have been one of the reasons why it did not attempt
16:535:44065:15:11:79:525:100:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:to dismantle French reforms in the parts of Western Germany that it took over after 1815 (see Fisher, 1903, pp.
16:536:44176:11:0:79:116:89:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:380-381).

17:538:44289:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and eligible for office.” Although the political changes were not implemented (the parliament
17:539:44382:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hardly  met),  the  economic  changes  were  profound  and—in  this  case  and  in  many  others—
17:540:44479:18:19:79:170:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:largely irreversible.
17:541:44500:19:18:96:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland, Napoleon consolidated the changes brought
17:542:44587:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the Revolution, with an emphasis on establishing (his) legal code and a downplaying of any
17:543:44680:19:18:79:209:560:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:move towards democracy.18
17:544:44705:18:18:96:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon’s impact on Spain is controversial.  Napoleon acquired nominal control over Spain
17:545:44795:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quite late (1808) and from that time on he had considerable distractions in the form of almost
17:546:44889:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:continual major wars. TheCode Napol ́eonwas supposedly introduced, but it is unclear whether
17:547:44981:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it was ever properly implemented.  There was also considerable popular resistance, abetted by
17:548:45074:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  British  directly  and  through  their  base  in  Portugal,  and  by  1812  the  French  had  lost
17:549:45177:18:19:79:264:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effective control south of the Pyrenees.
17:550:45217:19:18:96:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Italy, the picture is similar with theCode  Napol ́eonbeing implemented mainly in the
17:551:45305:18:29:79:388:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:North, but also involving certain profound changes in the South.

17:553:45409:26:18:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:After  the  final  collapse  of  Napoleon  in  1815  the  institutional  reforms  implemented  over  the
17:554:45513:18:19:79:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:previous 25 years suffered various fates.  In our econometric analysis of Germany we specifi-
17:555:45606:19:18:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cally code reforms throughout the 19th century so examine this issue empirically.  As a first
17:556:45699:18:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approximation, the reforms were most clearly persistent in places where the old elites did not
17:557:45793:18:19:79:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:return,  for example,  in the areas of Napoleonic Germany that were ceded to Prussia at the

17:560:46030:19:18:106:498:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the revolutionary decade, the Code became firmly entrenched.  Indeed,  it was so
17:561:46110:18:18:106:498:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:well entrenched that, after 1815, the Rhenish elite successfully preserved the Code
17:562:46193:18:19:106:498:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  resisted  attempts  of  their  new  Prussian  masters  to  introduce  the  Prussian

17:564:46306:16:15:87:525:146:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:18Napoleon also briefly invaded Portugal,  but the French presence did not last long,  partly due to British
17:565:46414:15:11:79:525:131:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:intervention.  We therefore treat Portugal as part of the control group, along with Austria (where Napoleon also
17:566:46526:11:7:79:270:120:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:had military victories but never ruled directly).
17:567:46575:7:14:87:525:113:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:19See Sperber (1989) and (1991) for details on the Rhinelanders tried (and succeeded for a long while) to hold
17:568:46685:14:0:79:383:99:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:onto theCode Napol ́eonand other progressive aspects of the French legacy.
18:569:46761:0:18:96:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Emsley’s argument is that the French reforms fundamentally changed the political status
18:570:46848:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quo in such a way as the elites who benefitted from these institutions could sustain the.  The
18:571:46942:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence of a new elite created by the reforms and determined to hang onto them is also central
18:572:47037:18:31:79:373:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the argument of Simms (2004, p.  39) who sums this up as:
18:573:47097:31:18:106:498:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“In  western  and  southern  Germany  there  was  no  going  back  to  the  feudal  sta-
18:574:47185:18:19:106:498:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tus  quo  ante.   The  Prussian  bureaucrats  arriving  in  the  newly  acquired  Rhine
18:575:47272:19:18:106:498:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Province in 1815 found a population determined to hold onto the French law . . .  In
18:576:47356:18:18:106:498:530:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:southern Germany the old corporate representations had permanently given way
18:577:47432:18:19:106:498:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to parliaments whose lower houses were largely elected on the basis of a property
18:578:47513:19:18:106:498:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:franchise;  and  by  1820  all  southern  German  states  had  constitutions  guarantee-

18:580:47685:19:18:106:498:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:movement—freedom of movement,  the standardization of taxation,  the abolition
18:581:47763:18:30:106:342:438:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:of guilds—could not be put back in the bottle.”20
18:582:47812:30:19:96:525:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although  elsewhere,  most  notably  in  Hanover,  there  was  much  more  of  a  return  to  the
18:583:47909:19:18:79:525:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:status quo, these examples highlight a plausible mechanism via which the reforms may have
18:584:47998:18:19:79:525:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:had enduring effects, even in places where the de jure aspects of French reforms were repealed
18:585:48092:19:34:79:130:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after 1815.

18:587:48112:29:19:79:525:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we briefly describe the four types of data we use for our empirical analysis.  In
18:588:48210:19:29:79:372:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all cases, further details are contained in the Data Appendix.
18:589:48272:29:25:79:375:241:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.1    Country and Polity Level Outcome Variables
18:590:48321:25:19:79:524:216:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:We use two main data series to measure economic prosperity across countries and polities.21
18:591:48412:19:16:79:525:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our first measure of prosperity is the urbanization rate of a country or a polity, measured as
18:592:48506:16:15:87:525:181:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:20Note that the southern states mentioned here—Baden, W ̈urttemberg, and Bavaria—are not in our treatment
18:593:48611:15:11:79:525:166:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:group of invaded countries.  To the extent that defensive modernization promoted economic growth, this will
18:594:48718:11:7:79:267:155:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:bias our result downwards, as we discuss later.
18:595:48765:7:14:87:525:148:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:21Our units of observation are countries in their present-day borders where applicable,  i.e.,  where political
18:596:48876:14:11:79:525:134:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:entities  during  the  19th  century  are  roughly  corresponding  to  today’s  borders.   For  the  cases  of  Italy  and
18:597:48998:11:11:79:525:123:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Germany,  two  complicating  factors  occur:   on  the  one  hand,  different  regions  of  these  countries  experience
18:598:49118:11:11:79:525:112:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:different types of French ‘treatment.’  On the other hand, Italy and Germany are established as unitary states
18:599:49228:11:11:79:525:101:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:only towards the end of the 19th century.  Therefore, we consider 8 distinct pre-unitary polities in Germany,
18:600:49337:11:0:79:381:90:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:and 12 such polities in Italy.  For more details, refer to appendices 6 and 6.
19:601:49417:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the percent of the population living in cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants.  We compute
19:602:49509:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:urbanization rates for 41 polities (21 present-day states, 8 German and 12 Italian pre-unitary
19:603:49603:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states).  Bairoch (1988, Chapter 1) and de Vries (1984, p.  164) argue that only areas with high
19:604:49699:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:agricultural productivity and a developed transportation network could support large urban
19:605:49789:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:populations.  In addition, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2002) present evidence that both
19:606:49880:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the time-series and the cross-section there is a close association between urbanization and
19:607:49974:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:income per capita before as well as after industrialization.  We take urbanization as the best
19:608:50068:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:available proxy for GDP per capita.  Urbanization estimates from Bairoch (1988) and the city
19:609:50160:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level population data from Bairoch, Batou and Ch`evre (1988) are fairly reliable and build on
19:610:50253:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the work of many economic historians.22In addition, urbanization at this stage of European
19:611:50343:18:19:79:518:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:development is likely highly correlated with the growth of industrial activity based in cities.
19:612:50438:19:18:96:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also use estimates of GDP per capita for national polities from Maddison (2003).  The
19:613:50526:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:numbers before 1820 are in many cases educated guesses by Maddison.  Furthermore, because
19:614:50615:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these  estimates  are  constructed  for  modern  polities,  such  as  Germany  or  Italy,  they  do  not
19:615:50719:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allow us to exploit the considerable variation within Germany and Italy.  Maddison’s estimates
19:616:50813:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:start in 1500, and are available for 1600, 1700, 1820, and then more frequently.  We use the
19:617:50905:19:18:79:492:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results with the GDP per capita estimates as a check on our urbanization rate results.
19:618:50991:18:19:96:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For Germany, we also collected data from the 19th century of the extent of railway networks
19:619:51082:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and also the distribution of the population across different sectors of the economy (industry,
19:620:51176:18:29:79:499:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:commerce and agriculture).  The sources for all these variables are listed in Appendix 6.
19:621:51265:29:26:79:262:292:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.2    Coding French Treatment
19:622:51295:26:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We focus on three related measures of French treatment; these are summarized in Table 1 for all
19:623:51390:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states in our datasets. The first records for each country the years of French occupation between
19:624:51487:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the entire period 1792 and 1815.  We consider years in which the French had direct control
19:625:51577:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over  these  territories  or  installed  republics  and  principalities  directly  dependent  on  French
19:626:51681:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:directives; we exclude years and months of pure military occupation, such as for example in
19:627:51772:19:18:79:171:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the case of Prussia.
19:628:51792:18:16:96:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our  second  measure  is  binary  and  reports  as  treated  the  areas  invaded  by  the  French
19:629:51889:16:15:87:525:140:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:22The complete city level population dataset has information on all 2,200 European cities which had, at some
19:630:51997:15:11:79:525:125:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:time between 800 and 1800, 5,000 or more inhabitants.  City level populations are added up and divided by total
19:631:52108:11:11:79:525:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:population, as garnered from McEvedy and Jones (1978), Lahmeyer (n.d.)  or Maddison (2003).  The Bairoch et
19:632:52215:11:11:79:525:103:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:al.  dataset stops in 1850; therefore, we resort to official statistics of that period to estimate urbanization rates
19:633:52332:11:0:79:486:92:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:after that date.  More details on the construction of urbanization figures are provided in Appendix 6.
20:634:52436:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:revolutionary armies, thus the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, most of northern and central
20:635:52530:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Italy as well as the Rhineland.  The third measure includes countries occupied by Napoleon.
20:636:52621:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This adds Spain, Poland, most of Italy and the northwest of Germany.  The untreated countries
20:637:52714:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are all those in Europe which were not occupied and for which we have data.  This includes
20:638:52804:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Britain, Portugal, Austria, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the southern and eastern German
20:639:52896:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states Baden, W ̈urttemberg, Bavaria, Saxony, and Prussia.  To the extent that some of these
20:640:52988:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implemented modernizing reforms under pressure from France, through the implicit or explicit
20:641:53080:18:29:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:threat of invasion, this coding works against our hypothesis and biases our results downwards.
20:642:53174:29:26:79:357:513:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.3    Coding Institutional Reforms in Germany
20:643:53220:26:18:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the last part of our analysis, we also use an index of reforms in Germany, both to show the
20:644:53314:18:19:79:525:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of the French occupation on institutional reforms and as the right-hand side variable
20:645:53406:19:18:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in  our  instrumental-variables  strategy.   For  our  8  polities  in  Germany  we  were  also  able  to
20:646:53511:18:18:79:525:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:use historical sources to code the nature of some of the reforms that took place.  The reforms
20:647:53605:18:19:79:525:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we  focus  on  are  the  enactment  of  written  legal  codes  including  the  French  civil  code,  the
20:648:53709:19:18:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restructuring of agricultural relations, the abolition of guilds, and the emancipation of Jews.
20:649:53804:18:19:79:525:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  interpret  these  reforms  as  a  proxy  or  index  for  the  overall  set  of  institutional  reforms,
20:650:53911:19:18:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which  also  include  changes  in  the  nature  of  state  administration  or  tax  collection  and  the
20:651:54015:18:19:79:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:secularization of church lands.  We are not able to construct measures of these reforms that are
20:652:54111:19:18:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comparable across different areas of Germany (for example, the secularization of church lands
20:653:54204:18:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was only relevant for Catholic territories).  Table 2 shows the incidence of reforms in Germany.
20:654:54300:18:19:96:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Looking first at the top panel of Table 2, the first three columns report the treatment status
20:655:54394:19:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the 8 German polities for each of the three definitions of treatment.  Column 1, for example,
20:656:54491:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that only what was to become the Prussian Rhine Province (the Rhineland) was treated
20:657:54581:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:during the Revolutionary period.  In column 2, the Napoleonic treatment also includes Hanover
20:658:54674:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Westphalia (the latter also became part of Prussia after 1815).  In column 3 we record
20:659:54764:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the years of French control,  which ranges for 19 years for the Rhineland to just 3 years for
20:660:54857:19:18:79:121:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hanover.
20:661:54865:18:19:96:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The next four columns record the date at which the different polities introduced the various
20:662:54957:19:18:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms on which we focus.  Appendix 6 describes in detail how we coded these reform dates
20:663:55047:18:19:79:525:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the sources we used.  The first is the date at which a written legal code was introduced.
20:664:55140:19:0:79:525:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The figures in this column indicate both the presence of a written civil code, and of a system
21:665:55236:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  commercial  law,  represented  either  by  the  French  code  de  commerce,  or  by  the  Prussian
21:666:55338:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:Allgemeines Landrecht(ALR).23The Napoleonic civil code was introduced in 1805 in French-
21:667:55426:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:occupied Rhineland and in 1808 in Westphalia.  Other places such as Bavaria did not have such
21:668:55519:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a code until 1900.  Note that although Baden was never treated it introduced a version of the
21:669:55612:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French civil code in 1810.  The next column examines agrarian reform, effectively abolition of
21:670:55706:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:serfdom or alternative feudal landholding arrangements, such as theGrundherrschaft, prevalent
21:671:55799:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in south and west Germany (though in many cases peasants had to pay a compensation to
21:672:55884:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their landlords).  These reforms seem to have been relatively ineffective during the Napoleonic
21:673:55979:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:period itself even in the treated areas with the exception of the Rhineland.  Column 6 of the
21:674:56072:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:table records when guilds were abolished.  As this column reports, the abolition of guilds was
21:675:56166:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one  of  the  reforms  most  assiduously  implemented  by  the  French,  but  something  that  only
21:676:56265:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:happened elsewhere in Germany some 50 years later.  Finally, column 7 presents data on the
21:677:56355:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:emancipation  of  the  Jews.   Though  some  historians  have  argued  for  the  importance  of  this
21:678:56456:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Ferguson, 1998), the evidence does not suggest that these reforms were actually enacted very
21:679:56549:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effectively.  In most German states, full formal emancipation had to wait until the second half
21:680:56644:18:19:79:267:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the 19th century to be implemented.
21:681:56682:19:18:96:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  column  8  we  construct  a  simple  index  of  reforms  at  two  exemplary  dates,  1850  and
21:682:56780:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1900 for each polity by simply adding the number of years each particular reform had been
21:683:56869:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in place and dividing by 4.  As an example, consider Hanover, which was taken over by the
21:684:56958:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French for such a brief period that reforms were not implemented.  By 1850 there had yet to
21:685:57049:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be a written civil code; agrarian reform had been in place for 19 years; guilds had not been
21:686:57141:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:abolished; and Jews had not been emancipated.  Therefore the value of the index for Hanover
21:687:57232:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in 1850 is 19/4=4.75.  This index shows a clear distinction between parts of western Germany
21:688:57324:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that were reformed by the French, those places which defensively modernized, like Prussia or
21:689:57416:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Baden,  and  the  rest  of  Germany.   In  1850,  for  instance,  the  reform  index  was  33.5  for  the
21:690:57521:19:18:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rhineland  and  27.25  for  Westphalia.   The  fact  that  it  was  31.25  for  Prussia  and  26.25  for
21:691:57625:18:19:79:525:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Baden shows how important the IV strategy is to avoid our results being biased by defensive
21:692:57716:19:18:79:525:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:modernization.   Figure  1  plots  the  reform  index  over  time  showing  the  divergence  between
21:693:57816:18:18:79:525:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treated  areas  (Rhineland,  Westphalia),  defensive  modernization  areas  (Prussia,  Baden)  and
21:694:57914:18:19:79:177:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the rest of Germany.
21:695:57934:19:16:96:525:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  bottom  panel  of  Table  2  reports  some  of  the  data  in  an  intuitive  form.   We  show
21:696:58033:16:15:87:525:102:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:23The French implemented the civil code and the commercial code simultaneously and the ALR includes both
21:697:58137:15:0:79:453:87:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:types of codes, so we emphasized the timing of the introduction of both types of legal codes.
22:698:58232:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the average date that different reforms were implemented, by treatment status.  For instance,
22:699:58325:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:looking at the average date when guilds were abolished for polities which got the Napoleonic
22:700:58417:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment, we see from column 6 that this was 1826, compared to 1853 for the control group.
22:701:58508:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The last row of the table reports the correlation coefficient between the years of French control
22:702:58605:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the date when particular reforms were implemented.  For example, in column 4 we see that
22:703:58697:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the correlation between the date of introduction of a written civil code and years of French
22:704:58789:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence is -0.398,  so there is a sizable negative correlation—more years of French presence
22:705:58882:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is correlated with an earlier introduction of a civil code.  As will be clear from the table, the
22:706:58979:18:29:79:382:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlation with respect to the abolition of guilds is the largest.

22:708:59063:25:19:79:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also use a variety of other data as controls, in particular the proportion of the population
22:709:59158:19:18:79:525:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a polity who are Protestant, the latitude of the capital city of the polity, and initial values

22:712:59311:26:18:79:525:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 3A records some basic descriptive statistics of the complete cross-national dataset with
22:713:59405:18:19:79:525:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the standard deviations in parentheses below the means.  Panel A focuses on the urbanization
22:714:59497:19:18:79:475:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dataset, while panel B examines the countries in the dataset with GDP per-capita.
22:715:59578:18:19:96:525:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The table consists of five columns.  The first five rows describe urbanization rates in the
22:716:59669:19:18:79:525:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:five time periods considered;  this evolution is also depicted in Figures 2A and 2B. One sees
22:717:59762:18:18:79:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the urbanization rate prior to the revolutionary period was larger in polities that were
22:718:59855:18:19:79:525:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:invaded by the Revolutionary armies compared to those that were not.  The same is true with
22:719:59946:19:18:79:525:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:respect to the Napoleonic treatment.  This suggests that invaded countries were richer in 1700
22:720:60040:18:19:79:525:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and also 1800.  Nevertheless, until 1800-1850 the urbanization rates of the two groups do not
22:721:60133:19:18:79:525:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:display different evolutions (if anything, there is a slight convergence of the untreated group
22:722:60228:18:19:79:525:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:toward the treated group).  So there seems to be little evidence of differential trends before the
22:723:60326:19:18:79:525:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French Revolution.  After 1850, there is a marked take-off of the treated states relative to the
22:724:60422:18:18:79:100:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rest.
22:725:60427:18:19:96:525:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The next three rows of the table report summary statistics for the treatments status vari-
22:726:60517:19:18:79:525:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ables.  Countries not invaded by French Revolutionary Armies still have 2.03 years of French
22:727:60609:18:19:79:525:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence on average (column 3), since they were later under Napoleonic control.  The next row
22:728:60702:19:0:79:525:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows average latitude, which does not vary significantly between the treatment and control
23:729:60795:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:groups.  The final row of this panel records the averages of our ‘Protestant’ variable,  which
23:730:60889:18:19:79:427:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that untreated polities are in general more likely to be Protestant.
23:731:60963:19:18:96:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel B of Table 3A shows some similar patterns.  The sample is smaller now (since we
23:732:61048:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do not have income variations within Germany or Italy) but we see that in 1700 income per-
23:733:61138:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capita was higher in treated than in untreated areas and remained so throughout the period of
23:734:61231:18:19:79:522:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis.  The picture with respect to latitude and Protestantism is also qualitatively similar.
23:735:61327:19:18:96:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Table 3B we turn to descriptive statistics for the 8 German polities.  In contrast to the
23:736:61419:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whole sample we can see that, at least for the Napoleonic treatment,24there is little difference
23:737:61515:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between the urbanization levels of treatment and control groups prior to 1789.  This is also
23:738:61607:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shown in Figures 3A and 3B. Indeed,  in 1750 urbanization is slightly greater in the control
23:739:61699:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:group.  Subsequently, however, urbanization grows more rapidly in the treatment group so that
23:740:61792:19:34:79:454:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by 1900 it is a full 10 percentage points higher in areas occupied by Napoleon.

23:742:61909:29:19:79:525:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to investigate the cross-country

24:784:64239:26:18:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We start in Table 4 with our preferred measure of prosperity in the 19th century, urbanization

24:786:64427:18:19:79:525:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment, while the second uses invaded by the French during the Revolutionary period as the
24:787:64520:19:18:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment.  Column 3 uses invasion during the Napoleonic period as the treatment.  Finally,
24:788:64611:18:19:79:518:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:column 4 uses years of French presence but weights the polities by their population in 1700.
24:789:64703:19:18:96:526:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The setTpostincludes the treatment years 1850 and 1900,Tprecomprises 1750 and 1800,

24:791:64886:19:18:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:error of 0.154, so that by 1850 there was a negative, though relatively small and statistically
24:792:64981:18:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:insignificant effect of years of French presence on the growth of urbanization. By 1900, however,
24:793:65078:18:19:79:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a significant positive effect occurs. Indeed, ˆα1900= 0.899 (standard error=0.382).  Importantly,
24:794:65175:19:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:there is no evidence of a pre-trend favoring the treated areas.  The coefficients ˆα1750and ˆα1800
24:795:65273:18:19:79:324:248:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:are in fact negative, but statistically insignificant.27
24:796:65329:19:16:96:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The patterns in columns 2 and 3, which use dummies for control by the French Revolu-

24:798:65517:14:11:79:525:199:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:try/polity level in almost all cases.  So our use of the fully robust variance-covariance matrix is conservative
24:799:65629:11:11:79:525:188:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:except for the possibility that asymptotic approximations may not be valid because of the limited numbers of
24:800:65737:11:11:79:525:177:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:clusters.  As a remedy for this last possibility, we also discuss how using the alternative wild bootstrap procedure
24:801:65853:11:7:79:469:166:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:suggested by Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008) affects the significance levels of our estimates.
24:802:65950:7:15:87:525:159:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:27One concern, already mentioned in footnote 26, is that the number of clusters in Table 4 is relatively small
24:803:66060:15:11:79:525:144:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(41 polities).  As a potential check, we also computed the significance levels for our parameter estimates using the
24:804:66176:11:11:79:525:133:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:wild bootstrap procedure (based on the t-statistics with the null hypothesis imposed) as suggested by Cameron,
24:805:66286:11:11:79:525:122:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Gelbach and Miller (2008).  We computed the significance levels using 1000 replications.  This procedure has
24:806:66394:11:11:79:525:111:9:g_d0_f5:6:g_d0_f4:little effect on the significance levels of the results in Table 4.  For example, in column 1 the p-value for  ˆα1900
24:807:66511:11:11:79:525:100:9:g_d0_f5:6:g_d0_f4:increases slightly from 0.024 to 0.034, and the p-value of the F-test of joint significance of the coefficientsα1850
24:808:66627:11:0:79:461:89:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:andα1900changes from 0.001 to 0.008.  Similar results apply to the other estimates in Table 4.
25:809:66723:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tionary armies and by Napoleon as the measure of French treatment, and in column 4, which
25:810:66812:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:uses weighted regressions (using population in 1750 as weights), are similar to that in column
25:811:66906:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1.  We continue to find a negative and insignificant effect of being occupied by the French in
25:812:67000:18:19:79:526:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1850, and a positive and significant effect in 1900.  The estimates of the coefficientα1900are
25:813:67094:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not statistically significant in columns 2 and 4.  Nevertheless, in all cases, the F-test shows that
25:814:67194:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 1850 and 1900 interactions are jointly significant, reflecting the fact that the differences
25:815:67290:19:18:79:490:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between the 1850 and 1900 coefficients are statistically significant in all specifications.
25:816:67381:18:18:96:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, the pre-1800 coefficients are now larger, and in column 2 and 4, they are statis-
25:817:67471:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tically significant.  This raises the possibility of potential mean reversion, which may confound
25:818:67568:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our estimates.  To deal with this concern, we report results from models that explicitly allow
25:819:67662:18:19:79:279:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for mean reversion in the next subsection.
25:820:67704:19:18:96:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The quantitative effects implied by these estimates are economically large but reasonable.
25:821:67794:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For example, the estimate ofα1900in column 1 implies that by 1900 countries that experienced
25:822:67886:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:10 years of French control had urbanization rates almost 9 percentage points higher.  This is
25:823:67979:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a large effect relative to mean urbanization in 1900 which was 41.2% for the entire sample,
25:824:68070:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggesting  an  increase  of  close  to  22%  (or  half  a  standard  deviation)  in  the  urbanization
25:825:68173:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate.  The effects estimated forα1900in columns 2 and 3 using treatment dummies are also
25:826:68261:18:19:79:208:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quantitatively very similar.
25:827:68289:19:18:96:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, these results show no evidence of a negative effect of French occupation.  On the
25:828:68379:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contrary,  they  suggest  that  polities  invaded  and  reformed  by  the  French  experienced  more
25:829:68479:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rapid urbanization and economic growth after 1850.  We find it reasonable that the positive
25:830:68570:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effects of the French Revolution exhibit themselves after 1850, since, as discussed in Section 2,
25:831:68667:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the main role of the French reforms was to remove the barriers against industrialization and
25:832:68759:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industrial technology and such practices did not spread in continental Europe until the second
25:833:68853:18:29:79:194:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:half of the 19th century.

25:835:68895:26:18:79:525:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Tables 5 and 6 investigate the robustness of our initial results.  In Table 5 we re-estimate the
25:836:68991:18:19:79:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:basic model from column 1 of Table 4, focusing on years of French presence as our measure of
25:837:69083:19:18:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French treatment, and add some simple covariates.  Column 1 reproduces column 1 of Table
25:838:69171:18:19:79:525:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:4.   In  column  2  we  add,  as  covariate  vectorXjt,  latitude  interacted  with  a  full  set  of  time
25:839:69278:19:0:79:377:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dummies to allow for a time varying impact of geography (i.e.,

26:842:69371:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:column 2 shows that though the interactions between latitude and time effects are statistically
26:843:69466:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant, controlling for these interactions has no effect on the estimated effects of French

26:845:69574:18:19:96:526:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 3, we include a full set of interactions between initial urbanizationyj1750and
26:846:69662:19:0:79:236:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the full set of year dummies (i.e.,

26:850:69862:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  any  pre-existing  trends  and  mean  reversion.   The  negative  and  sometimes  statistically
26:851:69962:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant  estimates  before  1800  shown  in  Table  4  raise  the  possibility  that  there  might  be
26:852:70068:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant  mean  reversion  in  economic  growth  during  this  era,  potentially  confounding  our
26:853:70169:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimation strategy.  Nevertheless, this flexible specification has little effect on our estimates.
26:854:70268:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For example,  ˆα1900is now 0.85 (standard error= 0.396) and the interactions between initial
26:855:70360:19:18:79:412:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:urbanization and the year dummies are also statistically insignificant.
26:856:70431:18:19:96:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 4, we include a full set of interactions between year dummies and our ‘Protestant’
26:857:70523:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variable.  Several influential social scientists have argued for the importance of the Protestant
26:858:70620:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:work ethic in causing or at least facilitating industrialization (e.g., Weber, 1905, Landes, 1998).
26:859:70719:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although  there  is  some  evidence  of  differential  growth  of  Protestant  countries  (the  set  of
26:860:70822:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interactions between Protestantism and the time dummies is significant at the 5% level), the
26:861:70914:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inclusion  of  this  set  of  covariates  only  strengthens  the  differential  growth  effect  of  French
26:862:71020:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment.  Column 5 finally includes all of these interactions jointly.  Our estimates are again
26:863:71117:18:19:79:166:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:largely unaffected.
26:864:71136:19:18:96:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  Table  6  we  conduct  a  variety  of  other  robustness  checks  again  restricting  attention
26:865:71235:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to  years  of  French  presence  as  our  measure  of  French  treatment.   In  column  1  for  ease  of
26:866:71339:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comparison we again reproduce the regression from column 1 of Table 4.  In the second column
26:867:71431:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we drop the United Kingdom, since the British were the industrial leader at the time and their
26:868:71525:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industrialization trajectory may have been unaffected by the French Revolution. This again has
26:869:71619:19:18:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:little impact on our results;  ˆα1900is now estimated to be slightly larger and highly significant.
26:870:71718:18:19:79:525:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Eastern Europe,  where serfdom was more widespread,  may also be a poor control for more
26:871:71806:19:18:79:525:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:western areas.  Motivated by this reasoning, in column 3 we drop both the United Kingdom
26:872:71894:18:18:79:525:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Eastern  Europe.  The basic  pattern remains  unchanged,  though with  a slightly smaller

26:874:72083:16:15:87:525:121:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:28As with the results in Table 4, those in Tables 5 and 6 are robust to using the wild bootstrap procedure
26:875:72189:15:11:79:525:106:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:to compute p-values, and our estimates remain significant at conventional levels.  For example, using the same
26:876:72299:11:11:79:525:95:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:procedure as in footnote 27, the p-value for  ˆα1900in column 2 changes from 0.025 to 0.028, and the p-value of
26:877:72410:11:0:79:460:84:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the F-test of joint significance of the coefficientsα1850andα1900increases from 0.001 to 0.014.
27:878:72507:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using Maddison’s data, where we cannot distinguish across German and Italian sub-national
27:879:72596:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:polities.  In this case, the qualitative pattern of the results is similar, but ˆα1900is much smaller
27:880:72697:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and statistically insignificant.  This already constitutes a warning about the interpretation of
27:881:72793:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the results using Maddison’s GDP estimates, where we will lose all of the within Germany and
27:882:72885:19:18:79:150:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Italy variation.
27:883:72901:18:19:96:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The remaining columns of Table 6, allow for mean reversion using the alternative strategy
27:884:72990:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  explicitly  introducing  the  lagged  dependent  variable  on  the  right-hand  side.   To  ensure
27:885:73092:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consistency,  these models are estimated using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
27:886:73178:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991).  The results are generally similar to the OLS
27:887:73271:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates without the lagged dependent variable and the lagged dependent variable itself is
27:888:73362:18:19:79:139:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:insignificant.
27:889:73376:19:18:96:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Also noteworthy is that in all of these specifications, we do not find evidence of pre-trends
27:890:73469:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:favoring areas subsequently occupied by the French.  We find this reassuring for our overall
27:891:73561:19:29:79:167:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical strategy.

27:893:73614:25:19:79:525:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  7  reports  estimates  of  equation  (1)  using  GDP  per  capita  as  the  dependent  variable.
27:894:73717:19:18:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The baseline specification, reported in columns 1, 2, and 3, excludes Italy and Germany, since
27:895:73811:18:18:79:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these  countries  comprise  both  treated  and  untreated  sub-national  polities.   In  addition,  the
27:896:73914:18:19:79:525:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:setTpre(for the pre-trend specification tests) now includes 1700 and 1820 (even though there
27:897:74006:19:18:79:525:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may already be some effect in 1820), whileTpostincludes 1850, 1870, 1890 and 1900.  With all
27:898:74098:18:19:79:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:three measures of French treatment, there is no evidence of significant effects before 1850.  The
27:899:74195:19:18:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coefficients for 1850 and thereafter are all positive and individually statistically significant in
27:900:74294:18:19:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:columns 1 and 2.  In column 3, where we use the dummy variable for control by Napoleon, the
27:901:74385:19:18:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effects are not statistically significant.29The quantitative magnitudes of the estimates are also
27:902:74482:18:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar to the results with urbanization rates.  For example, the estimate of ˆα1900in column 2,
27:903:74578:18:19:79:525:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:0.359, implies that by 1900 countries that were occupied by the French Revolutionary armies
27:904:74669:19:18:79:508:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would have reached about 36% higher per capita income relative to unoccupied countries.
27:905:74756:18:19:96:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The remainder of Table 7 focuses on the measure of years of French presence and reports
27:906:74843:19:16:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specifications that also include Italy and Germany (column 4), excludes the United Kingdom
27:907:74933:16:15:87:525:121:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:29However, in contrast to the results in Tables 4-6, the statistical significance of the estimates in this table is
27:908:75048:15:11:79:525:106:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:not robust to using bootstrapped p-values.  Typically, the p-value of the F-statistic resulting from a test of joint
27:909:75164:11:11:79:525:95:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:significance of all post-1820 coefficients increases to approximately 0.5 and is thus highly insignificant.  This
27:910:75277:11:0:79:414:84:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:suggests that the results using GDP per capita should be interpreted with caution.
28:911:75361:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(column 5), also excludes Eastern Europe (column 6) and includes a full set of latitude, Protes-

28:913:75552:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specifications show statistically significant differential effects before 1850, and all specifications
28:914:75654:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:show positive effects after (and including) 1850.  While individual coefficients are insignificant
28:915:75752:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in many specifications, the F- tests for the joint significance of all post-1820 interactions (1850
28:916:75851:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:onwards) in all cases indicate that there is significantly faster growth in countries occupied by
28:917:75948:19:18:79:184:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the French after 1850.
28:918:75970:18:18:96:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In sum,  results using Maddison’s GDP estimates also show no evidence that the French
28:919:76055:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evolution have negative economic consequences.  In fact, the estimates show a positive effect of
28:920:76151:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the French revolution, particularly after 1850 (though this is less robust than the results with
28:921:76247:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:urbanization).  As we mentioned in the Introduction,  however,  using this GDP data entails
28:922:76338:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discarding a considerable amount of variation in treatment, which comes from the within Italy
28:923:76431:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and within Germany experiences.  This is the reason why we have emphasized the urbanization
28:924:76522:19:34:79:257:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data as our main dependent variable.
28:925:76558:34:29:79:284:397:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:5    Within-German Evidence
28:926:76585:29:19:79:525:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The results so far indicate that countries where the French Revolution imposed radical insti-
28:927:76678:19:18:79:525:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tutional reforms,  such as the abolition of feudal land relations and the power of the guilds,
28:928:76772:18:18:79:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experienced faster growth in the second half of the 19th century, particularly after the industri-
28:929:76870:18:19:79:525:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:alization process got underway in earnest in continental Europe.  We now look at the variation
28:930:76964:19:18:79:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:within  Germany,  which  is  useful  for  several  reasons.   First,  it  will  enable  us  to  focus  on  a
28:931:77072:18:19:79:525:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample of polities that were more homogeneous than the whole set of European countries at
28:932:77161:19:18:79:525:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the turn of the 19th century.  Second, the greater availability of data will allow us to pinpoint
28:933:77258:18:19:79:525:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more precisely when in the second part of the 19th century the divergence between occupied
28:934:77348:19:18:79:525:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and unoccupied areas may have started.  Finally and most importantly, we will be able to use
28:935:77440:18:18:79:525:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:detailed data on institutional reforms and other outcome variables to further investigate the
28:936:77533:18:30:79:378:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implications of the reforms imposed by the French Revolution.
28:937:77594:30:25:79:243:154:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:5.1    Reduced-Form Results
28:938:77621:25:19:79:525:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We first examine reduced-form models similar to those estimated in Tables 4-6, but for the 8
28:939:77713:19:18:79:525:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:German polities for which we have urbanization data.  Our estimating equation is identical to
28:940:77806:18:0:79:526:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1), withyjtagain corresponding to the urbanization rate, but now defined for to sub-national
29:941:77901:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:German polities.  The rest of the variables are defined similarly to those in equation (1):  the
29:942:77997:18:19:79:526:653:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:dt’s denote a full set of time effects, theδj’s denote a full set of city effects,Xjtis a vector
29:943:78093:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of other covariates,  andεjtis the error term.  The dummyIjis again the treatment status
29:944:78181:18:19:79:229:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:defined in the same three ways.
29:945:78212:19:18:96:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our baseline sample now consists of the years 1700,  1750,  1800,  1850,  1875,  1880,  1885,
29:946:78305:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1890, 1895, 1900, 1905 and 1910; we are thus able to take advantage of the richer information
29:947:78398:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we have about urbanization within Germany as compared to the rest of Europe.  We take the
29:948:78487:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:setTpostto consist of the years between 1850 and 1910, while the setTpre(for the pre-trend
29:949:78577:18:19:79:442:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specification check) consists of 1750 and 1800.  1700 is the omitted category.
29:950:78655:19:18:96:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The estimates from the baseline models are reported in Table 8.  The first column uses years
29:951:78747:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of French presence as the treatment.  There is again no evidence of differential growth before
29:952:78841:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1850:   ˆα1750and  ˆα1800are  small  and  statistically  significant.   In  contrast,  ˆα1850is  positive,
29:953:78947:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:though insignificant.  By 1875 there is a statistically significant effect of treatment with  ˆα1875
29:954:79047:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equal to 0.71 (standard error= 0.20). In addition, the differential growth continues thereafter so
29:955:79145:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that by 1910 we have  ˆα1910= 1.07 (standard error= 0.37).  This indicates that the differential
29:956:79241:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effects of French treatment start relatively early in the second part of the 19th century (certainly
29:957:79341:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:well before 1900).  Quantitative magnitudes are comparable as well, but somewhat larger than
29:958:79433:18:19:79:526:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those from the cross-country estimates.  For example, the coefficient of  ˆα1900= 0.99 indicates
29:959:79529:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  a  polity  that  experienced  10  years  of  French  control,  on  average,  achieved  about  10
29:960:79631:18:19:79:408:321:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:percentage points higher urbanization relative to unoccupied areas.30
29:961:79700:19:18:96:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 2 we use invasion of Revolutionary armies as our measure of French treatment.
29:962:79787:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Recall that in the German context, this is simply testing for differential growth of urbanization
29:963:79884:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Rhineland versus the rest of Germany.  The pattern here is similar to that in column
29:964:79975:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1, with the estimated effect becoming significant in 1875, the size of the coefficient increasing
29:965:80072:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over time and the significance level remaining high.  In column 3 we use the dummy variable
29:966:80163:19:18:79:394:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for occupation by Napoleon; the results are again broadly similar.
29:967:80229:18:19:96:525:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 4, we use the years of French control measure and exclude the part of Prussia
29:968:80316:19:18:79:525:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that was not incorporated into Napoleon’s satellite kingdom, which lies for the most part east
29:969:80410:18:18:79:525:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the Elbe.  This is a useful check since the eastern German areas with stronger feudal labor
29:970:80504:18:16:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relations may be less comparable to, and thus are worse control, for polities occupied by the
29:971:80597:16:15:87:525:121:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:30As  in  Table  7  (and  in  contrast  to  Tables  4-6),  these  results  are  not  robust  to  using  wild  bootstrapped
29:972:80719:15:11:79:525:106:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:significance  levels.   For  example,  in  column  1,  the  p-value  for  the  test  of  joint  significance  of  all  post-1800
29:973:80847:11:0:79:245:95:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:coefficients increases from 0.000 to 0.360.
30:974:80892:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French.  In the event, the results in column 4 are very similar to those in column 1 and indicate
30:975:80989:18:19:79:474:653:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:that our findings are not given by a comparison of the west and east of the Elbe.31
30:976:81072:19:18:96:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns  5-7  focus  on  the  years  of  French  control  measure  and  include  interactions  of
30:977:81169:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Protestant, latitude and initial urbanization with linear time trends, while column 8 weights
30:978:81262:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the data by population in 1700.  The results are similar to those in column 1.  Finally, column 9
30:979:81359:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reports results from a specification including a lagged dependent variable. For this specification,
30:980:81458:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we only include the years 1700, 1750, 1800, 1850, 1900, to obtain a panel dataset with evenly
30:981:81551:18:18:79:442:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:spaced time intervals.  The estimates are again similar to those in column 1.
30:982:81628:18:19:96:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, the evidence in Table 8 is consistent with that presented in the previous sections.
30:983:81720:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In fact, the effects of French treatment are somewhat more precisely estimated, and because we
30:984:81814:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have more frequent observations, we can see the effects occur as early as 1875.  We conclude, in
30:985:81910:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:line with our results from the previous section, that there is no evidence of a negative economic
30:986:82007:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of the French Revolution; on the contrary, there is considerable evidence indicating that
30:987:82103:19:29:79:523:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:areas occupied by the French grew considerably faster in the second half of the 19th century.

30:989:82243:25:18:79:525:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One  advantage  of  our  within  Germany  analysis  is  that  we  can  verify  the  impact  of  French
30:990:82345:18:19:79:525:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment on institutional reforms and then also estimate models where all of the effects of
30:991:82437:19:18:79:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French  occupation  are  assumed  to  work  through  institutions.   In  particular,  we  posit  the
30:992:82537:18:28:79:525:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:following simple relationship between our index of institutional reform and French occupation:
30:993:82631:28:28:211:525:294:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:Rjt=dt+δj+ψ·t·Tt>1800·Ij+ηjt,(2)

30:996:82849:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and as usualIjis our treatment variable, which in this section we take to be years of French
30:997:82941:19:18:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence.ηjtis a disturbance term.  The variableTt>1800is a dummy for post-1800 dates, so
30:998:83030:18:16:79:524:192:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:thatt·Tt>1800is a linear time trend that turns on after 1800 (and is equal to 0 before then).32
30:999:83125:16:15:87:525:176:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:31The results including the areas East of the Elbe are useful, on the other hand, because they provide evidence
30:1000:83236:15:11:79:525:161:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:against a related but different hypothesis that part of the effects of French occupation within Germany are partly
30:1001:83350:11:11:79:525:150:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(or largely) due to defensive modernization efforts of Prussia (itself triggered by the French Revolution).  After
30:1002:83464:11:11:79:525:139:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Prussia took over large parts of Napoleonic Western Germany including the
30:1003:83569:11:11:79:525:128:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Rhineland and Westphalia.  As noted in footnote 17, this is part of the explanation for why institutional reforms
30:1004:83682:11:11:79:525:117:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:were not reversed in Germany after Napoleon’s fall.  Nevertheless, our interpretation is that the within-Germany
30:1005:83794:11:11:79:525:106:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:results are unlikely to be due to such a Prussian effect.  First, the general pattern is similar for the whole of
30:1006:83907:11:7:79:382:95:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Europe.  Second, in Germany much of Prussia is itself in the control group.
30:1007:83982:7:0:87:381:88:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:32To simplify the interpretation of coefficients, timetis divided by 1000.
31:1008:84058:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We start with this simpler form in (2), because in the second stage we are interested in the
31:1009:84150:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:main effect of institutional reforms and thus using a full set of time interactions as instruments
31:1010:84248:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might exaggerate the strength of our first-stage relationship.  We return to a specification in
31:1011:84343:18:19:79:481:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which the full set of time interactions are used in the first stage in columns 3 and 4.
31:1012:84430:19:29:96:233:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The second-stage equation is
31:1013:84458:29:29:236:525:568:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:yjt=dt+δj+φ·Rjt+υjt,(3)

31:1015:84554:19:18:96:525:520:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 9 shows the results of estimating (3) using OLS and two-stage least squares.  Column
31:1016:84644:18:19:79:525:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1 is for the entire Germany using years of French presence as the measure of French treatment.
31:1017:84738:19:18:79:525:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel  A  shows  estimates  (3)  using  OLS  for  comparison.   The  reforms  index  has  a  positive
31:1018:84839:18:18:79:525:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and statistically significant effect on urbanization with an estimated coefficient ofˆφ= 0.368
31:1019:84933:18:19:79:187:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(standard error=0.13).
31:1020:84955:19:18:96:525:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel B depicts estimates of equation (2).  It shows a strong first stage with the coefficient
31:1021:85049:18:19:79:525:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on  the  interaction  between  the  post  dummy  and  years  of  French  presence  beingˆψ=  0.711
31:1022:85147:19:18:79:525:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(standard  error=0.25).   The  strong  first-stage  relationship  indicates  that  even  though  there
31:1023:85249:18:18:79:525:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were reforms in German areas not occupied by the French (most likely due to defensive mod-
31:1024:85339:18:19:79:525:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ernization as in Baden and in Prussia), occupation by the French was a significant determinant
31:1025:85433:19:18:79:126:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of reform.
31:1026:85443:18:19:96:525:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel C reports the second stage.  These results show that the impact of reforms on urban-
31:1027:85533:19:18:79:525:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ization is also highly significant, now with a larger coefficientˆφ= 0.658 (standard error=0.21).
31:1028:85630:18:19:79:525:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The greater magnitude of this coefficient is not surprising in view of the fact that the OLS
31:1029:85722:19:18:79:525:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coefficient is likely to be subject to considerable attenuation, both because the extent of re-
31:1030:85817:18:18:79:525:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:form is measured with error and also because, conceptually, our reforms are only proxies for a
31:1031:85911:18:19:79:525:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:broader range of institutional reforms undertaken during this era.33Column 2 repeats these
31:1032:86001:19:18:79:490:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regressions excluding the East of the Elbe and shows very similar results to column 1.
31:1033:86087:18:19:96:525:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns  3  and  4  reestimate  the  same  models  as  in  columns  1  and  2,  but  instead  of  a
31:1034:86186:19:18:79:525:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:linear interaction of time with years of French presence in the first stage, they include a full
31:1035:86282:18:19:79:525:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:set of interactions between post-1800 dummies and years of French presence (as in equation
31:1036:86372:19:18:79:525:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1)).  We do not show the corresponding first stages in Panel B to save space.  This exercise
31:1037:86465:18:16:79:525:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is  useful  for  two  reasons.   First,  the  very  similar  coefficients  in  columns  3  and  4  show  that
31:1038:86574:16:15:87:525:99:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:33The results in this table are weakened by the use of the wild bootstrap-t method, with the level of significance
31:1039:86688:15:0:79:299:84:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:forˆφtypically increasing to around or just above 10%.
32:1040:86744:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using the linear time interaction in (2) is not important for our results.  Second, because with
32:1041:86840:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this specification we have more instruments than endogenous regressors,  we can perform an
32:1042:86930:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:overidentification test of the validity of the instruments.  Economically, this amounts to testing
32:1043:87028:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether we can reject the hypothesis that all of the effects of the post-1800 time interactions
32:1044:87123:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with French occupation work through the reforms index. To perform the overidentification test,
32:1045:87217:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we use the Huber-White variance-covariance matrix without clustering, since this corresponds
32:1046:87309:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to smaller standard errors and thus stacks the cards against our hypothesis.  The results show
32:1047:87403:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the overidentification tests are very far from rejecting the above-mentioned hypothesis.
32:1048:87496:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This gives some support to our interpretation that French occupation impacted urbanization
32:1049:87586:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and economic growth in German polities in the second half of the 19th century mainly through
32:1050:87678:18:19:79:257:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the reforms that the French imposed.
32:1051:87714:19:18:96:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 5-8 include interactions between Protestant, latitude and initial organization and
32:1052:87804:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:linear time trends (these models again only include a linear interaction of time with years of
32:1053:87898:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:French presence in the first stage, as in (2)).  These controls have little effect on the results.
32:1054:87996:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally,  column  8  reports  weighted  regressions,  again  showing  a  very  similar  pattern  to  the
32:1055:88100:18:19:79:173:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results in column 1.
32:1056:88120:19:18:96:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall the results in this section are consistent with our interpretation that occupation by
32:1057:88213:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the French induced significant institutional reforms and these reforms paved the way for more
32:1058:88306:19:28:79:433:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rapid economic growth particularly in the second half of the 19th century.
32:1059:88380:28:26:79:312:311:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:5.3    Other German Outcome Variables
32:1060:88417:26:18:79:525:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our focus so far on urbanization rates and GDP per-capita was driven by our desire to check
32:1061:88508:18:19:79:525:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for pre-trends—both of these variables allowed us to see whether there were differential changes
32:1062:88604:19:18:79:525:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before the French Revolution.  The lack of such pre-trends so far motivates us to look at other
32:1063:88699:18:19:79:525:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proxies for economic growth and industrialization in the 19th century.  More specifically, we
32:1064:88792:19:18:79:525:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:focus on the length of railway tracks in the area and the sectoral composition of employment,
32:1065:88885:18:18:79:501:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which are available for German administrative units in the 19th century, but not before.
32:1066:88973:18:19:96:525:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Given  the  absence  of  pre-French  Revolution  data,  we  adopt  a  simpler  strategy  in  this
32:1067:89070:19:27:79:422:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsection.  We report a series of cross-sectional regressions of the form:
32:1068:89145:27:26:250:525:129:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:yjt=dt+αt·Ij+εjt(4)

33:1072:89443:18:19:79:484:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes inαt’s can be interpreted as differential growth related to French treatment.
33:1073:89528:19:18:96:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Data on railways construction are available at the level of districts (Regierungsbezirke).  In
33:1074:89622:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our dataset, districts have an average size of 12,000 square km and a population of 1.15 million
33:1075:89718:19:18:79:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inhabitants.  Data until 1874 are available only for Prussia, from 1880 onwards for the entirety
33:1076:89814:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the German Empire.  There are 35 districts in Prussia, 38 in the rest of Germany.  We are
33:1077:89906:19:18:79:502:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thus able to look at railways in the years 1859, 1864, 1869, 1874, 1880, 1885, 1890, 1895.
33:1078:89996:18:18:96:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 10 shows the results of estimating equation (4) with the left-hand side variable as log
33:1079:90089:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:kilometers of railways in districtj.  The regressions for 1859, 1864, 1869, and 1874, show no
33:1080:90182:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant differences in railway tracks by years of French presence both in the entire Germany
33:1081:90278:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and in the West of the Elbe.  However, by 1880 (after the non-Prussian districts are added to
33:1082:90371:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the dataset) we find significantly more railway tracks in areas occupied by the French.  These
33:1083:90465:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:differences are confirmed in subsequent periods, particularly when attention is confined to the
33:1084:90560:19:18:79:162:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:West of the Elbe.
33:1085:90577:18:18:96:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 11 turns to the sectoral shares of employment.  Economic progress in the 19th century
33:1086:90668:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was associated with a move out of agricultural activities and into the industrial and manufac-
33:1087:90762:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:turing sectors.  We exploit variation across districts in sectoral shares of employment, based on
33:1088:90859:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data assembled by Frank (1994) for four points in time:  1849, 1882, 1895, and 1907.  The re-
33:1089:90952:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sults in Table 11 show that by 1849 there was already less agriculture and greater industry and
33:1090:91047:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:manufacturing employment in areas occupied by the French, though these differences are not
33:1091:91137:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistically significant.  They become larger and statistically significant by 1882 and remain so
33:1092:91235:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:until 1908.  This evidence therefore also suggests that there was more rapid industrialization
33:1093:91329:18:35:79:521:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in areas that underwent more significant reforms because of French occupation and invasion.
33:1094:91420:35:29:79:180:231:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:6    Conclusion
33:1095:91435:29:18:79:525:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The French Revolution of 1789 had a momentous impact on France and its neighboring coun-
33:1096:91523:18:19:79:525:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tries.  The Revolution violently toppled the established regime and started a complex process,
33:1097:91617:19:18:79:525:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:involving both the infamous FrenchTerrorand also radical institutional changes, including the
33:1098:91710:18:19:79:525:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:abolition of the remnants of feudalism in agriculture, the reduction of the power of the nobility
33:1099:91807:19:18:79:525:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the clergy, the abolition of guilds and internal tariffs, and the declaration of equality before
33:1100:91907:18:19:79:188:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the law for all citizens.
33:1101:91932:19:0:96:525:91:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:More importantly for the focus of this paper, the French Revolutionary armies, and later
34:1102:92022:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon, invaded and controlled Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, parts of Ger-
34:1103:92114:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many.  In all of these places, the Revolution undertook essentially the same radical political,
34:1104:92209:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:legal,  and  economic  reforms  as  in  France.   However,  invasion  by  the  French  Revolutionary
34:1105:92309:18:19:79:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:armies  (and  later  by  Napoleon)  also  came  with  chaos  and  the  exploitation  of  the  occupied
34:1106:92411:19:18:79:129:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:territories.
34:1107:92423:18:19:96:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Despite the very large literature on the causes and consequences of the French Revolution,
34:1108:92513:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there has been little investigation into the long-run implications of the institutional changes
34:1109:92608:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:brought about by the French Revolution.  This paper is an attempt in this direction and it
34:1110:92698:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigates the implications of the radical institutional reforms imposed by the French armies
34:1111:92793:19:18:79:345:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on neighboring countries as a quasi-natural experiment.
34:1112:92848:18:19:96:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The evidence suggests that areas that underwent the institutional reforms of the French
34:1113:92935:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Revolution experienced more rapid urbanization, especially after 1850.  This pattern is fairly
34:1114:93029:18:19:79:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:robust when we look at cross-country data on urbanization and if anything stronger when we
34:1115:93119:19:18:79:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:focus on within-Germany  variation.  Even though it is  much less  satisfactory for examining
34:1116:93212:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these issues, when we use Maddison’s data on GDP the overall pattern is similar, though the
34:1117:93303:18:19:79:218:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results are somewhat weaker.
34:1118:93331:19:18:96:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These findings are interesting not only as a historical appraisal of the economic impacts of
34:1119:93423:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Revolution but more importantly because of their implications for the role of institutions
34:1120:93517:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in economic development and for the debate about sources of institutional change.  The his-
34:1121:93608:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:torical experience we have studied is a clear example of a large-scale and radical institutional
34:1122:93704:19:18:79:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change.  In this light, our findings support recent empirical work emphasizing the centrality of
34:1123:93800:18:18:79:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:institutional differences for comparative economic development.  More importantly, the results
34:1124:93894:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are  inconsistent  with  influential  theses  in  social  sciences  emphasizing  the  potential  negative
34:1125:93999:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effects of the French Revolution because it imposed potentially ‘inappropriate,’ ‘designed’ and
34:1126:94094:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:‘French’ institutions in a ‘Big Bang’ style—all of these often argued to be inimical to economic
34:1127:94190:19:18:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:progress.  On the contrary, the evidence supports our hypothesis that the institutions of the
34:1128:94283:18:19:79:525:192:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:ancien  r ́egimeimpeded prosperity,  and that the radical institutional reforms removed these
34:1129:94376:19:18:79:525:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:barriers and paved the way for industrialization and economic growth.  Naturally, all of these
34:1130:94470:18:18:79:525:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:findings have to be interpreted with caution, both because our analysis was limited to the avail-
34:1131:94567:18:19:79:525:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:able historical data and results from one historical episode cannot always be extrapolated to
34:1132:94660:19:18:79:525:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other eras.  Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that our findings do suggest that radical institutional
34:1133:94759:18:0:79:502:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms can have long-run beneficial consequences, at least in certain historical contexts.

41:1328:106996:18:19:96:525:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The definition of these regions follows post-1815 borders. So, for example, Saxony comprises

41:1330:107196:18:19:79:525:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comprises East Frisia, Hildesheim, etc., and Bavaria comprises Franconia (but not the Bavarian

45:1444:115331:29:19:79:525:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this appendix, we describe in more detail the introduction of reforms in 19th century Ger-
45:1445:115424:19:18:79:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many; a list of sources is given below.  A more detailed description of this process in all German
45:1446:115522:18:19:79:360:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pre-unitary states can be found in Acemoglu et. al. (2009).
45:1447:115581:19:18:96:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The introduction of the French civil and commercial codes was one of the reforms most
45:1448:115666:18:18:79:525:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:systematically pursued in the occupied territories of Germany and the civil code, introduced by
45:1449:115761:18:19:79:525:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Napoleon, was in force until 1900 in the territories left of the Rhine.  The codes were enacted
45:1450:115856:19:18:79:525:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Rhineland starting in 1805, in Westphalia starting in 1808, in the Grand Duchy of Berg
45:1451:115949:18:19:79:525:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:starting in 1810, and starting in 1809/1810 for the territories of northern Germany correspond-
45:1452:116044:19:18:79:525:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing to present-day Lower Saxony, as well as in the Hanseatic Cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and
45:1453:116135:18:19:79:525:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:L ̈ubeck.  At the same time, Baden, under the leadership of its liberal prime minister Johann
45:1454:116228:19:18:79:525:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:Niklas Friedrich Brauer,  introduced theBadisches  Landrecht,  essentially theCode  Napol ́eon
45:1455:116322:18:18:79:525:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with some minor additions; Bavaria, on the other hand, merely revised some parts of its Codex
45:1456:116415:18:19:79:525:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Maximilianeus Bavaricus Civilis of 1756,  which however remained a subsidiary legal source,
45:1457:116506:19:18:79:200:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second to customary law.
45:1458:116530:18:19:96:525:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:After the demise of Napoleonic rule in Germany, the territories east of the Rhine were quick
45:1459:116622:19:18:79:525:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in  reintroducing  the  previous  legal  systems  and  dismantling  all  remnants  of  the  Napoleonic
45:1460:116724:18:18:79:525:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms.  Two exceptions stand out, though.  The lands that were taken over by Prussia ob-
45:1461:116814:18:19:79:525:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tained theAllgemeines Landrecht(ALR), the ambitious Prussian civil code of 1794, a 19,000
45:1462:116903:19:18:79:525:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paragraphs-long codification of all legal matters which,  while retaining some vestiges of the
45:1463:116997:18:19:79:525:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:feudal system, was a progressive work for its times, heavily influenced by the ideals of the En-
45:1464:117093:19:18:79:525:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lightenment.  The other exception is represented by the Rhineland, where the local bourgeoisie
45:1465:117187:18:19:79:525:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:successfully defended the presence of theCode Napol ́eon, evidently favorable to their position.
45:1466:117283:19:18:96:525:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  abolition  of  guilds  is  another  reform  intimately  linked  to  the  abolition  of  the  rem-
45:1467:117385:18:18:79:525:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nants of the ancien r ́egime.  The development mirrors the case of the introduction of the civil
45:1468:117481:18:19:79:525:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:code:  guilds are first abolished in the territories on the left bank of the Rhine (1800),  then
45:1469:117577:19:18:79:525:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Napoleonic states of Westphalia (1808) and Berg (1809), finally in Northern Germany.
45:1470:117668:18:19:79:525:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Restoration of the status quo ante occurred equally quickly in the reactionary states of Han-
45:1471:117761:19:18:79:525:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nover and Hesse-Kassel between 1814 and 1816.  Even the Hanseatic cities reversed the reforms
45:1472:117854:18:19:79:212:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they had been subjected to.
45:1473:117881:19:18:96:525:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The situation in the Prussian territories was varied:  while theGewerbefreiheit(freedom of
45:1474:117971:18:0:79:525:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:commerce, including the abolition of guilds) was a pillar of the reforms of Stein and Hardenberg,
46:1475:118070:0:18:79:525:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it extended at first only to the core territories of Prussia at its minimal territorial extension
46:1476:118167:18:19:79:525:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after the Peace of Tilsit. Following the Congress of Vienna, the abolition of guilds was sustained
46:1477:118265:19:18:79:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Rhineland (both Prussian and non-Prussian) and in the former territories of Berg and
46:1478:118356:18:19:79:135:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Westphalia.
46:1479:118367:19:18:96:525:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The policies of no other German state were as consistent with freedom of commerce af-
46:1480:118452:18:19:79:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ter 1815 as were those of Prussia;  Baden retained its guild structure, whereas W ̈urttemberg
46:1481:118545:19:18:79:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reorganized its guilds in larger units,  allowing for a small degree of mobility within groups.
46:1482:118640:18:18:79:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bavaria and Saxony moved instead to a concession-based system, where a state bureaucracy
46:1483:118728:18:19:79:525:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would determine the number of people and the prerequisites to become craftsmen.  A tempo-
46:1484:118817:19:18:79:525:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rary backlash occurred during and after the 1848 revolution,  when there was pressure for a
46:1485:118908:18:19:79:525:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restoration of guild structures in many states that had so far pursued liberal policies, and full
46:1486:119005:19:18:79:525:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:liberalization all over Germany was eventually achieved with the newGewerbeordnung(law
46:1487:119091:18:19:79:303:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regulating commerce) after unification in 1871.
46:1488:119138:19:18:96:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Agrarian reforms are another dimension along which different approaches are discernible
46:1489:119225:18:18:79:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across German states, even when restricting one’s view only to the territories west of the Elbe,
46:1490:119321:18:19:79:525:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where the feudal relations were less oppressive than in the eastern territories characterized by
46:1491:119417:19:18:79:525:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:serfdom and theGutsherrschaftform of land tenure. Again, we can see that the wave of reforms
46:1492:119509:18:19:79:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was lead by the French occupiers first, and by the Prussian ‘defensive modernizers’ thereafter.
46:1493:119604:19:18:79:525:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  most  radical  attempt  to  reform  succeeded  only  west  of  the  Rhine,  where  serfdom  was
46:1494:119704:18:19:79:525:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:abolished without compensation and duties were made redeemable for 15 times their annual
46:1495:119792:19:18:79:145:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:value in 1798.
46:1496:119806:18:18:96:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Reforms followed suit in Berg (1808) and Westphalia (1809), but confusion soon arose about
46:1497:119896:18:19:79:525:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the exact terms of the redemption of feudal payments.  All reforms were ultimately blocked
46:1498:119986:19:18:79:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by decree in 1812, and resumed only in Prussian times.  In fact, at the same time Prussia was
46:1499:120079:18:19:79:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:already implementing agrarian reforms in parts of Prussia, starting with the edict of October
46:1500:120172:19:18:79:525:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:9th, 1807, which in 1821 was perfected with laws regulating the exact terms of redemption of
46:1501:120264:18:19:79:285:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:feudal duties (25 times their annual value).
46:1502:120308:19:18:96:525:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:A law describing the exact amount needed to exit the feudal relation of theGrundherrschaft
46:1503:120398:18:18:79:525:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was a crucial precondition for agrarian reforms that did not remain a dead letter.  Hence what
