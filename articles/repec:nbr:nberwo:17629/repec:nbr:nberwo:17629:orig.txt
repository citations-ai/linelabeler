2:28:1326:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We use novel data to study the decision to undergo genetic testing by individuals at risk for Huntington
2:29:1430:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:disease (HD), a hereditary neurological disorder that reduces healthy life expectancy to about age 50.
2:30:1532:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:Although genetic testing is perfectly predictive and carries little financial or time cost, less than 10
2:31:1636:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:percent of at-risk individuals are tested prior to the onset of symptoms. Testing rates are higher for
2:32:1738:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:individuals with higher ex ante risk of carrying the genetic expansion for HD. Untested individuals
2:33:1837:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:express optimistic beliefs about their probability of having HD and make fertility, savings, labor supply,
2:34:1943:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:and other decisions as if they do not have HD, even though individuals with confirmed HD behave
2:35:2038:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:quite differently. We show that these facts are qualitatively consistent with a model of optimal expectations
2:36:2147:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:(Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005) and can be reconciled quantitatively in this model with reasonable
2:37:2245:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:parameter values. This model nests the neoclassical framework and, we argue, provides strong evidence
2:38:2346:14:42:72:518:448:12:Times:12:Times:rejecting the assumptions of that framework. Finally, we briefly develop policy implications.

3:81:4155:12:45:99:354:297:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:framework.  Finally, we briefly develop policy implications.
3:82:4215:45:32:72:185:252:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:1  Introduction
3:83:4230:32:22:72:525:220:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Huntington disease (HD) is a degenerative neurological disorder with onset about age 40, a life
3:84:4325:22:22:72:550:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expectancy of around 60 and a healthy life expectancy of 10 years fewer than that.  HD is caused by
3:85:4424:22:21:72:535:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:an inherited expansion in the Huntingtin gene.  Individuals with one parent with HD have a 50%
3:86:4518:21:22:72:553:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:chance of inheriting the expanded copy of the gene and developing the disease.  Since the early 1990s
3:87:4619:22:22:72:554:133:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a genetic test has been available.  This blood DNA test can provide at-risk individuals with certainty
3:88:4721:22:16:72:553:111:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(100% or 0%) about whether they will develop HD. This test would appear to have significant value;

4:92:5071:0:21:72:521:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a variety of life choices (childbearing, marriage, retirement, education, participation in clinical
4:93:5170:21:22:72:542:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:research) are likely to be affected by HD status.  Although HD is a rare disease, genetic testing for
4:94:5271:22:22:72:512:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:other conditions is becoming increasingly common, making our conclusions potentially more
4:95:5360:22:21:72:211:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:generalizable in the long run.
4:96:5390:21:22:100:539:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this paper we explore the decision to undergo genetic testing.  Our first contribution is to
4:97:5485:22:22:72:546:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:document a number of facts about genetic risk, behavior and genetic testing using a rich dataset of
4:98:5584:22:21:72:546:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals at risk for HD. Our data covers 1001 at-risk individuals who had chosen not to undergo
4:99:5682:21:22:72:539:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:genetic testing prior to enrollment into an observational study.  Over a ten year period we observe
4:100:5781:22:22:72:508:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:subsequent decisions by some research participants to pursue genetic testing for HD, yearly
4:101:5872:22:22:72:547:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:information on subjective and investigator-measured probability of carrying the HD expansion, and
4:102:5969:22:21:72:254:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:information on a variety of life events.
4:103:6009:21:22:100:519:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We begin by documenting low rates of genetic testing in our sample:  fewer than 10% of
4:104:6095:22:22:72:528:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals pursue predictive testing during the study.  This echoes what has been seen in other
4:105:6191:22:21:72:544:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:contexts (Koszegi, 2003; Lerman et al, 1996; Thornton, 2008) and in other data on this population
4:106:6288:21:22:72:538:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(Shoulson and Young, 2011).  Also in line with other contexts, financial and time testing costs are
4:107:6387:22:22:72:449:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:relatively low, on the order of a few hundred dollars even if paid out of pocket.
4:108:6468:22:21:100:538:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Although predictive testing rates are low overall, we find that the probability of undergoing
4:109:6561:21:22:72:534:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:genetic testing is increasing withex anterisk of carrying the HD expansion.  This is true both in
4:110:6658:22:22:72:544:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:levels and in changes.  In the cross section, individuals with higher objective probabilities of having
4:111:6761:22:21:72:541:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD (by virtue of emerging signs or symptoms) are more likely to pursue testing.1Further, testing
4:112:6857:21:22:72:550:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:appears to be commonly prompted by achangein symptoms which indicates increased likelihood of
4:113:6950:22:22:71:519:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carrying the HD expansion.  Moreover, we show that testingexplicitly for confirmationin this
4:114:7042:22:21:71:530:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:context is fairly common.  Depending on the dataset, as many as half or more of individuals will
4:115:7138:21:22:71:417:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:eventually be tested to “prove” what they know already from symptoms.
4:116:7207:22:22:100:544:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We next turn to describing beliefs and behaviors among untested individuals.  First, we show
4:117:7299:22:21:71:522:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that when asked about their chance of carrying the HD expansion, untested individuals report
4:118:7391:21:22:71:534:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:perceived probabilities which are much lower than their objective probability (determined by the
4:119:7487:22:22:71:516:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:investigator based on clinical signs).  In many cases, the bias is extreme.  For example, among
4:120:7582:22:15:71:553:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:untested individuals for whom a clinical investigator observes signs which represent “Certain Signs of
4:121:7684:15:15:84:554:71:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:1This objective probability is based on investigator evaluations done as part of the study.  The results of this evaluation
4:122:7807:15:0:72:212:56:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:are not transmitted to the patient.
5:123:7843:0:21:72:528:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD (>99% confidence),” the average perceived chance of having HD is 52% and 11% percent of
5:124:7933:21:22:72:503:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals in this group report believing there isnochance they carry the HD expansion.
5:125:8021:22:22:100:547:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Second, although behaviors (e.g., marriage, fertility, retirement choices) differ significantly for
5:126:8120:22:21:71:547:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals who report certainty about either carrying or not carrying the affected gene, individuals
5:127:8221:21:22:71:526:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:who are uncertain almost always behave identically to those who are not carriers of the genetic
5:128:8316:22:22:71:513:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion, rather than displaying intermediate behavior.  For example, adjusting for age and
5:129:8408:22:21:71:541:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:gender2, retirement is more than twice as likely for individuals who report knowing they carry the
5:130:8506:21:22:71:539:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD expansion versus those who are certain they do not.  However, retirement rates for individuals
5:131:8603:22:22:71:505:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with intermediate probabilities are identical to those who are certain they do not carry the
5:132:8695:22:22:71:550:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion.  This remains true even when we focus on individuals whose symptoms indicate a 90% or
5:133:8791:22:21:71:519:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:greater chance of HD. Although our primary descriptive analysis is limited to the HD case, in
5:134:8884:21:22:71:527:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Appendix B we show suggestive evidence of similar patterns for both cancer screening and HIV
5:135:8976:22:22:71:535:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing.  This suggests that explaining the patterns we observe for HD may also be informative in
5:136:9073:22:21:71:358:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:understanding the limited medical testing in those contexts.
5:137:9133:21:22:100:554:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Other authors have noted that the combination of low testing rates with low testing costs are a
5:138:9228:22:22:71:534:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:challenge to a standard neoclassical model, and suggested this behavior might be better modeled
5:139:9323:22:21:71:550:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with a framework in which beliefs about the state impact utility directly (Koszegi, 2003; Caplin and
5:140:9423:21:22:71:529:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Leahy, 2004; Caplin and Leahy, 2001).  The facts here suggest that whatever model explains low
5:141:9517:22:22:71:554:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing rates – neoclassical or otherwise – shouldalsoaccommodate the biased perception of risk, the
5:142:9617:22:21:71:528:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:fact that uncertain individuals behave in an overly optimistic way, and the result that testing is
5:143:9715:21:22:71:155:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increasing in risk.
5:144:9734:22:22:100:524:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Section 4 we suggest that an optimal expectations model, based on Brunnermeier and
5:145:9819:22:21:71:514:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Parker (2005), provides a parsimonious way to explain the patterns in the data.3Section 4.1
5:146:9910:21:22:72:551:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:describes the setup.  There are three periods, a binary state (“sick” or “healthy”) and a binary action
5:147:10013:22:22:72:553:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choice.  Individuals are endowed with some probability that they carry the HD gene.  At time 0, they
5:148:10113:22:16:72:554:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:can choose whether to learn the true state, possibly for some real cost.  An action is chosen at time 1
5:149:10216:16:11:84:398:135:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:2We can also adjust for symptom levels, if any, with no impact on our results.
5:150:10294:11:14:84:554:124:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:3We focus on a setup in which individuals make the choice about information seeking and actions on their own.  This
5:151:10409:14:11:72:554:110:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:is related to a setting in which information can be conveyed by an agent who seeks to maximize utility of a principal
5:152:10526:11:11:72:554:99:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:(Koszegi,  2006).   A  major  difference  between  our  setup  and  the  setup  in  Koszegi  (2006)  is  that  individuals  here  get
5:153:10659:11:11:72:554:88:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:utility from not only instrumental outcomes but also from their health statusper se.In addition, there are several other
5:154:10779:11:11:72:554:77:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:models which are close in spirit to Brunnermeier and Parker (2005).  These include Yariv (2005) and Mayraz (2011).  The
5:155:10898:11:0:72:467:66:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:Benabou and Tirole (2002) model of self-confidence is also closely related, if slightly more distant.
6:156:11000:0:21:72:534:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and then the true state is revealed at time 2.  At time 1, individuals experience utility associated
6:157:11100:21:22:72:531:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with their anticipation of future consumption; at time 2, actual consumption utility is delivered.
6:158:11198:22:22:72:516:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Consumption utility is maximized when the action is correctly matched to the realized state.
6:159:11290:22:21:100:554:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The key feature of this model is that if individuals are untested they have the option to choose
6:160:11386:21:22:72:546:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their beliefs about the probability of each state, but are constrained to take actions consistent with
6:161:11488:22:22:72:542:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:those beliefs.  Choosing an overly optimistic belief increases the time 1 anticipation utility but also
6:162:11591:22:21:72:538:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increases the chance that the wrong action is chosen, with a time 2 utility cost.  Overly optimistic
6:163:11691:21:22:72:546:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:beliefs may be optimal if the increase in anticipatory utility outweighs the decrease in consumption
6:164:11791:22:22:72:545:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility.  If an individual chooses to test they cannot “unlearn” the true state, and therefore does not
6:165:11894:22:22:72:230:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have the option to choose beliefs.
6:166:11928:22:21:100:551:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Section 4.2 relates the model to the facts in Section 3.  We show that individuals in this model
6:167:12024:21:22:72:554:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:adopt overly optimistic beliefs in order to experience higher utility in the anticipation period.  Having
6:168:12129:22:22:72:549:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:adopted such overly optimistic beliefs, individuals take overly optimistic actions, in accordance with
6:169:12231:22:21:72:554:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these beliefs.  These skewed choices of behavior naturally produce the result that testing is increasing
6:170:12335:21:22:72:529:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in risk:  as the objective risk increases and people continue to behave as if they do not carry the
6:171:12434:22:22:72:544:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion, the utility loss from this behavior becomes larger and larger, increasing the incentive to
6:172:12535:22:21:72:93:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:test.
6:173:12540:21:22:100:551:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Once tested, individuals in this model can no longer manipulate their beliefs.  This means that
6:174:12635:22:22:72:554:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a significant “cost” of testing is the loss of the option to believe that you are healthy regardless of the
6:175:12742:22:21:72:554:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:true state; this cost may be so large that the value of testing is negative even ignoring any real costs.
6:176:12847:21:22:72:533:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Even for those with a positive testing value, a very small real cost of testing may be sufficient to
6:177:12947:22:22:72:551:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:discourage testing.  In an extension we show that it is possible to accommodate confirmatory testing
6:178:13047:22:21:72:552:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in this model.  That is, it is possible that individuals will not choose to test while uncertain but may
6:179:13151:21:22:72:421:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choose to get a test to confirm status with some small benefit to “proof.”
6:180:13225:22:22:100:554:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Section 4.3 we estimate the model with heterogeneous agents and show that with reasonable
6:181:13317:22:21:72:550:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:parameter values we can match both the skewed action choices and the low testing rates we observe
6:182:13414:21:22:72:521:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the data.  The estimation demonstrates that the low testing rates we see in the data can be
6:183:13508:22:22:72:545:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:generated with a testing cost that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the utility cost of
6:184:13608:22:21:72:189:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:taking the wrong action.
6:185:13632:21:0:100:554:65:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Section 5 we return to evaluating the standard, information-seeking, neoclassical framework.
7:186:13728:0:21:72:543:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As we note above, the combination of low testing rates with low testing costs seem like a threat to
7:187:13827:21:22:72:550:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the standard model.  However, in practice we observe many settings in which individuals are slow to
7:188:13926:22:22:72:532:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:take actions which benefit them (for example, poorly optimized retirement savings in Choi et al,
7:189:14022:22:21:72:540:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2011).  We have only our estimate of the financial and time costs of testing, we do not observe the
7:190:14121:21:22:72:553:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:actual costs people experience.  Given this, it seems hasty to reject this framework if theonlyissue is
7:191:14224:22:22:72:240:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the need for high real testing costs.
7:192:14261:22:21:100:526:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:If we assume individuals place no weight on anticipation, the optimal expectations model
7:193:14349:21:22:72:546:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:collapses to the neoclassical framework.  We derive the predictions of the model in the case without
7:194:14449:22:22:72:507:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:anticipatory utility and evaluate the fit in light of the new facts in Section 3.  We argue the
7:195:14544:22:22:72:551:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:neoclassical model fails qualitatively in two concrete ways:  it cannot accommodate skewed beliefs or
7:196:14645:22:21:72:534:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmatory testing.  In addition, generating skewed action choices and testing increasing in risk
7:197:14744:21:22:72:537:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:require assumptions on the parameters which, although plausible, do not accord with intuition or
7:198:14840:22:22:72:530:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:other survey data.  We also estimate the model and show that the fit of the model is worse than
7:199:14935:22:21:72:528:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:optimal expectations4and the parameter values which constitute the best fit seem problematic.
7:200:15028:21:22:100:535:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Overall, we argue the addition of these new facts more concretely rules out the neoclassical
7:201:15120:22:22:72:544:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:framework.  In Appendix C we describe two other non-neoclassical models with anticipatory utility
7:202:15217:22:21:72:554:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and relate them to our data.  The first is an explicit model of wishful thinking (Mayraz, 2011), which
7:203:15319:21:22:72:545:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is very similar in many ways to the optimal expectations framework and makes similar predictions.
7:204:15416:22:22:72:545:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The second is a model with information-averse preferences (Koszegi, 2003), which we argue fits the
7:205:15514:22:21:72:138:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:data less well.
7:206:15529:21:22:100:543:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In the conclusion section, we briefly discuss welfare and policy.  The patterns in the HD data
7:207:15623:22:22:72:543:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:also appear, at least suggestively, in data on HIV and cancer screening, suggesting this model may
7:208:15721:22:21:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:help explain resistance to testing in those more policy-relevant settings.  To begin, we note that in
7:209:15822:21:22:72:554:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this model individuals are not making mistakes.  Their biased beliefs are optimal and a social planner
7:210:15924:22:22:72:543:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:would make them worse off by forcing them to test.  However, when we consider a case like HIV in
7:211:16020:22:21:72:505:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which testing may be socially valuable, it may be optimal to encourage individuals to test.
7:212:16111:21:22:100:552:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We use the estimated model in Section 4.3 to evaluate what policy levers might change testing
7:213:16204:22:22:72:536:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rates.  We find that lowering real testing costs would have limited impact on testing, increasing it
7:214:16304:22:15:72:543:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:only from 5% to 10% even at a cost of zero.  This is due to the fact that, for many individuals, the
7:215:16404:15:15:84:554:71:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:4We free up another parameter which we restricted in the optimal expectations estimation, in order for the models
7:216:16517:15:0:72:212:56:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:to have similar degrees of freedom.
8:217:16553:0:21:72:531:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:anticipation value is so important that it swamps the impact of testing.  In contrast, making the
8:218:16650:21:22:72:550:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value of of correct actions more salient would have a larger impact.  In some cases (e.g., HIV, cancer
8:219:16752:22:22:72:539:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:screening) this could include emphasizing actions individuals could take to improve their health if
8:220:16851:22:45:72:153:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:they were tested.
8:221:16868:45:33:72:418:583:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:2  Background and Data on Huntington Disease
8:222:16912:33:29:72:296:550:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f10:2.1  Huntington Disease Background5
8:223:16947:29:21:72:545:521:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Huntington disease (HD) is a degenerative neurological disorder that clinically affects an estimated
8:224:17047:21:22:72:530:500:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:30,000 individuals in the United States.  Individuals with the disease typically begin to manifest
8:225:17145:22:22:72:554:478:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:symptoms in early middle age (30-50).  Symptoms include involuntary movement, impaired cognition
8:226:17241:22:21:72:544:456:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and psychiatric disturbances.  Individuals will need increasing levels of supportive and institutional
8:227:17343:21:22:72:537:435:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:care for many years.  Death follows approximately 20 years after onset.  A test for the HD genetic
8:228:17441:22:22:72:554:413:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion was developed in 1993.  Since everyone with the expansion will eventually develop HD, this
8:229:17541:22:21:72:199:391:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:test is perfectly predictive.
8:230:17570:21:22:100:550:370:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD is a genetic disorder due to an excessive expansion in the Huntingtin gene on chromosome
8:231:17661:22:22:72:541:348:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:4; individuals with more than 40 repeats of a “C-A-G” (cytosine-adenine-guanine) sequence in this
8:232:17758:22:21:72:550:326:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:gene will inevitably develop HD unless they die from an unrelated cause prior to the expected onset
8:233:17857:21:22:72:552:305:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of illness.  The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner:  individuals who have a parent
8:234:17958:22:22:72:546:283:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with HD have a 50% chance of having inherited the genetic expansion and subsequently developing
8:235:18053:22:22:72:527:261:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the disease.  There is no cure for HD or treatment that slows the progression, and symptomatic
8:236:18147:22:21:72:535:239:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:treatments are limited.  The fact that HD has such clear and strong genetic predisposition means
8:237:18243:21:22:72:418:218:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f10:individuals are frequently aware of their family history and genetic risk.6
8:238:18318:22:22:100:527:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:At birth, any individual with one parent with HD has a 50% chance of inheriting the HD
8:239:18404:22:21:72:536:174:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion and eventually developing the disease.  However, as they age individuals should update
8:240:18500:21:22:72:552:153:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their probability (either up or down).  The progression of HD is slow but steady, and timing of onset
8:241:18601:22:16:72:554:131:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:varies.7Early signs or features of HD may not be noticed by at-risk individuals, and early symptoms
8:242:18700:16:15:84:554:115:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:5In  this  section  we  provide  only  a  brief  overview  of  Huntington  disease;  for  a  fuller  clinical  discussion,  please  see

8:244:18861:7:15:84:554:93:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:6It is, of course, possible that people may not know of their risk until they are older, since parents’ age of onset may
8:245:18981:15:10:72:554:78:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:be late or their parents may die of something other than HD before onset.  In our sample, everyone enrolled knows of
8:246:19097:10:8:72:269:68:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:their risk since this is a condition for enrollment.
8:247:19149:8:0:84:554:60:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:7Timing of onset has an inverse relationship with the extent of the CAG expansion.  The greater the expansion, the
9:248:19264:0:21:72:549:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are not a perfect signal of HD. As symptoms develop, individuals should update their probability of
9:249:19363:21:22:72:525:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carrying the gene slowly, generating variation in probability above 50%.  On the other hand, as
9:250:19458:22:22:72:544:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals age without symptoms, especially moving through middle age, it becomes progressively
9:251:19554:22:37:72:504:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:less likely that they carry the expansion.  This generates variation in the range below 50%.
9:252:19646:37:29:72:203:591:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2.2  Data Description
9:253:19667:29:22:72:528:562:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The PHAROS (Prospective Huntington At Risk Observational Study) study was a prospective,
9:254:19755:22:21:72:514:540:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:observational study of individuals at risk for HD conducted by the Huntington Study Group
9:255:19844:21:22:72:535:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(Huntington Study Group PHAROS Investigators, 2006).  The study began in 1999 and included
9:256:19934:22:22:72:525:497:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:1001 individuals at roughly 40 study sites in the United States and Canada.  Individuals in the
9:257:20029:22:21:72:512:475:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:PHAROS study were interviewed at recruitment and then approximately every nine months
9:258:20114:21:22:72:546:454:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:afterward.  Prospective clinical evaluation in the PHAROS study concluded in 2010.  The PHAROS
9:259:20208:22:22:72:553:432:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:study enrolled individuals who were (at the time of enrollment) at risk for HD: that is, they had one
9:260:20309:22:21:72:520:410:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:parent (or first-degree relative) with HD, but had not pursued genetic testing.  Participants in
9:261:20405:21:22:72:550:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:PHAROS are not a random sample of individuals at risk for HD. First, they needed to be willing to
9:262:20502:22:22:72:550:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:participate in the study, which may imply other differences.  There is little we can do to address this.
9:263:20606:22:21:100:506:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In addition, participants had to be untested and not show signs of HD at the time of
9:264:20690:21:22:72:553:324:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:enrollment.  This introduces two concerns.  First, this sample may understate the general demand for
9:265:20790:22:22:72:550:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing, since individuals are selected based on not having tested up to enrollment.  Empirically, this
9:266:20893:22:22:72:517:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:doesn’t seem to be the case:  testing rates in our sample are around 5%, similar to other data
9:267:20987:22:21:72:554:258:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(Shoulson and Young, 2011).  Second, if the type of individuals who test early are different from those
9:268:21090:21:22:72:544:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:who wait or do not test at all, we may draw conclusions which are not representative of the overall
9:269:21189:22:22:72:531:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD population.  The low testing rates help us here:  since only a small share of people test when
9:270:21286:22:21:72:545:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:young, our sample should be representative of most of the population (on this dimension, at least).
9:271:21385:21:22:100:544:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Participant visits during PHAROS contained two parts.  First, individuals responded to a set
9:272:21477:22:22:72:554:150:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of questionnaires, which collected information on demographics, life events and HD-specific behaviors
9:273:21578:22:21:72:539:128:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and beliefs (e.g., genetic testing, perception of disease risk).  Second, visits included a neurological
9:274:21682:21:20:72:549:107:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:exam with a series of motor, cognitive, behavioral and functional tests that looked at the individual
9:275:21783:20:11:72:554:87:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:earlier the onset.  Tested individuals would learn their CAG expansion count, which provides information on expected
9:276:21899:11:0:72:122:76:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:age of onset.
10:277:21913:0:21:72:504:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for signs of HD. Our analysis uses four elements of the data:  investigator evaluation of the
10:278:22006:21:22:72:524:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:probability of carrying the HD expansion, individual subjective probability of carrying the HD
10:279:22100:22:22:72:417:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion, information about HD testing and information on life events.
10:280:22171:22:21:100:538:628:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Investigator Evaluation of HD StatusIndividuals in PHAROS were given a series of clinical
10:281:22260:21:22:72:552:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tests at each visit.  These tests were designed to evaluate whether the individual was developing HD,
10:282:22361:22:22:72:537:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and they include tests of motor and ocular performance, gait and involuntary movements such as
10:283:22455:22:21:72:543:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:chorea.  Based on this test, individuals were given a motor score which could range from 0 through
10:284:22553:21:22:72:535:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:154.  In addition, at the end of the exam the investigators, who remained unaware of gene carrier
10:285:22650:22:22:72:545:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:status, make a composite judgment of confidence on a scale from 0 to 4.  A 0 indicates “normal (no
10:286:22748:22:22:72:548:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:abnormalities),” a 1 indicates “non-specific motor abnormalities (less than 50% confidence of having
10:287:22848:22:21:72:534:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD),” a 2 indicates “motor abnormalities which may be a symptom of HD (50-89% confidence of
10:288:22939:21:22:72:554:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:having HD),” a 3 indicates “motor abnormalities that are likely signs of HD (90-98% confidence)” and
10:289:23039:22:22:72:537:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a 4 indicates “motor abnormalities that are unequivocal signs of HD (≥99% confidence of having
10:290:23133:22:21:72:542:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD).” We should note that given the construction of this sample, individuals who have no signs of
10:291:23230:21:22:72:546:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD at all (and are sufficiently young) are still at about 50% risk, since they have a parent with the
10:292:23331:22:22:72:537:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD expansion and could have inherited the expansion.  Any clinical confidence score greater than
10:293:23427:22:21:72:362:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:zero indicates a higher likelihood than the nominal 50% risk.
10:294:23488:21:22:100:526:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The other source of objective variation in probability comes from age.  As individuals age
10:295:23578:22:22:72:524:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:without signs or symptoms, they become less likely to carry the HD expansion.  This generates
10:296:23671:22:21:72:541:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:variation in the probability below 50%:  at birth, the probability is 50% and as people age without
10:297:23770:21:22:72:535:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:signs or symptoms, the probability drops.  At-risk individuals who do not develop signs of HD by
10:298:23866:22:22:72:426:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their late 60s and beyond are increasingly unlikely to carry the expansion.
10:299:23941:22:21:100:547:216:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Perceived Probability of HDIndividual subjective probability of carrying the HD expansion is
10:300:24033:21:22:72:554:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:based on the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 100, today, how likely do you think it is that you
10:301:24136:22:22:72:538:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carry the genetic mutation that causes HD? 0 = absolutely certain that you do not have the gene
10:302:24231:22:21:72:533:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mutation that causes HD and 100 = absolutely certain that you do have the gene mutation that
10:303:24323:21:22:72:547:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:causes HD.” Summary statistics for the motor score and perceived probability appear in Panel A of
10:304:24420:22:22:72:110:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Table 1.
10:305:24428:22:21:100:542:86:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:HD Testing and Gene StatusInformation on testing is drawn from a question, asked at each
10:306:24516:21:0:72:524:65:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:visit, about whether the individual has undergone HD testing since their last visit (everyone is
11:307:24613:0:21:72:549:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:untested at enrollment into PHAROS, and roughly 10% chose to undergo testing during the sample
11:308:24707:21:22:72:554:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:period).  Our primary use of the testing data is as an outcome; the share of individuals who choose to
11:309:24809:22:22:72:546:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be tested is summarized in Panel A of Table 1.  In addition, we use the behavior of individuals who
11:310:24908:22:21:72:539:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:report certainty about their status (either due to testing or early symptoms) to pin down optimal
11:311:25005:21:22:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:behavior for individuals who are either certain they do carry the HD expansion or certain they do
11:312:25102:22:22:72:94:585:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f10:not.8
11:313:25107:22:21:100:542:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Using the testing data for this latter purpose requires knowing individual test results.  While
11:314:25202:21:22:72:553:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:everyone in the study consented to independent research analysis of their blood DNA sample as part
11:315:25300:22:22:72:549:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of the study, these individual identifiable research results are never made available to anyone, either
11:316:25403:22:22:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:research participants or investigators.  However, for individuals who chose to be tested outside the
11:317:25503:22:21:72:538:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:study we can infer their test result by using information from the investigator assessment or from
11:318:25601:21:22:72:548:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their subjective probabilities (after testing, a large share of people report either 0% or 100% chance
11:319:25703:22:22:72:537:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of carrying the HD expansion).  The inference procedure is described in more detail in Oster et al
11:320:25801:22:21:72:423:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2010), and allows us to infer testing status for 80% of tested individuals.
11:321:25877:21:22:100:510:390:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Life EventsInformation on life events is drawn from a questionnaire entitled the “Life
11:322:25963:22:22:72:538:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Experience Survey” which was administered (for most participants) five or six times over the 7-10
11:323:26060:22:21:72:552:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:year study.  This questionnaire listed a number of life events and asked the individual about whether
11:324:26161:21:22:72:554:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:they had experienced each event in the last year; a copy of the questionnaire is included as Appendix
11:325:26262:22:22:72:547:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A. A number of these experiences do not qualify as “choices” – death of a spouse, changing sleeping
11:326:26361:22:21:72:514:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:habits, etc.  We use data on a subset of events which do reflect choices.  These are:  marriage,
11:327:26457:21:22:72:543:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:pregnancy (either self or partner), divorce, getting a new job, reporting a major change in finances
11:328:26557:22:22:72:538:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(including reports of borrowing), change in church activities, change in recreation and retirement.
11:329:26656:22:21:100:545:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:These data do not cover all life experiences in which we might be interested.  In addition, the
11:330:26751:21:22:72:546:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:survey did not probe in more depth about exactlywhatis implied by that behavior.  In some cases,
11:331:26847:22:22:72:554:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:like “Made a Major Financial Change,” it not entirely clear what happened.  In the case of something
11:332:26947:22:21:72:528:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:like pregnancy, although the details of the experience may differ, it is clear what is meant when
11:333:27044:21:22:72:536:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:people report a “pregnancy.” Despite these drawbacks, we believe that these data are informative
11:334:27140:22:16:72:539:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:about behavior.  Summary statistics, reporting the share of individuals engaging in each behavior,
11:335:27238:16:15:84:554:92:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:8A fundamental concern here is that those individuals who are tested behave differently than those who are not.  This
11:336:27355:15:11:72:554:77:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:is worth keeping in mind, although in practice we will find the behavior among those who say they do not carry the HD
11:337:27472:11:0:72:508:66:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:expansion is very similar to those with intermediate risk suggesting, perhaps, that this is of limited concern.
12:338:27584:0:21:72:239:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are reported in Panel B of Table 1.
12:339:27619:21:22:100:554:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:DemographicsWe will also use data on basic demographics – gender, age and education.  These
12:340:27710:22:22:72:528:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are summarized in Panel C of Table 1.  The PHAROS sample is two-thirds women (this reflects
12:341:27801:22:21:72:518:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:desire to participate in the study, not anything about the gender distribution of HD, which is
12:342:27895:21:22:72:534:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:roughly equal) and fairly highly educated.  The high education, in particular, prompts caution in
12:343:27992:22:45:72:317:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:extrapolating our results to the general population.

12:345:28104:33:21:72:554:507:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this section we describe several facts from the HD data.  These will motivate the theory in Section
12:346:28206:21:37:72:80:486:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:4.
12:347:28208:37:29:72:273:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:HD Testing Rates and Testing Costs
12:348:28242:29:22:72:530:420:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We begin with the most basic fact about HD testing:  it is uncommon.  In the ten years that the
12:349:28337:22:21:72:553:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:PHAROS study has been running, about 7% of individuals with uncertain HD status have chosen to
12:350:28431:21:22:72:554:377:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:take an HD test.9Testing is even more limited, about 5%, when we focus on people who test prior to
12:351:28529:22:22:72:530:355:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:observinganysigns or symptoms of HD. We might expect testing rates in this population to be
12:352:28620:22:21:72:554:333:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:especially low, given that a requirement for enrollment is that individuals are untested.  However, the
12:353:28723:21:22:72:469:312:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:levels are very similar to what is seen in the HD population overall (Meyers, 2004).
12:354:28807:22:22:100:551:290:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Laboratory costs for an HD test are on the order of $200-$300.  The actual financial costs may
12:355:28901:22:21:72:554:268:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be higher, perhaps twice that, once you include consulting a neurologist and genetic counselor before
12:356:29002:21:22:72:550:247:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing, which most testing centers require.  This testing would be covered by insurance, although in
12:357:29103:22:22:72:554:225:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a large share of cases individuals report paying out of pocket for testing, likely to retain the option to
12:358:29209:22:37:72:306:203:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:keep their test results private (Oster et al, 2008).
12:359:29261:37:28:72:233:166:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Testing and Pre-Testing Risk
12:360:29289:28:22:72:554:138:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Although testing is low in general, testing rates appear to vary with individualex anterisk of finding
12:361:29391:22:16:72:538:116:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:they carry the HD expansion.  Figure 1 shows the probability of testing before the next PHAROS
12:362:29485:16:15:84:554:100:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:9We refer here to testing outside of the sample.  Everyone in our study is genotyped (the size of their Huntingtin gene
12:363:29604:15:11:72:554:85:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:is determined) as part of the study, but these results are never shared with the research participant of the investigator.
12:364:29726:11:0:72:441:74:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:In order to learn their HD status individuals must pursue genetic testing outside the study.
13:365:29820:0:21:72:515:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:visit graphed against investigator diagnostic confidence score at the last visit.  The pattern is
13:366:29917:21:22:72:546:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increasing, with the highest probability of testing among those with an investigator score of 4.  It is
13:367:30020:22:22:72:535:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:perhaps puzzling that people who should be nearly certain they carry the expansion nevertheless
13:368:30115:22:21:72:522:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choose to test.  However, as we will see below, in practice many of these individuals reportedly
13:369:30211:21:22:72:532:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:believe that their probability is lower, and are acting accordingly.  This means they still perceive
13:370:30311:22:22:72:272:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:there to be information for them to learn.
13:371:30353:22:21:100:553:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Figure 2 shows the same result, but with coefficients adjusted for controls (listed in the notes).
13:372:30451:21:22:72:546:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In addition to adjusting for standard demographics, the fact that we observe this investigator score
13:373:30551:22:22:72:525:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:at all visits means we can run these regressions with individual fixed effects.  In both cases, the
13:374:30650:22:22:72:546:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:highest rates of testing are among individuals where the investigator records the highest confidence
13:375:30750:22:21:72:533:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that they carry the HD expansion, and this is true with and without the individual fixed effects.
13:376:30847:21:22:72:554:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Finally, Figure 3 shows the fixed effect analysis of Figure 2 in changes, graphing the chance of testing
13:377:30951:22:22:72:533:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by the next visit against the change in investigator score between the last two visits.  Again, this
13:378:31051:22:21:72:528:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:slopes up, demonstrating that individuals tend to test when new information points towards an
13:379:31144:21:22:72:282:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increasing chance of carrying the expansion.
13:380:31188:22:22:100:548:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Finally, we explore age variation in testing.  As individuals age without developing symptoms,
13:381:31282:22:21:72:550:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their (objective) updated probability of carrying the HD expansion declines (from about 47% at age
13:382:31380:21:22:72:538:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:25 to 10% by age 55).  This allows us to look at whether testing becomes more common as people
13:383:31474:22:22:72:554:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:become more sure that theydo notcarry the expansion.  Figure 4 shows the change of testing by the
13:384:31571:22:21:72:548:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:next visit by age group.  Testing probability is not systematically varying with age.10Together with
13:385:31671:21:22:71:523:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the evidence in Figures 2 and 3, this suggests that increases in risk above 50% prompt testing,
13:386:31766:22:22:71:385:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:although reductions in risk from 50% do not have a similar effect.
13:387:31832:22:21:100:542:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Even at the highest risk levels here, testing is still relatively uncommon.  However, testing to
13:388:31928:21:22:71:505:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirm HD status once it is known is much more frequent.  Of the people in our data with
13:389:32017:22:22:71:545:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:acknowledged symptoms of HD, 30% have undergone HD testing.  And this is over only a few years
13:390:32111:22:21:71:541:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of data.  In another dataset (the COHORT study), confirmatory testing is more common.  In those
13:391:32206:21:22:71:541:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:data, among individuals who notice symptoms without having been tested, 75% of them choose to
13:392:32299:22:16:71:553:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have a confirmatory genetic test.  In other words, the test is widely used but only after disease status
13:393:32403:16:15:80:554:92:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:10One interpretation of this is that older people who are more interested in testing have been selected out of the sample
13:394:32524:15:11:71:553:77:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:(due to the requirement that individuals be untested at enrollment).  Again, due to the genearlly limited testing in this
13:395:32645:11:0:71:304:66:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:population that seems unlikely to make a large difference.
14:396:32705:0:37:72:119:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is certain.
14:397:32716:37:28:72:174:656:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Perception of Risk
14:398:32734:28:22:72:553:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We turn now to beliefs and actions among individuals who remain untested.  In our data, we observe
14:399:32832:22:22:72:504:606:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:both what individuals report to be their probability of carrying the HD expansion and the
14:400:32921:22:21:72:554:584:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:investigator evaluation of motor signs of HD. These signs are informative, but not unequivocal:  some
14:401:33022:21:22:72:554:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals without HD will show signs which could be consistent with the disease.  More signs makes
14:402:33122:22:22:72:552:541:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the diagnosis more certain.  Based on data which includes motor signs of HD and actual gene status,
14:403:33221:22:21:72:554:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we calculate the posterior probability of carrying the HD expansion by level of motor signs.  Figure 5
14:404:33323:21:22:72:535:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:shows the actual posterior chance of carrying the HD expansion (based on the informativeness of
14:405:33418:22:22:72:546:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:each level of symptoms) and individual self-perception.  In addition, we graph the share of untested
14:406:33518:22:21:72:549:454:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals at each level of motor signs who report there isnochance they carry the HD expansion.
14:407:33615:21:22:100:554:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Based on this figure, it is clear individuals are overly optimistic.  Among those with very limited
14:408:33714:22:22:72:543:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:symptoms, the average reported risk is about 40%, similar to the 50% objective risk, although still
14:409:33813:22:22:72:552:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lower.  However, individuals update only very minimally with increasing symptoms.  As the objective
14:410:33912:22:21:72:537:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:chance of carrying the HD expansion increases to 100%, the average subjective probability moves
14:411:34007:21:22:72:542:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:only from about 40% to just over 50%.  Moreover, some individuals persist in reporting there is no
14:412:34105:22:22:72:490:324:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f10:chance that they carry the HD expansion, even when they have significant symptoms.11
14:413:34189:22:21:100:530:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Another simple way to express this is to report results from a regression of self-perception
14:414:34281:21:22:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:against actual risk (with some simple demographic controls).  The coefficient is around 0.09, much
14:415:34379:22:22:72:535:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:less than the value of 1 which we would expect if self-perceptions and objective assessments were
14:416:34476:22:21:72:550:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:synchronous.  Overall, this evidence supports the view that there is significant over-optimism among
14:417:34576:21:14:72:169:216:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f10:at-risk individuals.12
14:418:34598:14:15:80:554:202:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:11One concern with this is that a large share of people are defaulting to 50%,  and if we ignored individuals with a
14:419:34714:15:11:71:553:187:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:report of 50% we would see something differnet.  This is not the case; leaving these individuals out the percieved risk in
14:420:34836:11:11:71:553:176:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:the lowest groups is around 37% and in the highest is around 52%, veyr similar to what we observe when including all
14:421:34952:11:7:71:107:165:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:the data.
14:422:34961:7:15:80:554:158:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:12HD has mental as well as physical symptoms, so one possibility is that this apparent “bias” is simply due to confusion.
14:423:35082:15:11:71:553:143:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:However, the lack of updating of risk appears even among individuals with fairly low motor scores who are unlikely to
14:424:35199:11:11:71:553:132:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:be so impaired that they are unable to process the question.  In addition, there is little reason to think this confusion
14:425:35320:11:0:71:210:121:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:would bias consistently downward.
15:426:35355:0:28:72:174:693:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Risk and Behavior
15:427:35372:28:22:72:514:665:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our second new fact concerns behaviors undertaken by individuals with varying objective or
15:428:35462:22:22:72:532:643:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:subjective probabilities of carrying the HD expansion.  To begin, Table 2 compares behaviors for
15:429:35558:22:21:72:554:621:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:those who report being certain about carrying the HD expansion and those who report being certain
15:430:35655:21:22:72:554:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:they do not carry the expansion.  Column 1 shows means, and Column 2 shows regression coefficients
15:431:35753:22:22:72:546:578:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:adjusted for age, gender and education.13These groups do not differ on every action, but there are
15:432:35851:22:22:71:542:556:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:large significant differences in behavior for 5 of the 8 items.  Unmarried individuals who know they
15:433:35951:22:21:71:535:534:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carry the HD expansion are more likely to get married.  Individuals who know they carry the HD
15:434:36045:21:22:71:545:513:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expansion are more likely to get pregnant, marginally more likely to retire and much more likely to
15:435:36144:22:22:71:531:491:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:report major financial changes and changes in recreational activities.  There are no differences in
15:436:36243:22:21:71:306:469:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:divorce, starting a new job or church attendance.
15:437:36292:21:22:100:546:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Although this is not the focus of the paper, we note that for the most part these patterns are
15:438:36386:22:22:71:522:426:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:what we would expect based on a life cycle model, especially retirement, financial changes and
15:439:36480:22:21:71:525:404:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:changes in recreation.  The direction of the differences in marriage and pregnancy are, perhaps,
15:440:36576:21:22:71:523:383:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surprising.  It may be that the knowledge of a shortened lifespan advances forward the optimal
15:441:36670:22:22:71:535:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:timing of these activities in the life cycle.  It is also worth noting that although these impacts are
15:442:36772:22:21:71:528:339:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:large and statistically significant, they are based on a small sample size and should therefore be
15:443:36870:21:22:71:164:318:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:taken with caution.
15:444:36889:22:22:100:534:296:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:If we take the behavior of these individuals who are certain about their status as reflecting
15:445:36982:22:21:71:547:274:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:full-information choices, we can then ask where the behavior of uncertain individuals lies relative to
15:446:37084:21:22:71:544:253:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these points.  Of course, it is only meaningful to ask this about the subset of actions which differ in
15:447:37187:22:22:71:550:231:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Table 2.14Graphical evidence on the behavior among uncertain individuals can be seen in Figure 6.
15:448:37284:22:21:71:518:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This figure shows coefficients, adjusted for demographic controls, measuring differences across
15:449:37379:21:22:71:531:188:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:groups.  In each case we show the coefficients for uncertain individuals and those who know they
15:450:37475:22:16:71:533:166:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carry the HD expansion relative to those who are certain they do not carry the expansion.  In all
15:451:37572:16:15:80:554:150:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:13The sample of people who are sure they do carry the HD expansion includes individuals who have been tested and
15:452:37684:15:11:71:553:135:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:know they carry the HD expansion but do not have symptoms, as well as those who are certain they have the expansion
15:453:37799:11:11:71:553:124:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:due to symptom development.  Given this, one concern is that behavior might be different since these individuals are
15:454:37915:11:11:71:553:113:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:actually sick and cannot engage in certain behaviors.  In practice, this does not seem to impact our results:  controlling
15:455:38037:11:7:71:330:102:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:for the degree of motor symptoms observed makes no difference.
15:456:38099:7:15:80:554:95:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:14Since  the  choices  are  binary,  it  is  difficult  to  understand  what “intermediate” behavior  would  be.   The  simplest
15:457:38227:15:11:71:553:80:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:way to envision this is to imagine that learning they carry the HD expansion prompts 20% of people to get pregnant.
15:458:38342:11:0:71:457:69:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:Intermediate behavior would suggest that a 50% risk would push 10% of people into pregnancy.
16:459:38436:0:21:72:544:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cases, we see evidence that behavior differs for the two extreme groups (as in Table 2) but find the
16:460:38536:21:22:72:553:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:behavior of those individuals who remain untested mimics that of those who know they do not carry
16:461:38633:22:22:72:161:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the HD expansion.
16:462:38650:22:21:100:554:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Table 3 shows further regression evidence in which untested individuals are differentiated based
16:463:38746:21:22:72:543:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on their symptom level.  This gives us some sense of whether individuals are at least more likely to
16:464:38846:22:22:72:544:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:engage in intermediate behaviors as their objective risk increases.  This table indicates that actions
16:465:38948:22:21:72:545:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:among untested individuals are strongly skewed toward the expansion-negative optimal action.  For
16:466:39045:21:22:72:552:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:marriage, retirement and financial changes there are no significant differences in behavior even up to
16:467:39147:22:22:72:516:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the highest risk group.  Individuals with motor scores above 11 have at least a 98% chance of
16:468:39240:22:22:72:548:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carrying the HD expansion (see Figure 6) and yet seem to behave no differently from those who are
16:469:39337:22:21:72:543:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:certain they do not carry the expansion.  For pregnancy and recreation there is some evidence that
16:470:39435:21:22:72:554:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the highest risk group behaves more like those who are certain they do carry the expansion, although
16:471:39535:22:22:72:529:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the behavior is consistently skewed up to the group for whom the investigator reports a 90-98%
16:472:39629:22:21:72:554:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:chance of carrying the expansion.  When we aggregate (Column 6), we find no evidence of changes in
16:473:39727:21:22:72:486:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:behavior until the group with the highest motor scores and even this is not significant.
16:474:39815:22:22:100:533:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The evidence in this section comes only from HD. However, in Appendix B we look at two
16:475:39901:22:21:72:547:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:other contexts with low rates of medical testing:  HIV testing and cancer screening.  In each case we
16:476:40002:21:22:72:543:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:look for evidence in existing literature to speak to the patterns demonstrated above.  Although our
16:477:40101:22:22:72:538:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD data is obviously richer and more complete, we find suggestive evidence of similar patterns in
16:478:40198:22:21:72:546:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:both other contexts.  This suggests that whatever theory explains the patterns in the HD data may
16:479:40295:21:45:72:497:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:also explain low rates of medical testing in other, perhaps more policy relevant, contexts.
16:480:40386:45:33:72:313:215:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:4  Theory: Optimal Expectations
16:481:40417:33:22:72:552:182:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Low medical testing rates in settings where the information seems extremely useful and the financial
16:482:40517:22:21:72:544:160:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:costs of testing are small seem to be a challenge to a standard neoclassical model of behavior (e.g.,
16:483:40618:21:22:72:550:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Koszegi, 2003; Caplin and Leahy, 2004).  This has led to the suggestion that models of this behavior
16:484:40718:22:22:72:544:117:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:should incorporate some form of anticipatory utility (Caplin and Leahy, 2001), wherein individuals
16:485:40816:22:21:72:518:95:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:care about their expectations about the future in addition to their present consumption.  The
16:486:40909:21:0:72:531:74:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:descriptive evidence in Section 3 presents several other, related, facts which such a model would
17:487:41008:0:21:72:175:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ideally accommodate.
17:488:41028:21:22:100:544:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this section we outline an optimal expectations model, based on Brunnermeier and Parker
17:489:41118:22:22:72:550:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2005), which we argue provides a parsimonious explanation for both low testing rates and the facts
17:490:41217:22:21:72:536:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:described in Section 3.  Our version of the theory hews closely to the original model, although we
17:491:41315:21:22:72:551:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:introduce the possibility of testing and learning the true state before the action is chosen.  There are
17:492:41419:22:22:72:536:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:two key underpinnings of the model.  First, individuals experience anticipatory utility.  Second, as
17:493:41519:22:21:72:549:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:long as they are uncertain about the future state, individuals can hold beliefs about the state which
17:494:41620:21:22:72:521:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:differ from the true probabilities.  Below, we describe the model and derive implications about
17:495:41715:22:22:72:397:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:beliefs, action choices and the relationship between testing and risk.
17:496:41785:22:22:100:543:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:It is perhaps important to note that although the language used in this model indicates that
17:497:41877:22:21:72:554:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals “choose” their beliefs, this need not be a description of the psychological process by which
17:498:41981:21:22:72:532:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these beliefs occur.  Individuals may “choose” beliefs, for example, by ignoring signs which would
17:499:42079:22:22:72:513:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:contradict their beliefs (as in Dawson et al, 2002).  The key assumption in this model is that
17:500:42173:22:37:72:383:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals act as if they hold beliefs which differ from the truth.
17:501:42241:37:29:72:136:374:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.1  Setup
17:502:42251:29:21:72:554:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:There is a binary states∈{0,1}wheres= 1 indicates the individual has the gene or disease (in this
17:503:42348:21:22:72:541:324:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:case, carries the HD expansion) ands= 0 indicates they do not.  We refer to these states as “sick”
17:504:42446:22:22:72:549:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and “healthy.” Individuals have some exogenously givenp=E(s).  The timing is as follows.  At time
17:505:42543:22:22:72:546:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:0, individuals choose whether or not to learn the true state through testing.  This testing has a real
17:506:42645:22:21:72:553:258:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cost, denotedC.At time 1, individuals choose a binary actiona∈{0,1}and experience (discounted)
17:507:42739:21:22:71:532:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility associated with their expectation of time 2 consumption.Ex postindividual consumption
17:508:42832:22:22:71:522:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility is maximized when action is matched to state.  At time 2, the true state is revealed and
17:509:42928:22:21:71:508:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals receive consumption utility, which is a function of the action and the true state.
17:510:43022:21:22:100:538:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The key assumption in this model is that if individuals do not learn the true state, they are
17:511:43115:22:22:71:540:150:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:able to adopt beliefs about the probability of each state at time 1.  These chosen beliefs may differ
17:512:43216:22:21:71:549:128:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from the true probabilityp.  Actions are picked at time 1 based on these chosen beliefs only.  Denote

17:514:43412:22:0:71:389:85:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:Assume anticipation utility is down-weighted by a factorδ∈[0,1].
18:515:43478:0:39:100:479:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Formally, individuals in this model choose time 1 beliefsπ∈[0,1] to maximize:
18:516:43555:39:39:223:402:654:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:U(π|p) =δE(u(ˆa,s)|π) +E(u(ˆa,s)|p)
18:517:43590:39:22:72:515:615:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:where ˆa(π) =argmaxaE[u(a,s)|π].  Because both actions and states are binary, we can write
18:518:43680:22:22:72:519:593:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expected utility at time 2 asE[u(ˆa,s)|p] =pu(ˆa,1) + (1−p)u(ˆa,0), and similarly forπin the
18:519:43772:22:21:72:166:571:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:anticipation period.
18:520:43792:21:22:100:527:550:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:If individuals know the true state, for example through testing, they are no longer free to
18:521:43883:22:22:72:530:528:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choose beliefs.  However, knowing the true state allows individuals to choose theex postoptimal
18:522:43978:22:21:72:505:506:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:action, soa=s, and two period utility is simply given by (1 +δ)[pu(1,1) + (1−p)u(0,0)].
18:523:44065:21:39:100:299:485:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We define the following parameter values.
18:524:44106:39:25:277:338:446:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:u(0,1) =−Ω
18:525:44116:25:25:277:328:421:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:u(1,1) = 0
18:526:44126:25:24:277:349:396:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:u(1,0) = 1−Φ
18:527:44138:24:40:277:328:372:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:u(0,0) = 1
18:528:44148:40:21:72:554:332:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Being healthy and taking the correct action has a value of 1; being sick and taking the state-matched
18:529:44249:21:22:72:554:311:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:action has a value of 0.  Taking the wrong action in either case leads to a loss of utility.  This loss is Φ
18:530:44357:22:22:72:553:289:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:if the state is “healthy” and Ω if the state is “sick”.  Defining separate parameter values allows for the
18:531:44463:22:21:72:524:267:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:losses to differ by state, although the simplest assumption is Ω = Φ.We assume that Φ,Ω<1,
18:532:44553:21:38:72:515:246:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:implying that people value not having HD more than they value choosing the correct action.

18:534:44677:29:21:72:536:179:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As discussed, the timing in this model is such that beliefs are chosen at time 1 and actions result

20:573:46370:0:13:72:548:693:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Proof.This follows directly from the proof of Proposition 1.  There, we showed that individuals will
20:574:46470:13:15:72:519:680:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choose beliefπ= 0 up to a value ofp∗=ΦΦ+Ω+δΦ(1+Φ)(Φ+Ω)2andπ=ΦΦ+Ωfor largerp.  The agent

20:576:46614:31:21:100:544:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Proposition 2 implies that individuals will take actiona= 0 for some values ofp > .5 as long
20:577:46706:21:22:72:553:613:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as Ω is not much larger than Φ.In the simple case where Φ = Ω we will see actionsa= 0 for at least
20:578:46804:22:22:72:544:591:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:some values ofp > .5, sincep∗=.5.If Φ>Ω,this result is reinforced.  It is only in cases where the
20:579:46901:22:21:71:553:569:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cost to taking the wrong action if the true state is sick is much larger than if the true state is healthy
20:580:47007:21:22:71:252:548:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that we might not see skewed actions.
20:581:47044:22:22:100:529:526:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Considering our base case of Φ = Ω,we have actionsa= 0 occur for values ofp > .5.The
20:582:47128:22:21:72:514:504:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:intuition behind the skewed action result is fairly straightforward.  Skewed action choices are
20:583:47223:21:22:72:546:483:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:delivered by individuals’ desire to “pretend” they do not have the disease.  When individuals choose
20:584:47323:22:22:72:534:461:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:an overly optimistic belief, they benefit from experiencing positive anticipation:  when they think
20:585:47422:22:21:72:554:439:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:about the future they experience anticipation of the ideal utility state, in which they are healthy and
20:586:47525:21:22:72:542:418:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have taken the correct action.  This overly optimistic belief has costs, however, sinceex postactors
20:587:47625:22:22:72:468:396:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:experience a loss in consumption utility from having likely taken the wrong action.
20:588:47708:22:21:100:549:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To the extent that the anticipation gain outweighs the realized loss later, it will be optimal to
20:589:47805:21:22:72:533:353:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:adopt an overly optimistic belief.  Conditional on having beliefs which lead to a given action, the
20:590:47904:22:22:72:538:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:actor will want beliefs to be as optimistic as possible.  For any value ofπ≤ΦΦ+Ω,they take action
20:591:48001:22:21:72:551:309:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:a= 0 and are paying the time 2 cost associated with the possibility of taking the wrong action.  The
20:592:48101:21:37:72:526:288:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:anticipatory utility, however, is greatest for the value ofπ= 0,so this is what they will choose.
20:593:48198:37:29:72:165:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Testing and Risk
20:594:48214:29:22:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:When evaluating the value of testing, individuals compare the utility delivered when tested to the
20:595:48312:22:21:72:549:200:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility delivered by their optimal choice while untested.  The latter is described above.  The utility if
20:596:48417:21:40:72:174:179:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tested is given below:
20:597:48439:40:39:156:469:139:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:Utest= (1 +δ)(pu(1,1) + (1−p)u(0,0))−C= (1 +δ)(1−p)−C

20:599:48594:21:22:71:375:79:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:between this testing utility and the utility delivered if untested.
20:600:48661:22:0:100:519:57:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Given the beliefs and action choices described, Proposition 3 describes testing behavior.

21:616:49486:13:14:99:538:395:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(since Ω−δ >0), meaning it is maximized atp∗.For values ofp > p∗and actiona= 1, the
21:617:49569:14:13:99:548:381:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value of testing is decreasing inp(since−(δ+ Ω)<0), meaning it is maximized at the lowest
21:618:49658:13:14:99:547:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value ofp,namelyp∗.The implications about value of testing come directly out of the testing
21:619:49749:14:22:99:548:354:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:values given above.  Note that these conditions imply that value of testing is maximized atp∗.

21:621:49920:14:14:99:552:318:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f5:−(δ+ Ω)<0.However, it is always negative:  individuals with this set of parameter values will
21:622:50013:14:13:99:554:304:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:never choose to test.  We note that atp∗the value of testing is the same in thea= 0 anda= 1
21:623:50104:13:14:99:543:291:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cases.  This is becausep∗is defined such that at that value the utility from the two actions is
21:624:50199:14:13:99:534:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the same.  The utility in the tested case is also the same, so the total value of testing is the
21:625:50295:13:14:99:538:264:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:same for actiona= 0 anda= 1 atp∗.For values ofp > p∗the value of testing is decreasing,
21:626:50382:14:56:99:341:250:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and since it is negative atp∗,it is always negative.
21:627:50434:56:22:100:544:194:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Case 2 in Proposition 3 does not generate any variation in testing behavior.  Individuals with
21:628:50528:22:21:72:533:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this set of parameter values will never test at any value ofp.Any variation in testing withpwill
21:629:50624:21:22:71:546:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:therefore be driven by individuals with parameter values given in Case 1.  These individuals may or
21:630:50723:22:22:71:554:129:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:may not choose to test.  Their value of testing will be highest atp∗,defined as in Proposition 1, but if
21:631:50827:22:21:71:499:107:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:anticipation is important, it is possible that even this maximum value may be very small.
21:632:50916:21:22:100:541:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We can illustrate this result graphically.  For simplicity, in these graphs we focus on the base
21:633:51012:22:0:71:542:64:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:case of symmetric losses:  Φ = Ω.Consider first the impact of testing on time 1 anticipatory utility
22:634:51114:0:21:72:494:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:only.  This impact is the difference between the anticipatory utilitywithtesting, which is
22:635:51204:21:22:72:544:672:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:δ[p(Φ) + (1−p)(1 + Φ)],and the anticipatory utility without testing, which isδ(1 + Φ).These two
22:636:51299:22:22:72:551:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utilities, and their difference, are graphed againstp(for benchmark values ofψandδ) in Figure 7.1.
22:637:51397:22:21:72:544:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Up top∗,utility without testing is constant (since people are just acting as if they are healthy and
22:638:51497:21:22:72:551:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:experiencing anticipation associated with that state), and utility with testing is decreasing inp.The
22:639:51598:22:22:71:305:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:difference (−δp) is therefore also decreasing inp.
22:640:51648:22:21:100:512:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The second element is the impact of testing on time 2 consumption utility.  This is the
22:641:51735:21:22:71:540:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:difference between realized utility with testing, which isp(Φ) + (1−p)(1 + Φ), and realized utility
22:642:51834:22:22:71:518:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:without testing, which is (1−p)(1 + Φ).  These utilities are graphed againstp(with the same
22:643:51925:22:22:71:554:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:parameters as in Figure 7.1) in Figure 7.2.  Both utility with and without testing are decreasing inp,
22:644:52027:22:21:71:544:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:but the utility without testing is decreasing faster.  The time 2 difference in utilities ispΦ,which is
22:645:52130:21:22:71:187:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:increasing inpup top∗.
22:646:52152:22:22:100:551:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The total value of testing (ignoring the real cost) combines these two utilities.  This is graphed
22:647:52250:22:21:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Figure 7.3, along with (for reference) the value of Φ.  Because we have assumed thatδ <Φ,the
22:648:52345:21:22:71:551:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:time 2 consumption utility dominates, and we observe that, overall, the value of testing is increasing
22:649:52447:22:22:71:544:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in risk.  However, because of the incorporation of the anticipatory utility, this testing value is much
22:650:52550:22:21:71:545:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:lower than it would be if we considered only the consumption utility as in the rational model.  Asp
22:651:52649:21:22:71:550:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increases, it becomes more and more valuable to remain untested and pretend you are healthy, since
22:652:52747:22:22:71:540:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing is increasingly likely to lead to finding out you are sick.  As Figure 7.3 illustrates, with this
22:653:52852:22:21:71:551:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:addition, even a very small real cost of testing could push people, especially those with low values of
22:654:52955:21:22:71:548:260:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:p,to not test.  Effectively, a large portion of the cost of testing is the loss of the anticipatory utility.
22:655:53063:22:22:100:541:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Putting together the two cases in Proposition 3, we observe that as long as some individuals
22:656:53155:22:21:71:554:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have values ofδ <Φ,we will have testing increasing in risk.  With a small real cost of testing, testing
22:657:53258:21:22:71:539:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:will have a negative value for some low levels ofpand a positive value elsewhere.  Any individuals
22:658:53356:22:22:71:525:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:withδ >Φ will never test and so will not matter for the gradient (although they will lower the
22:659:53450:22:37:71:168:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:overall testing rate).
22:660:53472:37:28:71:290:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:4.2.1    Extension:  Confirmatory Testing
22:661:53513:28:22:71:553:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We consider now a simple extension to the model:  adding the possibility of confirmatory testing.  We
22:662:53614:22:0:71:538:64:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:add to the setup the assumption that if the individual does turn out to have HD, there will be an
23:663:53713:0:21:72:553:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:incentive to undergo confirmatory testing, for example, to have “proof” for disability or other claims.
23:664:53816:21:22:72:522:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Assume the value to this confirmation is Ψ.A reasonable assumption would appear to be that
23:665:53906:22:22:72:550:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Ψ<Ω.That is, if you turn out to carry the HD expansion, the value to taking the correct action at
23:666:54003:22:21:72:514:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all times leading up to confirmation is higher than the value of the confirmation.  This seems
23:667:54097:21:22:72:545:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:particularly true since even many of the actions one would take only when sick (draw down of long
23:668:54194:22:22:72:535:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:term care benefits, for example) do not actually require a genetic confirmation.  The value of this
23:669:54293:22:21:72:277:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmation is therefore likely quite small.
23:670:54338:21:22:100:514:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Importantly, we are considering here an individual who has accepted (through medical
23:671:54422:22:22:72:530:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:diagnosis) thatp= 1; that is, that they are sick.  This individual has no option to choose beliefs
23:672:54520:22:22:72:554:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which differ from the truep,so that “cost” of testing is eliminated.  Propositions 1 and 2 are identical
23:673:54624:22:21:72:549:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with this modification.  The key follow-up question is under what conditions will individuals test for
23:674:54726:21:22:72:546:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmation butnotengage in predictive testing.  Are there parameter values such that people will
23:675:54824:22:22:72:551:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:avoid testing for allp <1 and yet still be willing to test once they are sure they have the gene?  The
23:676:54926:22:44:72:271:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:condition is summarized in Proposition 4.

23:679:55147:14:24:72:198:340:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:following conditions holds:
23:680:55174:24:25:183:211:316:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:δ≥Ω
23:681:55177:25:0:183:256:291:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:δ <ΩandC >
23:682:55187:0:15:260:441:299:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Φ2(Ω−δ) + (1−δ)ΦΩ2+δ2Φ(Ω−1)
23:683:55214:15:53:297:404:284:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Ω(Φ + Ω) +δΦ(Ω−1)
23:684:55231:53:14:71:554:231:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Proof.Confirmatory without predictive testing requires that individuals experience all values ofpup
23:685:55330:14:13:71:544:217:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:top= 1 without testing, but they do want to test once there is no anticipation loss.  The condition
23:686:55429:13:14:71:534:204:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for wanting to test later is simply Ψ> C.The condition for preferring confirmatory to predictive
23:687:55525:14:13:71:550:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing isC >p(Ω−δ)(1−p).  Ifδ >Ω then the right hand side is negative and any positive value ofCwill
23:688:55626:13:14:72:127:177:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:satisfy this.
23:689:55639:14:14:100:554:163:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:Ifδ <Ω we note that the value of testing is highest atp∗.If the costCexceeds the value atp∗,
23:690:55731:14:13:72:514:149:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this will hold.  Simplified, the condition for this is given above.  Note that combined with the
23:691:55827:13:31:72:503:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:condition for ever wanting to test, this implies that Ψ is also greater than that expression.
23:692:55920:31:21:100:538:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This proposition suggests there are parameter values under which individuals will engage in
23:693:56011:21:22:72:533:84:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmatory but not predictive testing.  Even though the value of confirmation is assumed to be
23:694:56107:22:0:72:492:62:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:small (Ψ<Ω), the existence ofδmeans that this condition may hold.  Put simply:  with
24:695:56193:0:21:72:545:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmatory testing the real costs are the same, and the benefits are lower.  However, when testing
24:696:56293:21:22:72:543:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for confirmation individuals do not experience the cost associated with having to face the truth.  If
24:697:56394:22:22:72:536:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this cost is important enough as a restriction on testing predictively, it may be that confirmatory
24:698:56493:22:21:72:314:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing is a good idea and predictive testing is not.
24:699:56546:21:22:100:540:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Propositions 1-4 we show that the general form of the optimal expectations model is able
24:700:56637:22:22:72:547:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:match the qualitative evidence in Section 3.  In Section 4.3 below we estimate the model, and argue
24:701:56736:22:37:72:325:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that we are able to fit the fact quantitatively as well.
24:702:56792:37:29:72:315:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.3  Estimation of Optimal Expectations
24:703:56831:29:22:72:548:497:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The intuition behind the optimal expectations model is appealing, and it is qualitatively predictive.
24:704:56932:22:21:72:549:475:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A key question, however, is whetherin practicethe low testing rates we observe can be explained in
24:705:57030:21:22:71:532:454:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this model with only a small cost of testing.  In this section we estimate the model, imposing the
24:706:57128:22:22:71:545:432:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assumption that the cost of testing is small.  We fit the behavioral moments in the data:  the action
24:707:57229:22:21:71:191:410:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choices and testing rates.
24:708:57255:21:22:100:552:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We focus on matching the average action, based on Column 6 of Table 3.  We define the action
24:709:57347:22:22:71:544:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:taken by individuals who are certain they carry the expansion as “1” and the action taken by those
24:710:57445:22:21:71:523:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:who are certain they do not carry the expansion as “0”.  For both actions and testing we define
24:711:57540:21:22:71:512:324:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:groups based individual motor score.  We match 10 moments of the data which are shown in
24:712:57628:22:22:71:261:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Columns 1 and 2 in Panel B of Table 4.
24:713:57666:22:22:100:539:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We assumeCi∼Unif[0,0.01].This puts a constraint on the real testing costs relative to the
24:714:57755:22:21:71:546:258:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:difference in maximum utility in the healthy versus sick cases (defined in Section 4.1 as equal to 1).
24:715:57857:21:22:71:532:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:What wedo notconstrain is the cost of testing relative to the lost utility from taking the wrong
24:716:57953:22:22:71:549:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:action.  That will be fit by the data.  In this sense, the data will tell us whether the cost of testing is
24:717:58060:22:21:71:541:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:small:  it will tell us the size of the costrelative tothe cost of taking the wrong action.  In terms of
24:718:58164:21:22:71:536:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimation, we could set the cost lower, which would result in a similar fit with smaller estimated
24:719:58263:22:22:71:134:150:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f15:values for Φi.
24:720:58277:22:21:100:547:128:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We assume symmetry:  Φi= Ωi.We estimate a distribution of Φi(Φi∼Unif[α,α+β]),and a
24:721:58359:21:22:71:427:107:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:single value forδ.To review, individuals will choose to take actiona= 1 if
24:722:58433:22:0:71:350:85:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2pi−1−.5δ)Φi−.5δ >0.The conditions for testing are:
25:723:58487:0:16:289:420:669:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:pi(Φi−δ)−Ci>0 ifa= 0
25:724:58507:16:15:206:250:653:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:δ(1 + Φi)
25:725:58516:15:0:225:230:638:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2
25:726:58517:0:32:254:420:645:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f5:−pi(δ+ Φi) + Φi−Ci>0 ifa= 1
25:727:58544:32:22:100:548:613:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Table 4 shows the best fit parameters and the estimated moments of the data.  The estimated
25:728:58635:22:22:72:546:591:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:moments are, again, a close fit to the actual moments in the data.  The parameter values indicate a
25:729:58734:22:22:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:compressed distribution of Φivery close in value toδ.This means that most individuals are either
25:730:58830:22:21:72:554:547:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(a) never interested in testing sinceδ >Φ or (b) close to indifferent about testing, so a small cost can
25:731:58934:21:22:72:554:526:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:push them not to test.  This is consistent with the intuition outlined in Section 4:  much of the cost of
25:732:59039:22:22:72:550:504:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing is simply that if the individual tests they may spend the next period anticipating bad health
25:733:59140:22:21:72:545:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:later.  The estimated values ofαandβsuggest that the utility loss from taking the wrong action is
25:734:59237:21:22:72:321:461:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:about 180 times higher than the real cost of testing.
25:735:59290:22:22:100:529:439:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The estimated model produces the result that beliefs are skewed.  In fact, beliefs are more
25:736:59381:22:21:72:552:417:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skewed than in the data.  As the model is set up, all individuals who take actiona= 0 should report
25:737:59480:21:22:72:534:396:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:beliefsπ= 0.In practice, we observe skewed beliefs clustered aroundπ=.4.  This is perhaps not
25:738:59573:22:22:72:554:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surprising.  People may find 50% to be a focal point, since that is their objective probability of HD at
25:739:59677:22:21:72:530:352:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:birth.  We could potentially accommodate this in the model by introducing some psychic cost of
25:740:59771:21:22:72:513:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reporting a probability which is very far from the truth, or by suggesting that reporting any
25:741:59864:22:22:72:553:309:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:probability less thanπ=.5 reflects an individual thinking they do not carry the expansion.  We note
25:742:59963:22:21:72:533:287:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that the average individual in all groups except the highest risk one reports a probabilityπ < .5,
25:743:60061:21:22:72:502:266:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:consistent with the latter interpretation and the fact that these groups take actionsa= 0.
25:744:60151:22:22:100:554:244:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As a final note, we consider the possibility of confirmatory testing with these parameter values.
25:745:60248:22:21:72:537:222:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For the majority of individuals,δ >Φ,which would imply that we could rationalize confirmatory
25:746:60341:21:22:72:531:201:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing without predictive testing for any value of Ψ> C.Even for individuals in this setting for
25:747:60438:22:22:72:551:179:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:whomδ >Φ,we would expect confirmatory testing without predictive testing as long as Ψ> .01.In
25:748:60531:22:21:72:549:157:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:other words, it is easy to explain this pattern in the data in this setting:  the value of anticipation is
25:749:60637:21:22:72:509:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sufficiently high that predictive testing is very unappealing, although once this is turned off
25:750:60732:22:0:72:455:114:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals may well want to test as long as there is some value to having proof.
26:751:60815:0:32:72:219:693:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:5  Neoclassical Case
26:752:60835:32:22:72:535:661:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The evidence above suggests that both qualitatively and quantitatively, the optimal expectations
26:753:60931:22:22:72:554:639:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:model can fit the patterns we observe in the data.  What we do not answer above is whether we could
26:754:61030:22:21:72:552:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:do as well, or almost as well, with the neoclassical, no-anticipatory-utility version of the modelifwe
26:755:61132:21:22:72:554:596:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:were willing to assume a higher cost of testing.  That is, we can ask whether the only thing ruling out
26:756:61235:22:22:72:543:574:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the neoclassical model is the need for a high cost of testing.  If that is the case, the conclusion that
26:757:61339:22:21:72:512:552:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:people want to avoid information seems hasty; perhaps our impression of the cost is skewed.
26:758:61430:21:22:100:554:531:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To begin, Proposition 5 below summarizes the results of the model under the assumption of no
26:759:61522:22:44:72:132:509:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:anticipation.
26:760:61535:44:23:72:278:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:Proposition 5.Assume thatδ= 0.  Then:
26:761:61572:23:22:84:294:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:1.  Self-reported beliefs are accurate (π=p).
26:762:61617:22:23:84:486:420:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:2.  Actiona= 0is taken as long asp < p∗wherep∗=ΦΦ+Ω.  Notep∗> .5iffΦ>Ω.
26:763:61688:23:13:84:535:397:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:3.  The value of testing is increasing inpfor values ofp < p∗and decreasing in p for values of
26:764:61782:13:23:99:487:384:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:p≥p∗.This value is positive ifp < p∗andpΩ> Cor ifp≥p∗andΦ−pΩ> C.
26:765:61846:23:53:84:473:361:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:4.  Confirmatory testing will occur without predictive testing if and only ifΨ>Φ.
26:766:61927:53:13:72:552:308:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Proof.These conditions follow directly from Propositions 1-4, with the assumption in each case that
26:767:62026:13:51:72:100:295:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:δ= 0.
26:768:62031:51:29:72:186:244:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Qualitative Evidence
26:769:62051:29:21:72:475:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We begin by evaluating the qualitative evidence for the statements in Proposition 5.
26:770:62135:21:22:72:543:194:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:BeliefsThe neoclassical case does not accommodate the overly-optimistic self-reported beliefs that
26:771:62233:22:22:72:553:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we observe in the data.  Without an anticipation period there is simply no sense in which individuals
26:772:62334:22:21:72:314:150:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:can hold beliefs which are different from the truth.
26:773:62386:21:22:72:537:129:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Confirmatory TestingWe have assumed that Ψ<Ω.That is, the value to confirmation is smaller
26:774:62476:22:22:72:545:107:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:than the value to all actions which could be taken while uncertain.  The neoclassical case allows for
26:775:62577:22:21:72:539:85:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmatory testing only if Ψ>Φ.Further, note that this model generates skewed actions only if
26:776:62672:21:0:72:504:64:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Φ>Ω,so observing confirmatory testing would require Ψ>Ω,which is in violation of the
27:777:62758:0:21:72:550:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assumption.  We should note that thiscouldoccur if we allowed for the possibility that confirmation
27:778:62857:21:22:71:468:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is more valuable than all choices up to that point, although this seems implausible.
27:779:62941:22:22:71:544:650:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Actions and TestingSkewed action choices and the claim that testing is increasing in risk are both
27:780:63039:22:21:71:554:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:delivered in the model by ap∗> .5.As stated above, this will occur only if Φ>Ω,implying that it is
27:781:63137:21:22:72:544:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:much worse to take the wrong action if the true state turns out be “healthy” than if it turns out to
27:782:63237:22:22:72:554:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be “sick.” To deliver the actual patterns in the data this asymmetry needs to be quite large:  in order
27:783:63340:22:21:72:532:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:to have skewed actions up top=.9, as we observe in the data, it must be the case that Φ≥9Ω.
27:784:63431:21:22:100:547:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We can frame the required difference in terms of timing.  For example, we observe in the data
27:785:63524:22:22:72:537:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that individuals who carry the HD expansion choose to retire earlier than those who do not.  The
27:786:63620:22:22:72:539:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:data we observe would be generated, therefore, if people felt it was much worse to retire too early
27:787:63719:22:21:72:517:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:than to retire too late.  In principle, there is nothing that rules this out.  One way to evaluate
27:788:63817:21:22:72:550:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:whether this is plausible in practice is through introspection.  In the case of retirement, perhaps this
27:789:63921:22:22:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assumption seems reasonable.  For fertility, maybe less so:  given the behavior of individuals at the
27:790:64022:22:21:72:546:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:two extremes, generating the data in this model requires that it is much worse to have children too
27:791:64121:21:22:72:548:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:early than to wait too long.  An alternative to introspection, perhaps slightly more compelling, is to
27:792:64223:22:22:72:395:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:survey individuals from the general population about these options.
27:793:64290:22:21:100:505:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We ran a simple survey through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk marketplace, asking 300
27:794:64369:21:22:72:545:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals from the general population about the timing of marriage, childbearing and retirement.
27:795:64467:22:22:72:548:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For simplicity, we looked for direction rather than intensity of preference.  Individuals were asked to
27:796:64570:22:21:72:548:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:imagine their optimal age for marriage, childbearing or retirement.  We then asked them whether, if
27:797:64669:21:22:72:539:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their optimal age was not possible, they would prefer to undertake the action too early relative to
27:798:64768:22:22:72:191:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their optimal or too late.
27:799:64794:22:21:100:518:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The data does not support the view that losses are asymmetric.  On all three outcomes,
27:800:64880:21:22:72:534:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals are fairly evenly split between preferring to undertake the action too early versus too
27:801:64979:22:22:72:530:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:late:  55% prefer too late on marriage, 57% on childbearing and 50% on retirement.  Of course it
27:802:65075:22:21:72:536:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:remains possible these preferences are different in the HD population, or the asymmetry in losses
27:803:65172:21:22:72:545:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:arises directly from being sick rather than from timing, but this certainly does not provide positive
27:804:65273:22:22:72:257:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:evidence in support of any asymmetry.
27:805:65310:22:21:72:554:86:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Impact of Testing CostsAs a final piece of qualitative evidence, we note that in the neoclassical case,
27:806:65413:21:0:72:529:65:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:avoidance of testing is driven only by cost.  If the cost of testing were zero, everyone would test.
28:807:65515:0:21:72:544:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Moreover, changes in the cost of testing should have a large impact on testing behavior.  This need
28:808:65614:21:22:72:554:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:not be true in the case with anticipation; there, our estimation suggests a large share of people avoid
28:809:65717:22:22:72:472:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing solely due to anticipation concerns and would not test even with a cost of 0.
28:810:65802:22:21:100:540:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:There are two things in the data which call into question the prediction of responsiveness to
28:811:65895:21:22:72:554:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing costs.  The first comes from the comparison between Canada and the US. Real costs of testing
28:812:65995:22:22:72:553:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Canada are likely to be lower still than those in the US; with a national health care and disability
28:813:66098:22:21:72:547:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:plan, there is no concern about loss or denial of insurance with testing.  This both removes one cost
28:814:66199:21:22:72:541:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of testingandmakes it less likely people will feel they need to pay out-of-pocket to keep their test
28:815:66299:22:22:72:525:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:results anonymous (Oster et al, 2008).  Despite this lower cost, predictive testing rates are only
28:816:66397:22:22:72:410:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:slightly higher in Canada:  in our data, about 7% versus 5% in the US.
28:817:66467:22:21:100:548:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The second piece of evidence comes from reported reasons for avoiding testing.  At enrollment
28:818:66560:21:22:72:542:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:into the PHAROS study individuals are asked why they have not undergone genetic testing.  They
28:819:66654:22:22:72:554:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are provided with a list of possible reasons and asked to indicate the importance of each reason.  One
28:820:66756:22:21:72:525:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of the reasons given is, “The financial costs of testing are too high” and another is “The testing
28:821:66854:21:22:72:547:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:process takes a long time.” Only 20% of individuals report that financial costs are a “Somewhat” or
28:822:66953:22:22:70:550:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:“Extremely” important reason to avoid testing and only 8% of individuals report that time costs are
28:823:67052:22:21:72:546:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:an important reason.  In contrast, 60% of people say that a preference for living with uncertainty is
28:824:67153:21:22:72:537:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:an important reason for not testing.  This suggests that relatively few people perceive real testing
28:825:67253:22:37:72:220:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:costs to be a barrier to testing.
28:826:67286:37:29:72:194:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Quantitative Evidence
28:827:67307:29:21:72:553:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To get a quantitative sense of the neoclassical model fit to the data, we can estimate the model from
28:828:67408:21:22:72:536:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Section 4.3 with the restriction thatδ= 0.To allow for similar degrees of freedom we fit different
28:829:67506:22:22:72:548:194:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:minimum values for Ωiand Φi(when estimating with a freeδwe constrained these to be equal).  In
28:830:67600:22:21:72:547:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:particular, we estimate Φi∼Unif[α,α+β] and Ωi∼Unif[λ,λ+β].We match the same moments as
28:831:67686:21:22:72:140:151:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Section 4.3.
28:832:67701:22:22:100:554:129:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The results (parameters and moments) are shown in Table 4.  This model is a slightly less good
28:833:67795:22:21:72:537:107:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:fit to the data than the optimal expectations model; the best fit testing rates are still slightly too
28:834:67897:21:22:72:513:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:high.  The parameters of the data are noisier and imply extreme asymmetry.  Comparing the
28:835:67986:22:0:72:548:64:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimated distributions of Φ and Ω we find the parameters suggest it isten thousandtimes worse in
29:836:68085:0:21:72:533:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:terms of lost utility to take the wrong action if the true state turns out to be “healthy” than if it
29:837:68186:21:22:72:177:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:turns out to be “sick”.
29:838:68209:22:22:100:552:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The parameters also imply large testing costs.  Recall that we pinned down the average testing
29:839:68303:22:21:72:545:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cost ofC= 0.005, and we interpret this magnituderelative tothe costs of taking the wrong action.
29:840:68399:21:22:72:551:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this case, the real costs of testing must large:  be about 6 times higher than the cost of taking the
29:841:68503:22:22:72:536:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:wrong actions if the true state is “sick.” Finally, we note that to incorporate confirmatory testing
29:842:68603:22:21:72:553:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:here it must be the case that there is some Ψ>Φ.The high degree of asymmetry here means that Φ
29:843:68697:21:22:72:554:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is very large relative to Ω.Therefore, in order to explain the existence of confirmatory testing it must
29:844:68801:22:22:72:553:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be the case that the benefit to confirmation when sick is ten thousand times greater than the benefit
29:845:68902:22:22:72:307:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to taking all the correct actions up to that point.
29:846:68953:22:21:100:549:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The evidence here shows that the fit of the restricted model is worse (despite having the same
29:847:69047:21:22:72:553:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:number of free parameters).  More problematic, the estimated parameter values seem implausible.  In
29:848:69146:22:22:72:550:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:combination with the qualitative evidence, some of which directly contradicts the findings, we argue
29:849:69246:22:21:72:530:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that we reject the neoclassical model as an explanation for these facts.  In some sense this is not
29:850:69345:21:22:72:554:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surprising.  However, our rejection here is more complete:  even if one thinks that real testing cost are
29:851:69450:22:37:72:358:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:large, the other evidence seems to rule out this explanation.
29:852:69511:37:29:72:290:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Alternative Non-Neoclassical Models
29:853:69546:29:22:72:541:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Having rejected the neoclassical case, we note that the optimal expectations model is not the only
29:854:69644:22:22:72:549:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:non-neoclassical candidate to explain these facts.  In Appendix C we describe two other models.  We
29:855:69743:22:21:72:538:258:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:begin with a model of wishful thinking (Mayraz, 2011).  We find this model produces implications
29:856:69839:21:22:72:554:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:very similar to the optimal expectations case, and in this sense is a plausible alternative.  Little in our
29:857:69946:22:22:72:552:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:data distinguishes these two models; the one feature leading us to weakly favor optimal expectations
29:858:70046:22:21:72:554:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is that the Mayraz (2011) model requires higher real costs of testing to explain low testing rates, and
29:859:70149:21:22:72:542:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:has difficulty accommodating confirmatory testing.  Second, we describe a model with anticipatory
29:860:70246:22:22:72:531:150:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility and information-averse preferences (Koszegi, 2003).  This model fails to match the bias in
29:861:70344:22:21:72:530:128:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reported beliefs, and requires the same asymmetry in utility losses which is necessary to explain
29:862:70441:21:0:72:551:107:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:behavior in the neoclassical case.  We therefore argue the data more strongly rejects this alternative.
30:863:70546:0:32:72:253:693:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:6  Conclusion and Policy
30:864:70570:32:22:72:541:661:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The central puzzle with which we began this paper is low rates of medical testing.  The analysis of
30:865:70669:22:22:72:549:639:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HD data here demonstrates several additional stylized facts about testing and behavior:  individuals
30:866:70769:22:21:72:519:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have downward-biased beliefs about their risk of being sick, they take actions which would be
30:867:70862:21:22:72:539:596:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:appropriate if they were healthy and testing rates are increasing withex anterisk.  We argue that
30:868:70959:22:22:72:542:574:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these facts are well explained by an optimal expectations model (Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005).
30:869:71055:22:21:100:534:552:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In addition to fitting the facts in theory, we show that this model can match the data with
30:870:71146:21:22:72:520:531:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:seemingly reasonable parameter values.  In particular, even if we assume very low real costs of
30:871:71241:22:22:72:522:509:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing, we can produce low testing rates.  This model also features an appealing psychological
30:872:71336:22:21:72:546:487:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:intuition.  The primary reason for testing avoidance in this case can be summarized, colloquially, as
30:873:71437:21:22:72:530:466:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:not wanting to live with the anticipation of future ill-health.  This intuition aligns closely with a
30:874:71538:22:22:72:541:444:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:literature in psychology in which individuals facing bad news look for reasons to avoid believing it
30:875:71638:22:21:72:333:422:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(see, for example, Dawson, Gilovich and Regan, 2002).
30:876:71691:21:22:100:538:401:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Although the data analysis in this paper focuses on HD, we show evidence (in Appendix B)
30:877:71779:22:22:72:536:379:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that similar patterns exist in cancer screening and HIV testing.  This suggests that the theory we
30:878:71877:22:21:72:518:357:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:suggest here may explain not just the HD case but low demand for medical information more
30:879:71966:21:22:72:548:336:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:generally.  In a number of these other settings, low testing rates are of some policy concern.  We can
30:880:72068:22:22:72:519:314:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:use our analysis to ask the question of how testing rates might be increased, if that is socially
30:881:72165:22:21:72:537:292:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:desirable.  It is important to note that in the optimal expectations world, the individual choice to
30:882:72265:21:22:72:533:271:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:avoid testing is privately optimal.  They are not making a mistake, nor do they lack information:
30:883:72362:22:22:72:553:249:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals are avoiding testing because they prefer to consume happiness in the anticipation period.
30:884:72463:22:21:72:533:227:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Given this fact, we should be wary of inadvertent revelation of information about genetic status,
30:885:72560:21:22:72:262:206:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:since it may make individuals worse off.
30:886:72600:22:22:100:549:184:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:There are two reasons why higher testing rates could be socially optimal even ifnotprivately.
30:887:72693:22:21:72:537:162:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The first is in a case like HIV, for example, where testing might lead to better treatment and less
30:888:72792:21:22:72:531:141:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:disease spread.  Because of the contagious nature of this disease, revealing individual status may
30:889:72890:22:22:72:544:119:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:encourage them to protect their partners, which has social value.  Second, even if the disease is not
30:890:72991:22:22:72:525:97:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:contagious, overly optimistic individuals may be socially costly for other reasons.  For example,
30:891:73088:22:0:72:521:75:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:over-optimism may lead people to under-save for bad health, and then the burden falls on the
31:892:73182:0:21:72:434:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:government.  In either case, a social planner may want to encourage testing.
31:893:73258:21:22:100:539:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Using the estimated model from Section 4.3, we can run several counterfactuals to illustrate
31:894:73350:22:22:72:554:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:what interventions might increase testing rates under this model.  These results are shown in Table 5.
31:895:73452:22:21:72:549:628:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Row (1) reports the baseline probability of testing with the simulated best-fit parameters.  Rows (2)
31:896:73553:21:22:72:536:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and (3) report simulated testing rates with changes in the cost of testing.  These results illustrate
31:897:73654:22:22:72:554:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that while testing rates are responsive to changes in cost, they are not very responsive since for many
31:898:73757:22:21:72:554:563:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:people the true “cost” of testing is the loss in the ability to ignore their status.  Even at a cost of zero,
31:899:73866:21:22:72:554:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:only around 10% of individuals would be tested.  Doubling the cost of testing reduces testing rates by
31:900:73968:22:22:72:124:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:about half.
31:901:73979:22:22:100:549:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The alternative to changing testing costs is to change the weight on anticipation or the utility
31:902:74075:22:21:72:553:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:loss from taking the wrong action.Rows (4)-(7) of Table 5 show the impact of these changes.  Testing
31:903:74175:21:22:72:538:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rates are much more sensitive to these alterations than to the cost of testing.  Less anticipation (a
31:904:74276:22:22:72:502:433:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lower value ofδin the model) or greater value on taking the correct action (higherα) will
31:905:74365:22:21:72:265:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:dramatically increase the cost of testing.
31:906:74407:21:22:100:551:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The results in Table 5 suggest that under this model it may be difficult to have a large impact
31:907:74502:22:22:72:551:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on testing rates by changing the real cost of testing.  However, either making the future more salient
31:908:74604:22:21:72:543:346:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:or emphasizing the value of changing life choices in response to medical information could be more
31:909:74702:21:22:72:554:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:effective at encouraging testing.  This, of course, predicts the obvious comparative static that if there
31:910:74807:22:22:72:554:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is a treatment or cure, which will impact the value of taking the correct action, people will test more.
31:911:74911:22:21:100:554:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As a final note, the key assumption in the optimal expectations framework is that, once tested,
31:912:75006:21:22:72:546:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals are no longer able to change their beliefs.  This seems like an appropriate assumption in
31:913:75107:22:22:72:546:238:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cases like HD (or HIV) where the test is fully accurate.  A different assumption may be appropriate
31:914:75206:22:21:72:532:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in cases where the test is not fully accurate.  In this case we could imagine that the test restricts
31:915:75307:21:22:72:539:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:belief manipulation to some extent, but not completely.  This modification could be an interesting
31:916:75405:22:0:72:184:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:extension to the model.

46:1369:94435:0:32:72:358:693:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:Appendix B: HIV and Cancer Screening
46:1370:94471:32:14:100:546:661:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this appendix we discuss patterns of behavior in HIV testing and cancer screening and ask
46:1371:94563:14:13:72:345:647:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:whether we see patterns similar to those in our HD data.
46:1372:94619:13:14:100:554:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HIV testing and cancer screening are both cases in which the demand for medical testing seems
46:1373:94712:14:13:72:542:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surprisingly low.  Although cancer screening has improved dramatically in the past decades, and is
46:1374:94810:13:14:72:505:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:useful in catching cancer at an early stage, many people do not get this screening with the
46:1375:94901:14:13:72:538:593:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:recommended frequency.  In the case of HIV, even in the US where good treatments are available,
46:1376:94996:13:14:72:554:580:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:public health officials have struggled to get people to engage in HIV testing.  In Africa, where rates of
46:1377:95101:14:14:72:532:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:HIV are much higher but treatments are limited, testing is even less common.  These low testing
46:1378:95196:14:13:72:451:552:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rates extend to testing for genetic markers for cancer risk (Lerman et al, 1996).
46:1379:95277:13:14:100:548:539:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As with HD, the real costs of testing seem not to be the limiting factor on testing.  Lerman et
46:1380:95372:14:13:72:552:525:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:al (1996) report that 40% of individuals who were tested for the BRCA1 mutation did not choose to
46:1381:95469:13:14:72:550:512:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:receive their results even though the cost was zero and they were already at a counseling session.  In
46:1382:95571:14:13:72:543:498:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the case of HIV, Thornton (2008) pays individuals to receive their HIV test results in Malawi, and
46:1383:95669:13:14:72:442:485:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:finds that 20% of people avoid their results even if they are paid to get them.
46:1384:95748:14:13:100:530:471:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Although the data are less comprehensive than in the HD case, an expanding literature in
46:1385:95836:13:14:72:533:458:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these two cases also provides some evidence on the relationship between risk and testing, and on
46:1386:95932:14:14:72:535:444:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:behavior chosen by untested people relative to those who are tested.  The one thing we have only
46:1387:96028:14:13:72:535:430:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:limited evidence on is the relationship between subjective and objective probability.  In these two
46:1388:96127:13:14:72:539:417:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:settings, the objective probability is not well defined, and few studies ask for details on subjective
46:1389:96229:14:13:72:554:403:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:chance of illness.  One exception are data from HIV positive individuals reported in Thornton (2011).
46:1390:96330:13:14:72:554:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:She finds that two years after being told they were HIV positive, about 70% of individuals report “no
46:1391:96431:14:13:72:537:376:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:likelihood” or “low likelihood” of having HIV. This suggests significant down-weighting relative to
46:1392:96530:13:22:72:297:363:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:their actual risk, similar to what we see in HD.
46:1393:96578:22:29:72:325:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Risk and Actions among Untested Individuals
46:1394:96621:29:13:100:554:312:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For both cancer screening and HIV testing, the primary non-testing behaviors researchers focus
46:1395:96715:13:14:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on are health-related.  In the case of cancer and BRCA testing, the natural question is how cancer
46:1396:96813:14:13:72:538:285:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:screening behavior differs for individuals with positive and negative BRCA1 test results, and how
46:1397:96910:13:14:72:525:272:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these behaviors compare to at-risk individuals who are untested or who do not get test results.
46:1398:97005:14:13:100:536:258:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Schwartz et al (2003) study prophylactic ovary removal for individuals after BRCA testing;
46:1399:97095:13:14:72:527:245:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:carriers of the BRCA1 mutation are more likely to develop ovarian cancer in addition to breast
46:1400:97189:14:14:72:554:231:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cancer.  These authors find similar rates of prophylactic ovary removal for those individuals who have
46:1401:97291:14:13:72:527:217:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a negative test result and those without test results (2% and 5% respectively), but higher rates
46:1402:97387:13:14:72:554:204:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(27%) for those who have a positive test result.  Note thatnoneof these individuals (even those with
46:1403:97487:14:13:72:433:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a positive test result) actually have cancer, just a marker for increased risk.
46:1404:97566:13:14:100:521:177:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Foster et al (2007) compare carrier and non-carriers of the BRCA1 mutation on rates of
46:1405:97652:14:13:72:544:163:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mammography, ovarian ultrasound and other preventative behaviors.  The individuals in this study
46:1406:97748:13:14:72:551:150:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are questioned about behaviors before testing and after testing, with the latter dependent on carrier
46:1407:97849:14:13:72:518:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:status.  The data suggest that there are limited differences between baseline behavior and the
46:1408:97943:13:14:72:550:123:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:subsequent behavior of non-carriers, but very large changes in behavior for those who are carriers of
46:1409:98044:14:13:72:550:109:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the mutation.  This suggests screening behavior is different for individuals with differing test results,
46:1410:98149:13:14:72:548:96:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:but that those with intermediate risk tend to behave like those without the genetic mutation rather
46:1411:98248:14:14:72:293:82:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:than undertaking some intermediate behavior.
46:1412:98292:14:0:100:549:68:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A similar result is seen in the case of HIV when the outcome is sexual behavior.  For example,
47:1413:98388:0:13:72:536:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Thornton (2008) uses a randomized evaluation in Malawi to estimate the impact of learning HIV
47:1414:98481:13:14:72:536:680:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:status on risky behavior and condom purchases.  She finds evidence that those who learn about a
47:1415:98576:14:13:72:554:666:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:positive test result purchase more condoms, but there is no difference between those who learn about
47:1416:98676:13:14:72:526:653:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a negative result and those who remain uninformed.  She also finds a large (but not significant)
47:1417:98772:14:13:72:551:639:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:decrease in risky sexual behavior for individuals who test positive.  A meta-analysis of data from the
47:1418:98874:13:14:72:520:626:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:US from 1985 to 1997 (Weinhardt et al, 1999) shows similar patterns.  Risky behavior (lack of
47:1419:98967:14:14:72:525:612:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:condom use, unprotected sex) is similar for untested individuals and those with a negative test
47:1420:99062:14:13:72:436:598:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:result; those with a positive test result have significantly less risky behavior.
47:1421:99143:13:14:100:543:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Overall, in both cases, the data suggest that behaviors are very different for individuals with
47:1422:99238:14:13:72:513:571:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:differing test results, as we would expect.  We also consistently observe that individuals with
47:1423:99333:13:14:72:554:558:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:intermediate risk do not undertake some intermediate level of behavior:  they appear to behave much
47:1424:99432:14:13:72:549:544:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:more similar to individuals who have a negative test result.  This suggests some “skewing” of actions
47:1425:99533:13:22:72:306:531:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:toward what would be optimal in the good state.
47:1426:99580:22:29:72:218:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Risk and Testing Behavior
47:1427:99605:29:13:100:543:480:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Among the most informative genetic screens for cancer is the test for the BRCA1 or BRCA2
47:1428:99693:13:14:72:532:467:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mutation, which are a strong predictors of both breast and ovarian cancer.  Penentrance of these
47:1429:99789:14:13:72:547:453:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:markers is high:  80% of women with the BRCA1 mutation will develop breast cancer if they live to
47:1430:99886:13:14:72:534:440:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:age 80.  A simple way to measureex anterisk is with the number of relatives impacted by breast
47:1431:99980:14:13:72:543:426:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cancer:  the more relatives with cancer, the more likely that it is genetic.  In a number of studies of
47:1432:100083:13:14:72:535:413:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing behavior, it appears that testing is increasing with risk, as measured by number of family
47:1433:100181:14:14:72:546:399:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:members impacted (Lerman et al, 1996; Meijers-Heijboer et al, 2000; Baer et al, 2010).  The second
47:1434:100279:14:13:72:552:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of these studies (Meijers-Heijboer et al, 2000) explicitly separates individuals at 25% risk from those
47:1435:100382:13:14:72:407:372:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:at 50% risk and shows higher testing rates among the 50% risk group.
47:1436:100450:14:13:100:532:358:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Cancer screening (mammography in particular) shows similar patterns.  In a meta-analysis
47:1437:100538:13:14:72:554:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:focusing on perceived risk and screening behavior, Katapodi et al (2004) demonstrates that perceived
47:1438:100638:14:13:72:319:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:risk is associated with increased screening behavior.
47:1439:100691:13:14:100:551:318:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In the case of HIV testing in the US, testing also seems to be increasing in risk (Wortley et al,
47:1440:100788:14:13:72:502:304:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:1995; Stein and Nyamathi, 2000; Samet et al, 1997).  The African context is perhaps more
47:1441:100876:13:14:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:interesting, given extremely low testing rates and high prevalence in many countries in the region,
47:1442:100975:14:13:72:520:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and shows more mixed evidence.  A number of studies find self-perceived risk increases testing
47:1443:101069:13:14:72:552:264:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(Wringe et al, 2008; Adeneye et al, 2006; Fylkesnes and Siziya, 2004), although some have found the
47:1444:101168:14:14:72:326:250:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:opposite (Sambisa et al, 2010; Thierman et al, 2006).
47:1445:101221:14:13:100:534:236:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:It is worth noting that this evidence is weaker than the HD evidence in the sense that to a
47:1446:101312:13:14:72:505:223:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:large extent these behaviors are directly linked to disease risk, disease avoidance or disease
47:1447:101406:14:13:72:533:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:transmission and, given that, it seems inherently more likely that those with positive test results
47:1448:101505:13:26:72:463:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:would respond more.  This underscores the advantage of the HD setting and data.

47:1450:101631:33:13:100:554:137:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this section we describe two alternative, non-neoclassical, models which have been suggested
47:1451:101726:13:0:72:199:124:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to explain these behaviors.
48:1452:101755:0:28:72:277:693:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f10:Wishful Thinking (Mayraz, 2011)15
48:1453:101788:28:14:100:550:665:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The key assumptoin of this model is that individuals engage in “wishful thinking”:  when faced
48:1454:101882:14:14:72:554:651:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with a bad state of the world, they are overly optimistic.  More concretely, individuals hold subjective
48:1455:101986:14:21:72:482:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:beliefs which depend on the payoff function.  We describe the setup and results below.
48:1456:102072:21:29:72:104:616:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Setup
48:1457:102077:29:13:100:541:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As before, there is a binary states∈{0,1}and individuals are endowed withp=E(s).The
48:1458:102160:13:14:71:542:574:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:starting point in this model is bias in subjective beliefs:  the assumption that individuals engage in
48:1459:102262:14:14:71:538:560:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:wishful thinking causes their beliefs to be (potentially) biased toward the healthy state.  As in the
48:1460:102363:14:13:71:542:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:basic setup, we assume that individuals prefer to be healthy than to be sick.  We denote the utility
48:1461:102463:13:14:71:537:533:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:from health asf(s).  As in the body of the paper, we assume thatf(s= 1) = 0 andf(s= 0) = 1,
48:1462:102554:14:13:72:521:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:implying that the maximum possible utility in the healthy state is 1 and in the sick state is 0.
48:1463:102650:13:14:100:540:506:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In general, Mayraz (2011) describes the formulation of subjective beliefsπ(s) from objective
48:1464:102742:14:13:72:536:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:probabilitiesp(s) as:π(s) =p(s)eψf(s)whereψrepresents the level of optimism.  Someone with a
48:1465:102834:13:14:72:492:479:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value ofψ= 0 is a realist; high values ofψindicate high optimism.  This model can also
48:1466:102920:14:13:72:527:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:accommodate pessimism (with a negativeψ).In the HD case, the subjective probability can be

48:1474:103069:19:14:100:552:405:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As in the baseline model, individuals choose a binary actiona∈{0,1}.  Utility in this model is
48:1475:103163:14:24:72:379:391:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:delivered in the same way as in the optimal expectations model:
48:1476:103226:24:25:214:411:367:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:U((a,s)|p) =δE(u(ˆa,s)|π) +E(u(ˆa,s)|p)
48:1477:103265:25:13:72:541:342:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:where ˆa=argmaxaE[u(a,s)|π].  However, in this model individuals consideronlythe anticipatory
48:1478:103358:13:14:72:533:329:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility period when making choices about testing.  In the optimal expectations model individuals
48:1479:103454:14:13:72:550:315:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:make a choice of action based only on the beliefs in the anticipation period, but make choices about
48:1480:103554:13:14:72:547:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing based on both periods.  In this case, both action and testing choices are made based only on
48:1481:103654:14:13:72:497:288:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the anticipatory period, so we can write the object that individuals actually maximize as
48:1482:103743:13:25:72:544:275:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:U((a,s)|p) =E[u(ˆa,s)|π].For simplicity, we assume symmetric values for utility losses, so we have:
48:1483:103842:25:17:277:338:250:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:u(0,1) =−Φ

48:1487:103884:24:22:72:329:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:We assume that testing carries a real financial costC.

48:1490:104012:21:16:72:318:104:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Appendix Proposition 1. Beliefs and Actions
48:1491:104055:16:15:80:554:88:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:15We are extremely grateful to Guy Mayraz for very helpful conversation about this model,  and for developing the
48:1492:104168:15:0:71:221:73:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:version of the model we present here.
49:1493:104207:0:30:84:282:693:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:1.  Ifψ >0individuals hold beliefsπ < p.
49:1494:104247:30:0:84:325:663:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f15:2.  Actiona= 0will be taken for values ofp∗≤e
49:1495:104292:0:12:325:330:670:6:g_d0_f45:6:g_d0_f45:ψ

49:1497:104297:26:31:72:522:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Proof.1.  As noted above, in this modelπ=pp+(1−p)eψ.As long asψ >0 this is less thanp.
49:1498:104383:31:21:85:545:601:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2.  Lemma 1 in the paper describes the choice of action based onπ.The model here corresponds
49:1499:104475:21:22:99:516:580:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to the symmetric case, so the cutoff value to switch froma= 0 toa= 1 isπ=.5.  This
49:1500:104557:22:52:99:371:558:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:statement follows directly from solving forpwhenπ=.5
49:1501:104609:52:14:100:545:506:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The intuition for this result is similar to the optimal expectations case, although the result is
49:1502:104706:14:13:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:delivered with one fewer step.  By assuming biased beliefs, we deliver that result immediately, and
49:1503:104805:13:14:72:159:479:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the actions follow.
49:1504:104824:14:14:100:539:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We next turn to testing behavior.  The proposition below describes the relationship between
49:1505:104915:14:13:72:523:451:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing and risk, the condition for individuals to test at all, and the condition for confirmatory
49:1506:105013:13:14:72:550:438:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing.  As in the optimal expectations case, we assume that testing for confirmation carries a value
49:1507:105115:14:30:72:83:424:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:Ψ.
49:1508:105117:30:31:72:305:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Appendix Proposition 2. Testing Behavior
49:1509:105157:31:0:84:426:363:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f15:1.  Value of testing is increasing inpfor values ofp < p∗wherep∗=e
49:1510:105223:0:11:426:431:370:6:g_d0_f45:6:g_d0_f45:ψ
49:1511:105224:11:18:416:532:359:8:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f6:1+eψ.  Value of testing is
49:1512:105250:18:30:99:269:341:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:decreasing inpfor values ofp≥p∗.
49:1513:105282:30:34:84:236:311:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:2.  Individuals will test if either:
49:1514:105318:34:26:103:244:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:(a)p < p∗andπ(p)Φ> Cor
49:1515:105340:26:33:103:256:251:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:(b)p≥p∗and(1−π(p))Φ> C
49:1516:105362:33:31:84:473:218:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:3.  Confirmatory testing will occur without predictive testing if and only ifΨ>Φ.
49:1517:105443:31:13:72:554:187:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Proof.1.  Both points (1) and (2) follow from the value of testing.  Ifπ(p)≤.5 and individuals are
49:1518:105541:13:14:99:526:174:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:taking actiona= 0 then value of testing isVtest=π(p)Φ.Ifπ(p)> .5 and individuals are
49:1519:105625:14:13:99:529:160:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:therefore taking actiona= 1 thenVtest= (1−π(p))Φ.Note thatp∗is the value such that
49:1520:105707:13:14:99:546:147:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:π(p∗) =.5.  Testing value is therefore increasing up to thisp∗and decreasing for higher values.
49:1521:105802:14:23:99:521:133:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Moreover, in either case individuals will test if the value to testing exceeds the real cost.
49:1522:105895:23:13:85:545:110:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2.  To have confirmatory testing without predictive testing requires that individuals want to test
49:1523:105993:13:14:99:546:97:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:for confirmation but not for predictive reasons.  Testing for confirmation requires that Ψ> C.
49:1524:106087:14:0:99:554:83:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Nottesting predicatively requires that the value to testing for confirmation only be higher than
50:1525:106185:0:13:99:554:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the value to testing predictively, where the latter is evaluated at the highest testing value point
50:1526:106284:13:25:99:552:680:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(p∗,orπ=.5), at which point individuals are still taking actiona= 0.  These values are given:
50:1527:106377:25:16:220:436:655:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:Vtest,predictive=.5u(1,1) +.5u(0,0)−C+πΨ
50:1528:106417:16:25:206:447:639:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:Vtest,confirmation=.5u(0,1) +.5u(0,0) +.5(Ψ−C)
50:1529:106463:25:13:99:547:614:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Testing for confirmation and not predictively will therefore occur ifC >Φ.Together with the
50:1530:106554:13:53:99:499:601:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:condition for testing for confirmation rather than not testing at all, we have Ψ>Φ.
50:1531:106637:53:13:100:548:548:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This model delivers the implication that testing is increasing inpdirectly through the wishful
50:1532:106731:13:14:72:546:535:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:thinking.  As an a neoclassical model, individuals want to test when they are most uncertain (when
50:1533:106829:14:13:72:554:521:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:they believe the probability of the disease is 50%).  Because of the wishful thinking, this occurs at an
50:1534:106933:13:14:72:336:508:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:objective probability of higher than 50%, namely atp∗.
50:1535:106987:14:13:100:552:494:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The other parts of Appendix Proposition 4 are more similar to the rational model.  Individuals
50:1536:107081:13:14:72:551:481:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are prevented from testing here only by the real cost of testing, and therefore this cost must be high
50:1537:107183:14:14:72:554:467:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in order to prevent testing.  In particular, for the same parameter values preventing testing requires a
50:1538:107287:14:13:72:553:453:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:higher cost of testing than in the optimal expectations model.  The required cost is not as large as in
50:1539:107390:13:14:72:538:440:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the neoclassical model, however, since there the value of testing waspΦ, and here it isπΦ and, as
50:1540:107487:14:13:72:268:426:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:shown in Appendix Proposition 3,π < p.
50:1541:107525:13:14:100:538:413:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:With regards to confirmatory testing, this model has an issue similar to the rational model.
50:1542:107617:14:13:72:536:399:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Generating confirmatory testing requires that the gain to confirmatory testing be larger than the
50:1543:107714:13:14:72:554:386:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:gain to taking the correct actions up to that point.  We have argued this is not the case, so effectively
50:1544:107819:14:50:72:359:372:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this model cannot rationalize confirmatory testing behavior.
50:1545:107879:50:29:72:125:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Summary
50:1546:107886:29:14:100:554:293:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In many ways this model is observationally similar to the optimal expectation case, given what
50:1547:107980:14:13:72:548:279:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we can see in our data.  Both models predict biased beliefs, skewed actions and testing increasing in
50:1548:108081:13:14:72:549:266:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:risk.  In terms of the predictions on beliefs, this model may actually be a better fit than the optimal
50:1549:108184:14:13:72:550:252:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expectations, since it accommodates the fact that reported beliefs are increasing in actual risk, even
50:1550:108286:13:14:72:357:239:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:if slowly, rather than suggesting all biased beliefs areπ= 0.
50:1551:108347:14:13:100:539:225:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The two models have different psychological micro-foundations, but testing between these is
50:1552:108438:13:14:72:554:212:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:beyond the scope of our data.  More specifically, the underpinnings of the optimal expectations model
50:1553:108539:14:13:72:537:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:suggest that individuals “know” their truep– it’s effectively a two-self model in which, if pushed,
50:1554:108638:13:14:71:531:185:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals could in principle access their true risk, even if they are adopting biased beliefs.  The
50:1555:108739:14:14:71:534:171:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:wishful thinking model has only the biased beliefs.  Through wishful thinking individuals literally
50:1556:108838:14:13:71:546:157:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:forget their true risk.  Although this does differentiate the models, it’s not something we can test in
50:1557:108941:13:14:71:115:144:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our data.
50:1558:108950:14:13:100:548:130:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The most significant difference between this and the optimal expectations model comes in the
50:1559:109042:13:14:71:533:117:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing.  Like the neoclassical model, there is nothing limiting testing here other than real testing
50:1560:109143:14:13:71:552:103:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:costs.  This means that both (a) higher real testing costs would be required to rationalize low testing
50:1561:109246:13:14:71:528:90:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rates and (b) this model struggles to explain confirmatory testing.  For this reason, we favor the
50:1562:109344:14:0:71:530:76:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:optimal expectations setting, although the similarities between the models make this a plausible
51:1563:109442:0:13:72:554:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:alternative.  Richer data, with more information on psychological processing of these decisions, might
51:1564:109544:13:22:72:195:680:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:help differentiate the two.

51:1566:109601:29:29:72:104:629:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Setup
51:1567:109606:29:13:100:536:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We retain the basic setup from Section 4.1.  The state is binary (s∈{0,1}) and individuals
51:1568:109696:13:14:72:463:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have some exogenously givenp=E(s).Consumption utility at time 2 is given by:

51:1570:109810:13:14:100:482:560:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Individuals also experience some anticipatory utility at time 1.  Individuals have
51:1571:109892:14:14:72:532:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:information-averse preferences over anticipatory utility (Kreps and Porteus, 1978).  We adopt an
51:1572:109988:14:15:72:542:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:extremely simple formation for time 1 utility (or “anxiety”), drawn from Caplin and Leahy (2004):

51:1578:110164:13:14:72:517:504:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:preferences would prefer a lowp,since it indicates they are unlikely to be sick.  However, this

51:1598:110866:29:13:100:532:229:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We summarize the results in two propositions.  The first describes beliefs and actions.  The
51:1599:110958:13:14:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:second describes the relationship between testing and risk.  We discuss confirmatory testing at the
51:1600:111057:14:22:72:92:202:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:end.
51:1601:111061:22:30:72:318:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Appendix Proposition 3. Beliefs and Actions
51:1602:111104:30:31:84:291:150:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:1.  Self-reported beliefs are accurate (π=p)
51:1603:111148:31:18:84:486:119:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:2.  Actiona= 0is taken as long asp < p∗wherep∗=ΦΦ+Ω.  Notep∗> .5iffΦ>Ω.
51:1604:111219:18:15:80:554:101:6:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f9:16In principle,  this taste for  uncertainty could imply people  actually preferp=.5 top=  0,which seems unlikely;
51:1605:111333:15:0:71:289:86:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:however, with high enoughcthis will not be the case.
52:1606:111387:0:21:72:554:693:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:Proof.1.  This follows directly from the fact that the model does not accommodate the possibility
52:1607:111484:21:31:99:207:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:of beliefs other thanp.
52:1608:111507:31:22:85:505:641:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2.  Note that the action utility enters only at time 2.  The individual will choosea= 0 if
52:1609:111597:22:21:99:530:619:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(1−p)Φ≥pΩ.Rearranging, we find that the individual will choosea= 0 up to a value of
52:1610:111680:21:53:99:373:598:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:p∗=ΦΦ+Ω..  Note this is the same as the neoclassical case.
52:1611:111738:53:13:100:533:545:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This proposition notes first that this model cannot accommodate biased beliefs.  Second, it
52:1612:111829:13:14:72:546:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:demonstrates that generating skewed actions in this model requires the same type of asymmetry as
52:1613:111925:14:30:72:370:518:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the neoclassical case, summarized in Section 5 in the paper.
52:1614:111988:30:22:72:551:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:Appendix Proposition 4. Testing and RiskDefinep∗=ΦΦ+Ω, as above.  Individuals will choose
52:1615:112077:22:31:72:293:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:to test if one of the following conditions holds:
52:1616:112126:31:30:84:186:435:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f15:1.p≤p∗andp >b−Ωb
52:1617:112142:30:31:84:181:405:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f15:2.p > p∗andp <Φb
52:1618:112158:31:14:72:542:374:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:Proof.1.  Whenp≤p∗the individual is taking actiona= 0.  Given this,Vtest=pΩ +b(p2−p).
52:1619:112243:14:22:99:278:360:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:This is positive for values ofp >b−Ωb.
52:1620:112281:22:14:85:548:338:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2.  Whenp > p∗the individual is taking actiona= 1.  Given this,Vtest= (1−p)(Φ−bp).This is
52:1621:112370:14:52:99:218:324:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:positive when Φ−bp >0
52:1622:112391:52:14:100:552:272:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For values ofpbelowp∗, the utility from testing has two components.  First, over this range of
52:1623:112485:14:13:72:541:258:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:p, individuals take the actiona= 0.Aspincreases, it becomes more and more likely this is wrong
52:1624:112579:13:14:72:546:245:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and the value to learning the true state and taking the correct action increases.  This component of
52:1625:112679:14:13:72:527:231:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the testing utility is always positive.  Pushing against this is the anxiety associated with testing
52:1626:112779:13:0:72:443:218:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:which is the difference in anticipation utility if tested versus untested:−b4+b

52:1630:112865:9:14:487:515:218:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f5:.This
52:1631:112870:14:13:72:552:204:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:difference is the greatest (most negative) whenp=.5.  Ifbis large enough, this anxiety may be large
52:1632:112969:13:22:72:501:191:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:enough to outweigh the positive benefits of testing and individuals may prefer not to test.
52:1633:113060:22:22:100:531:169:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For small values ofb,individuals withp < p∗will always want to test.  The model requires
52:1634:113148:22:21:72:547:147:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:values ofb >Ωin order to generate any testing avoidance over this range.  Given thatb >Ω,testing
52:1635:113244:21:22:72:547:126:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value will be increasing withpup top∗,which could produce the result that testing is increasing in
52:1636:113342:22:22:72:508:104:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:risk; to have testing value be highest somewhere above 0.5 it must be the case thatb >2Ω.
52:1637:113431:22:21:100:550:82:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For value ofp > p∗,the value of testing is decreasing inp.If Φ> bthen the actor will want to
52:1638:113523:21:0:72:470:61:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:test for any value ofp > p∗.Ifb >Φ they may test only for values ofpcloser top∗.
53:1639:113605:0:13:100:534:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:It is worth noting that, while this model does include the assumption that people prefer to
53:1640:113696:13:14:72:529:680:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have a lowerp(in the form of thec(1−p) term), this does not enter the decision-making about
53:1641:113787:14:13:72:548:666:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:testing.  Because this is linear inp,from the standpoint of someone deciding whether or not to test,
53:1642:113887:13:14:72:542:653:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individuals experience the same value for this (in expectation) whether or not they choose testing.
53:1643:113986:14:13:100:552:639:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Confirmatory testing fits easily in this model.  Individuals avoid testing here not due to testing
53:1644:114084:13:14:72:539:626:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:costs but due to preferences for information avoidance.  Once those concerns are removed (as they
53:1645:114181:14:14:72:552:612:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:would be once the individual was sure of their status) they would be willing to test if Ψ(the value of
53:1646:114283:14:13:72:539:598:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmation) is greater than the cost of testing.  This relationship has no bearing on the desire to
53:1647:114384:13:51:72:262:585:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:avoid testing in the anticipation period.
53:1648:114425:51:28:72:125:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Summary
53:1649:114432:28:14:100:549:506:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Under some conditions, this model can fit the data.  However, it shares two problems with the
53:1650:114525:14:13:72:544:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:neoclassical model.  First, it does not allow for overly-optimistic beliefs.  To the extent this is a fact
53:1651:114631:13:14:72:534:479:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we would like to fit, the model fails there.  In addition, explaining the skewed actions and testing
53:1652:114731:14:13:72:550:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increasing in risk requires some asymmetry in the loss to the wrong action in the two states (just as
53:1653:114832:13:14:72:554:452:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the neoclassical model).  As we discuss in Section 5, there is not a lot of empirical support for that
53:1654:114937:14:14:72:538:438:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f12:claim.  The latter result on testing and risk also requires a particular set of parameter values forb
53:1655:115038:14:13:72:517:424:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:relative to Ω,an assumption which is plausible but difficult to test.  Where this model clearly
53:1656:115133:13:14:72:535:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:preforms better than the neoclassical model is on the testing costs and testing confirmation:  it is
53:1657:115233:14:13:72:522:397:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:able to explain limited testing without resorting to the extremely high testing costs and it can
53:1658:115329:13:0:72:288:384:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:accommodate the confirmatory testing easily.
