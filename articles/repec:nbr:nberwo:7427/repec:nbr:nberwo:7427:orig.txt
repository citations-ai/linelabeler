2:26:1141:38:22:108:540:520:12:Times:12:Times:The Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported an extraordinary increase in temporary help supply
2:27:1230:22:23:72:540:498:12:Times:12:Times:(THS) employment during the late 1980s and the 1990s.  However, little is known about the venues where
2:28:1324:23:22:72:540:475:12:Times:12:Times:these THS employees actually work.  Our estimates indicate that the proportion of THS employees in each
2:29:1423:22:23:72:539:453:12:Times:12:Times:major American industry, except the public sector, increased during 1977-97.  By 1997, close to 4 percent
2:30:1519:23:22:72:540:430:12:Times:12:Times:of the employees in manufacturing and services were THS workers.  In the service sector, the increase was
2:31:1615:22:23:72:541:408:12:Times:12:Times:accompanied by a large increase in direct hires.    In  manufacturing,  however,  it  was  accompanied  by  a
2:32:1717:23:22:72:540:385:12:Times:12:Times:decline in direct hiring  from  its  peak  in  1989  even  though  output  increased  substantially  in  the  1990s.
2:33:1830:22:23:72:540:363:12:Times:12:Times:Practically, all of the growth in THS employment is attributed to a change in the hiring behavior of firms,
2:34:1932:23:43:72:457:340:12:Times:12:Times:rather than to a disproportional increase in the size of more THS-intensive industries.

3:42:2323:0:20:90:173:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1 Introduction
3:43:2336:20:21:126:486:688:12:Times:12:Times:In the last ten years or so, employment in the temporary help supply (THS)
3:44:2410:21:20:90:496:667:12:Times:12:Times:industry has more than tripled in the United States.1 The increased use of individuals
3:45:2496:20:21:89:498:647:12:Times:12:Times:hired from THS firms is evident in the payroll data published by the Bureau of Labor
3:46:2580:21:21:89:502:626:12:Times:12:Times:Statistics (BLS).  Although employment in the THS industry represented only about 2
3:47:2663:21:21:89:490:605:12:Times:12:Times:percent of total nonfarm employment in 1997, it accounted for 10 percent of the net
3:48:2746:21:20:89:519:584:12:Times:12:Times:increase between 1991 and 1997.  Since 1972, employment in the THS industry has risen
3:49:2831:20:21:90:521:564:12:Times:12:Times:at an annual rate of more than 11 percent while total nonfarm employment expanded only
3:50:2917:21:21:90:514:543:12:Times:12:Times:2 percent per year (Figure 1).  In addition, the variability and cyclical sensitivity of THS
3:51:3009:21:20:90:520:522:12:Times:12:Times:jobs have been extraordinarily high (Golden, 1996).  If we wish to understand the reasons
3:52:3098:20:21:90:521:502:12:Times:12:Times:for the timing and magnitude of the changes in employment in the THS industry, we need
3:53:3184:21:21:90:468:481:12:Times:12:Times:to know more about the changing demand for this type of nonstandard worker.
3:54:3259:21:20:90:510:460:12:Times:12:Times:Knowledge of precisely where THS employees actually work is a first step towards this
3:55:3344:20:21:90:512:440:12:Times:12:Times:goal.  Furthermore, this information is essential to assess the impact of the rapid growth
3:56:3434:21:21:90:511:419:12:Times:12:Times:in the THS industry on the performance of the sectors that hire such workers (Segal and
3:57:3521:21:20:90:289:398:12:Times:12:Times:Sullivan, 1995; Estevão and Lach, 1999).
3:58:3561:20:21:126:473:378:12:Times:12:Times:There is, however, very scant direct evidence concerning the industry of
3:59:3633:21:21:90:506:357:12:Times:12:Times:assignment of THS workers.  Because the BLS classifies employees by the industry of
3:60:3716:21:21:90:499:336:12:Times:12:Times:the employing firm rather than by the industry where they are actually working, THS
3:61:3799:21:20:90:492:315:12:Times:12:Times:workers are not included in the regularly reported measures of employment in those
3:62:3881:20:21:90:503:295:12:Times:12:Times:industries.  This paper aims to remedy this problem by combining different sources of
3:63:3966:21:21:90:504:274:12:Times:12:Times:information about the THS industry to generate estimates of the flow of these workers
3:64:4051:21:20:90:330:253:12:Times:12:Times:going to major U.S. industries from 1977 to 1997.
3:65:4100:20:21:126:484:233:12:Times:12:Times:In the next section, we define the measurement problem in more detail and
3:66:4173:21:21:90:512:212:12:Times:12:Times:discuss the different data sources that can be used to analyze the recent developments in
3:67:4262:21:21:90:474:191:12:Times:12:Times:the THS industry.  In Section 3, we provide estimates for the proportion of THS
3:68:4341:21:20:90:519:170:12:Times:12:Times:employees working in each major sector of the U.S. economy.  These estimates are based
3:69:4427:20:21:90:497:150:12:Times:12:Times:on the analysis of input-output tables published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
3:70:4510:21:32:90:515:129:12:Times:12:Times:(BEA) for 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992, and on the Contingent Worker Supplement to the

3:72:4648:7:16:90:512:90:6:Times:10:Times:1 The use of temporary workers also grew rapidly in most OECD countries (International Herald Tribune,

4:74:4767:0:21:90:504:709:12:Times:12:Times:CPS of February 1995 and February 1997.  These two supplements constitute the only
4:75:4849:21:21:90:492:688:12:Times:12:Times:direct evidence on where THS employees actually work.  Section 4 decomposes the
4:76:4928:21:20:90:494:667:12:Times:12:Times:recent increase in THS employment into the contribution of two different sources of
4:77:5011:20:21:90:521:647:12:Times:12:Times:growth: changes in the size and changes in the THS-intensity of eight major sectors of the
4:78:5101:21:42:90:357:626:12:Times:12:Times:U.S. economy.  Conclusions are presented in Section 5.
4:79:5155:42:20:90:359:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2 The Measurement Problem and Data Sources
4:80:5196:20:21:126:511:564:12:Times:12:Times:The inherent measurement difficulty stems from the fact that BLS establishment
4:81:5274:21:21:90:513:543:12:Times:12:Times:surveys classify THS agency workers as employed in SIC 7363 (Help Supply Services),
4:82:5357:21:20:90:508:522:12:Times:12:Times:rather than being included in the measured employment of the industries actually using
4:83:5443:20:21:90:503:502:12:Times:12:Times:their labor.  This occurs because THS workers are not on the payroll of the using firm.
4:84:5530:21:21:126:501:481:12:Times:12:Times:Let yt = 1 denote the event that an individual is a THS worker in period t.  The
4:85:5610:21:20:90:519:460:12:Times:12:Times:time subscript is hereafter omitted for notational convenience.  The parameters of interest
4:86:5701:20:22:90:482:440:12:Times:12:Times:are the probability that an individual working in industry i (e.g., manufacturing or
4:87:5785:22:22:90:501:418:12:Times:12:Times:services) is a THS, denoted by θi ≡ P(y=1|i), and the probability that a THS employee
4:88:5867:22:21:90:307:396:12:Times:12:Times:works in industry i, denoted by αi ≡ P(i|y=1).
4:89:5912:21:49:126:447:375:12:Times:12:Times:The two parameters are related by Bayes theorem as shown below:

4:105:6022:53:22:126:510:273:12:Times:12:Times:The expression for θi means, for example, that if a THS worker has a 30 percent
4:106:6100:22:21:90:483:251:12:Times:12:Times:chance of working in manufacturing (αi  = 0.30) then the number of THS workers
4:107:6178:21:21:90:496:230:12:Times:12:g_d0_f4:employed in manufacturing relative to total employment is 0.30 times P(y=1) which,
4:108:6260:21:21:90:512:209:12:Times:12:Times:given that the THS industry comprised about 2 percent of the workforce in 1997, equals
4:109:6346:21:21:90:509:188:12:Times:12:Times:0.006.  Using 0.15 as the value for P(i) in 1997, the proportion of THS workers relative
4:110:6434:21:22:90:350:167:12:Times:12:Times:to manufacturing employment, θi, would be 4 percent.
4:111:6486:22:22:126:490:145:12:Times:12:Times:In order to estimate θ i we need to estimate P(y=1), P(i), and the assignment
4:112:6561:22:21:90:514:123:12:Times:12:Times:probability αi =P(i|y=1).  The first two probabilities are readily estimated from available
4:113:6652:21:21:90:508:102:12:Times:12:Times:data by the observed proportions of THS and industry i workers in every year.  The last
4:114:6739:21:0:90:518:81:12:Times:12:Times:probability, however, is problematic because there is no systematic information about the
5:115:6828:0:21:90:511:709:12:Times:12:Times:distribution of THS workers by the industry of where they work (the “industry of use”).
5:116:6915:21:21:90:511:688:12:Times:12:Times:Nevertheless, under certain assumptions, estimates of the assignment probability can be
5:117:7002:21:21:90:361:667:12:Times:12:Times:extracted from selected data sources for particular years.
5:118:7060:21:22:126:520:646:12:Times:12:Times:Note that the number of workers in industry ithe denominator in the estimate of
5:119:7140:22:22:90:496:624:12:Symbol:12:Times:θishould be the true number of workers; that is, the reported number plus the THS
5:120:7222:22:20:90:512:602:12:Times:12:Times:employees working in the industry.  Under these conditions, the probability of finding a
5:121:7310:20:67:90:285:582:12:Times:12:Times:THS worker in industry i is estimated by

5:154:7895:21:21:90:499:336:12:Times:12:Times:The Current Employment Survey (CES) of the BLS is an establishment based survey
5:155:7974:21:20:90:520:315:12:Times:12:Times:providing information on the number of workers on the payroll of firms belonging to SIC
5:156:8061:20:21:90:516:295:12:Times:12:Times:7363—Help Supply Services.  This is a slightly broader category than purely THS firms,
5:157:8147:21:21:90:475:274:12:Times:12:Times:but nonetheless almost identical to data collected by the National Association of
5:158:8228:21:20:90:511:253:12:Times:12:Times:Temporary and Staffing Services (NATSS) on THS firms (upper chart of Figure 2).2  In

5:164:8680:7:16:90:487:125:6:Times:10:Times:2 Prior to the 1987 revision of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) scheme, THS firms were
5:165:8779:16:12:90:511:109:10:Times:10:Times:classified as SIC 7362 and were part of SIC 736 which also included Employment Agencies (7361) and a
5:166:8879:12:11:90:489:97:10:Times:10:Times:residual category.  The 1987 revision combined the THS firms and the residual category (excluding
5:167:8976:11:12:90:493:86:10:Times:10:Times:facilities and continuing maintenance services) into a single category named “Help Supply Services”
5:168:9075:12:0:90:182:74:10:Times:10:Times:classified as SIC 7363.
6:169:9099:0:21:126:496:709:12:Times:12:Times:The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a household-based survey providing
6:170:9170:21:21:90:500:688:12:Times:12:Times:information on households’ and individuals’ characteristics.  It assigns workers to the
6:171:9257:21:20:90:483:667:12:Times:12:Times:industry in which they are employed, broadly equivalent to a 3-digit SIC industry.
6:172:9339:20:21:90:494:647:12:Times:12:Times:Therefore, individuals are not identified as employed in the Temporary Help Supply
6:173:9421:21:21:90:522:626:12:Times:12:Times:industry as such, but in the 3-digit industry (SIC 736) that contains THS, i.e., the Personal
6:174:9514:21:21:90:470:605:12:Times:12:Times:Supply Services (PSS) industry.  However, the share of THS firms in total PSS
6:175:9591:21:20:90:511:584:12:Times:12:Times:employment was about 90 percent in 1997 and, as shown in the lower chart of Figure 2,
6:176:9676:20:21:90:503:564:12:Times:12:Times:changes over time in manufacturers’ use of PSS workers mainly reflect changes in the
6:177:9760:21:21:90:508:543:12:Times:12:Times:use of THS workers.  Unfortunately, the regular CPS does not include a question about
6:178:9845:21:20:90:337:522:12:Times:8:Times:the industry to which PSS employees are assigned.3
6:179:9895:20:21:126:480:502:12:Times:12:Times:The Contingent Worker Supplements to the CPS of February 1995 and of
6:180:9963:21:21:90:491:481:12:Times:12:Times:February 1997 are other sources of data on the THS industry.  In these supplements
6:181:10045:21:20:90:510:460:12:Times:12:Times:respondents were asked directly if they were paid by a Temporary Help Supply agency.
6:182:10129:20:21:90:509:440:12:Times:12:Times:Furthermore, the supplements recorded the respondents’ industry of assignment.  Thus,
6:183:10214:21:21:90:508:419:12:Times:12:Times:these surveys constitute the only direct evidence on the distribution of THS workers by
6:184:10301:21:20:90:164:398:12:Times:12:Times:industry of use.
6:185:10317:20:21:126:498:378:12:Times:12:Times:Finally, under certain assumptions, input-output tables from the BEA provide
6:186:10393:21:21:90:458:357:12:Times:12:Times:estimates of the distribution of PSS workers among different industries.  The
6:187:10470:21:21:90:515:336:12:Times:12:Times:commodities-use tables measure the dollar amount of output from one sector that is used
6:188:10557:21:20:90:521:315:12:Times:12:Times:as input to another sector.  These transactions are registered at approximately a three-digit
6:189:10650:20:21:90:502:295:12:Times:12:Times:level of aggregation; therefore input-output tables do not provide information on THS
6:190:10735:21:21:90:487:274:12:Times:12:Times:firms but on PSS firms (SIC 736).  When wages of PSS workers and other fees are
6:191:10814:21:20:90:515:253:12:Times:12:Times:largely independent of their industry of assignment, the proportion of the PSS industry’s
6:192:10903:20:21:90:519:233:12:Times:12:Times:output that goes to industry i (the input–output coefficient) is equivalent to the proportion
6:193:10996:21:21:90:256:212:12:Times:12:Times:of PSS hours used by in industry i.
6:194:11031:21:24:126:435:191:12:Times:12:Times:Formally, the nominal output in the PSS sector can be written as
6:195:11095:24:20:201:507:167:7:g_d0_f4:12:Times:rrrmmmNHwNHwY+=, where the subscript indicates the industry of assignment (m =
6:196:11173:20:20:90:475:147:12:Times:12:Times:industry under study and r = remaining industries), w = hourly wage plus hourly
6:197:11252:20:19:90:503:127:12:Times:12:Times:overhead fees (including the profit-per-hour of the THS agency), H =average hours of
6:198:11336:19:7:89:235:108:10:Times:10:Times:                                                       
6:199:11391:7:16:90:513:101:6:Times:10:Times:3 Using a non-parametric approach, Estevão and Lach (1999) use workers’ individual characteristics from
6:200:11494:16:0:90:520:85:10:Times:10:Times:the March CPS tapes to provide a tight range of possible values for the probability of finding a THS worker
7:201:11602:0:25:90:497:708:12:Times:12:Times:work and N = number of workers assigned to industry m or r.  Ifmwis approximately
7:202:11683:25:23:90:493:683:12:Times:12:Times:equal torw, then the proportion of PSS output going to industry m (the input-output
7:203:11766:23:22:90:489:660:12:Times:12:Times:coefficient) is approximately equal to the share of total hours of PSS work going to
7:204:11850:22:23:90:484:638:12:Times:12:Times:industry m.  In addition, if mHis approximately equal torH, then the input-output
7:205:11931:23:21:90:503:615:12:Times:12:Times:coefficient is also a reasonable approximation for the share of employment directed to
7:206:12017:21:24:90:505:594:12:Times:12:Times:manufacturing.  For instance, because manufacturing wages per worker (mfgmfgHw) are
7:207:12100:24:21:90:499:570:12:Times:12:Times:larger than the average wage in other industries, input-output coefficients will tend to
7:208:12188:21:21:90:478:549:12:Times:12:Times:overestimate a bit the proportion of THS employment directed to manufacturing.
7:209:12266:21:21:90:486:528:12:Times:12:Times:Anyway, input-output tables with the relevant information on the PSS industry are
7:210:12347:21:55:90:288:507:12:Times:12:Times:available for 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992.

7:212:12428:20:21:126:510:432:12:Times:12:Times:Under the assumptions discussed above, input-output coefficients could be used
7:213:12506:21:21:90:495:411:12:Times:12:Times:as estimates of the assignment probability, αi, for 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992. Direct
7:214:12591:21:22:90:495:390:12:Times:12:Times:estimates of αi can also be obtained for 1995 and 1997 using the Contingent Worker
7:215:12673:22:21:90:361:368:12:Times:12:Times:Supplement to the February CPS for each of these years.
7:216:12728:21:20:126:509:347:12:Times:12:Times:In principle, these sources of data provide information at the three-digit level of
7:217:12811:20:21:90:515:327:12:Times:12:Times:aggregation.  Because the statistical noise and potential biases of the estimators decrease
7:218:12902:21:21:90:476:306:12:Times:12:Times:with the level of aggregation, we conduct our analysis at the level of eight major
7:219:12984:21:21:90:503:285:12:Times:12:Times:industries: (1) construction; (2) manufacturing; (3) transportation, communication and
7:220:13070:21:20:90:512:264:12:Times:12:Times:utilities; (4) retail and wholesale trade; (5) finance, insurance and real estate (FIRE); (6)
7:221:13163:20:21:90:494:244:12:Times:12:Times:services; (7) public sector; and (8) other industries (mining, agriculture, forestry and
7:222:13251:21:20:90:138:223:12:Times:12:Times:fisheries).
7:223:13262:20:21:126:517:203:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 3 reports the assignment probabilities.  A few points are worth mentioning
7:224:13343:21:21:90:502:182:12:Times:12:Times:here.  During 1982-87, the service and public sectors accounted for the lion’s share of
7:225:13430:21:21:90:480:161:12:Times:12:Times:THS workers.  After the 1982 peak of 40 percent, the proportion of THS workers
7:226:13508:21:21:90:518:140:12:Times:12:Times:employed in the public sector (includes federal, state and local administration, and public
7:227:13599:21:33:90:493:119:12:Times:12:Times:enterprises) declined dramaticallyto almost zero in 1997.  In contrast, the share in
7:228:13684:33:12:90:523:86:10:Times:10:Times:                                                                                                                                                                    
7:229:13848:12:0:90:239:74:10:Times:10:Times:in manufacturing from 1972 to 1997.
8:230:13884:0:21:90:506:708:12:Times:12:Times:manufacturing increased no less dramaticallyit tripled between 1987 and 1997and
8:231:13965:21:21:90:515:687:12:Times:12:Times:accounted for about 30 percent of the THS workers in 1997.  The demand for THS work
8:232:14048:21:21:90:482:666:12:Times:12:Times:from the service sector also increased substantially.  Together, manufacturing and
8:233:14130:21:21:90:459:645:12:Times:12:Times:services firms accounted for about 75 percent of all THS employees in 1997.
8:234:14205:21:20:126:499:624:12:Times:12:Times:The radical changes in the assignment distribution of THS workers must have
8:235:14280:20:21:90:506:604:12:Times:12:Times:been accompanied by changes in the characteristics of THS workers.  In particular, the
8:236:14366:21:21:90:505:583:12:Times:12:Times:shift from the public sector to manufacturing suggests that there must also have been a
8:237:14453:21:20:90:418:562:12:Times:12:Times:shift in the direction of more male, blue-collar workers in the 1990s.
8:238:14523:20:21:126:518:542:12:Times:12:Times:Using data from the March CPS files, Table 2 displays the changes in the average
8:239:14603:21:21:90:502:521:12:Times:12:Times:characteristics of individuals working in personnel supply services.  While blue-collar
8:240:14690:21:20:90:508:500:12:Times:12:Times:workers comprised 14 percent of the workforce hired by PSS firms in 1977, and only 6
8:241:14774:20:21:90:504:480:12:Times:12:Times:percent in 1985, they accounted for about 25 percent by the mid-90s.  The particularly
8:242:14860:21:21:90:516:459:12:Times:12:Times:rapid increase in the proportion of blue-collar workers in the 1990s is consistent with the
8:243:14951:21:20:90:518:438:12:Times:12:Times:evidence from the input-output-tables and the contingent worker supplements pointing to
8:244:15038:20:21:90:495:418:12:Times:12:Times:a surge in the demand for THS employment from manufacturing firms.  Most of this
8:245:15118:21:21:90:512:397:12:Times:12:Times:increase was matched by reductions in the proportion of white-collar workers, while the
8:246:15205:21:21:90:370:376:12:Times:8:Times:proportion of clerical workers (pink-collars) edged down.4
8:247:15263:21:20:126:516:355:12:Times:12:Times:Table 2 presents additional evidence suggesting structural changes in the demand
8:248:15343:20:21:90:512:335:12:Times:12:Times:for THS workers.  The average proportion of male workers in the PSS industry in 1992-
8:249:15428:21:21:90:506:314:12:Times:12:Times:1997 was more than 10 percentage points higher than in 1977-1987.  The share of PSS
8:250:15511:21:20:90:513:293:12:Times:12:Times:employees working part-time (less than 35 hours of work per week) declined although it
8:251:15597:20:21:90:470:273:12:Times:12:Times:remained well above the average for the whole labor force.  The increase in the
8:252:15676:21:21:90:511:252:12:Times:12:Times:proportion of male workers, the reduction in the proportion of employees working part-
8:253:15762:21:21:90:519:231:12:Times:12:Times:time and the slight rise in their usual weekly hours of work are also consistent with larger
8:254:15854:21:20:90:511:210:12:Times:12:Times:flows of THS employees to manufacturing firms.5  As an aside, the average PSS worker
8:255:15938:20:21:89:470:190:12:Times:12:Times:seems to have acquired only a bit more education over time:  The proportion of
8:256:16016:21:26:89:497:169:12:Times:12:Times:individuals with at least some college increased from 52.5 between 1977 and 1987 to
8:257:16099:26:7:89:235:143:10:Times:10:Times:                                                       
8:258:16154:7:16:90:510:136:6:Times:10:Times:4 Segal and Sullivan (1995) had already pointed out that the observed rise in the proportion of blue-collar
8:259:16261:16:7:90:518:120:10:Times:10:Times:workers among THS employees in the early 1990s was evidence of increased demand from manufacturers.
8:260:16360:7:16:90:512:113:6:Times:10:Times:5 The proportion of male workers in manufacturing (67 percent in 1997) is substantially larger than in the
8:261:16466:16:11:90:517:97:10:Times:10:Times:rest of the economy (48 percent in 1997).  Also, manufacturing employees tend to work longer hours: 41.5
8:262:16570:11:12:90:463:86:10:Times:10:Times:hours per week, on average, in 1997 as opposed to an average of 36.8 hours per week outside
8:263:16661:12:0:90:151:74:10:Times:10:Times:manufacturing.
9:264:16676:0:21:90:517:709:12:Times:12:Times:about 55 percent between 1992 and 1997, while the proportion of PSS workers without a
9:265:16761:21:42:90:234:688:12:Times:12:Times:high school diploma declined.

9:267:16833:20:21:126:465:626:12:Times:12:Times:As shown in Figure 1, the proportion of THS workers in total nonfarm
9:268:16901:21:21:90:512:605:12:Times:12:Times:employment increased from 1 percent in 1990 to about 2 percent in 1997.  According to
9:269:16986:21:20:90:518:584:12:Times:12:Times:the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services (NATSS), in 1990 the THS
9:270:17070:20:21:90:509:564:12:Times:12:Times:industry comprised about 1.2 million workers; in 1997 it reached more than 2.5 million
9:271:17156:21:21:90:132:543:12:Times:12:Times:workers.
9:272:17164:21:22:126:508:522:12:Times:12:Symbol:The aggregate data, however, masks distinct sectoral trends.  Our estimates of θ
9:273:17244:22:20:90:505:500:12:Times:12:Times:for different industries over time (as per equation (2)) are shown in Figure 4.  We used
9:274:17332:20:21:90:512:480:12:Times:12:Times:payroll employment data from the CES to compute Ny=0,i for seven of our eight industry
9:275:17418:21:21:90:508:459:12:Times:12:Times:groups.  Data from the monthly Employment Situation BLS release for farms, fisheries
9:276:17502:21:20:90:521:438:12:Times:12:Times:and forestry were combined with payroll data from the CES for mining to form the “other

9:280:17790:22:21:126:494:354:12:Times:12:Times:What stands out is the rapid and sharp increase in manufacturing use of THS
9:281:17865:21:20:90:499:333:12:Times:12:Times:workers, from 1 percent of the sector’s workforce in 1992 to about 4 percent in 1997,
9:282:17950:20:21:90:506:313:12:Times:12:Times:about the same level of THS-intensity as in service industries.  Finance, insurance, and
9:283:18038:21:21:90:495:292:12:Times:12:Times:real estate (FIRE) and transportation, communications, and utilities have also shown
9:284:18122:21:20:90:481:271:12:Times:12:Times:significantly larger THS-intensity in the 1990s.  But in contrast to manufacturing,
9:285:18205:20:21:90:498:251:12:Times:12:Times:services, FIRE and TCU arrived at this level of THS intensity through steady growth
9:286:18288:21:21:90:475:230:12:Times:12:Times:since the early 1980s.  The proportion of THS workers in construction increased
9:287:18367:21:21:90:490:209:12:Times:12:Times:substantially between 1982 and 1987 but has remained roughly constant since then.
9:288:18448:21:20:126:489:188:12:Times:12:Times:Within manufacturing, THS-intensity increased a bit more in durable goods
9:289:18521:20:22:90:506:168:12:Times:12:Times:industries (Figure 5).  In addition, the increase was somewhat more noticeable in high-

10:379:19987:22:20:126:495:259:12:Times:12:Times:Equation (4) can be used to compute the contribution of individual sectors to
10:380:20064:20:21:90:488:239:12:Times:12:Times:aggregate growth. For example, the employment share of the manufacturing sector
10:381:20143:21:23:90:470:218:12:Times:12:Times:declined from 0.25 percent in 1977 to 0.15 percent in 1997. Thus 200.sit= and
10:382:20220:23:24:135:518:195:11:Times:12:Times:100.sit−=∆.  However, the proportion of THS workers increased from 0.00001 to almost
10:383:20303:24:23:90:518:171:12:Times:12:Times:0.04 during the same period. Thus, 02.0≅itθ and 04.0≅∆itθ.  Putting all this information
10:384:20391:23:28:90:481:148:12:Times:12:Times:together, we get that the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the change in

10:386:20638:18:16:90:518:102:6:Times:10:Times:7 Given the breakdown provided by the CPS we defined “high-tech industries” as the lowest aggregate that
10:387:20742:16:12:90:518:86:10:Times:10:Times:captures developments in office and computing equipment (SIC 357), semiconductors and related products
10:388:20844:12:0:90:310:74:10:Times:10:Times:(SIC 3674) and communications equipment (SIC 366).
11:389:20895:0:21:90:509:708:12:Times:12:Times:aggregate θ between 1977 and 1997 is (-0.10*0.02+0.04*0.2) = 0.06, which taking into
11:390:20979:21:21:90:488:687:12:Times:12:Times:account rounding errors in this back-of-the envelope calculation, is close to the 0.5
11:391:21064:21:21:90:224:666:12:Times:12:Times:percentage point in Table 4.
11:392:21092:21:21:126:513:645:12:Times:12:Times:The decomposition in (4) is also useful for identifying the sources of growth.  At
11:393:21174:21:22:90:521:624:12:Times:12:Times:one extreme, growth in the aggregate proportion of THS workers can occur even when no
11:394:21259:22:24:90:506:602:12:Times:12:Times:industry increased its THS-intensity, i.e., when 0=∆itθ for all i, as a consequence of
11:395:21345:24:21:90:500:578:12:Times:12:Times:the more THS-intensive industries having increased their size over time.  In this case,
11:396:21432:21:22:90:388:557:12:Times:12:Times:aggregate growth is due to a purely compositional component.
11:397:21492:22:25:126:511:535:12:Times:12:Times:On the other hand, all industries may be growing at the same pace, 0=∆its for
11:398:21569:25:22:90:518:510:12:Times:12:Times:all i, so that changes in the aggregate θ are directly related to changes in industry-specific
11:399:21662:22:21:90:509:488:12:Symbol:12:Times:θit’s, their THS-intensity.  This indicates changes in the hiring pattern within individual
11:400:21753:21:21:90:387:467:12:Times:12:Times:industries.  This is the within component of aggregate growth.
11:401:21815:21:21:126:522:446:12:Times:12:Times:Table 3 contrasts the contribution of the compositional and the within components
11:402:21896:21:21:90:491:425:12:Times:12:Times:with the growth in the ratio of THS workers to total civilian employment.  The data
11:403:21979:21:20:90:495:404:12:Times:12:Times:clearly show that most of the growth in this ratio can be attributed to increases in the
11:404:22067:20:21:90:479:384:12:Times:12:Times:latter.  In fact, in the most recent period, between 1992 and 1997, this component
11:405:22149:21:21:90:498:363:12:Times:12:Times:accounted for more than 96 percent of the increase in the proportion of THS workers
11:406:22232:21:20:90:234:342:12:Times:12:Times:among all civilian employees.
11:407:22261:20:21:126:519:322:12:Times:12:Times:Table 4 presents a breakdown of the within and the compositional components by
11:408:22339:21:21:90:518:301:12:Times:12:Times:different sectors.  As the third row shows, the public sector was the only industry making
11:409:22429:21:22:90:514:280:12:Times:12:Times:a negative contribution to the growth of aggregate θ.  More than 90 percent of the public
11:410:22518:22:20:90:520:258:12:Times:12:Times:sector’s negative contribution came from a change in hiring behavior (within component)
11:411:22605:20:21:90:519:238:12:Times:12:Times:and not from the observed relative shrinking of public sector employment (compositional
11:412:22692:21:21:90:522:217:12:Times:12:Times:effect).  The service sector accounted for about half of the increase in THS use in the U.S.
11:413:22784:21:21:90:512:196:12:Times:12:Times:since 1977 (0.86 percentage point of the 1.67 percentage point increase in the aggregate
11:414:22872:21:22:90:494:175:12:Symbol:12:Times:θ), while manufacturing accounted for about a third of the increase (0.50 percentage
11:415:22956:22:20:90:122:153:12:Times:12:Times:point).
11:416:22963:20:21:126:484:133:12:Times:12:Times:Virtually all of the contribution from manufacturing between 1987-1997 is
11:417:23036:21:21:90:478:112:12:Times:12:Times:originated from the within component suggesting a dramatic structural change in
11:418:23115:21:0:90:515:91:12:Times:12:Times:manufacturers’ hiring behavior during this period.  This structural change is all the more
12:419:23207:0:21:90:512:709:12:Times:12:Times:remarkable because it coincided with a significant decline in the share of manufacturing
12:420:23295:21:21:90:502:688:12:Times:12:Times:employment and, therefore, a negative contribution of this sector to the compositional
12:421:23381:21:20:90:150:667:12:Times:8:Times:component.8
12:422:23392:20:21:126:486:647:12:Times:12:Times:Within manufacturing, as shown in Table 5, the change in THS intensity in
12:423:23465:21:21:90:508:626:12:Times:12:Times:durable goods industries (the within component shown in the second row) accounts for
12:424:23549:21:21:90:505:605:12:Times:12:Times:about 62 percent of the 3.4 percentage points increase during 1977-97.  Compositional
12:425:23634:21:20:90:486:584:12:Times:12:Times:effects are insignificant.  High-tech industries explain about 17 percent of the total
12:426:23720:20:21:90:499:564:12:Times:12:Times:variation in manufacturing THS-intensity during 1977-97 even though they comprise
12:427:23801:21:21:90:317:543:12:Times:12:Times:only 10 percent of manufacturing employment.
12:428:23845:21:20:126:507:522:12:Times:12:Times:Using the estimates of industry-specific THS employment and shares we adjust
12:429:23921:20:21:90:519:502:12:Times:12:Times:upward the observed employment levels in each industry.  Figure 6 plots the evolution of
12:430:24009:21:21:90:509:481:12:Times:12:Times:annual employment levels from 1977 to 1997 after taking into account the employment
12:431:24092:21:20:90:514:460:12:Times:12:Times:of THS workers.9 As noted above, while employment other than THS has been going up
12:432:24174:20:21:90:517:440:12:Times:12:Times:in most industries it declined in manufacturing, so that at the end of 1997, manufacturing
12:433:24264:21:21:90:497:419:12:Times:12:Times:employment remained significantly below the peak reached in 1989.  However, after
12:434:24345:21:20:90:512:398:12:Times:12:Times:correcting for THS hires (the dots in Figure 6), manufacturing employment in 1997 was
12:435:24430:20:35:90:337:378:12:Times:12:Times:only slightly lower than the level observed in 1989.
12:436:24482:35:21:90:235:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5 Concluding Remarks
12:437:24501:21:20:126:500:322:12:Times:12:Times:This paper focuses on estimating the distribution of THS workers across eight
12:438:24578:20:21:90:522:302:12:Times:12:Times:major sectors of the U.S. economy using input-output data and information from the 1995
12:439:24665:21:21:90:505:281:12:Times:12:Times:and 1997 Contingent Worker Supplement to the CPS.  In 1997, about 75 percent of all
12:440:24748:21:20:90:520:260:12:Times:12:Times:THS employees worked in manufacturing or service sector firms, compared to 40 percent
12:441:24833:20:21:90:495:240:12:Times:12:Times:in 1982.  This reallocation of THS workers has occurred at the expense of the public
12:442:24917:21:21:90:497:219:12:Times:12:Times:sector.  It was accompanied by changing characteristics of the THS employees in the
12:443:25000:21:21:90:510:198:12:Times:12:Times:direction of significantly more males and blue-collar individuals who are, on average, a
12:444:25088:21:45:90:357:177:12:Times:12:Times:bit more educated now than they had been in the 1980s.
12:445:25142:45:7:90:235:132:10:Times:10:Times:                                                       
12:446:25197:7:16:90:515:125:6:Times:10:Times:8 The combination of the two effects suggests that manufacturers may have substituted temporary workers
12:447:25300:16:7:90:329:109:10:Times:10:Times:hired from THS firms for directly hired temporary workers.
12:448:25358:7:16:90:478:102:6:Times:10:Times:9  In order to add up regular and THS employees we must assume that THS workers are full-time
12:449:25451:16:12:90:507:86:10:Times:10:Times:equivalents and are not merely replacing temporary absent regular employees. The general perception is
12:450:25553:12:0:90:391:74:10:Times:10:Times:that THS workers are regarded as fully substitutable for regular employees.
13:451:25630:0:21:126:512:709:12:Times:12:Times:Our results show that the recent large increase in the proportion of THS workers
13:452:25710:21:21:90:515:688:12:Times:12:Times:in the economy is due to a change in the hiring behavior of firms in the private sector.  It
13:453:25802:21:20:90:519:667:12:Times:12:Times:is not due to a reallocation of workers from the less to the more THS-intensive industries.
13:454:25893:20:21:90:499:647:12:Times:12:Times:This suggests that the reasons for the dramatic growth in THS employment should be
13:455:25975:21:21:90:398:626:12:Times:12:Times:traced to the forces underlying changes in firms’ hiring patterns.
13:456:26041:21:21:126:462:605:12:Times:12:Times:Many reasons have been advanced to explain the rapid spread of THS
13:457:26107:21:20:90:498:584:12:Times:12:Times:arrangements.  These include the potential for employers to implement a new, lower-
13:458:26190:20:21:90:519:564:12:Times:12:Times:wage rate in a two-tier wage structure by contracting with intermediaries that pay less for
13:459:26281:21:21:90:503:543:12:Times:12:Times:similar work, realize scale economies due to specialization in the provision of specific
13:460:26369:21:20:90:483:522:12:Times:12:Times:tasks, increase productivity given that THS may be better screened or trained than
13:461:26451:20:21:90:515:502:12:Times:12:Times:temporary workers hired directly by the firm (Autor, 1998; Polivka, 1996), and facilitate
13:462:26540:21:21:90:487:481:12:Times:12:Times:more rapid changes in firms’ level of employment in response to temporary and/or
13:463:26620:21:20:90:466:460:12:Times:12:Times:unpredictable changes in demand (Abraham and Taylor, 1996; Golden, 1996).
13:464:26693:20:21:126:513:440:12:Times:12:Times:The estimates of temporary employment by sector discussed in this paper should
13:465:26771:21:21:90:458:419:12:Times:12:Times:provide guidance for future research aimed at testing some of these potential
13:466:26848:21:20:90:512:398:12:Times:12:Times:explanations.  In particular, researchers must account for the observed differences in the
13:467:26938:20:21:90:490:378:12:Times:12:Times:timing of the changes in firms’ hiring behavior in manufacturing and service sector
13:468:27021:21:0:90:139:357:12:Times:12:Times:industries.
