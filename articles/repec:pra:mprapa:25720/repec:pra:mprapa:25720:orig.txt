3:44:1312:27:28:108:510:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We present and test empirically a new theory of property and contract rights.    Any 
3:45:1397:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incentive an autocrat has to respect such rights comes from his interest in future tax collections and 
3:46:1500:27:28:72:517:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:national income and increases with his planning horizon.    We find    a compelling empirical 
3:47:1594:28:28:72:542:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship between property and contract rights and an autocrat's time in power.    In lasting -- but 
3:48:1697:28:27:72:532:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not in new -- democracies, the same rule of law and individual rights that ensure continued free 
3:49:1793:27:28:72:524:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:elections entail extensive property and contract rights.    We show that the age of a democratic 
3:50:1890:28:27:72:375:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system is strongly correlated with property and contract rights.

4:54:1967:0:27:72:152:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Introduction 
4:55:1982:27:28:108:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:What types of governments are most likely to have economic policies and institutions that 
4:56:2071:28:27:72:530:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generate good economic performance?    There are examples of good -- and of bad -- economic 
4:57:2161:27:28:72:533:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance under both autocratic and democratic governments.    Many empirical studies have 
4:58:2254:28:27:72:529:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compared the economic performance of autocracies and democracies, but their conclusions are 
4:59:2346:27:28:72:532:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remarkably varied and inconclusive.    We shall show here that it is naive to suppose that one of 
4:60:2444:28:28:72:533:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these types of political systems will regularly have better economic performance than the other. 
4:61:2540:28:27:108:523:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The quality of economic policies and institutions depends partly on the incentives and 
4:62:2627:27:28:72:528:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constraints that face those who make governmental and legal decisions.    These incentives and 
4:63:2722:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constraints vary from one autocracy to another and from one democracy to another.    We contend 
4:64:2818:27:28:72:519:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that they vary so much within these two types of regimes that any empirical tests that merely 
4:65:2912:28:28:72:527:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:distinguish governments as autocratic or democratic are bound to be mis-specified.    We show 
4:66:3006:28:27:72:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that, when appropriate distinctions are drawn within each of these two types of governments, clear 
4:67:3105:27:28:72:257:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and robust empirical findings emerge. 
4:68:3142:28:27:108:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The importance of incentives within different types of governments becomes immediately 
4:69:3229:27:28:72:532:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:evident when we think about the sometimes hoped-for benevolent dictator who understands (or 
4:70:3321:28:28:72:531:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:who is guided by economic advisers who understand) the advantages of markets and uses them 
4:71:3412:28:27:72:545:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effectively to elicit economic growth through the rational self-interested behavior of his subjects.   
4:72:3515:27:28:72:511:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A moment's reflection reveals a methodological inconsistency: if the autocrat's subjects are 
4:73:3608:28:28:72:530:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supposed to be self-interested, we should impartially assume that the autocrat will also take his 
4:74:3706:28:27:72:519:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:own interests into account.    If he does, then whenever insecurity about his hold on power or 
4:75:3801:27:0:72:525:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:anything else gives him a short time horizon, he will gain from expropriating any assets of his 
5:76:3898:0:27:72:531:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subjects whose tax-yield to him over the short time horizon is less than their capital value.    He 
5:77:3998:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will typically also gain resources by printing money to spend on his own purposes, thereby taxing 
5:78:4096:28:27:72:542:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:real money balances through inflation, and by repudiating his debts.    Such measures increase the 
5:79:4195:27:28:72:536:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources he can use to attempt to keep himself in power or to serve his interests in other ways.   
5:80:4295:28:27:72:541:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There are countless examples throughout history of autocrats who have taken such measures.    In 
5:81:4392:27:28:72:537:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:such cases, the rational self-interest of an autocrat is inconsistent with the private property rights 
5:82:4495:28:28:72:322:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that are necessary for an effective market economy. 
5:83:4546:28:27:108:528:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:By contrast, a similarly rational and self-interested autocrat expecting to rule for a long 
5:84:4638:27:28:72:518:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time (and especially one with dynastic expectations) would gain from respecting -- and even 
5:85:4729:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:protecting -- the property of his subjects.    This would increase investment and future productivity 
5:86:4830:27:28:72:537:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and thus also his long-run tax collections.    There are also many historical examples of autocrats 
5:87:4930:28:28:72:326:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:who have served their long-run interests in this way. 
5:88:4983:28:27:108:534:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus autocrats with different time horizons face dramatically different incentives.    This 
5:89:5075:27:28:72:509:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:means that we cannot correctly estimate the impact of autocratic government on economic 
5:90:5162:28:27:72:516:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance without taking the time horizons of the individual autocrats into account.    The 
5:91:5256:27:28:72:451:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empirical results in this paper suggest that this is a matter of some importance. 
5:92:5337:28:28:108:525:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Consider now the factors that can endanger property and contract rights in a beginning 
5:93:5423:28:27:72:524:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracy.    Suppose the democratic debut involves nothing more than an election that gives 
5:94:5516:27:28:72:534:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:victory to some political leader or optimizing party.    When an elected leader has such power, it 
5:95:5615:28:28:72:540:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:brings him benefits, so we cannot take it for granted that democratic leaders will be indifferent to 
5:96:5716:28:27:72:543:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whether or not they continue in power or that they will exercise their power without regard to their 
5:97:5817:27:0:72:539:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:own interests.    The elected leadership might maximize its chances of re-election by confiscating 
6:98:5917:0:27:72:534:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the assets of unpopular minorities or of the rich and distributing the proceeds among those from 
6:99:6014:27:28:72:522:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whom it hopes to obtain a majority in the next election.    It might sometimes also improve its 
6:100:6110:28:27:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:chances of staying in power by seizing opposing media of communication, or the assets of political 
6:101:6209:27:28:72:397:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opponents, or any firms or fortunes that are linked to its opponents. 
6:102:6278:28:27:108:540:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Such measures terminate or at least endanger the democracy (and often are a sign that the 
6:103:6368:27:28:72:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current elected leader is on the way to becoming a dictator).    They could not even be implemented 
6:104:6468:28:28:72:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:if the democracy has courts that rigorously enforce the rule of law.    But an initial election 
6:105:6564:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(however fair) does not by itself guarantee that there is an effective legal system enforcing the rule 
6:106:6667:27:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of law.    Thus transitory democracies can easily suffer from expropriations that have the same 
6:107:6763:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:harmful effects on property rights as the predations of an autocrat.    If a government does not have 
6:108:6865:27:28:72:527:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(or respect) the legal mechanisms that constrain usurpations of individual rights, it cannot be a 
6:109:6963:28:28:72:355:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lasting democracy, but some democracies do not last long. 
6:110:7020:28:27:108:493:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The situation in a lasting democracy is utterly different not only from transitory 
6:111:7103:27:28:72:522:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies but also from autocratic governments.    Though lasting democracies suffer from 
6:112:7195:28:27:72:542:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sclerotic accumulations of special-interest lobbying and (like all other types of governments) often 
6:113:7296:27:28:72:499:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have economically inefficient policies, they necessarily hold elections under law and the 
6:114:7385:28:28:72:539:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:governmental leaders or parties that are defeated surrender power in accord with the law.    There 
6:115:7484:28:27:72:542:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cannot be genuine elections unless even the leading opponents of the party in power have not only 
6:116:7581:27:28:72:541:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political rights but also the economic rights needed to obtain a livelihood.    If even those who are 
6:117:7683:28:28:72:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the main competitors of the existing leaders of government have these rights, they should normally 
6:118:7782:28:27:72:537:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be available to others as well.    (This is true of any lasting representative government, whether it 
6:119:7884:27:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has universal adult suffrage, such as is typical now, or a more restrictive suffrage, such as was 
7:120:7983:0:27:72:518:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristic of representative governments in the nineteenth century and earlier.    Thus our 
7:121:8079:27:28:72:534:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:argument applies to all representative governments, but since the representative governments in 
7:122:8175:28:27:72:515:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:our data base are overwhelmingly universal suffrage democracies, we use the familiar word 
7:123:8265:27:28:72:336:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:"democracy" to cover all representative governments.) 
7:124:8318:28:27:108:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Moreover, the independent judiciary, the courts, the respect for law, or whatever other 
7:125:8406:27:28:72:517:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms ensure that a democracy abides by competitive elections held according to law, 
7:126:8496:28:28:72:530:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:necessarily also ensure that the citizenry has the freedom to do whatever is permitted under the 
7:127:8593:28:27:72:532:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:law.    This freedom by definition provides some individual rights: individuals have the socially 
7:128:8691:27:28:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:protected right to do whatever is not prohibited by law.    Property rights are simply the individual 
7:129:8792:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights that relate to things that may be bought and sold.    As James Madison put it, just "as a man is 
7:130:8896:27:28:72:523:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:said to have a right to his property, he may equally be said to have a property in his rights."1  
7:131:8994:28:28:72:527:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Property and contract rights are protected by the same institutions that protect other individual 
7:132:9092:28:27:72:516:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights.    Societies are therefore constrained in their choices: they cannot prohibit all types of 
7:133:9191:27:28:72:542:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:private property and freedom of contract and also have a lasting democracy.    A stable democracy 
7:134:9288:28:27:72:517:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:without any property and contract rights is not in the feasible set.    All lasting representative 
7:135:9387:27:28:72:531:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:governments that have been observed, however wise or unwise their laws may be, always have 
7:136:9478:28:133:72:259:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensive property and contract rights. 
7:137:9517:133:11:72:221:101:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
7:138:9547:11:0:108:395:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:1  In the National Gazette for March 27, 1792 (Madison Papers, 1983). 
8:139:9616:0:27:108:537:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Whereas in an autocracy it is the leader's interest in his future tax returns (and thus in the 
8:140:9711:27:28:72:539:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:future income of his domain) that is the source of any property and contract rights, in any lasting 
8:141:9811:28:27:72:541:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracy it is the very mechanisms that ensure that a leader can not unilaterally extend his hold 
8:142:9908:27:28:72:532:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on power that are the source of property and contract rights.    Though some democracies suffer 
8:143:10004:28:27:72:541:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from excessive turnover of leadership, the legal replacement of democratic leaders is in general a 
8:144:10103:27:28:72:517:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sign of the effective rule of law, and thus of the property and contract rights of the citizenry. 
8:145:10199:28:28:108:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Property and contract rights in a democracy rest mainly on the need, if the democracy is to 
8:146:10291:28:27:72:546:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:last, to leave decisions about whether the law is being followed to relatively disinterested parties.   
8:147:10394:27:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Political leaders have an incentive to interpret the law in whatever way best furthers their own 
8:148:10491:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interests, so a democracy will not last if they can interpret the law as they please.    The rule of law 
8:149:10596:27:28:72:539:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:needed for a lasting democracy will prevail only if disputes under the law are adjudicated mainly 
8:150:10693:28:28:72:539:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by individuals who have no stake in the dispute.    This in turn requires institutions that, by social 
8:151:10796:28:27:72:538:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:design, have a very special structure of incentives and constraints: one in which those who make 
8:152:10892:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decisions do not share in the losses or gains of any party to the dispute, and in which a knowledge 
8:153:10992:28:27:72:506:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the law and a reputation for fairness increases the chances for advancement.    To last, a 
8:154:11086:27:28:72:518:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracy must maintain and abide by such institutions, notably courts with an independent 
8:155:11177:28:28:72:120:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:judiciary. 
8:156:11187:28:27:108:532:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We hypothesize that the dependence of any lasting democracy on legal institutions with 
8:157:11274:27:28:72:522:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this special structure of incentives and constraints is the main source of property and contract 
8:158:11371:28:28:72:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights in democracies.   In an autocracy, on the other hand, the autocrat is by definition the source 
8:159:11473:28:27:72:506:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of law and thus above the law and able to override any of his courts.    Thus his motive for 
8:160:11566:27:0:72:537:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:providing property and contract rights, even if they are provided through courts, is rather mainly 
9:161:11666:0:27:72:531:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:his interest in the income and taxable capacity of his domain.    The structures of incentives and 
9:162:11765:27:28:72:513:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constraints that give rise to property and contract rights in democracies and autocracies are, 
9:163:11860:28:27:72:231:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:therefore, dramatically different. 
9:164:11894:27:28:108:542:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The foregoing logic leads us to hypothesize that in autocracies it is the time horizon of the 
9:165:11988:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:individual autocrat (or, occasionally, the ruling clique) that is the main determinant of property and 
9:166:12090:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract rights, whereas in democracies these rights depend upon whether the democratic system is 
9:167:12187:28:28:72:114:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:durable. 
9:168:12195:28:27:108:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Many democracies are transitory and such property and contract rights as they provide can 
9:169:12285:27:28:72:518:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be quite inferior to those provided by some secure autocrats.    An autocrat has, however, the 
9:170:12380:28:27:72:500:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capacity to seize any assets in the country that he rules, whereas no single individual in a 
9:171:12473:27:28:72:523:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continuing democracy can unilaterally seize the assets of others or abrogate their rights under 
9:172:12569:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contracts.    Any autocratic society will sooner or later come to have rulers with short time horizons 
9:173:12672:28:27:72:530:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:due to succession crises or other causes.    We therefore hypothesize that democracies that have 
9:174:12769:27:28:72:527:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lasted for some time and are expected to last much longer provide better property and contract 
9:175:12864:28:27:72:539:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights than any other type of regime.    The societies that are consistently havens for capital flight 
9:176:12966:27:28:72:495:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and that have experienced steady capital accumulation across generations are all lasting 
9:177:13055:28:28:72:141:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies.2 
9:178:13068:28:27:108:541:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In this paper we test empirically the theory that has just been described.    Section 2 shows 
9:179:13162:27:28:72:527:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:how the theory lends itself to relatively straightforward empirical tests, both because here past 
9:180:13260:28:28:72:534:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experience is a relatively good guide to the future, and also because the tests are not likely to be 
9:181:13361:28:22:72:543:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subject to any severe endogeneity problems.    Section 3 describes our data on regime type, regime 
9:182:13460:22:11:72:221:101:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
9:183:13490:11:0:108:520:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2  The foregoing theory is set out more fully in Olson (1991, 1993) and in McGuire and Olson (1996). 
10:184:13591:0:27:72:542:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration, and property rights.    Section 4 reports empirical findings on property rights and regime 
10:185:13692:27:28:72:542:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:type, while Section 5 presents findings on property rights and regime duration.    Sections 6, 7, and 
10:186:13793:28:27:72:521:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:8 test the robustness of our results and show that they are not an artifact of reverse causation, 
10:187:13891:27:28:72:507:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sample selection, measurement error, or heteroskedasticity.    We conclude with Section 9. 
10:188:13980:28:27:72:202:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2. Empirical Tractability 
10:189:14005:27:28:108:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However long a political regime has survived, the incentive structure changes drastically if 
10:190:14098:28:28:72:535:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that regime is expected to collapse soon.    This expectation will not only change behavior in the 
10:191:14197:28:27:72:542:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political system, but will also alter behavior in the market.    Even if property or contract rights are 
10:192:14302:27:28:72:522:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:good at the moment, it will usually not pay to make long-term contracts or investments if one 
10:193:14396:28:27:72:502:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expects that contracts will not be enforced or property rights protected a year from now.   
10:194:14488:27:28:72:540:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Therefore, the institutions and policies that determine contract and property rights, like monetary 
10:195:14588:28:28:72:536:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and macroeconomic policies, affect reality not only directly but also through their impact on the 
10:196:14686:28:27:72:304:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expectations of the participants in the economy. 
10:197:14734:27:28:108:530:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It might seem that, because expectations about the future are important, yet not directly 
10:198:14824:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measurable, the foregoing theory would be difficult to test.    In fact, there are some important and 
10:199:14926:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interesting reasons that make empirical testing relatively straightforward.    The idea that the past is 
10:200:15031:28:28:72:280:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prologue is especially relevant in this area. 
10:201:15076:28:27:108:512:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Consider democratic systems first.    The length of time that a legal system has been 
10:202:15162:27:28:72:503:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:operating is a major determinant of how well property and contract rights are defined and 
10:203:15251:28:28:72:533:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:delineated.    It is beyond the wit of man to think of all possible contingencies that might lead to 
10:204:15352:28:27:72:533:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disputes about contracts or property.    Thus legal systems that have litigated a great many cases 
10:205:15451:27:0:72:535:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and have accumulated a vast store of precedents offer better defined and delineated contract and 
11:206:15549:0:27:72:543:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property rights than otherwise similar systems that have just started.    Some new political systems 
11:207:15650:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have dealt with this problem by adopting wholesale the commercial codes and court precedents of 
11:208:15746:28:27:72:524:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:other countries.    Though in some cases, such as in the continued use of English common law 
11:209:15839:27:28:72:527:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:precedents in the United States after it achieved independence, this is relatively easy, there are 
11:210:15938:28:27:72:506:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:often substantial problems arising from differences in technology, customs, language, and 
11:211:16027:27:28:72:539:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experience between the country with the new political system and the country whose legal codes 
11:212:16122:28:28:72:523:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and precedents are being adopted.    Thus the length of time a legal system has been operating 
11:213:16217:28:27:72:463:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:affects the way it works, quite apart from the way that its age affects its viability. 
11:214:16303:27:28:108:516:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The impact of age on viability is nicely illustrated by elections in the United States.   
11:215:16393:28:27:72:532:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Though there are substantial industries that do economic and political forecasting, one virtually 
11:216:16491:27:28:72:524:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:never sees forecasts about whether, say, the 1998 Congressional elections will take place.    In 
11:217:16587:28:28:72:536:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:large part because elections in the US have been held as scheduled for more than 200 years, it is 
11:218:16685:28:27:72:534:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:simply taken for granted that they will be held as scheduled.    Similarly, the fact that the British 
11:219:16787:27:28:72:532:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:court system has protected property and contract rights with continuity for more than 300 years 
11:220:16883:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:means that certain property and contract rights in Britain are not the object of explicit forecasts, but 
11:221:16988:27:28:72:536:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are unthinkingly taken for granted.    Such tacit assumptions about the institutional reality are, in 
11:222:17090:28:28:72:542:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:turn, part of the institutional reality: what everyone expects -- and especially what everyone takes 
11:223:17190:28:27:72:527:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for granted -- is more likely to happen precisely because of these explicit or tacit expectations. 
11:224:17287:27:28:108:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:New democracies not only usually lack the security that comes from such expectations, but 
11:225:17377:28:28:72:542:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they are often also set up in extremely fluid -- and sometimes nearly anarchic -- situations.    When 
11:226:17477:28:27:72:540:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the flag of a new democracy is raised, it may not even be clear how many will salute: there is not 
11:227:17576:27:0:72:535:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only uncertainty about how long the new democracy will last, but sometimes it is not even clear 
12:228:17674:0:27:72:483:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that the new democracy has the power needed to protect property and contract rights. 
12:229:17758:27:28:108:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus we conclude that the age of a democratic political system is not only directly pertinent 
12:230:17852:28:27:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to the property and contract rights in a democracy, but also a reasonable proxy measure of both the 
12:231:17952:27:28:72:533:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:likelihood and the popular expectation that a given democratic system and the rights it provides 
12:232:18049:28:27:72:240:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will last for the foreseeable future. 
12:233:18086:27:28:108:532:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Now let us consider autocracy.    It is instructive to start with Mao's maxim that political 
12:234:18179:28:28:72:538:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power grows out of the barrel of a gun.    Accepting this maxim does not imply, however, that an 
12:235:18276:28:27:72:542:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocrat is the best marksman in the country, much less that he personally could outgun any large 
12:236:18374:27:28:72:535:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:number of his subjects.    The power of an autocrat when he is powerful grows mainly out of the 
12:237:18470:28:27:72:525:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:belief that his subordinates will use their guns in the service of the autocrat, thereby making it 
12:238:18569:27:28:72:543:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exceedingly costly for other subjects to rebel.    But who guards the guards?    What explains why a 
12:239:18670:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:given officer in the autocrat's army or police will obey the autocrat's orders, when they do, in fact, 
12:240:18773:28:27:72:534:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:obey?    If any officer expects that all or almost all of the other officers will follow the autocrat's 
12:241:18876:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:orders, then he has no choice but to follow these orders also.    What each of the other officers does 
12:242:18979:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also depends on what they, in turn, expect their colleagues to do.    If almost everyone expects that 
12:243:19080:27:28:72:533:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:almost all of the officers will follow the autocrat's orders, the autocrat is securely in control and 
12:244:19182:28:28:72:520:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:likely to remain in control for some time.    What it is rational to do depends on what average 
12:245:19278:28:27:72:542:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opinion expects average opinion to be.    When someone has appointed himself the new autocrat, it 
12:246:19376:27:28:72:531:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is usually not clear what each officer will expect, or expect that his colleagues will expect.    So 
12:247:19477:28:28:72:527:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocrats who have not consolidated their power do not, in fact, necessarily have much power. 
12:248:19570:28:27:108:542:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus the power of an autocrat is in large part the outcome of a coordination game.    Just as 
12:249:19664:27:0:72:532:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:it is irrational to drive on a different side of the road than other people going the same direction 
13:250:19767:0:27:72:548:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expect to use, so it is irrational to ignore the expectations of others in assessing an autocrat's power.   
13:251:19875:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This means that usually the longer that an autocrat exercises power,    the more people will take for 
13:252:19977:28:27:72:401:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:granted that his orders will be followed, and the more power he has. 
13:253:20045:27:28:108:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:One check on the validity of the foregoing arguments is the correlation between the elapsed 
13:254:20136:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration of an autocrat's rule and the likelihood of a coup.    We calculated the probability of a coup 
13:255:20240:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for all regimes for all years from the data for 1948-82 as a ratio of two numbers.    The numerator is 
13:256:20343:28:28:72:541:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the sum of all autocrats who were deposed by a coup in year t of their tenure. The denominator is 
13:257:20440:28:27:72:512:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the sum of all autocrats with tenure greater than or equal to t - 1.    The probabilities of both 
13:258:20536:27:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:successful and unsuccessful coup attempts are quite high in the first five years of an autocrat's 
13:259:20634:28:27:72:533:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tenure, but decline dramatically as duration increases.    The probability of a coup attempt in the 
13:260:20734:27:28:72:534:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:first year (including successful coups) is 32%, 20% in the second year, and below 10% for most 
13:261:20829:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:years beyond the sixth.    This pattern suggests that the duration of an autocrat's rule is a reasonable 
13:262:20934:28:27:72:500:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:approximation of regime stability and expected remaining duration.    This pattern is also 
13:263:21025:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consistent with our use of the log of duration in all empirical specifications, so that increases from, 
13:264:21129:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:say, 0 to 3 years in the elapsed duration of an autocrat's rule are weighted much more heavily than 
13:265:21229:27:28:72:522:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increases from 10 to 13 years.    A similar calculation was made for democracies.    Again, the 
13:266:21325:28:28:72:515:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:probabilities of successful and unsuccessful coups tend to decline as the elapsed duration of 
13:267:21419:28:27:72:259:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracy within a country increases. 
13:268:21456:27:28:108:541:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It might be thought that the expected remaining duration of an autocrat's regime would be 
13:269:21546:28:28:72:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inversely related to the age of the autocrat, since human life is finite and this sets a maximum value 
13:270:21649:28:27:72:540:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on the expected remaining duration of an autocrat's regime.    Age and duration increase together, 
13:271:21748:27:0:72:543:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:making duration to date a suspect proxy for the expected remaining time in power.    However, the 
14:272:21848:0:27:72:543:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prospects of natural death constrain the time horizons of even very old leaders less than one might 
14:273:21948:27:28:72:516:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expect.    The probability of death from natural causes in a particular year is not high even at 
14:274:22045:28:27:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:advanced ages.    From the life tables of the United States, average remaining years of life exceeds 
14:275:22146:27:28:72:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:five years even for an 80-year-old male.    Furthermore, our use of the log of duration ensures that 
14:276:22247:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:minimal weight is given to further increases in tenure for aging autocrats of long standing included 
14:277:22348:27:28:72:531:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in our sample, such as Banda of Malawi and Franco of Spain.    In any event, the expectation of 
14:278:22444:28:28:72:542:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:natural death will have less impact on an autocrat's incentives than the expectation of exiting via a 
14:279:22546:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coup.    An autocrat may spend substantial amounts of a country's resources attempting to stave off 
14:280:22646:27:28:72:541:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a coup -- or preparing for a luxurious exile -- but there are limits to what he can usefully spend to 
14:281:22746:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stave off natural death.    A proxy measure that declined in value when autocrats reached advanced 
14:282:22845:27:28:72:529:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ages thus might be a less accurate measure of incentives to protect property rights than the one 
14:283:22942:28:28:72:123:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:used here. 
14:284:22952:28:27:108:533:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus we take the elapsed duration of an autocrat's (or an autocratic group's) rule and the 
14:285:23043:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current age of a democratic system as proxies for its expected remaining life: what has survived for 
14:286:23144:28:27:72:539:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a long time is expected to be more likely to last than that which is new.    In summary, our theory 
14:287:23244:27:28:72:518:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:leads us to predict a positive relationship, for both autocracies and democracies, between the 
14:288:23339:28:28:72:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration of a regime and the security of the property and contract rights that its citizens enjoy.    For 
14:289:23445:28:27:72:532:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:both types of regimes, this positive relationship is the result of the joint hypotheses that (1) past 
14:290:23547:27:28:72:529:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration of the regime is positively related to expected future duration, and (2) expected future 
14:291:23645:28:28:72:517:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration is positively related to the security of property and contract rights.    In addition, for 
14:292:23745:28:27:72:538:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies we argue (3) that the mechanisms that support contract and property rights function 
14:293:23841:27:0:72:516:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:better, the longer the democracy has been continuously in existence, apart from the effect of 
15:294:23937:0:27:72:518:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration on expectations of its future life.    Though the incentive structures underlying these 
15:295:24033:27:28:72:530:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationships are different for democracies and autocracies, the expected empirical relationship 
15:296:24130:28:27:72:311:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between duration and property rights is the same. 
15:297:24179:27:28:108:535:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There is another reason why testing the implications of the foregoing theory is relatively 
15:298:24270:28:27:72:542:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:straightforward.    The key causal variables are the age of a democratic system and the duration of 
15:299:24369:27:28:72:534:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an individual autocrat's rule.    As Grossman and Noh (1990) have shown, the time in office of a 
15:300:24465:28:28:72:542:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democratic leader in a political system with free entry is likely to be quite sensitive to the policies 
15:301:24569:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:chosen by that leader.    A leader or political party with a rapacious policy is much less likely to be 
15:302:24673:27:28:72:533:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:able to win support for continuation in office than one that has followed a policy that favors the 
15:303:24772:28:27:72:505:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:welfare of the citizenry.  To determine the relationship between the tenure in office of an 
15:304:24864:27:28:72:530:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:individual democratic leader and his impact on property and contract rights, one would have to 
15:305:24959:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measure not only the effect of leaders' time horizons on the policies they chose, but also the impact 
15:306:25060:28:27:72:542:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the policies chosen on the probability of re-election.    There would presumably be strong causal 
15:307:25161:27:28:72:533:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:connections going in both directions and this would complicate empirical testing.    By contrast, 
15:308:25259:28:27:72:527:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:when the age of a democratic system -- or the length of a single autocrat's rule -- is at issue the 
15:309:25354:27:28:72:255:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:situation is relatively straightforward. 
15:310:25394:28:28:108:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In a secure democracy in which the continuation of representative government is taken for 
15:311:25484:28:27:72:542:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:granted, the incumbent leader may not even give any thought to the implications of his policies for 
15:312:25584:27:28:72:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the life of the political system.    The property and contract rights at issue are, moreover, more often 
15:313:25689:28:28:72:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the province of the courts and the legal system than of the elected officials.    In a democracy that is 
15:314:25794:28:27:72:532:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:quite insecure the courts may be much weaker and the incumbent leader obviously may take an 
15:315:25885:27:0:72:532:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interest in the question of how long the democracy will last, since his position as leader may be 
16:316:25985:0:27:72:513:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:affected.    But it would be wrong to conclude that he is necessarily motivated by a desire to 
16:317:26079:27:28:72:539:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prolong the life of the democracy: he could, for the reasons set out above, also be motivated by a 
16:318:26178:28:27:72:542:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:desire to become a dictator who does not have to continue to answer to the electorate.    Thus, just 
16:319:26279:27:28:72:528:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:as he might choose policies that are intended to increase the life of the democracy, so he might 
16:320:26375:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:choose policies with the opposite objective.    While our theoretical framework suggests that there 
16:321:26475:27:28:72:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:should be a strong tendency for lasting democracies to have better individual rights than those that 
16:322:26576:28:28:72:524:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have not yet been securely established, it does not suggest that there should be any strong and 
16:323:26672:28:27:72:541:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regular tendency for democratic leaders to choose policies about property and contract rights that 
16:324:26771:27:28:72:534:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are intended to change the duration of the democratic system.    Accordingly, our theory implies 
16:325:26868:28:27:72:536:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that the age of a democratic system is not directly influenced by policy choices.    Policy choices 
16:326:26968:27:28:72:538:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:may influence the survival probability of a democratic system through their impact on economic 
16:327:27063:28:28:72:533:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance, but we control for per capita GDP levels and growth rates and this should capture 
16:328:27158:28:27:72:514:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:much of the effect of any endogenous policy choices.    We shall later see that our statistical 
16:329:27254:27:28:72:323:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:examination of this issue offers further reassurance. 
16:330:27307:28:27:108:540:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the case of autocracy, there can be no doubt that an autocrat has an incentive to choose 
16:331:27399:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policies that will extend his tenure.    Though this effect can indeed lead to bias in our estimates, the 
16:332:27505:28:28:72:534:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bias runs against our hypothesis.    We assume autocrats optimize, so that an autocrat with a low 
16:333:27603:28:27:72:481:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:survival probability increases his exactions and reduces his expenditures on the legal 
16:334:27689:27:28:72:517:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:infrastructure.    One reason he does this is because he has little reason to take account of the 
16:335:27787:28:28:72:542:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reduction in future tax receipts that this brings about.    Another reason is that he rationally gives a 
16:336:27892:28:27:72:516:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relatively higher value to resources that he can obtain now to shore up his hold on power by 
16:337:27985:27:0:72:513:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strengthening his instruments of social control and by subsidizing pivotal allies.    Though a 
17:338:28082:0:27:72:524:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:government whose survival depends on popularity with an electorate may gain from lowering 
17:339:28172:27:28:72:541:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:taxes, an autocrat's tenure does not depend on any electorate.    It typically depends instead on the 
17:340:28274:28:27:72:528:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power and loyalty of his military and police forces and on the support of his allies.3  He needs 
17:341:28371:27:28:72:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources to obtain this power, loyalty, and support.    If most autocrats tried to extend their tenures 
17:342:28476:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by improving the welfare of their subjects, much of the effects of this behavior would in any event 
17:343:28576:27:28:72:445:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be captured by per capita GDP levels and growth rates, which we control for. 
17:344:28652:28:28:108:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus in our model an autocrat's incentive to increase taxes and reduce expenditures on 
17:345:28739:28:27:72:528:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:legal infrastructure improves his survival probabilities.    Higher taxes still have an opportunity 
17:346:28838:27:28:72:521:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cost for an autocrat, however: higher taxes (and insecure property and contract rights) reduce 
17:347:28933:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:future GDP levels.    At a sufficiently high probability of survival, the costs of foregone future tax 
17:348:29036:27:28:72:542:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revenues from reducing GDP outstrip the benefits from using current tax revenues to extend one's 
17:349:29133:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tenure, particularly if one makes the reasonable assumption that survival probabilities increase at a 
17:350:29235:28:197:72:459:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:diminishing rate as expenditures on repressive forces and pivotal allies increase.

17:352:29347:11:16:108:540:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:3  See Olson (1965) on the logic behind this conclusion and Lichbach (1995) for a most thorough survey of 
17:353:29453:16:11:72:529:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the literature on this subject.    See also Svensson (1994) for a broadly similar model in which investments in legal 
17:354:29571:11:12:72:542:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:infrastructure in period 1 are negatively related to the current government's prospects of remaining in power in period 
17:355:29691:12:11:72:530:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2.    Unlike our results reported below, Svensson's empirical tests utilize only country-level averages of instability, 
17:356:29811:11:0:72:421:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:property rights, and investment, and do not differentiate democracies from autocracies. 
18:357:29899:0:27:108:530:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Accordingly, optimization by insecure autocrats assures that they adjust their economic 
18:358:29986:27:28:72:533:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policies to make their tenure less short or insecure than it would otherwise be.    They do this by 
18:359:30086:28:27:72:531:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increasing their exactions or confiscations to obtain more resources for protecting their hold on 
18:360:30184:27:28:72:501:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power.    To the extent that autocrats who would otherwise have a short tenure succeed in 
18:361:30274:28:27:72:519:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extending their hold on power, our coefficients on the duration of autocrats tend to be biased 
18:362:30369:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:downward: those insecure autocrats whose expedient expropriations have enabled them to cling to 
18:363:30465:28:28:72:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power for extended periods reduce the generally positive association between the elapsed duration 
18:364:30563:28:27:72:541:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of an autocrat's rule and the security of property and contract rights.    We nonetheless later report 
18:365:30666:27:28:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the results of tests that correct for the possibility our coefficients are biased upwards by a feedback 
18:366:30770:28:27:72:291:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from improved policies to lengthened tenure.

18:369:30876:28:27:108:531:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This section describes the variables we use to assess regime types, regime duration, and 
18:370:30965:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property and contract rights.    Since both the regime type and regime duration variables have been 
18:371:31065:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:newly constructed for this paper and should ultimately also prove useful to other investigators, we 
18:372:31165:27:28:72:517:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:must describe them fully.    But the rest of the paper should be comprehensible even to those 
18:373:31259:28:28:72:259:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:readers who have skipped this section. 
18:374:31297:28:27:72:215:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3.1. Defining Regime Types 
18:375:31323:27:28:108:516:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Most recent empirical studies of democracy and economic performance make use of 
18:376:31403:28:28:72:527:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Gastil's (1989) measures of political rights and/or civil liberties.    The Gastil measures include 
18:377:31502:28:0:72:520:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:some rights that are more nearly outcomes of political and economic processes than defining 
19:378:31596:0:27:72:543:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:features or requisites of a democratic political system.4  Given that our interest is in assessing the 
19:379:31699:27:28:72:539:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact of regime type on property rights, the outcomes-based nature of the Gastil indexes makes 
19:380:31795:28:27:72:530:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:them inappropriate indicators of democracy.    In addition, they do not cover part of our sample 
19:381:31892:27:446:72:108:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period.

19:383:31929:11:16:108:523:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:4  The civil liberties checklist includes "personal social rights, including those to property, internal and 
19:384:32037:16:11:72:531:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:external travel, choice of residence, marriage, and family," "freedom from gross social inequality," "freedom from 
19:385:32152:11:12:72:533:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:gross government indifference or corruption," and "socio-economic rights: including freedom from dependency on 
19:386:32263:12:11:72:520:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:landlords, bosses, union leaders, or bureaucrats."    The political rights checklist includes "recent shifts in power 
19:387:32381:11:0:72:486:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:through elections," "significant opposition vote," and "informal consensus: de facto opposition power." 
20:388:32486:0:27:108:530:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our definition of democracy is procedural.    In a democratic regime the chief executive 
20:389:32575:27:28:72:539:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the legislature are both elected in competitive elections and the legislature is effective, in the 
20:390:32678:28:27:72:531:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sense that it has considerable autonomy.    In this definition both presidential and parliamentary 
20:391:32777:27:28:72:534:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:systems can be fully democratic.    A regime falls short of full democracy if the elections are not 
20:392:32877:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fully competitive or if the executive's power is so predominant that the legislature does not provide 
20:393:32979:27:28:72:234:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an effective check on that power. 
20:394:33012:28:28:108:528:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our definition of democracy is procedural, but the existence of competitive democratic 
20:395:33098:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procedures implies the existence of certain rights.    It is obviously impossible for a society to have 
20:396:33202:27:28:72:504:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continuing and truly competitive elections unless certain freedoms are maintained.    Thus 
20:397:33293:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continuing representative government implies free speech, the right to campaign freely, the right to 
20:398:33394:27:28:72:536:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:form political parties, the right of peaceful demonstration, and freedom from arbitrary arrest.    It 
20:399:33496:28:28:72:488:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also implies that at least some opponents of the party in power must be able to survive 
20:400:33584:28:27:72:535:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economically, and thus have at least enough property and contract rights to remain viable.    The 
20:401:33682:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only fully competitive elections are those in which even the opponents of the party in power have 
20:402:33780:28:27:72:299:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the rights they need to compete and to survive. 
20:403:33827:27:28:108:512:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A full-fledged dictatorship, on the other hand, is a regime in which neither the chief 
20:404:33914:28:28:72:537:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executive nor the legislature (if one exists) is chosen in a competitive election, or one in which a 
20:405:34015:28:27:72:528:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competitively-elected legislature is rendered ineffective by a non-elected (or not competitively 
20:406:34112:27:67:72:168:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:elected) executive.5

20:408:34162:10:16:108:520:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:5  The definitions of democracy and dictatorship refer exclusively to the characteristics of the national 
20:409:34268:16:0:72:471:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:government.    We do not attempt to characterize the selection of officials at the sub-national levels. 
21:410:34373:0:27:108:515:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We classify regimes by relying as much as possible on the judgments made by other 
21:411:34455:27:28:72:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:observers, although in a few situations we draw our own inferences in resolving ambiguities.   
21:412:34550:28:27:72:505:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:These instances are explained below.    Our basic sources for data on selection of the chief 
21:413:34643:27:28:72:538:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executive and effectiveness of the legislature are Gurr's Polity II (1990) and Banks (1979).    Our 
21:414:34742:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classification assigns a number from I to V to each country in each year, where these numbers have 
21:415:34841:27:28:72:191:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the following meanings: 
21:416:34864:28:14:72:206:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: I. Dictatorship 
21:417:34878:14:14:72:244:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: II. Almost Dictatorship 
21:418:34900:14:13:72:254:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: III. Intermediate Category 
21:419:34925:13:14:72:240:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: IV. Almost Democracy 
21:420:34944:14:14:72:202:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: V. Democracy 
21:421:34955:14:14:72:75:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
21:422:34955:14:27:108:528:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:These classifications are based on the variables executive competitiveness (XRCOMP) 
21:423:35039:27:28:72:542:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from Gurr and executive selection (EXSELEC) and legislative effectiveness (LEGEF) in Banks.   
21:424:35133:28:28:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Gurr and Banks provide two alternative judgments about the selection of the chief executive.   
21:425:35228:28:27:72:528:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Gurr's XRCOMP classifies countries into one of three categories with respect to how the chief 
21:426:35322:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executive is selected.    These may be loosely described as (1) no elections or rigged elections; (2) 
21:427:35424:28:27:72:523:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dual/transitional, where there are two executives or there is a transition between selection and 
21:428:35521:27:28:72:506:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:election; and (3) competitive election.    Banks' EXSELEC provides essentially a two-way 
21:429:35610:28:28:72:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:classification: the chief executive is either elected or not.    Banks' LEGEF classifies countries into 
21:430:35714:28:27:72:526:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one of three categories with respect to the legislature: (1) no legislature or one that is rendered 
21:431:35814:27:28:72:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:completely ineffective by domestic turmoil or by the actions of the chief executive; (2) a partially 
21:432:35915:28:28:72:488:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effective legislature; (3) an effective legislature, elected under competitive conditions. 
21:433:36005:28:27:108:492:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Five categories (I-V) are derived from these variables in the following way.    A 
21:434:36087:27:0:72:517:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:full-fledged Democracy (V) is in the top category on all three variables, while a full-fledged 
22:435:36184:0:27:72:542:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Dictatorship (I) is in the bottom category on XRCOMP and LEGEF.    An Almost Democracy (IV) 
22:436:36276:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:falls short of the top rating on either XRCOMP or LEGEF, while an Almost Dictatorship (II) is in 
22:437:36373:28:27:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the intermediate category on LEGEF.    The other cases are classified in the Intermediate Category 
22:438:36472:27:28:72:542:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(III), or are inconsistent (for example, because Gurr and Banks rate the chief executive differently, 
22:439:36574:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or because the legislature is rated as fully effective yet the chief executive was selected rather than 
22:440:36678:27:28:72:537:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:elected).6  In our empirical tests below, we treat countries in categories IV or V as democracies, 
22:441:36777:28:28:72:488:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and countries in categories I and II as autocracies.    The small number of country-year 
22:442:36866:28:27:72:267:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:observations in category III are omitted. 
22:443:36907:27:28:108:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Gurr and Banks data are available only through 1986.    Our research assistant Suzanne 
22:444:36998:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Gleason updated regimes codings through 1990, relying primarily on the Europa Yearbook.    Only 
22:445:37094:27:28:72:478:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seven countries were judged to have changed classification between 1986 and 1990. 
22:446:37175:28:28:108:480:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Empirically, the differences between our procedural definition and the Gastil 
22:447:37253:28:27:72:535:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:outcomes-based measures turn out to be relatively minor.7  A crucial advantage of our measure 
22:448:37347:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for present purposes is that the data it is based on are available well before the 1973 beginning date 
22:449:37450:28:32:72:170:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for Gastil's indexes. 
22:450:37471:32:10:72:221:257:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
22:451:37501:10:16:108:542:247:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:6  Our conception of democracy is fundamentally consistent with the conceptions of Bollen (1990) and other 
22:452:37608:16:12:72:542:231:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:political scientists who have adopted a procedural definition of democracy.    There is a conceptual difference, though, 
22:453:37729:12:11:72:537:219:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:between our scheme and those that add up the scores on different indicators.    Such a methodology assumes that the 
22:454:37845:11:12:72:546:208:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:contribution of a characteristic to the democratic nature of a regime is independent of the level of other characteristics.   
22:455:37971:12:11:72:542:196:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:However, the marginal productivity of an input (in this case, in producing democracy) usually depends on the level of 
22:456:38089:11:12:72:531:185:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:other inputs.    A dictator who tolerates freedom of the press during periods in which he feels secure in his position 
22:457:38208:12:11:72:532:173:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:does not on that account become a more democratic ruler.    Similarly, the fact that the ballots are counted honestly 
22:458:38326:11:12:72:529:162:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:does not make a regime more democratic if important political alternatives are prevented from participating in the 
22:459:38441:12:11:72:535:150:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:elections.    Our classification does not yield a ranking identical to one obtained from a mechanical adding up of the 
22:460:38560:11:19:72:506:139:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:scores on each of the component indicators.    See the Appendix for a summary of our classification scheme. 
22:461:38667:19:16:108:535:120:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:7  The simple Spearman rank-order correlations between our 5-category political regime indicator and the 
22:462:38772:16:12:72:541:104:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:7-point Gastil measures are quite high: 0.87 for political rights and 0.82 for civil liberties.    Changes in Gastil ratings 
22:463:38897:12:11:72:532:92:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:of countries over time are highly correlated with changes in our classification.    Correlations of each with property 
22:464:39016:11:0:72:206:81:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:rights indicators differ very little. 
23:465:39055:0:27:72:271:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3.2. Measurement of Regime Duration 
23:466:39090:27:28:108:532:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For democracies, we create two duration measures:    DEMDUR refers to the number of 
23:467:39174:28:27:72:502:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consecutive years that a country has been a democracy8 (i.e., regime type IV or V), while 
23:468:39263:27:28:72:520:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:DEXDUR is the number of years that the chief executive has been in office in a democracy.   
23:469:39354:28:27:72:530:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus, DEMDUR is reset to one in any year in which the country lapses from democratic status 
23:470:39446:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(i.e., drops to category III or below), while DEXDUR is reset to one in any year in which the chief 
23:471:39546:28:28:72:165:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executive changes. 
23:472:39564:28:27:108:542:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For autocracies, the variable AUTDUR is defined as the number of consecutive years that 
23:473:39652:27:28:72:515:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the chief executive in an autocratic nation has been in power.    The value of AUTDUR thus 
23:474:39743:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increases by one for each year that the autocrat remains in power and the regime remains in either 
23:475:39841:27:28:72:529:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the categories I and II.    The variable is reset to one in any year in which the chief executive 
23:476:39942:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes.    This proxy for the time horizons of decision makers in autocracies fits the simplest and 
23:477:40043:28:27:72:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:most common type of modern autocracy: one-man rule with no established procedures for 
23:478:40129:27:193:72:129:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:succession. 
23:479:40140:193:11:72:221:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
23:480:40170:11:16:108:533:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:8  Our data on property rights go back no further than 1969.    In measuring duration of regimes, we begin 
23:481:40277:16:11:72:535:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:counting in 1930.    Since we use the log of duration in regressions, neglecting to identify an earlier starting date for 
23:482:40399:11:0:72:452:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:democracy in the U.S., Britain, etc. affects our estimates for DEMDUR's impact only trivially. 
24:483:40495:0:27:108:543:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There are, however, some cases for which this proxy for autocratic time horizons does not 
24:484:40585:27:28:72:531:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:apply.    Though autocracies are much less likely to be institutionalized than democracies, some 
24:485:40682:28:27:72:467:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relatively autocratic or at least non-democratic regimes have achieved a degree of 
24:486:40765:27:28:72:529:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutionalization.    For these regimes, the duration of the chief executive will be a somewhat 
24:487:40864:28:27:72:488:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:noisy measure.    In exceptional cases, such as Mexico in the heyday of the PRI, where 
24:488:40951:27:28:72:486:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutionalization reaches levels that are not normally found outside of the advanced 
24:489:41039:28:28:72:511:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies, the expected remaining duration of the President's rule is never more than his 
24:490:41131:28:27:72:499:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutionally given single term of six years, but the time horizon of the PRI's oligarchic 
24:491:41224:27:28:72:522:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:establishment has been far longer.    In the more general case of undemocratic and entrenched 
24:492:41318:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ruling parties,9 the chief executive may be removed by the party's ruling council or Politburo while 
24:493:41418:27:28:72:522:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the dictatorial rule of the party continues.    As in Saudi Arabia, the monarch often attains and 
24:494:41516:28:28:72:506:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:maintains power only with the backing of other members of the royal family.    For a chief 
24:495:41607:28:27:72:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executive who intends to have his son succeed him in power, the autocratic planning horizon is so 
24:496:41705:27:28:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:long that any confiscation that reduces investment and thus future income and tax collections will 
24:497:41804:28:27:72:542:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not be advantageous.    What is common to all of these cases is the presence of a "ruling group," a 
24:498:41904:27:28:72:525:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:family or party with an indefinitely long life span and thus a longer-run interest in the nation's 
24:499:42003:28:28:72:542:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:long-term economic performance than an individualistic    autocrat would have.    Autocratic ruling 
24:500:42103:28:36:72:503:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:groups usually also impose some constraints on the unilateral decisions of their leaders.10 
24:501:42194:36:10:72:221:170:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
24:502:42224:10:16:108:542:160:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:9  In addition to Mexico, prominent examples include Taiwan and most communist countries (which are not 
24:503:42328:16:19:72:134:144:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:in our sample). 
24:504:42343:19:16:108:528:125:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:10  The chief of such a dictatorial party usually has little chance of success if he attempts to use society's 
24:505:42454:16:12:72:542:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:resources to maintain power in the face of widespread opposition within his party.    The costs of losing power are also 
24:506:42574:12:11:72:542:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:usually lower where autocracy is institutionalized, as the party can offer a deposed leader credible guarantees of a safe, 
24:507:42697:11:0:72:168:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:comfortable retirement. 
25:508:42722:0:27:108:519:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:These considerations lead us to adopt a second measure of tenure for autocracies, the 
25:509:42808:27:28:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration of the ruling group (AUTGROUP).    Whenever one autocrat is succeeded by another 
25:510:42898:28:27:72:538:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocrat belonging to the same "group," the counter variable AUTGROUP continues, rather than 
25:511:42991:27:28:72:530:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:re-starting at one, as AUTDUR does.    As with AUTDUR and DEMDUR, we hypothesize that 
25:512:43077:28:27:72:483:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:far-sighted policies regarding property rights will be associated with higher values of 
25:513:43165:27:28:72:517:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:AUTGROUP, our measure of stability of the ruling group.    In defining groups, our primary 
25:514:43255:28:28:72:533:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:criterion is the peaceful transfer of power.    Except in rare circumstances (such as an overthrow 
25:515:43354:28:27:72:525:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:within a ruling family, as in Oman in 1970), exit via a coup is regarded as a change in group.   
25:516:43451:27:28:72:534:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Information from Europa Yearbook and other sources was used in judging the extent to which a 
25:517:43543:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:new leader represented a sharp break with his predecessor.    Monarchical succession, and transfers 
25:518:43643:27:28:72:543:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of power within strong ruling parties (or revolutionary councils) were coded as occurring within a 
25:519:43741:28:28:72:462:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:given group.    In all, about 30 percent of transfers were judged to be intra-group. 
25:520:43825:28:28:72:75:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
25:521:43825:28:27:72:230:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3.3. Property Rights Measures 
25:522:43854:27:27:108:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There are many ways in which governments can violate -- or fail to protect against private 
25:523:43944:27:28:72:497:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:theft and usurpation -- the property and contract rights of its citizens and subjects: direct 
25:524:44037:28:28:72:500:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expropriation of assets, defaulting on public debt, debasing the currency, prohibiting any 
25:525:44128:28:27:72:503:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transactions other than those at officially established prices, and failing to provide a legal 
25:526:44223:27:28:72:537:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:infrastructure that impartially enforces contracts and adjudicates disputes about property rights.   
25:527:44324:28:28:72:522:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:No one measure can capture all of these aspects of property and contract rights, so we use six 
25:528:44419:28:27:72:537:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:separate variables: the amount of "contract-intensive money" (defined below), indexes from two 
25:529:44514:27:0:72:499:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:firms evaluating risks to foreign investors, a subjective measure of default risk, currency 
26:530:44608:0:27:72:338:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depreciation, and the black market exchange premium. 
26:531:44660:27:28:108:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:"Contract-intensive money" (CIM) is defined as (M2-C)/M2, where M2 is a broad definition 
26:532:44748:28:27:72:542:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of money and C is currency outside banks.    In environments in which third-party enforcement of 
26:533:44845:27:28:72:531:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contracts is reliable and where property rights facilitate pledging of assets as security for loans, 
26:534:44946:28:27:72:538:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:banks and other financial intermediaries will profit from providing retail banking services at low 
26:535:45045:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cost, and sometimes even from paying interest on bank deposits, in order to obtain money that they 
26:536:45143:28:28:72:490:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can lend at higher rates.    If the public can rely on institutional stability and third-party 
26:537:45238:28:27:72:537:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enforcement of contracts, they can be confident that the banks or government will not confiscate 
26:538:45335:27:28:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their deposits.    Thus the rationale for this measure is that those forms of money, such as currency, 
26:539:45438:28:27:72:511:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that rely least on the fulfillment of contractual obligations by others will be preferred when 
26:540:45533:27:28:72:542:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property and contractual rights are insecure, whereas other forms of money are more advantageous 
26:541:45630:28:28:72:538:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for most purposes in environments with secure contract-enforcement and property rights.    Since 
26:542:45727:28:27:72:542:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the non-currency components of M2 are, by definition, held in banks or other financial institutions, 
26:543:45827:27:28:72:532:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:poor contract enforcement and property rights imply that any advantages of using money in the 
26:544:45921:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:form of deposits in financial institutions are small and that there is also the risk that sums deposited 
26:545:46026:27:28:72:535:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will not be recovered.    Thus the poorer contract-enforcement and other institutions in a society, 
26:546:46126:28:28:72:542:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the smaller the proportion of contract-intensive money individuals will hold.    We have found the 
26:547:46225:28:27:72:529:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proportion of contract-intensive money to be a useful and reliable measure in other contexts as 
26:548:46321:27:28:72:106:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well.11 
26:549:46328:28:39:108:525:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For two other measures of property rights, we employ ratings compiled by two private 
26:550:46413:39:10:72:221:112:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
26:551:46443:10:16:108:510:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:11  For a more extensive description of and justification for CIM, and evidence on its relationship to 
26:552:46546:16:0:72:352:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:economic performance, see Clague, Keefer, Knack and Olson (1995). 
27:553:46613:0:27:72:542:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:firms for potential foreign investors.    Though these ratings are subjective, the firms that produced 
27:554:46716:27:28:72:532:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:them for sale had an incentive to make them as accurate as possible, and the fact that they were 
27:555:46813:28:27:72:521:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purchased by investors who would lose from wrong information also adds something to their 
27:556:46903:27:28:72:531:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:credibility.    The International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), published since 1982, covers more 
27:557:46998:28:27:72:533:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than 100 countries.    Business Environmental Risk Intelligence (BERI) has provided ratings for 
27:558:47094:27:28:72:257:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:about 50 countries beginning in 1972. 
27:559:47131:28:28:108:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:From five variables contained in one of these sources and four scored by the other, we 
27:560:47218:28:27:72:542:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:create the two simple additive indices, "ICRG" and "BERI."12  The five variables comprising the 
27:561:47314:27:28:72:511:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ICRG index are "Expropriation Risk," "Risk of Contract Repudiation by the Government," 
27:562:47401:28:27:72:521:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:"Quality of the Bureaucracy," "Corruption in Government," and "Rule of Law."13  Variables 
27:563:47491:27:28:72:543:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:entering the BERI index include "Contract Enforceability," "Nationalization Risk," "Bureaucratic 
27:564:47588:28:28:72:264:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Delays," and "Infrastructure Quality."14 
27:565:47628:28:27:108:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:"Contract Enforceability" by BERI and "Risk of Repudiation of Contracts by Government" 
27:566:47715:27:28:72:519:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by ICRG are measures of how well contracts are enforced.    "Rule of Law" scores reflect the 
27:567:47808:28:27:72:530:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strength of the court system and the degree to which citizens accept the lawmaking powers and 
27:568:47902:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dispute resolution mechanisms of legal institutions, rather than depending on force or other illegal 
27:569:48003:28:40:72:486:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:means to settle claims.15  Definitions of "Corruption in Government," "Quality of the 
27:570:48089:40:11:72:221:194:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
27:571:48119:11:16:108:542:183:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:12  These simple additive scales were found to be highly correlated (r > .99) with alternative scales weighted 
27:572:48230:16:19:72:265:167:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:by factor scores generated from factor analyses. 
27:573:48278:19:16:108:543:148:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:13  The latter 3 measures are scored on a 0-6 scale.    We multiply them by 10/6 to put them on the same 0-10 
27:574:48388:16:19:72:437:132:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:scale as the former 2 variables.    The resulting additive index has a potential range of 0-50. 
27:575:48483:19:16:108:542:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:14  Each variable is scored 0-4, with fractional values possible.    BERI scores are averages from a permanent 
27:576:48594:16:19:72:430:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:panel of experts, while ICRG ratings are evaluated by the staff of Political Risk Services. 
27:577:48685:19:0:108:539:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:15  High scores for "Rule of Law" also indicate "provisions for an orderly succession of power," raising the 
28:578:48795:0:27:72:534:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bureaucracy," "Bureaucratic Delays," and "Transportation and Communication Quality" justify 
28:579:48887:27:28:72:540:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their use as measures of the general efficiency of provision of government services as well as the 
28:580:48986:28:461:72:351:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extent of rent-seeking behavior of government officials.16 
28:581:49044:461:15:72:545:159:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                                                                                                   
28:582:49142:15:12:72:535:144:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:possibility that correlations with regime type might be tautological.    Deleting "Rule of Law" from our ICRG index 
28:583:49258:12:19:72:488:132:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:does not change any results, however, as this alternative index is correlated with the one we use at .998. 
28:584:49364:19:16:108:515:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:16  See Knack and Keefer (1995) for more detailed definitions and discussion of the ICRG and BERI 
28:585:49462:16:11:72:519:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:variables.    Some of these variables may be taken as empirical proxies for Clague's concept of "rule obedience" 
28:586:49574:11:0:72:136:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(Clague, 1993). 
29:587:49591:0:27:108:520:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our fourth measure of property and contract rights is a subjective rating of the risk of 
29:588:49680:27:28:72:515:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:default on sovereign debt.    This "credit rating" variable (CREDIT) can range from 0 to 100 
29:589:49773:28:27:72:534:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(higher values indicate a lower risk of default, but values are not interpretable as probabilities).   
29:590:49876:27:28:72:494:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This measure is an average of evaluations by a panel of international bankers published 
29:591:49964:28:27:72:273:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:semi-annually by Institutional Investor.17 
29:592:50006:27:28:108:534:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our fifth measure is the debasement of the currency as measured by the rate of currency 
29:593:50094:28:28:72:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depreciation (DEPREC), which is equal to (100 + inflation rate)/100.    Inflation (as well as default 
29:594:50196:28:27:72:523:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on the sovereign debt) can be viewed as an indirect method of expropriation, an alternative to 
29:595:50291:27:28:72:213:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:directly expropriating assets. 
29:596:50321:28:27:108:503:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our final measure is the (log of the) black market premium on currency exchange 
29:597:50401:27:28:72:542:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(PREMIUM).    A high black market premium suggests that there are exchange controls and severe 
29:598:50496:28:28:72:534:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:import restrictions.    These controls and restrictions not only limit the types of contracts and the 
29:599:50598:28:27:72:542:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uses of property that are permissible in a country, but also give government officials a wide range 
29:600:50698:27:28:72:524:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of discretionary power through the granting or withholding of licenses and other permissions. 
29:601:50791:28:27:108:516:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Each of the foregoing measures has its own idiosyncrasies, but to the extent they are 
29:602:50877:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uncorrelated, they can be viewed as complementary.    Our empirical findings are not dependent on 
29:603:50974:28:28:72:253:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the use of any one of these measures. 
29:604:51011:28:27:72:193:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3.4. Control Variables  
29:605:51033:27:28:108:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Given the dearth of empirical literature on the determinants of property rights, there are no 
29:606:51127:28:39:72:518:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well-established precedents on model specification.    We include only (the log of) per capita 
29:607:51222:39:10:72:221:112:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
29:608:51252:10:16:108:525:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:17  We use the mean of the two scores assigned each year (in March and September) to a country as the 
29:609:51353:16:0:72:188:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:country's value for that year. 
30:610:51385:0:27:72:542:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income and time variables as regressors accompanying regime type and duration indicators in the 
30:611:51481:27:28:72:236:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regressions reported in the tables. 
30:612:51516:28:27:108:517:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Theoretical accounts of property rights claim that more is spent to define and protect 
30:613:51603:27:28:72:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property rights when the rights themselves become more valuable.    Growth could make them 
30:614:51693:28:27:72:538:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more valuable (Eggertsson, 1990).    Rosenberg and Birdzell (1986, pp. 115-117) have noted that 
30:615:51789:27:28:72:536:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:formal arrangements for protecting property rights, such as judicial systems based on precedent, 
30:616:51886:28:28:72:541:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are not instituted until there is a sufficient volume of transactions to make them practicable.    We 
30:617:51988:28:27:72:528:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can imperfectly control for these effects by including per capita income and aggregate GDP as 
30:618:52082:27:28:72:519:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proxies for the value of assets and volume of transactions.18  One might alternatively posit a 
30:619:52177:28:27:72:527:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:threshold effect, whereby for example a legal system is instituted when the value of assets and 
30:620:52273:27:28:72:541:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:volume of transactions imply that the social benefits of setting up courts exceed the social costs.   
30:621:52375:28:28:72:516:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Casual observation does not support such a view -- even in very small developing countries, 
30:622:52466:28:27:72:536:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increased expenditures on courts would surely pass such a cost-benefit test19  --  and we do not 
30:623:52563:27:158:72:194:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test for threshold effects. 
30:624:52590:158:11:72:221:159:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
30:625:52620:11:16:108:517:148:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:18  Aggregate GDP is generally not a significant determinant of our property rights measures, and has 
30:626:52722:16:11:72:542:132:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:virtually no impact on coefficients for regime type and duration variables.    Thus, regressions reported in tables below 
30:627:52844:11:19:72:185:121:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:do not include this variable. 
30:628:52872:19:16:108:514:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:19  In Egypt, many courts do not operate much during the summer months due to a simple lack of air 
30:629:52971:16:0:72:272:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:conditioning (Washington Post, March 13, 1995). 
31:630:53020:0:27:108:543:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The close historical connection between the emergence of democratic political institutions 
31:631:53111:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the development of property and contract rights poses problems for testing the causal effects of 
31:632:53212:28:27:72:539:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one upon the other.    A consensus is forming on the view that secure property and contract rights 
31:633:53311:27:28:72:527:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are important facilitators of economic growth.    Thus a high level of income in a society today 
31:634:53408:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suggests that there were good property and contract rights in the past.    Given the persistence of the 
31:635:53512:27:28:72:518:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions that sustain property and contract rights, income is also a good predictor of these 
31:636:53609:28:28:72:529:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions.    Moreover, there are many aspects of a political regime that influence growth and 
31:637:53707:28:27:72:500:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hence, over time, the level of income.    These include bureaucratic competence, political 
31:638:53798:27:28:72:521:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:legitimacy, and rule obedience, on the one hand, and susceptibilities to political violence and 
31:639:53894:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extreme inequalities, on the other.    These characteristics also tend to persist.    Thus a high level of 
31:640:54001:27:28:72:538:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income in a society today usually means that there was a well-functioning political regime in the 
31:641:54099:28:28:72:537:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:past, and, because of persistence of these characteristics, it also increases the probability that the 
31:642:54202:28:27:72:307:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current political regime also has these attributes. 
31:643:54253:27:28:108:542:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:What makes our empirical analysis of the effects of political regimes possible is that there 
31:644:54346:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are some independent forces producing changes in political regime.    In particular there have been 
31:645:54446:27:28:72:548:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:wars won by democracies, after which democracies were set up in countries that had lacked them.   
31:646:54544:28:28:72:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:More importantly for our sample, massive decolonization has occurred, as well as other historical 
31:647:54642:28:27:72:370:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:factors that have altered many countries' political institutions. 
31:648:54707:27:28:108:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:But it remains true that current period income contains much information about the current 
31:649:54798:28:28:72:537:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:state of property rights and political regime.    Since our analysis controls for current income and 
31:650:54899:28:27:72:527:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:necessarily employs relatively crude measures of political regimes to investigate the impact of 
31:651:54995:27:0:72:406:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political conditions on property rights, our tests are quite demanding. 
32:652:55068:0:27:108:534:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There are some secular and exogenous developments that may also affect the security of 
32:653:55155:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property and contract rights.    The proportion of contract-intensive money (CIM) may be sensitive 
32:654:55254:28:27:72:504:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to advances in banking technology that lower the costs of intermediation.    For subjective 
32:655:55346:27:28:72:530:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measures that have ceilings on the maximum possible scores, each country might be rated with 
32:656:55439:28:27:72:541:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reference to other countries at a given point in time: mean scores for the world could then remain 
32:657:55538:27:28:72:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constant even with a general improvement over time in the security of property and contract rights 
32:658:55636:28:28:72:528:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:around the world.    To avoid spuriously associating such changes, or nonchanges, with regime 
32:659:55730:28:27:72:515:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:type and duration, time (equal to the current year minus 1969) is included as an explanatory 
32:660:55823:27:28:72:124:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variable.20 
32:661:55834:28:27:108:505:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The proportion of contract-intensive money (CIM) might seem likely to be greatly 
32:662:55915:27:28:72:522:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:influenced by inflation and interest rates (Clague et al., 1995).    In fact, the inclusion of these 
32:663:56016:28:28:72:511:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables has only a minute impact on the coefficients for regime type and duration in CIM 
32:664:56107:28:27:72:432:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equations.    They are accordingly not included in the results reported here. 
32:665:56184:27:28:108:538:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Inequalities in income and wealth and other social cleavages based on ethnicity, religion, 
32:666:56275:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or region may generate social conflict endangering individual rights.    Similarly, culture, religion, 
32:667:56378:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and colonial heritage may influence property and contractual rights.    We do not include measures 
32:668:56477:28:28:72:528:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of these as regressors, however.    For our sample, the coverage of available data over time and 
32:669:56574:28:27:72:539:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:across countries on inequality and other social cleavages is inadequate.    Existing theories do not 
32:670:56675:27:28:72:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:account for the differences in the apparent effects of cultural variables across regions or over time: 
32:671:56778:28:26:72:539:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:why did British influences lead to strong property rights regimes only in some former colonies?   
32:672:56876:26:14:72:221:125:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
32:673:56906:14:23:108:543:111:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f8:20  Results using the log of time were very similar.    In fixed effects regressions, we use 
32:674:56998:23:0:72:228:88:10:g_d0_f8:10:Times New Roman:year dummies instead of time. 
33:675:57029:0:27:72:503:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Why was "Confucianism" until relatively recently thought to be unfavorable to economic 
33:676:57116:27:28:72:533:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development?    Also, since others have used cultural and heritage indicators to explain political 
33:677:57215:28:27:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:freedoms (Bhalla, 1994; Abrams and Lewis, 1993), inclusion of these variables as regressors along 
33:678:57313:27:28:72:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with regime type would potentially confound tests of the latter's impact on property rights.    In any 
33:679:57416:28:27:72:532:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:event, to the extent that inequality, other social cleavages, culture, and colonial heritage remain 
33:680:57516:27:28:72:514:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constant over time, their effects are captured by country intercepts in our fixed effects tests. 
33:681:57612:28:28:72:396:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:4. Property and Contract Rights in Different Types of Regimes 
33:682:57673:28:27:108:536:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Some recent and sophisticated statistical studies on postwar data have supported Lipset's 
33:683:57763:27:28:72:542:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1959) thesis that high incomes are conducive to the emergence and survival of democracy (Barro, 
33:684:57860:28:27:72:540:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1994; Burkhart and Lewis-Beck, 1994; Helliwell, 1994).    By contrast, there is no clear tendency 
33:685:57958:27:28:72:529:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that has yet emerged from studies of the effects of democracy on economic performance.    The 
33:686:58052:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:three studies just cited conclude that democracy has either no influence or a negative influence on 
33:687:58152:28:27:72:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subsequent growth.    A recent study by Bhalla (1994), on the other hand, finds a positive effect of 
33:688:58253:27:28:72:535:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political rights on growth.21  Consistent with Bhalla's results is evidence from earlier periods of 
33:689:58353:28:27:72:506:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:history suggesting that representative or at least non-absolutist government is favorable to 
33:690:58446:27:28:72:353:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic performance (e.g., de Long and Shleifer, 1992). 
33:691:58502:28:28:108:492:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We focus here on one of the proposed links between regime type and economic 
33:692:58578:28:27:72:509:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance: the hypothesis that more democratic regimes will better protect property and 
33:693:58668:27:32:72:529:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract rights.    We have elsewhere documented the impact of property and contract rights on 
33:694:58763:32:11:72:221:147:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
33:695:58793:11:16:108:541:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:21  The difference in results between Bhalla and the other three studies appears to relate mainly to the choice 
33:696:58905:16:11:72:542:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:of other independent variables and instruments for democracy.    We focus on these four studies because they make use 
33:697:59023:11:12:72:542:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:of the most recent data on a large number of countries and because they pay careful attention to endogeneity problems, 
33:698:59142:12:11:72:534:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:mainly through the use of instrumental and lagged variables.    The earlier literature is also thoroughly inconclusive 
33:699:59261:11:0:72:508:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:regarding the effects of democracy on growth.    See, for examples, the review in Brunetti and Weder (1993). 
34:700:59371:0:27:72:438:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:investment and growth rates (Clague et al., 1995; Knack and Keefer, 1995). 
34:701:59445:27:28:108:512:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The effects of regime type -- and of regime duration -- were first tested with pooled 
34:702:59529:28:27:72:542:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time-series cross-sectional regressions, using country-years as units of analysis.    Results of these 
34:703:59631:27:28:72:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tests were very supportive of the hypotheses.22  Errors from these regressions, however, were 
34:704:59725:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:highly autocorrelated, indicating that it is inappropriate to treat yearly observations of a country as 
34:705:59829:27:28:72:136:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:independent. 
34:706:59841:28:28:108:538:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In a purely cross-sectional design, on the other hand, difficulties arise in assigning values 
34:707:59935:28:27:72:510:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for regime type for countries moving across categories one or more times over the period.   
34:708:60027:27:28:72:524:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Averaging the different regime types -- i.e., treating a country shifting from type II to type IV 
34:709:60124:28:27:72:527:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:halfway through the period identically to one remaining a category III over the entire period -- 
34:710:60220:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:would unjustifiably impose cardinality on our regime type index as well as fail to make use of 
34:711:60315:28:28:72:228:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:important variations in the data. 
34:712:60348:28:27:108:497:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We adopted two alternative solutions.    First, we created an observation for each 
34:713:60431:27:28:72:532:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country-regime, i.e. for each spell of democracy (for regressions with DEMDUR), and for each 
34:714:60524:28:27:72:535:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period that a particular autocrat rules (for AUTDUR).23  With country-regime units of analysis, 
34:715:60620:27:28:72:533:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we retained some over-time variation across regime types within countries, but suffered far less 
34:716:60717:28:28:72:510:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:serious autocorrelation problems (as confirmed by Durbin-Watson statistics).    Second, we 
34:717:60808:28:27:72:515:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:retained country-year units of analysis but incorporated fixed country and/or regime effects, 
34:718:60902:27:20:72:489:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:thereby arguably removing the most important sources of possible autocorrelation and 
34:719:60987:20:11:72:221:159:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
34:720:61017:11:23:108:292:148:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:22  Results available on request from authors. 
34:721:61063:23:16:108:532:125:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:23  Thus, Egypt in 1954-1969, 1970-80, and 1981-1990 (1990 is the last year for our regimes and income 
34:722:61166:16:12:72:534:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:data) constitute three separate observations in Table 1 and in the AUTDUR panel of Table 3.    In the AUTGROUP 
34:723:61277:12:11:72:532:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:panel of Table 3, Egypt 1954-90 is one observation as Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak are all judged to be of the same 
34:724:61391:11:0:72:107:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:"group." 
35:725:61401:0:27:72:164:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:heteroskedasticity. 
35:726:61420:27:28:108:513:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 1 presents cross-sectional regressions, using country-regime units of analysis, 
35:727:61506:28:27:72:543:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:examining the effects of regime type on property rights (mean values over the period), controlling 
35:728:61605:27:28:72:530:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for mean per capita income and mean time over the period the country-regime lasts.24  In each 
35:729:61699:28:27:72:529:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:case we find democracies outperforming autocracies, even controlling for the higher per capita 
35:730:61794:27:28:72:539:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incomes prevailing in most democracies.    The Autocracy coefficient has the expected sign in all 
35:731:61892:28:28:72:495:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:six cases: negative for CIM, ICRG, BERI, and CREDIT, and positive for DEPREC and 
35:732:61973:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:PREMIUM.    These coefficients are highly significant for two of these property rights variables.   
35:733:62073:27:28:72:541:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Higher incomes are associated with significantly better scores on each of the dependent variables 
35:734:62171:28:27:72:527:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with the exception of DEPREC.    The latter, along with PREMIUM and CIM, all significantly 
35:735:62262:27:28:72:524:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increase with time, controlling for income and regime type.    The time trend in CIM probably 
35:736:62356:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reflects secular improvements in banking technology.    Negative coefficients for time on CREDIT 
35:737:62453:28:27:72:539:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and (in some specifications) BERI suggest that scores for these variables reflect only the relative 
35:738:62553:27:170:72:297:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:positions of countries at a single point in time. 
35:739:62602:170:11:72:221:147:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:

35:741:62736:16:11:72:521:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:country-regime, we delete time and income data for the corresponding years.    Calculating mean time and mean 
35:742:62846:11:12:72:533:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:income for Franco's regime using all available data from the 1930s onward would yield means far below those that 
35:743:62959:12:11:72:531:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:actually apply to (for example) the 1972-90 period covered by BERI.    Then, income and time would underpredict 
35:744:63071:11:0:72:450:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:BERI, and positive BERI residuals would be spuriously associated with a high duration value. 
36:745:63165:0:27:108:542:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The finding that democracies as a group outperform autocracies in protecting property and 
36:746:63254:27:28:72:535:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contractual rights does not, if the arguments at the beginning of this article are right, necessarily 
36:747:63356:28:27:72:509:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:imply that the short- or medium-term effects of    shift from autocracy to democracy are an 
36:748:63447:27:28:72:542:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:improvement in performance.    To explore this issue, we shift to country-year units of analysis, to 
36:749:63547:28:27:72:532:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exploit the time-series variation in the data, and control for fixed country-specific effects.    The 
36:750:63649:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocracy coefficient under this approach is influenced only by over-time variation in regime type 
36:751:63748:28:28:72:519:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and property rights.    Given the length of our sample period (9 to 22 years, depending on the 
36:752:63843:28:27:72:528:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dependent variable), this test is designed to reveal short- or medium-term effects of changes in 
36:753:63939:27:28:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regime type on our property rights variables.    Estimates from country-regime regressions in Table 
36:754:64039:28:27:72:519:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1 are heavily influenced by democracies of long standing, in Western Europe and among the 
36:755:64129:27:28:72:528:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:English-speaking nations.    No nation remaining a democracy (or an autocracy) over the entire 
36:756:64224:28:28:72:542:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sample period influences the autocracy coefficients in Table 2; those estimates are based solely on 
36:757:64323:28:27:72:529:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:over-time variation within countries.    Results for the autocracy dummy in Table 2 are thus the 
36:758:64420:27:28:72:514:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:product of a relatively small number of countries with inter-regime shifts during the sample 
36:759:64513:28:27:72:116:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period.25 
36:760:64522:27:28:108:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The results summarized in Table 2 strongly indicate that new democracies tend to face 
36:761:64608:28:28:72:532:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:many of the difficulties, outlined earlier in the paper, that can render property rights less secure 
36:762:64709:28:27:72:529:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than in a country ruled by a secure autocrat.    Autocracy is associated with significantly higher 
36:763:64808:27:28:72:539:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CIM and BERI values, and significantly lower inflation (coefficients on the other three variables 
36:764:64906:28:39:72:532:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are not significant).    Many of the benefits of democracy seem to accrue only over a substantial

36:766:65034:10:16:108:536:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:25  During our sample period eight countries shifted from autocracy to democracy, two shifted in the other 
36:767:65141:16:0:72:341:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:direction, and eleven more experienced multiple shifts (e.g. Chile). 
37:768:65211:0:27:72:535:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period of time, which may exceed the duration of most new democracies installed in our sample 
37:769:65305:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period.    Most importantly, longstanding democracies, unlike all other regimes, have a predictable 
37:770:65405:28:27:72:532:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:succession of power.    They also tend to have more effective checks on executive power, in the 
37:771:65501:27:28:72:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:form of independent legislatures, central banks, and judiciaries, and this makes it more difficult for 
37:772:65604:28:27:72:513:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:any leader to abridge property or contract rights.26  In new democracies such as Argentina, 
37:773:65696:27:28:72:535:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Nigeria (abortively), and Pakistan, by contrast, individuals cannot enter into long-term contracts 
37:774:65795:28:28:72:519:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:secure in the knowledge that successions will be orderly and legal, and that a chief executive 
37:775:65890:28:370:72:367:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cannot preempt the powers of other branches of government. 
37:776:65948:370:10:72:221:112:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
37:777:65978:10:16:108:542:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:26  In the U.S., the role of the Supreme Court as a check on unconstitutional actions of the Congress was not 
37:778:66088:16:0:72:449:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:established, nor recognized, until Marbury v. Madison, decided during Jefferson's presidency. 
38:779:66183:0:27:108:537:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In addition to the uncertainty and instability pervading new democracies generally, other 
38:780:66273:27:28:72:508:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:factors potentially contribute to the positive Autocracy coefficients in Table 2.    First, new 
38:781:66369:28:27:72:532:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies in recent years are hardly a random sample of all democracies.    These "marginal" 
38:782:66464:27:28:72:528:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies exhibit a substantially worse income distribution, more ethnic tensions, and more 
38:783:66558:28:27:72:531:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political violence than exhibited by countries remaining democracies throughout the 1970s and 
38:784:66652:27:28:72:537:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:80s.    Prevailing social conditions often subject these new democracies to extraordinary populist 
38:785:66751:28:28:72:516:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pressures, which autocrats in these same countries were (sometimes) better able to resist.27  
38:786:66845:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second, democracies are more likely to replace successful autocracies.    Autocracies almost never 
38:787:66944:27:28:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:replace democracies unless the latter are performing poorly -- when their legitimacy in the eyes of 
38:788:67043:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the public is especially low.    Conversely, with the exception of Argentina, autocrats giving way to 
38:789:67145:27:28:72:537:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:new democratic regimes during our sample period apparently chose to do so when the economic 
38:790:67237:28:28:72:539:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:climate was favorable for a smooth transition to democracy (as in Chile, Uruguay, and Turkey).   
38:791:67334:28:27:72:523:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Given these selection processes, the autocracy coefficient in fixed-effects tests is conceivably 
38:792:67430:27:28:72:494:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capturing a regression-to-the-mean effect: autocrats succeeding democracies have more 
38:793:67516:28:27:72:532:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunity to improve the policy climate than do leaders of democracies succeeding autocrats.

38:795:67610:28:87:72:283:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5. Property Rights and Regime Duration 
38:796:67648:87:11:72:221:147:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
38:797:67678:11:16:108:542:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:27  Keefer and Knack (1995) find that income distribution is a more important determinant of property rights 
38:798:67787:16:11:72:525:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:and risk of loan defaults in democracies than in autocracies.    Persson and Tabellini (1994) find that inequality is 
38:799:67905:11:12:72:534:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:harmful to growth, particularly in democracies.   One could alternatively interpret a significant interaction between 
38:800:68023:12:11:72:529:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:democracy and inequality in growth equations as implying that democracy is beneficial to growth where and only 
38:801:68134:11:0:72:325:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:where there exists a suitably egalitarian distribution of income. 
39:802:68201:0:27:108:543:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For the reasons set out at the beginning of this paper, we hypothesize that the length of time 
39:803:68296:27:28:72:490:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a democratic system has survived and the time horizons of each autocrat are important 
39:804:68382:28:27:72:520:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:determinants of the effects of regime type on property and contract rights.    If these temporal 
39:805:68479:27:28:72:492:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considerations are as important as we expect them to be, any comparisons of economic 
39:806:68564:28:27:72:536:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance under autocracy and democracy that leave them out are likely to be mis-specified.   
39:807:68660:27:28:72:540:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The same is true for the comparisons of property and contract rights under differing regime types 
39:808:68757:28:28:72:192:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in the preceding section. 
39:809:68782:28:27:108:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In this section, we test our hypotheses about how duration of regime affects the security of 
39:810:68875:27:28:72:542:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property and contract rights in each type of regime.    That is, we test our hypothesis that autocrats 
39:811:68978:28:27:72:528:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with longer duration will be associated with better property and contract rights than short-term 
39:812:69075:27:28:72:543:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocrats, and our hypothesis that the longer a democratic system has lasted the better these rights 
39:813:69176:28:28:72:111:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will be. 
39:814:69184:28:27:108:547:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 3 regressions test for the impact of regime duration on the security of property rights.   
39:815:69281:27:28:72:538:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As with Table 1, cross-sectional regressions using country-regime units are reported in Table 3.   
39:816:69380:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Control variables include mean income and time.    Autocracies and democracies are separated for 
39:817:69477:27:28:72:362:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these tests, as duration is defined differently for each group. 
39:818:69540:28:28:108:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The coefficient for duration of autocrats (AUTDUR) -- specifically, the log of duration the 
39:819:69631:28:27:72:503:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:year the regime ends -- has the expected sign in every case in Table 3, with three of these 
39:820:69722:27:28:72:541:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:statistically significant at .05 or better.    Results are similar for AUTGROUP, with better policies 
39:821:69824:28:28:72:534:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:associated with higher duration of the ruling group in every case, and significant associations in 
39:822:69923:28:27:72:130:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:three cases. 
39:823:69935:27:0:108:528:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Coefficients for the duration of democratic regimes (DEMDUR) are all in the expected 
40:824:70022:0:27:72:541:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:direction, with three significant at the .05 level.    These generally favorable results on DEMDUR 
40:825:70121:27:28:72:535:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are consistent with the view that new democracies cannot offer investors the same predictability 
40:826:70217:28:27:72:475:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(of succession) and credibility (of policy) offered by the longstanding democracies. 
40:827:70301:27:28:108:539:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This emphasis on the importance of the duration of democratic systems does not apply to 
40:828:70389:28:27:72:520:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the tenure of particular leaders of democracies.    While policy making in democracies is not   
40:829:70484:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:immune to the short-term needs of chief executives with limited time horizons, there are far more 
40:830:70582:28:28:72:516:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:powerful checks on the ability of chief executives in democracies, compared to autocrats, to 
40:831:70675:28:27:72:354:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expropriate assets, to renege on debts, and to print money. 
40:832:70734:27:28:108:542:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The results in Table 3 support the view that the duration of democracy itself matters more 
40:833:70825:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than the time in power of chief executives in democracies.    For these tests, we define democratic 
40:834:70925:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:leader regimes similarly to autocratic regimes: each unit of analysis corresponds to the time in 
40:835:71021:28:28:72:542:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power of a chief executive.    For all six dependent variables, the effect of a one-year increase in the 
40:836:71126:28:27:72:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration of a democratic leader (DEXDUR) has a smaller impact (see fourth panel of Table 3) than 
40:837:71223:27:28:72:398:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an identical increase in the duration of democracy (see third panel). 
40:838:71292:28:27:108:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our theory also suggests that the impact of DEXDUR should be weaker than the impact of 
40:839:71379:27:28:72:527:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:AUTDUR -- the duration of autocratic leaders.    The estimated impacts of leader duration are   
40:840:71474:28:28:72:524:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:similar, however, for autocrats and for democratic chief executives in the cross-sectional tests 
40:841:71571:28:27:72:543:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reported in Table 3.    The results from fixed-effects models reported below, on the other hand, are 
40:842:71672:27:28:72:194:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supportive of our theory. 
40:843:71697:28:28:108:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 4 illustrates the economic significance of results in Table 3 by substituting values for 
40:844:71791:28:27:72:543:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time, income and duration into the regressions to determine the predicted values of property rights 
40:845:71891:27:0:72:543:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicators.    The values in each cell correspond to predicted values of the property rights variables 
41:846:71996:0:27:72:541:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with time = 11 (i.e., 1980) and per capita income of $2500.    Within each row, duration increases 
41:847:72095:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from 2 to 10 to 25.    For each dependent variable, there are four rows, corresponding to autocratic 
41:848:72196:28:27:72:518:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:leaders, autocrat "groups," democratic leaders, and democratic regimes.    The most dramatic 
41:849:72289:27:28:72:538:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:improvements associated with increasing duration occur for the democratic regimes, particularly 
41:850:72385:28:27:72:520:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for ICRG, DEPREC, and PREMIUM.    Focusing on the column for which duration = 2, new 
41:851:72470:27:28:72:519:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocrats have "better" values than new democracies on four of the six dependent variables.   
41:852:72564:28:28:72:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, democratic regimes lasting 25 years outscore autocrats of 25 years duration on four out 
41:853:72661:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of six measures.    While many democracies surpass 25 years in duration, there is an upper limit to 
41:854:72761:27:28:72:508:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:how long an individual autocrat can last.    These results are consistent with the theory that 
41:855:72856:28:27:72:394:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:longstanding democracies provide the most secure property rights. 
41:856:72921:27:28:108:542:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We further explore the effects of duration variables using fixed-effects regressions.    With 
41:857:73015:28:28:72:541:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the cross-sectional design of Table 3 regressions, we cannot rule out unobserved country-specific 
41:858:73113:28:27:72:542:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables that may be responsible for both high rates of leadership turnover and insecure property 
41:859:73212:27:28:72:530:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and contractual rights.    By including country dummies in regressions using the full time series 
41:860:73310:28:27:72:538:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:available, we can examine the influence of variations in the duration of leaders over time, within 
41:861:73409:27:28:72:286:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries, on the property rights variables.28 
41:862:73455:28:28:108:539:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In five out of six cases (all except CREDIT), increases in autocratic duration (AUTDUR) 
41:863:73543:28:36:72:539:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are associated with highly significant improvements in our property and contract rights measures 
41:864:73640:36:11:72:221:170:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
41:865:73670:11:16:108:532:159:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:28  Results on the log of autocrat duration are generally weaker when regime dummies are substituted for 
41:866:73775:16:11:72:542:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:country dummies.    Regime effects are highly correlated within countries, and add very little explanatory power over 
41:867:73893:11:12:72:542:132:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the country intercepts.    The major difference between the two models is that within a regime (as opposed to a country) 
41:868:74014:12:11:72:537:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:over time, duration always increases -- when a new autocrat comes into power, duration re-starts at 1.    As time and 
41:869:74131:11:12:72:515:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(usually) income also increase each year, there are potentially serious multicollinearity problems using regime 
41:870:74243:12:11:72:521:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:dummies.    (Using time, as opposed to year dummies, and duration, as opposed to its log, would in fact result in 
41:871:74357:11:0:72:155:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:perfect collinearity.) 
42:872:74381:0:27:72:502:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:within countries (Table 5, first panel).    By contrast, increases in the duration of the chief 
42:873:74477:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executive's leadership in democracies (DEXDUR) are associated with significant improvement in 
42:874:74571:28:27:72:542:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only one of the six (CREDIT), with DEXDUR's coefficient taking on the wrong sign in four cases 
42:875:74666:27:28:72:533:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(see third panel of Table 5).    Table 6 presents marginal effects for duration values as estimated 
42:876:74766:28:464:72:533:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from Table 5 regressions, for changes in duration from 2 to 10 years, and from 10 to 25 years.29 
42:877:74862:464:11:72:221:101:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
42:878:74892:11:0:108:446:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:29  We do not calculate predicted values because of the differing country intercepts. 
43:879:74979:0:27:108:527:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:By pooling the autocratic and democratic observations, and constructing an interaction 
43:880:75066:27:28:72:538:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:term equal to the autocracy dummy multiplied by the duration of the chief executive, we can test 
43:881:75162:28:27:72:522:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whether differences between autocracies and democracies in the impact of leader duration on 
43:882:75254:27:28:72:534:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property rights are statistically significant.    Coefficients on these interaction terms indicate that 
43:883:75358:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more time in power for an autocrat improves property and contract rights more than does a longer 
43:884:75455:27:28:72:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time in office for a democratic leader; the interactions are highly significant for CIM and the BERI 
43:885:75556:28:28:72:537:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:index, and significant at .05 or .06 levels for ICRG, DEPREC, and PREMIUM.30  These results 
43:886:75648:28:27:72:515:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strongly support the theory that the duration of leaders affects property and contact rights in 
43:887:75744:27:28:72:244:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocracies but not in democracies. 
43:888:75779:28:27:108:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our theory would also predict that the time in power of "almost" autocrats -- category II in 
43:889:75871:27:28:72:522:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:our classification -- would matter less than the duration of less-constrained autocrats (in most 
43:890:75967:28:28:72:527:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cases, the presence of a partially effective legislature is what differentiates the category I from 
43:891:76067:28:27:72:516:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:category II leaders).    Results from tests using Table 5 specifications, but with autocrats and 
43:892:76164:27:28:72:503:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:almost autocrats separated, strongly support this prediction.    For the sample of relatively 
43:893:76258:28:27:72:534:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unconstrained autocrats, the AUTDUR coefficient is significant in all five cases in which it was 
43:894:76354:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant in the first panel of Table 5; in most cases the coefficient is larger in absolute value (see 
43:895:76460:28:28:72:538:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 7).    For the relatively constrained autocrats, coefficients attain the right sign only in CIM, 
43:896:76563:28:105:72:367:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:BERI, and PREMIUM equations, with only CIM significant. 
43:897:76618:105:11:72:221:101:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
43:898:76648:11:0:108:351:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:30  Results not shown in tables, but are available on request. 
44:899:76712:0:27:108:536:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Property rights appear to deteriorate with increasing life of democratic systems (Table 5, 
44:900:76803:27:28:72:540:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fourth panel).    The unexpected results here on the duration of democracy are largely the product 
44:901:76902:28:27:72:532:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of a few long-lasting democracies which were replaced by reform-minded autocracies, but then 
44:902:76995:27:28:72:516:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:returned to democracy during our sample period.    Chile, Uruguay, and Turkey are the most 
44:903:77086:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:notable examples of this phenomenon.    For each of these countries, a few high DEMDUR values 
44:904:77180:27:28:72:515:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are coupled with poor property rights at the outset of our sample period, and a few very low 
44:905:77273:28:28:72:533:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:DEMDUR values are coupled with much improved property rights at the end of the period.    In 
44:906:77366:28:27:72:507:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these cases, the improvements in property rights and policies over the period are primarily 
44:907:77458:27:28:72:518:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attributable to the reform-minded autocratic regimes.    These countries heavily influence the 
44:908:77553:28:27:72:537:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coefficient: for DEMDUR for the sample as a whole, despite the fact that the inverse correlation 
44:909:77650:27:28:72:507:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between DEMDUR and property rights measures within these countries is produced by an 
44:910:77735:28:28:72:530:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interruption of democracy by autocratic rule.    Deleting these three regime-switching countries 
44:911:77832:28:27:72:522:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dramatically weakens the perverse findings for DEMDUR in the CIM and BERI equations in 
44:912:77919:27:28:72:519:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 5.    A similar weakening of those findings is obtained by using a fixed-effects test that 
44:913:78016:28:27:72:523:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:substitutes regime dummies for country dummies.31  The Table 5 coefficients on DEMDUR, 
44:914:78103:27:28:72:513:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:therefore, do not reflect an actual deterioration in property and contract rights when a given 
44:915:78197:28:28:72:225:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democratic regime lasts longer.

44:917:78228:28:54:72:255:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:6. Endogeneity of Regime Duration 
44:918:78261:54:11:72:221:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
44:919:78291:11:16:108:535:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:31  Recall that within a democratic regime, DEMDUR always increases: DEMDUR reverts to a value of 1 
44:920:78391:16:11:72:524:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:only when a new democratic regime replaces a non-democratic regime.    Interruptions in democracy by spells of 
44:921:78502:11:0:72:475:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:autocratic rule thus cannot influence the DEMDUR coefficient when regime intercepts are included. 
45:922:78601:0:27:108:524:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The time in power of autocrats is conceivably endogenous to economic performance.   
45:923:78685:27:28:72:521:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Previous studies have found coup probabilities to be negatively related to recent growth rates 
45:924:78780:28:27:72:525:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Alesina et al., 1993; Londregan and Poole, 1991)32 and income levels (Londregan and Poole, 
45:925:78871:27:28:72:503:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1991).    The coefficient of AUTDUR could be biased upwards if property rights improve 
45:926:78958:28:27:72:522:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic performance, which in turn improves an autocrat's survival probability and thereby 
45:927:79049:27:28:72:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increases AUTDUR.    Another possibility is that increases in income add to autocrat duration and 
45:928:79147:28:28:72:529:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:improve property rights, creating a spurious association between the latter two variables.    Our 
45:929:79245:28:27:72:520:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regressions control for current income levels, however.    In specifications not reported in our 
45:930:79342:27:28:72:518:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tables, AUTDUR coefficients are found to be unaffected by the inclusion of growth over the 
45:931:79433:28:27:72:276:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:previous year as an additional regressor.33 
45:932:79476:27:28:108:539:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:If autocratic leaders behave in the same way as do governmental leaders in the Grossman 
45:933:79564:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Noh model, property rights could influence AUTDUR independently of the impact of property 
45:934:79657:28:27:72:522:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights on economic performance.    Though in our model higher rent extraction by an autocrat 
45:935:79750:27:28:72:534:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provides more resources to maintain his hold on power, on the alternative interpretation a lower 
45:936:79847:28:27:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extraction of rent from the populace would improve an autocrat's survival probability directly, and 
45:937:79947:27:28:72:391:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:thus generate a reverse causation from property rights to duration. 
45:938:80014:28:28:108:507:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:If such reverse causation were driving our results, we would expect duration in the 
45:939:80098:28:27:72:529:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:following period to explain current property rights better than duration in the previous period.   
45:940:80197:27:20:72:535:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We introduced one-year lags and, alternatively, one-year leads of duration into our fixed-effects 
45:941:80295:20:11:72:221:159:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
45:942:80325:11:16:108:502:148:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:32  Alesina et al. (1993) find, however, that the probability of government changes and of "major" 
45:943:80424:16:11:72:511:132:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:government changes (both of which include coups as one type of government change) is unaffected by recent 
45:944:80529:11:19:72:168:121:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:economic performance. 
45:945:80550:19:16:108:526:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:33  Growth in most cases is not a significant predictor of property rights.    These results are available on 
45:946:80660:16:0:72:105:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:request. 
46:947:80670:0:27:72:535:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regressions of property rights on autocrat duration.    Neither leads nor lags performed as well as 
46:948:80770:27:28:72:513:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contemporaneous duration, although differences were not dramatic.    Neither lags nor leads 
46:949:80862:28:27:72:538:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:clearly performed better than the other one, either.    These findings offer no support for the view 
46:950:80963:27:28:72:349:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that our results are primarily capturing reverse causation. 
46:951:81022:28:27:108:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A second piece of evidence against reverse causation is that the coefficient on AUTDUR in 
46:952:81111:27:28:72:543:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:most cases exceeds the coefficient on DEXDUR, the duration of democratic leaders.    A plausible 
46:953:81208:28:28:72:496:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assumption is that the time in power of chief executives in democracies, as compared to 
46:954:81296:28:27:72:519:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocracies, is more sensitive to their choice of policies: indeed, this sensitivity to short-term 
46:955:81395:27:28:72:530:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:electoral pressures is commonly cited as a disadvantage of democracy.    Thus, the endogeneity 
46:956:81490:28:27:72:513:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:objection outlined above should apply as strongly, or more strongly, to the time in office of 
46:957:81584:27:28:72:533:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democratic leaders.    Therefore, if reverse causation from property rights to time in power were 
46:958:81682:28:28:72:498:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the primary force driving our results, coefficients for DEXDUR should exceed those for 
46:959:81769:28:27:72:500:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:AUTDUR.    For five of the six dependent variables in Table 5, however, coefficients for 
46:960:81858:27:28:72:509:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:DEXDUR and AUTDUR indicate a stronger link between duration and property rights for 
46:961:81942:28:27:72:513:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocratic leaders than for democratic leaders, as reported in more detail above.    Again, no 
46:962:82037:27:28:72:265:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:evidence for reverse causation is found. 
46:963:82077:28:28:108:522:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, we also attempted to correct for endogeneity by instrumenting for AUTDUR, 
46:964:82160:28:27:72:505:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:despite our skepticism concerning the appropriateness of available instruments.    The two 
46:965:82251:27:67:72:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instruments used were age of the autocrat at the time of accession,34 and completed duration of the 
46:966:82350:67:10:72:221:112:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
46:967:82380:10:16:108:542:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:34  Age is a highly imperfect measure of the time horizons relevant to policy choices by autocrats, for reasons 
46:968:82492:16:0:72:192:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:discussed earlier in the paper. 
47:969:82525:0:27:72:518:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:previous autocrat.35  As neither of these instruments varies by year, we use them only in the 
47:970:82619:27:28:72:536:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country-regime regressions of property rights on AUTDUR.    Results using instrumented values 
47:971:82713:28:27:72:519:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of AUTDUR were mixed.    Recall that in Table 3 AUTDUR had the predicted sign in all six 
47:972:82802:27:28:72:532:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regressions.    Coefficients for instrumented values of AUTDUR are greater in absolute value in 
47:973:82898:28:27:72:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:four of these six cases, including each of the three cases (ICRG, CREDIT, and DEPREC) in which 
47:974:82993:27:28:72:542:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:AUTDUR was significant in Table 3.    Only in the case of DEPREC -- and of CIM, which reverses 
47:975:83087:28:28:72:539:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sign -- is the instrumented value of AUTDUR statistically significant, however.    In all six cases, 
47:976:83187:28:27:72:533:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:standard errors are several times higher than in Table 3, due in part to reductions in sample size 
47:977:83286:27:28:72:529:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attributable to missing data on the instruments, but primarily to the relatively poor explanatory 
47:978:83384:28:28:72:197:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power of the instruments. 
47:979:83409:28:27:72:75:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
47:980:83409:27:28:72:225:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:7. Heterogeneity of Autocrats 
47:981:83438:28:27:108:531:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our results on AUTDUR are conceivably an artifact of omitted-variable bias associated 
47:982:83524:27:28:72:539:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with heterogeneity (sample selection) of autocrats.    As a simple example, suppose that autocrats 
47:983:83622:28:27:72:542:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attaining power come in two types, "skilled" and "unskilled," with equal numbers in each group.   
47:984:83720:27:28:72:543:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Assume further that for each group, there is a constant hazard of deposition by coup in each period, 
47:985:83821:28:28:72:531:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and that this constant rate is substantially higher for the unskilled group, as depicted by the two 
47:986:83921:28:27:72:543:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:horizontal lines of Figure 1.    Autocrats know to which group they belong, and perceive a constant 
47:987:84021:27:32:72:542:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:low or high hazard rate over time, depending on whether they are skilled or unskilled.    The overall 
47:988:84123:32:11:72:221:147:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
47:989:84153:11:16:108:542:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:35  Where there was no previous autocrat, as in the newly-independent African nations, we used the average 
47:990:84260:16:11:72:535:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:of completed duration for the initial autocrats of "similar" countries.    For example, we used the average completed 
47:991:84378:11:12:72:542:109:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:duration of all other initial autocrats in formerly-British African colonies as the instrument for AUTDUR for Uganda's 
47:992:84497:12:11:72:532:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:first autocrat.    Age was highly significant (t = 4.70) but previous duration only marginally significant (t = 1.64) in 
47:993:84618:11:0:72:254:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:explaining AUTDUR.    The R2 was only .12. 
48:994:84661:0:27:72:523:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hazard rate for any given value of duration will be a weighted average of the rates for the two 
48:995:84757:27:28:72:541:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:separate groups.    In t = 1, the overall hazard will be exactly halfway between that for each of the 
48:996:84859:28:27:72:527:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:two groups, since they are represented in equal numbers at t = 1.    After that time, however, as 
48:997:84957:27:28:72:541:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:higher attrition in the unskilled group implies that the ratio of skilled to unskilled leaders rises, in 
48:998:85062:28:27:72:536:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:each subsequent year the weighted average rate of hazard will be increasingly close to the lower 
48:999:85159:27:28:72:227:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hazard rate of the skilled group. 
48:1000:85192:28:28:108:535:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In observing only the overall hazard rate, we attribute increasing horizons to leaders that 
48:1001:85284:28:27:72:540:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:survive longer in power, and hypothesize an improvement in property rights.    Yet, each autocrat 
48:1002:85382:27:28:72:543:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perceives only one of the two constant hazard rates, and thus does not feel more secure in power as 
48:1003:85481:28:27:72:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:his time in power lengthens.    A consequence of heterogeneity is that it potentially makes tenure to 
48:1004:85583:27:28:72:514:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:date an inappropriate proxy for time horizons.    Any correlation between time in power and 
48:1005:85675:28:28:72:543:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property rights may be spurious if duration has little or no relationship to the "true" time horizons 
48:1006:85777:28:27:72:186:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perceived by autocrats. 
48:1007:85800:27:28:108:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We believe the decline in hazard rates as the time in power of an autocrat lengthens is more 
48:1008:85893:28:27:72:530:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than an artifact of sample selection.    First, the concept of consolidation of power is difficult to 
48:1009:85995:27:28:72:532:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:argue against.    Second, "skill" is only one of many factors determining who stays in power.36  
48:1010:86092:28:28:72:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Third, some of the most important possible sources of unobserved heterogeneity may cancel each 
48:1011:86187:28:27:72:535:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:other out: hereditary succession may enhance a leader's legitimacy, yet his other "skills" may be 
48:1012:86285:27:28:72:510:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inferior to those of a leader rising to power on his own.    Note it is not necessarily true that 
48:1013:86383:28:39:72:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unobserved heterogeneity would bias the coefficient of AUTDUR upward.    "Charisma" may help 
48:1014:86476:39:10:72:221:112:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:                               
48:1015:86506:10:16:108:542:102:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:36  "Examples abound of leaders who were considered "smart" or "skilled" but who did not hold power very 
48:1016:86611:16:0:72:502:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:long, such as Kofi Busia in Ghana and Sylvanus Olympio in Togo." (Bienen and van de Walle, 1991, p. 6). 
49:1017:86716:0:27:72:512:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a leader to stay in office, but if that charisma is based in part on an ideology antagonistic to 
49:1018:86812:27:28:72:528:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:markets, increases in an autocrat's time in power will be associated with deteriorating property 
49:1019:86909:28:27:72:516:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights.    In any event, we correct for this potential problem of heterogeneity, finding that the 
49:1020:87007:27:28:72:478:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:positive impact of autocrat duration on property rights is robust to these corrections. 
49:1021:87094:28:27:108:543:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our test is borrowed from the Abraham and Farber (1987) study of the impact of seniority 
49:1022:87183:27:28:72:507:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on wages.    The long duration and favorable property-rights policies of some autocrats are 
49:1023:87275:28:28:72:515:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conceivably both products of some omitted autocrat-specific characteristic, such as superior 
49:1024:87368:28:27:72:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:"skills."    In principle, we could include autocrat dummies in our fixed effects tests.    Collinearity 
49:1025:87473:27:28:72:447:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of duration with time and income made these very demanding tests, however. 
49:1026:87547:28:27:108:518:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Abraham and Farber faced a similar problem in attempting to control for unobserved 
49:1027:87630:27:28:72:516:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:worker skills and worker-job "match" in time-series cross-sectional regressions of wages on 
49:1028:87722:28:28:72:509:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seniority and experience.    They could not estimate job-specific effects because changes in 
49:1029:87815:28:27:72:543:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seniority and experience over time were perfectly collinear within a given job.    As an alternative, 
49:1030:87917:27:28:72:534:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they included as an additional regressor completed job duration, as a proxy of these unobserved 
49:1031:88013:28:27:72:146:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics. 
49:1032:88029:27:28:108:531:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Analogously, we include terminal duration in a time-series cross-section model without 
49:1033:88116:28:28:72:537:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country- or autocrat-specific intercepts.    For each country-year observation, TERMDUR equals 
49:1034:88210:28:27:72:528:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the (log of) duration of the autocrat in his final year in power.    Unmeasured skills of autocrats 
49:1035:88310:27:28:72:439:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:formerly captured by AUTDUR are hence captured by TERMDUR instead. 
49:1036:88376:28:28:108:528:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The addition of TERMDUR has relatively little effect on the results for AUTDUR (see 
49:1037:88460:28:27:72:519:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 8, where column 1 equations do not contain TERMDUR but column 2 equations do).   
49:1038:88547:27:0:72:527:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:TERMDUR has the positive sign implied by the sample selection objection in only four of six 
50:1039:88641:0:27:72:528:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cases and is never significant.    AUTDUR retains the expected sign in five of six cases (all but 
50:1040:88739:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ICRG), with the coefficient rising substantially in two cases (CIM and BERI).    Property rights are 
50:1041:88840:28:27:72:537:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generally found to improve with autocrat duration, independently of autocrat skills, as measured 
50:1042:88937:27:28:72:244:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by differences in terminal duration. 
50:1043:88973:28:28:72:75:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
50:1044:88973:28:27:72:232:537:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:8. Additional Robustness Tests 
50:1045:89003:27:28:108:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The ranges of several of the dependent variables -- both objective and subjective -- are 
50:1046:89090:28:27:72:529:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:limited.    Most notably, CIM is bounded by 0 and 1, while CREDIT is bounded by 0 and 100.   
50:1047:89182:27:28:72:538:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Using OLS on these variables could lead to predicted values outside these bounds.    In fact, very 
50:1048:89281:28:27:72:542:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:few predicted values violated these bounds.    Re-estimating all CIM and CREDIT equations using 
50:1049:89377:27:28:72:541:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:logistic transformations of CIM and of CREDIT/100, constraining the predicted values to the 0-1 
50:1050:89473:28:28:72:395:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interval, yielded results very similar to those reported in the tables. 
50:1051:89544:28:27:108:510:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Each fixed-effects regression was re-run using corrections for autocorrelation.    All 
50:1052:89631:27:28:72:544:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:duration effects that were statistically significant in the tables reported here remained significant.   
50:1053:89736:28:27:72:495:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Random-effects specifications were also run.    In these tests, duration of autocrat leader 
50:1054:89828:27:28:72:521:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significantly improved values on all six dependent variables; AUTDUR was not a significant 
50:1055:89918:28:28:72:499:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:predictor of CREDIT in the fixed-effects results of Table 5.    A Hausman test rejects the 
50:1056:90009:28:27:72:461:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:random-effects specification in favor of the fixed-effects specification, however. 
50:1057:90091:27:28:108:543:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The country-regime units cover widely-varying periods: some last less than one year while 
50:1058:90180:28:28:72:542:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:others cover 30 or more years.    Accordingly, we re-ran all country-regime tests reported in Tables 
50:1059:90281:28:27:72:526:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1 and 3 weighting observations by the (square root of) duration of the regime.    Results on the 
50:1060:90378:27:0:72:543:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regime type and duration variables vary somewhat from OLS, but not in a consistent direction, and 
51:1061:90478:0:27:72:524:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lead to similar conclusions.    Furthermore, the error variance of the unweighted regressions is 
51:1062:90575:27:28:72:543:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generally uncorrelated with regime duration.    We therefore report OLS rather than WLS results in 
51:1063:90674:28:27:72:447:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:our tables.    All standard errors reported in tables are White-corrected (1980). 
51:1064:90755:27:28:72:75:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
51:1065:90755:28:27:72:149:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:9. Conclusions 
51:1066:90769:27:28:108:506:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We began with a theory of the incentives and constraints that explain property and 
51:1067:90852:28:28:72:539:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contracts rights in autocracies and in democracies.    We argued that a secure autocrat with a long 
51:1068:90952:28:27:72:527:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time horizon has an incentive to respect and protect property and contract rights in his domain 
51:1069:91048:27:28:72:519:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:because this increases the future income of his domain and thus also his tax collections.    By 
51:1070:91144:28:27:72:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contrast, an autocrat who, because of an insecure hold on power or any other reason, has a 
51:1071:91235:27:28:72:517:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sufficiently short time horizon will find that the tax yield from any asset over that short time 
51:1072:91332:28:28:72:500:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:horizon is less than the value of the capital good, so that he is rational to seize any easily 
51:1073:91427:28:27:72:163:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confiscable assets. 
51:1074:91446:27:28:108:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In democracies, we argued, property and contract rights arise from a dramatically different 
51:1075:91538:28:27:72:537:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:set of incentives and constraints.    There is no reason why the election that initiates a democracy 
51:1076:91639:27:28:72:518:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:should bring good property and contract rights.    Democracies often emerge in unsettled and 
51:1077:91732:28:28:72:537:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sometimes even somewhat anarchic conditions that are unfavorable to the protection of property 
51:1078:91827:28:27:72:526:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights and the new democracies may not be strong enough to protect these rights.    Even if the 
51:1079:91923:27:28:72:533:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:leadership of the new elected government is powerful, there is no assurance that property rights 
51:1080:92020:28:28:72:511:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will be secure, for this democratic government may not last long, and one of the prominent 
51:1081:92111:28:27:72:438:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possibilities is that the democratically elected leader will become a dictator. 
51:1082:92190:27:0:108:537:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:By contrast, it is not feasible for a long-lasting democracy to prohibit all forms of private 
52:1083:92286:0:27:72:525:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:property and contracting: the same adherence to the rule-of-law and protections for individual 
52:1084:92381:27:28:72:542:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:freedoms that are needed to maintain free elections in which any defeated incumbents step down, 
52:1085:92477:28:27:72:518:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:entail that there are some property rights -- the individuals in a free society have what James 
52:1086:92572:27:28:72:542:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Madison called "a property in their rights."    Thus we hypothesized that long-lasting democracies 
52:1087:92671:28:27:72:499:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generally provide better property and contract rights than either transient democracies or 
52:1088:92762:27:28:72:132:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:autocracies. 
52:1089:92774:28:26:108:540:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our empirical evidence supports our hypotheses.    We found that autocrats who had been 
52:1090:92862:26:27:72:543:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in power longer and who by our argument had reason to have longer time horizons were associated 
52:1091:92958:27:26:72:545:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with better property and contract rights than autocrats who were in power only for a shorter time.   
52:1092:93058:26:26:72:536:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We also found that, in general, democracies provide greater security of property and contractual 
52:1093:93155:26:26:72:543:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rights than autocracies.    But these benefits of democracy did not appear quickly: the property and 
52:1094:93255:26:26:72:521:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract rights were often poor in democracies that had lasted only a short time.    Among the 
52:1095:93350:26:26:72:543:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relatively small group of countries within our sample that moved from one regime type to another, 
52:1096:93448:26:26:72:542:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the security of property and contract rights was greater while they were autocracies than while they 
52:1097:93548:26:27:72:535:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:were democracies.    We found, by contrast, that long-lasting democracies offer better protection 
52:1098:93646:27:26:72:435:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for property and contract rights than any other regime type of any duration. 
52:1099:93722:26:26:108:525:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our results also show that, as our theory predicted, the duration of democratic systems 
52:1100:93809:26:26:72:519:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:matters much more than the duration of democratic leaders for property and contract rights.   
52:1101:93902:26:26:72:529:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Moreover, we found that, after controlling for country effects, the security of property rights is 
52:1102:94001:26:26:72:532:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more sensitive to changes in the time in power of autocratic leaders than to the time in office of 
52:1103:94100:26:27:72:168:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democratic leaders. 
52:1104:94119:27:26:108:501:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We conclude that statistical tests of economic performance under autocracies and 
52:1105:94200:26:0:72:542:91:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:democracies that leave out the hypotheses that we have developed and tested are mis-specified.    It 
53:1106:94303:0:26:72:519:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is only natural, given our theory and our empirical results, that the comparisons of economic 
53:1107:94397:26:26:72:539:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance under autocracies and democracies have been so varied and inconclusive.    It is, we 
53:1108:94494:26:26:72:524:623:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:argue, just as important in the analysis of government and politics as in the analysis of market 
53:1109:94590:26:26:72:527:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behavior to analyze the incentives and constraints that face the individuals involved.    Such an 
53:1110:94688:26:26:72:527:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:analysis suggests that property and contract rights in democracies and autocracies have utterly 
53:1111:94784:26:0:72:385:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:different sources, and our empirical results show that this is true.
