3:52:2092:75:27:70:200:360:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:1  Introduction
3:53:2107:27:14:70:540:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The signal value of education has been well studied ever since Michael Spence’s seminal 1973
3:54:2199:14:15:70:540:319:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:contribution. It is, therefore, interesting that students in many leading Master of Business
3:55:2291:15:14:70:540:304:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Administration (MBA) programs vote to reduce the accuracy of their own signal by passing
3:56:2379:14:15:70:540:290:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade non-disclosure policies. These policies are distinctive in that they mainly exist in MBA
3:57:2473:15:14:70:540:275:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f9:programs and not in other professional programs including medicine, law, and accounting.1
3:58:2562:14:14:70:540:261:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Moreover, grade non-disclosure is most prevalent in schools where the faculty are largely
3:59:2651:14:15:70:540:247:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:trained economists. In some cases, faculty seems to support these policies – or, at least, not
3:60:2745:15:18:70:201:232:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f9:heavily discourage them.2

3:63:2933:9:15:84:540:190:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:1Some medical and under-graduate programs (e.g., MIT) have limited grade non-disclosure, for example,
3:64:3034:15:12:70:540:175:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:covering first-year grades. Yale Law has only limited disclosure as well. But these cases are exceptional and
3:65:3143:12:8:70:354:163:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:typically don’t limit the signal as much as many MBA programs.
3:66:3205:8:16:84:540:155:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:2As deputy dean of Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, David Kreps wrote a thoughtful memorandum
3:67:3305:16:12:70:540:139:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:in 2005 that discussed the advantages and disadvantages of grade non-disclosure during a period of school
3:68:3410:12:12:70:540:127:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:debate. He expressed his personal support for non-disclosure, with some caveats. But he explained that the
3:69:3516:12:12:70:540:115:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:school’s official policy under the law is to remain neutral, thereby making non-disclosure a norm of students
3:70:3625:12:12:70:540:103:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:rather than a policy of the school.  Michael Spence was Stanford’s dean during this period.  At Harvard
3:71:3728:12:12:70:540:91:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:Business School, grade non-disclosure was considered an official school policy. Students were required by
3:72:3833:12:0:70:540:79:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:the administration to accept grade non-disclosure before matriculation, and those who did not follow these
4:73:3940:0:15:88:541:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:By U.S. federal law, academic grades cannot be released by schools to third-parties,
4:74:4024:15:14:70:540:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:including potential employers, without student permission.3The law allows for “directory”
4:75:4113:14:15:70:540:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:information to be disclosed, including characteristics such as name, address, field of study,
4:76:4206:15:14:70:540:665:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:date of attendance, and degrees as well as “awards” and other “honors.” The exact level of
4:77:4296:14:15:70:540:651:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:granularity for awards and honors is not defined precisely by law. But the conventional legal
4:78:4389:15:14:70:540:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:wisdom is that information pertaining to awards and honors should be limited to exceptional
4:79:4480:14:14:70:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:performance. An award or honor system whose main purpose is to substitute for traditional
4:80:4569:14:15:70:540:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grading marks (e.g., “Platinum,” “Gold,” “Silver,” and “Bronze” instead of “A,” “B,” “C,” and
4:81:4662:15:14:70:393:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:“D/F”), would not be considered to be “directory” information.
4:82:4724:14:15:88:541:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Since grades are the property of students and not schools, students can vote to create
4:83:4810:15:14:70:540:564:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a “social norm” of grade non-disclosure to potential employers. While individual students
4:84:4899:14:15:70:540:550:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:are legally allowed to break ranks with this norm and disclose their individual grades, they
4:85:4991:15:14:70:540:535:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:generally do not. Moreover, employers (often including alumni) typically do not ask for grade
4:86:5084:14:15:70:457:521:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:information at schools where non-disclosure has been endorsed by students.
4:87:5158:15:14:88:541:506:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:As shown in Tables I and II, grade non-disclosure policies in MBA programs are concen-
4:88:5244:14:14:70:540:492:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:trated within highly-ranked schools. A majority of the most selective 15 schools have a grade
4:89:5337:14:15:70:540:478:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:non-disclosure policy, while no school ranked 20 - 50 has such a policy. In some cases, school
4:90:5431:15:14:70:540:463:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:faculty do not appear to openly oppose the non-disclosure policy approved by students. In
4:91:5520:14:15:70:540:449:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:other cases, like at Wharton, the faculty is fairly vocal in their opposition to the policy, which
4:92:5618:15:14:70:540:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is generally approved each year by a large majority (about 95%) of students. Students at
4:93:5706:14:15:70:540:420:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Wharton and many other top-tier programs argue that non-disclosure allows them to take
4:94:5792:15:14:70:540:405:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:greater risks and harder courses without fear of having an embarrassing transcript. In prac-
4:95:5884:14:15:70:540:391:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tice, self-reported levels of learning effort have fallen significantly since the introduction of
4:96:5981:15:14:70:239:376:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade non-disclosure (Jain 2005).
4:97:6014:14:14:88:541:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:However, business schools with a grade non-disclosure norm typically have some method
4:98:6099:14:15:70:540:348:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of revealing the very best students. This revelation usually takes the form of awards and
4:99:6188:15:14:70:540:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:honors. Moreover, at Chicago’s Booth School of Business, where grade non-disclosure is the
4:100:6278:14:15:70:540:319:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:norm, MBA students also openly compete to earn teaching assistant positions, which are
4:101:6364:15:14:70:541:304:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:viewed as an indicator of excellent performance.4Concurrently, at many schools, including
4:102:6453:14:15:70:523:290:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Wharton, students whose grades fall below some minimum standards are also dismissed.
4:103:6537:15:14:88:541:275:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:This paper sets out to explain the main stylized facts about non-disclosure policies. First,
4:104:6629:14:15:70:540:261:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:what are conditions that lead to majority support of non-disclosure policies among students?
4:105:6721:15:14:70:540:246:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Second, why is support for non-disclosure mainly concentrated within highly selective pro-
4:106:6811:14:14:70:540:232:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grams? Third, why isn’t non-disclosure prevalent within other professional degree granting
4:107:6901:14:15:70:540:218:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:programs such as medicine, law, and accounting?  Fourth, how does the introduction of
4:108:6986:15:14:70:540:203:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:awards and minimum grade requirements, which reintroduce some informativeness, impact
4:109:7071:14:22:70:288:189:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the support for nondisclosure and welfare?
4:110:7113:22:12:70:540:167:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:policies were subject to disciplinary action (Ciolli, 2007).  There was concern about the legality of these
4:111:7220:12:12:70:540:155:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:requirements, which led the school to eventually remove them by 2005 [The Economist, “News from the
4:112:7319:12:12:70:540:143:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:schools.” (Dec 16, 2005)]. At INSEAD, grade non-disclosure is still an official school policy and students and
4:113:7429:12:12:70:540:131:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:recruiters found in breach of it are subject to disciplinary action. [INSEAD MBA Career Services, “Grade

4:115:7618:8:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:3The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), some-
4:116:7715:16:8:70:540:95:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:times called the Buckley Amendment, is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.

5:118:7860:0:15:88:541:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We construct a model with students, schools, and employers. Students prefer larger post-
5:119:7948:15:14:70:540:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:school wages but dislike studying. Schools are heterogenous in their selectivity (reputation).
5:120:8042:14:15:70:540:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Under disclosure, employers can observe both a student’s grades and the school’s selectiv-
5:121:8132:15:14:70:540:665:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ity; under non-disclosure, an employer can only observe the partial signal of the school’s
5:122:8222:14:15:70:123:651:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:selectivity.
5:123:8234:15:14:88:541:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Section 2 then derives the conditions that support grade non-disclosure under a non-
5:124:8318:14:14:70:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:overlapping property of the relationship between effort and grades. This assumption allows
5:125:8408:14:15:70:540:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:for the most straightforward interpretation of our results. We show that students at elite
5:126:8498:15:14:70:540:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:schools are the most likely to adopt a non-disclosure policy, subsequently reducing their effort.
5:127:8595:14:15:70:540:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Intuitively, a non-disclosure policy allows the median voter to study less and then pool to
5:128:8686:15:14:70:540:564:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:receive the expected (mean) wage, which might be more valuable to her than receiving the
5:129:8774:14:15:70:540:550:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:median wage with effort. For plausible wage distributions, the desire to pool becomes more
5:130:8864:15:14:70:540:535:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:valuable at more selective schools. Section 3 then generalizes the results to the case where
5:131:8956:14:15:70:540:521:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the non-overlapping property is relaxed. Section 4 explains why grade non-disclosure is not
5:132:9047:15:14:70:540:506:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:common in other professional degree programs, including medicine, law and accounting. In
5:133:9135:14:14:70:540:492:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:particular, minimum certification requirements undercut the support for grade non-disclosure
5:134:9227:14:15:70:540:478:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in those programs by requiring a level of effort that is complementary to studying, thereby
5:135:9318:15:14:70:540:463:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:reducing the value from pooling to reduce effort. Section 5 extends the analysis to allow
5:136:9407:14:15:70:540:449:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:for awards (similarly, honors) as well as minimum grades. Interestingly, while a minimum
5:137:9495:15:14:70:540:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade requirement encourages additional effort from lower ability students, the requirement
5:138:9586:14:15:70:540:420:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:also reinforces the support for non-disclosure by raising the expected pooled wage with low
5:139:9677:15:14:70:540:405:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:effort without changing the median wage with high effort. In contrast, awards reduce the
5:140:9765:14:15:70:540:391:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:support for non-disclosure by allowing higher-ability students to separate, thereby reducing
5:141:9857:15:14:70:540:376:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the expected wage earned by the pool of students who have not obtained this additional
5:142:9943:14:14:70:540:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:signal. Section 6 then draws some conclusions, including a discussion of some mechanisms
5:143:10031:14:15:70:540:348:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:that schools could potentially deploy to undermine student majority support for grade non-
5:144:10121:15:40:70:123:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:disclosure.

5:150:10416:14:15:70:541:198:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:which affects the distribution of accepted students.6A school with selectivityαaccepts a
5:151:10504:15:14:70:540:183:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:continuum of students distributed according to an atomless cumulative distribution function
5:152:10595:14:14:70:540:169:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:μα. We assume that more selective schools pick a better distribution of students. Formally,
5:153:10686:14:15:70:540:155:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:α > α′implies thatμαfirst-order stochastically dominates (FOSD)μα′.LetEαdenote the

5:156:10881:18:12:84:505:108:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:5In the Appendix, we show that our results generalize to the case of a continuum of effort levels.
5:157:10979:12:16:84:540:96:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:6To determine admission, schools can observe some pre-school signal of performance (e.g., undergraduate
5:158:11082:16:0:70:357:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:transcript, GMAT, etc.) to determine if it exceeds the school’sα.

6:163:11299:14:17:88:418:627:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We make the following assumptions about the grade technology:

6:167:11551:15:14:70:540:563:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:individuals with greater ability and higher effort get higher grades. The third assumption
6:168:11641:14:15:70:540:549:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:states that even the highest skilled student gets a lower grade than the lowest ability student
6:169:11736:15:14:70:540:534:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:if the highest type doesn’t study (i.e., the sets of grades under high and low efforts do not
6:170:11829:14:15:70:540:520:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:overlap). This assumption, which will be dropped in Section 3, simplifies the analysis of the
6:171:11922:15:14:70:212:505:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:equilibrium with disclosure.
6:172:11950:14:14:88:541:491:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Upon graduation, students obtain jobs in a competitive market of employers. A student

6:175:12197:14:15:70:540:448:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:not affect productivity and grades have purely a signaling aspect. Whenκ >0,education
6:176:12282:15:14:70:511:433:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:also has a human capital dimension and studying increases the student’s productivity.
6:177:12367:14:15:88:541:419:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:As discussed in the introduction, students determine the school’s disclosure policy through
6:178:12458:15:14:70:540:404:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a voting procedure. We formalize this mechanism by assuming that the voting procedure
6:179:12543:14:15:70:359:390:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f9:selects the policy preferred by the majority of students.9
6:180:12601:15:24:88:277:375:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The timing of the game is as follows:
6:181:12638:24:14:70:541:351:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f8:t=1.Voting:A pool of students with typesθdistributed according toμαjoins the school.

6:184:12863:24:25:70:530:298:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f8:t=2.Effort:Each student chooses a level of efforte∈{0,1}and obtains a gradeg(θ,e).

6:187:13112:15:17:100:541:244:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:competitive market offers a wagewequal to the expected productivity of the student.
6:188:13195:17:16:84:540:227:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:7The minimum effort level denotes the amount a student would choose in the absence of explicit incentives.
6:189:13301:16:12:70:540:211:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:While we have normalized it to zero, we do not claim that students would not study at all in the absence of
6:190:13408:12:8:70:150:199:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:explicit incentives.
6:191:13428:8:12:84:524:191:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f21:8In the Appendix, we characterize the solution of our model for general production functionsf(θ,e).
6:192:13527:12:16:84:540:179:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:9When there are finitely many students, this procedure picks the unique equilibrium outcome from the
6:193:13627:16:12:70:540:163:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:strategic voting game. With infinitely many students, each student has mass zero and, therefore, is indifferent
6:194:13738:12:12:70:540:151:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:between voting in either policy. As a result, all policies can be an equilibrium of the the voting game. The
6:195:13846:12:12:70:540:139:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:procedure then picks the equilibrium in which students vote on their preferred strategies. This is the only
6:196:13953:12:12:70:540:127:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:outcome that can be approached taking the limit of the game with finitely many players as the number of

8:260:16530:14:24:100:281:522:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the wage schedule is determined by

8:276:17403:15:14:100:541:242:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:course, that decision depends on whether, under disclosure, it is efficient for the student

8:282:17869:15:14:70:540:128:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A vote for disclosure allows the median voter to reveal his or her actual productivity; the

8:284:18048:15:14:70:540:99:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:non-disclosure, however, allows the median voter to essentially “free ride” off of the expected
8:285:18143:14:15:70:540:85:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:pooled wage, which will be advantageous when there are enough students who are more
8:286:18226:15:0:70:246:70:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:productive than the median voter.
9:287:18260:0:15:70:541:709:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Proposition 1.In any PBE, disclosure is chosen ifθMedianα+ max{κ−c,0} ≥Eα[θ]and

9:289:18393:22:15:88:541:672:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The disclosure policy, therefore, depends on the skewness of the distribution of ability.
9:290:18482:15:14:70:540:657:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:When the distribution of ability is symmetric, the median is equal to the mean. Then, there
9:291:18573:14:15:70:540:643:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:always exists an equilibrium with grade disclosure. Moreover, when high effort is efficient
9:292:18664:15:14:70:335:628:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:κ > c,no equilibrium features grade non-disclosure.
9:293:18715:14:15:88:541:614:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:However, actual wage distributions exhibit the empirical property that the median wage
9:294:18801:15:14:70:540:599:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is below the mean (consistent with example distributions considered below). It is, therefore,
9:295:18894:14:14:70:540:585:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:reasonable to assume that the median ability is lower than mean ability:θMedianα< Eα[θ].
9:296:18982:14:15:70:540:571:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Therefore, as long as the human capital parameterκis “not too large,” non-disclosure is
9:297:19069:15:23:70:107:556:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:chosen.

9:300:19221:23:14:88:541:496:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Greater school selectivityα, however, has an ambiguous impact on the support for non-
9:301:19306:14:14:70:541:482:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:disclosure. A larger value ofαincreases both median and mean abilities. If the mean ability
9:302:19397:14:15:70:540:468:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is more responsive to a change in selectivity than the median, increasing selectivity would
9:303:19488:15:14:70:540:453:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:raise the proportion of people voting for non-disclosure. Then, the most selective schools
9:304:19578:14:15:70:540:439:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:would be the ones whose students vote to implement a grade non-disclosure policy. Formally,
9:305:19669:15:22:70:470:424:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:letG(α)≡Eα[θ]−θMedianαdenote the mean-median gap. We, therefore, have:
9:306:19739:22:15:70:541:402:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Corollary 2.SupposeG(α)is increasing. There exists ̄α∈R∪{−∞,+∞}such that, in
9:307:19815:15:22:70:474:387:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f14:any PBE, non-disclosure is chosen ifα > ̄αand disclosure is chosen inα < ̄α.
9:308:19891:22:15:88:541:365:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Thus, more selective schools will adopt grade non-disclosure policies while less selective
9:309:19981:15:14:70:540:350:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:schools will not if the mean-median gap is increasing in school selectivity. The increasing
9:310:20072:14:15:70:540:336:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:mean-median gap assumption states that higher selectivity increases the quality of students
9:311:20163:15:14:70:540:321:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:by attracting a disproportionately higher amount of very good students.  As we show in

10:363:22092:15:14:70:540:527:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:would adopt a grade non-disclosure policy whereas less selective schools would adopt a policy
10:364:22185:14:15:70:540:513:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of disclosure. This pattern is consistent with the evidence from MBA programs (Tables I and
10:365:22276:15:14:70:540:498:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:II). Our model also predicts that studying effort is (weakly) lower with grade non-disclosure,
10:366:22370:14:40:70:409:484:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:which is also consistent with the evidence reported in Jain (2005).
10:367:22437:40:26:70:260:444:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:3  Overlapping Grades
10:368:22458:26:15:70:540:418:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Thus far, we have assumed that education had such a strong effect on grades that the lowest
10:369:22549:15:14:70:540:403:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ability student obtained a higher grade by studying than the highest ability student who did
10:370:22641:14:14:70:540:389:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:not study (non-overlapping grades). This assumption simplified the analysis because each
10:371:22729:14:15:70:540:375:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade fully identifies the student’s skill. In practice, however, the highest ability student may
10:372:22826:15:14:70:540:360:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:be able to obtain relatively better grades even without exerting much effort. This section,
10:373:22917:14:25:70:540:346:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f9:therefore, allows grades to overlap. For simplicity, we focus on an additive grade technology:13
10:374:23013:25:41:263:348:321:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:g(θ,e) =θ+γe.
10:375:23026:41:17:70:419:280:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f14:Assumption 2 (Overlapping Grades).θ1> θ0+γwhereγ >0.
10:376:23078:17:15:88:541:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Under Assumption 2, which replaces Assumption 1, the set of possible grades under high
10:377:23164:15:14:70:541:248:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and low efforts are now allowed to overlap. A high effort allows a type-θstudent, at a cost
10:378:23255:14:15:70:426:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ofc, to obtain the same grade of a typeθ+γwho chooses low effort.
10:379:23320:15:22:88:397:219:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:It is helpful to partition the grade space into three intervals:
10:380:23384:22:15:85:540:197:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:1. In the lowest interval,[θ0,θ0+γ),each gradeGcan only be obtained by the typeθ=G
10:381:23466:15:14:100:541:182:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:under low effort. Consistency (Condition 4(c)) requires beliefsβD(θ|G)to assign a unit
10:382:23552:14:24:100:181:168:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:mass at typeG.
10:383:23566:24:14:85:541:144:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:2. In the intermediate interval,[θ0+γ,θ1],grades can be obtained by two different types:
10:384:23654:14:15:100:541:130:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:θ=Gunder low effort andθ=G−γunder high effort. Consistency requires beliefs
10:385:23729:15:17:100:294:115:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to assign zero mass to all other types.
10:386:23768:17:16:80:541:98:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:12More precisely, the mean-median gap is positive ifα∈[μ−8.437σ,μ+ 7.7073σ]and it is increasing if

11:389:23939:0:15:85:541:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:3. In the highest interval,(θ1,θ1+γ],each gradeGcan only be obtained by the type
11:390:24019:15:14:100:541:694:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:θ=G−γunder high effort. Consistency requires beliefs to assign a unit mass to type
11:391:24101:14:24:100:133:680:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:G−γ.
11:392:24105:24:15:70:541:656:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f15:The first two intervals are always non-empty whereas the third interval is empty whenθ1=
11:393:24193:15:24:70:511:641:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f14:+∞. In this section, we will also assume that it is efficient to exert high effort:κ > c.
11:394:24282:24:15:70:540:617:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f8:Definition 2.We will say that grades aresufficiently responsive to effortifγ > c,and we
11:395:24369:15:24:70:408:602:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:will say that they arenot sufficiently responsive to effortifγ < c.
11:396:24436:24:14:88:541:578:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In words, grades are sufficiently responsive to effort if exerting high effort allows a student
11:397:24531:14:15:70:540:564:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to pool with someone whose productivity exceeds the student’s own productivity by an
11:398:24615:15:34:70:309:549:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:amount greater than the cost:(θ+γ)−θ > c.
11:399:24656:34:22:70:350:515:14:g_d0_f13:14:g_d0_f13:3.1  Equilibrium with responsive grades
11:400:24695:22:15:70:540:493:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We first characterize the unique equilibrium of the continuation game after grade disclosure
11:401:24787:15:14:70:540:478:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:has been selected in the case of sufficiently responsive grades. Since this unique equilibrium
11:402:24881:14:15:70:540:464:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:involves full separation of types, the results from Section 2 remain unchanged in any PBE of
11:403:24973:15:24:70:120:449:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the game.
11:404:24982:24:14:70:540:425:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Proposition 2.Suppose grades are sufficiently responsive to effort. There exists a unique
11:405:25071:14:15:70:541:411:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f14:PBE of the continuation game conditional on grade disclosure in whicheD(θ) = 1for allθ.
11:406:25158:15:24:70:358:396:12:g_d0_f23:8:g_d0_f9:Furthermore, this PBE survives the intuitive criterion.14
11:407:25215:24:14:88:541:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The proof of Proposition 2 will be presented through a series of lemmata. Intuitively,
11:408:25301:14:15:70:540:358:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:deviating from a high to a low effort causes the student to be pooled with someone with much
11:409:25393:15:14:70:540:343:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:lower productivity, and so this cannot be a profitable deviation when grades are sufficiently
11:410:25486:14:15:70:540:329:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:responsive to effort. Similarly, deviating in effort from low to high causes the student to be
11:411:25580:15:14:70:541:314:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:pooled with someone with higher productivity, whichisa profitable deviation under sufficient
11:412:25672:14:15:70:540:300:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:responsiveness, ruling out low effort as an equilibrium. Therefore, only equilibria in which
11:413:25764:15:24:70:273:285:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:everyone studies hard can be sustained.
11:414:25803:24:14:70:541:261:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Lemma 1.Suppose grades are sufficiently responsive to effort.  There exists a PBE that
11:415:25889:14:25:70:375:247:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f14:survives the intuitive criterion in whicheD(θ) = 1for allθ.
11:416:25948:25:14:70:541:222:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.LeteD(θ) = 1for all types and consider a deviation by a typeθtoe= 0.Since this
11:417:26032:14:14:70:540:208:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is a separating equilibrium, each type gets payoffu∗(θ) =θ+κ−c.Ifθ < θ0+γ, deviating
11:418:26116:14:15:70:541:194:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:fully identifies the type and the market offers wagew=θ.The deviation is not profitable
11:419:26203:15:14:70:541:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:sinceκ > c=⇒θ+κ−c > θ.If a type belongs to either the second or the third interval,
11:420:26286:14:15:70:541:165:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:deviating leads to gradeθ,which is the equilibrium grade of typeθ−γ,who exerts high
11:421:26369:15:14:70:541:150:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:effort. Therefore, the market offers wagew=θ−γ+κ. This deviation is also not profitable
11:422:26456:14:15:70:458:136:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:sinceγ > c=⇒θ+κ−c > θ+κ−γ. Hence,eD(θ) = 1is an equilibrium.
11:423:26516:15:14:88:541:121:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:But it remains to be shown that it survives the intuitive criterion.  The set of off-
11:424:26601:14:15:70:540:107:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:equilibrium-path grades is[θ0,θ0+γ).Any gradeGin this interval can only be obtained
11:425:26684:15:18:70:541:92:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:by typeθ=G. Letv(G,w,θ)denote the payoff of typeθwhen she obtains gradeG(or, in
11:426:26763:18:0:80:394:74:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:14See Cho and Kreps (1987) for a presentation of the intuitive criterion.

12:428:26921:15:26:70:290:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:dominated by the equilibrium payoffs since
12:429:26963:26:27:222:389:668:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:u∗(G) =G+κ−c > v(G,G,G).
12:430:26987:27:24:70:387:641:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Thus, the equilibrium trivially satisfied the intuitive criterion.
12:431:27053:24:14:70:540:617:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Lemma 2.Suppose grades are sufficiently responsive to effort. There is no PBE in which
12:432:27139:14:25:70:182:603:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:eD(θ)6= 1for someθ.
12:433:27158:25:14:70:540:578:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.Suppose, by contradiction, we have a PBE in whicheD(θ) = 0for some typeθ. Now
12:434:27241:14:15:70:540:564:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consider a deviation toe= 1.There are 3 possibilities: she separates herself, she obtains a
12:435:27332:15:14:70:541:549:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade already being taken by typeθ+γ, or she obtains a grade that is off-the-equilibrium
12:436:27420:14:15:70:540:535:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:path. If she separates herself, she obtains payoffθ+κ−c > θ=u∗(θ).Thus, the deviation
12:437:27505:15:14:70:541:520:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:is profitable. If she takes the grade already taken by typeθ+γ,she obtainsθ+γ−c > θ,
12:438:27589:14:15:70:540:506:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:which is also a profitable deviation. Finally, if the student obtains an off-the-equilibrium-path
12:439:27686:15:26:70:162:491:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade, she obtains
12:440:27704:26:26:137:474:465:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:λ(θ+κ) + (1−λ)(θ+γ)−c=λ(θ+κ−c) + (1−λ)(θ+γ−c),
12:441:27750:26:15:70:541:439:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:whereλ∈[0,1]are the market’s beliefs about the probability of the deviant type beingθ.
12:442:27836:15:14:70:540:424:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Sinceθ+κ−c > θandθ+γ−c > θ,it follows that this term is greater than the equilibrium
12:443:27920:14:24:70:512:410:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:payoffu∗(θ) =θfor any beliefλ.Therefore, we cannot have a PBE in whiche(θ) = 0.
12:444:27999:24:14:88:540:386:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:From Condition 4 of Definition 1, beliefsμ(θ|G)must assign a unit mass atθ=G−γ

12:446:28151:15:32:70:330:357:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the market must offer the following wage schedule:
12:447:28201:32:0:211:250:325:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f15:w(G) =
12:448:28207:0:10:254:263:342:12:g_d0_f30:12:g_d0_f30:{

12:451:28232:0:33:396:399:325:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:.
12:452:28233:33:14:70:540:292:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Thus, Lemmata 1 and 2 imply that the PBE is unique. Because the unique PBE of the
12:453:28314:14:15:70:540:278:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:continuation game has full separation, each type obtains payoffθ+κ−cunder grade disclosure.
12:454:28405:15:24:70:427:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Proceeding as in the previous section, we obtain the following results:
12:455:28476:24:28:70:418:239:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Proposition 3.Suppose grades are sufficiently responsive to effort.
12:456:28543:28:14:85:541:211:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:1. In any PBE, disclosure is chosen ifθMedianα+κ−c≥Eα[θ]and non-disclosure is chosen
12:457:28627:14:24:100:237:197:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:ifθMedianα+κ−c≤Eα[θ].
12:458:28648:24:15:85:541:173:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:2. SupposeG(α)is increasing. There exists ̄α∈R∪{−∞,+∞}such that, in any PBE,
12:459:28724:15:27:100:444:158:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:non-disclosure is chosen ifα > ̄αand disclosure is chosen inα < ̄α.
12:460:28791:27:15:70:540:131:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Therefore, the results from the previous section immediately generalize when we allow for
12:461:28880:15:14:70:540:116:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:overlapping grades if we assume that grades are sufficiently responsive to effort. Next, we
12:462:28971:14:0:70:289:102:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consider the case of non-responsive grades.
13:463:29016:0:22:70:381:709:14:g_d0_f13:14:g_d0_f13:3.2  Equilibrium with non-responsive grades
13:464:29059:22:15:70:540:687:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:When grades are not sufficiently responsive to effort, there may be multiple equilibria de-
13:465:29150:15:14:70:541:672:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:pending on the distribution of types.  We will say that a PBE isessentially uniquein a
13:466:29236:14:15:70:540:658:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:given class of equilibria if all PBE in that class have the same grade and wage schedules, and
13:467:29330:15:14:70:540:643:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:feature the same beliefs for all grades on the equilibrium path. The following proposition
13:468:29420:14:15:70:541:629:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:states that there exists an essentially unique PBE with non-decreasing effort.15Moreover,
13:469:29509:15:24:70:368:614:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:this equilibrium satisfies the intuitive criterion refinement.

13:478:29798:24:15:88:541:487:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Intuitively, when grades are not sufficiently responsive to effort, a typeθstudent looses
13:479:29887:15:14:70:540:472:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:relatively little in the form of wages by choosing low effort and pooling with a lower type
13:480:29978:14:15:70:540:458:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:θ−γ.Therefore, all types have an incentive to reduce their effort and imitate a slightly less
13:481:30071:15:14:70:540:443:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f15:productive type while saving the cost of effort. Only types at the upper interval(θ1−γ,θ1]
13:482:30161:14:14:70:540:429:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:are able to choose high effort in equilibrium because there are no higher types to pool with
13:483:30253:14:15:70:540:415:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:them. When ability is unbounded(θ1= +∞), this upper interval does not exist and all types
13:484:30342:15:14:70:512:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:exert low effort despite the fact that it is efficient for all of them to choose high effort.
13:485:30435:14:15:88:541:386:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The formal proof of the proposition will be presented through a series of lemmata. The
13:486:30521:15:14:70:540:371:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f15:first lemma establishes that all types that can obtain grades in the highest interval(θ1,θ1+γ]
13:487:30615:14:24:70:100:357:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:do so:

13:489:30707:15:24:70:300:318:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:decreasing effort,e(θ) = 1for allθ > θ1−γ.
13:490:30749:24:14:70:540:294:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.Consider a PBE in which a typeθ > θ1−γchoosese=  0.Since this equilibrium
13:491:30828:14:15:70:541:280:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is nondecreasing, we cannot havee(θ−γ)  =  1.Therefore, typeθmust be separated and
13:492:30910:15:14:70:540:265:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:gets payoffu∗(θ) =θ.Suppose this type deviates toe= 1.Becauseg(θ,1) =θ+γ > θ1,
13:493:30988:14:15:70:540:251:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consistency of beliefs (Condition 4(c) of Definition 1) implies that the market would assign
13:494:31080:15:14:70:540:236:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:probability one to his true type and would offer wageθ+κ.Thus, the student would get
13:495:31164:14:24:70:520:222:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:payoffθ+κ−c > θ=u∗(θ),contradicting the assumption of this being an equilibrium.
13:496:31244:24:14:88:541:198:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Next, we show that types who are unable to obtain grades in the highest interval choose
13:497:31331:14:24:70:121:184:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:low effort:

13:499:31429:15:24:70:241:145:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:PBE,e(θ) = 0for allθ≤θ1−γ.
13:500:31455:24:14:70:541:121:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.Consider a PBE in whiche(θ) = 1for some typeθ< θ1−γ. Since this equilibrium is
13:501:31539:14:15:70:541:107:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:nondecreasing and, by the previous lemma,e(θ1) = 1, we must also havee(θ) = 1for all types
13:502:31629:15:18:70:541:92:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in[θ,θ1].In particular,e(θ1−γ) = 1.Since bothθ1andθ1−γchoosee= 1,they are both
13:503:31707:18:0:80:408:74:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:15A PBE features non-decreasing effort ife(θ)is a non-decreasing function.
14:504:31783:0:15:70:540:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:separated in equilibrium and obtain payoffsu∗(θ1) =θ1+κ−candu∗(θ1−γ) =θ1−γ+κ−c.
14:505:31862:15:14:70:541:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:If typeθ1deviates toe= 0,he obtains the same grade as typeθ1−γ,thereby obtaining a
14:506:31944:14:24:70:471:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:payoff ofθ1−γ+κ > θ1+κ−c=u∗(θ1).Thus, this is a profitable deviation.
14:507:32013:24:14:88:541:656:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Therefore, the only candidate for a non-decreasing equilibrium effort schedule is the one
14:508:32102:14:15:70:540:642:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in which only types greater thanθ1−γexert high effort. The following lemma establishes
14:509:32188:15:14:70:540:627:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:that this schedule can be supported in equilibrium, and that such an equilibrium survives

14:516:32420:0:31:236:505:568:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:. Moreover this PBE survives the intuitive criterion.
14:517:32473:31:14:70:541:537:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.First, we will show that such an equilibrium exists. Given the effort schedule specified
14:518:32567:14:15:70:540:523:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:in the statement of the lemma, it is useful to partition the type space in 3 intervals:[θ0,θ1−
14:519:32661:15:14:70:262:508:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f14:2γ],(θ1−2γ,θ1−γ], and(θ1−1,θ1].
14:520:32692:14:15:88:541:494:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Students choosee(θ)  =  0in the first and second intervals and choosee(θ)  =  1in the
14:521:32777:15:14:70:540:479:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:third interval. A typeθin the first interval who deviates toe= 1obtains the equilibrium
14:522:32864:14:14:70:540:465:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f15:grade of typeθ+γ∈[θ0+γ,θ1−γ]. A typeθin the second interval who deviates toe= 1
14:523:32943:14:15:70:541:451:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:obtains gradeθ+γ∈(θ1−γ,θ1],which is off the equilibrium path. Similarly, a type in the
14:524:33029:15:14:70:541:436:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:third interval who deviates toe= 0obtains grades in the interval(θ1−γ,θ1],which is off
14:525:33115:14:15:70:541:422:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the equilibrium path. Let off-the-equilibrium-path beliefsμ(θ|G)assign a unit mass at type
14:526:33205:15:14:70:540:407:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:G(i.e., the market assigns probability 1 to the highest of the two possible types when an
14:527:33294:14:15:70:540:393:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:off-equilibrium grade is chosen), and define wages as the expected product given beliefs. We
14:528:33386:15:14:70:392:378:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:will verify that none of these possible deviations are profitable.
14:529:33452:14:15:88:541:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:If a typeθin the first or second intervals deviates toe= 1, she is perceived to be type
14:530:33539:15:14:70:541:349:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:θ+γ, yielding a payoff ofθ+γ−c < θ=u∗(θ).If a type in the third interval deviates to
14:531:33623:14:14:70:540:335:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:e= 0, she is perceived to be typeθ, yielding a payoff ofθ < θ+κ−c=u∗(θ).Thus, there
14:532:33706:14:15:70:213:321:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:are no profitable deviations.
14:533:33735:15:14:88:541:306:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Next, we verify that this equilibrium survives the intuitive criterion. Recall that the set
14:534:33826:14:15:70:540:292:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of off-equilibrium-path grades is(θ1−γ,θ1].Consider a gradeGin this interval. There are
14:535:33913:15:14:70:540:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:now two types that can obtain such a grade:GandG−γ. GradeGis undominated for
14:536:33989:14:27:70:408:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:typesGandG−γ, respectively, if the following inequalities hold:
14:537:34052:27:40:126:486:236:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:u∗(G) =G+κ−c≤max{λG+ (1−λ)(G−γ+κ)|0≤λ≤1},and
14:538:34096:40:21:128:483:196:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:u∗(G−γ) =G−γ≤max{λG+ (1−λ)(G−γ+κ)|0≤λ≤1}−c.
14:539:34139:21:15:70:540:175:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Sinceκ > c≥γ,the maximum term is equal toG−γ+κ.Then, these conditions are both
14:540:34217:15:14:70:140:160:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:satisfied since
14:541:34232:14:36:203:409:146:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:c≥γ=⇒G+κ−c≤G−γ+κ,and
14:542:34252:36:21:215:396:110:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:κ > c=⇒G−γ≤G−γ+κ−c.
14:543:34271:21:0:70:332:89:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Hence, both types are undominated for messageG.
15:544:34320:0:27:88:486:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The PBE fails the intuitive criterion if either of the following conditions hold:

15:546:34428:41:20:209:402:641:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:minBR(G)u(G−γ,w,G)> u∗(G−γ),
15:547:34456:20:15:70:540:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:whereBR(G)denotes the market’s best response to gradeGfor some beliefs with support

15:549:34625:14:27:70:331:592:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:market’s best response, the first condition becomes
15:550:34676:27:26:150:461:565:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:G=min{λG+ (1−λ)(G−γ+κ)|0≤λ≤1}> G+κ−c.
15:551:34713:26:27:70:432:539:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Sinceκ−c >0,this inequality is false. The second condition becomes
15:552:34779:27:26:140:471:512:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:G−c=min{λG+ (1−λ)(G−γ+κ)|0≤λ≤1}−c > G−γ,
15:553:34819:26:23:70:501:486:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Becausec≥γ,this is also false. Therefore, the PBE survives the intuitive criterion.
15:554:34902:23:15:88:541:463:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Since an effort schedule pins down beliefs and wages on the equilibrium path, the lemmata

16:586:36393:27:14:70:540:682:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Business schools are unique in that most other professional programs – including medicine,
16:587:36483:14:14:70:541:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:law and accounting – allow for grade disclosure.17These other programs, however, also have
16:588:36573:14:15:70:540:654:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:some uniform certification (medical boards, legal bar, CPA) that is required to practice at
16:589:36664:15:14:70:540:639:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the fullest level. We now show how the existence of these external minimum standards makes
16:590:36754:14:15:70:387:625:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:itharderto sustain an equilibrium with gradenon-disclosure.
16:591:36813:15:14:88:541:610:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Although the results are more general, we consider a simple formulation of certification.
16:592:36902:14:15:70:541:596:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:There are two types of effort:  studying for classes, denoted bye, and studying for the
16:593:36989:15:14:70:541:581:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:certification exam, denoted bys.  For simplicity, we maintain the assumption of binary
16:594:37075:14:27:70:487:567:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:efforts,e,s∈{0,1}, and keep the assumption of an additive production function:
16:595:37153:27:26:245:366:540:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:f(θ,e,s) =θ+κe+ηs,
16:596:37171:26:14:70:541:514:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:whereη∈Rcaptures the effect of studying for the exam on the student’s productivity. When
16:597:37259:14:15:70:436:500:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:η= 0,studying for the exam does not affect the student’s productivity.
16:598:37329:15:24:88:541:485:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The cost of effort is represented by the functionc(e,s),satisfying the following properties:
16:599:37421:24:25:70:456:461:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f8:Assumption 3.cis strictly increasing and satisfies decreasing differences.
16:600:37495:25:14:70:541:436:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The assumption thatcis strictly increasing means that both efforts are costly, while de-
16:601:37583:14:15:70:540:422:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:creasing differences states that studying for classes makes it easier to study for the exam so
16:602:37677:15:14:70:541:407:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:thateandsare “cost-complements.” For example, there is usually some overlap between the
16:603:37764:14:14:70:540:393:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:material covered in class and the material tested in the certification exam, which would make
16:604:37857:14:15:70:355:379:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:obtaining the certification easier if one studies for class.
16:605:37917:15:14:88:541:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In the presence of certification, all students are required to exert efforts= 1in order to
16:606:38007:14:15:70:540:350:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:work. In the absence of certification, students do not exert such effort (it is not observable
16:607:38101:15:14:70:540:335:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:by firms and, therefore, it is costly but does not raise their wages). The game is exactly
16:608:38191:14:15:70:540:321:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the same as in the model of Sections 2 and 3, with the exception that in the presence of
16:609:38279:15:14:70:541:306:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:certification workers are required to exert efforts= 1in order to pass the certification exam.
16:610:38373:14:15:88:541:292:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The following proposition states that it is easier to support grade non-disclosure when
16:611:38460:15:14:70:540:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:there is no certification exam. Intuitively, when studying for classes and for the certification
16:612:38556:14:14:70:540:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:exam are cost complements, certification reduces the incremental cost of studying for classes,
16:613:38650:14:25:70:283:249:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:thereby increasing the value of disclosure.
16:614:38693:25:14:70:541:224:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Proposition 5.Consider the model of either Section 2 or Section 3 and suppose Assumption
16:615:38781:14:15:70:540:210:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:3 holds. If there exists an equilibrium with grade disclosure under non-certification, there also
16:616:38878:15:24:70:386:195:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:exists an equilibrium with grade disclosure under certification.
16:617:38942:24:15:70:541:171:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.Under Assumption 3, the relevant conditions for grade non-disclosure under certifica-
16:618:39033:15:26:70:220:156:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tion and non-certification are

16:620:39098:26:19:219:541:104:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:θMedianα−Eα[θ]≤c(1,0)−c(0,0).(5)
16:621:39130:19:0:80:254:85:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f11:17Limited exceptions were noted earlier.
17:622:39172:0:26:70:280:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Suppose inequality (4) is satisfied. Then,
17:623:39214:26:15:212:397:683:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f15:θMedianα−Eα[θ]≤c(1,1)−c(0,1)
17:624:39242:15:26:300:399:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f14:≤c(1,0)−c(0,0),
17:625:39257:26:15:70:541:642:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:where the second inequality follows from the decreasing differences property ofc.Hence, (5)
17:626:39348:15:39:70:150:627:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is also satisfied.
17:627:39366:39:27:70:453:588:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:5  Minimum Grade Requirements and Awards
17:628:39406:27:14:70:540:561:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In the presence of grade non-disclosure, schools still have some limited tools available to
17:629:39497:14:15:70:540:547:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:encourage effort. The two most common instruments are awards and honors as well as some
17:630:39584:15:14:70:540:532:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:minimum performance requirement. Based on our conversations with MBA offices at most
17:631:39668:14:15:70:540:518:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of these schools, awards tend to be more emphasized at schools with a non-disclosure policy,
17:632:39760:15:14:70:540:503:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:often as an explicit attempt to challenge grade non-disclosure. “Implicit” distinctions also
17:633:39852:14:14:70:540:489:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:exist in other forms, including winning a teaching assistant position. Concurrently, some
17:634:39941:14:15:70:540:475:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:MBA programs also impose certain minimum requirements that require some non-trivial
17:635:40024:15:14:70:540:460:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:amount of effort.  For example, students at Wharton are dismissed if they score in the
17:636:40110:14:15:70:540:446:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:bottom decile in at least five credit unit courses during their first year or eight credit unit
17:637:40205:15:14:70:540:431:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:courses over two years, a rule passed during the 1998 school year by faculty in response to
17:638:40296:14:35:70:432:417:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade non-disclosure. We will address the minimum requirements first.
17:639:40365:35:22:70:227:382:14:g_d0_f13:14:g_d0_f13:5.1  Minimum Grades
17:640:40384:22:14:70:540:360:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Imposing a minimum grade has two effects. On the one hand, it may prevent individuals
17:641:40469:14:15:70:540:346:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:with the lowest skills from being able to graduate. On the other hand, it induces those with
17:642:40561:15:14:70:540:331:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:intermediate skills to exert high effort. Formally, let ̄gdenote the minimum grade. A type-θ

17:644:40716:15:14:88:541:302:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We assume that the market cannot determine if a student attended a school but was
17:645:40797:14:15:70:540:288:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:unable to obtain the minimum grade or if the student never attended the school, and denote

17:648:41063:15:14:70:173:244:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:incentivizing effort).
17:649:41085:14:14:88:541:230:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In the case of grade non-disclosure, students who are able to meet the minimum grade

17:656:41277:34:14:70:540:149:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f8:Model with non-overlapping grades.In in the model with non-overlapping grades (Sec-
17:657:41360:14:14:70:540:135:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tion 2), it is possible to induce all students to exert high effort by setting the minimum grade
17:658:41456:14:15:71:541:121:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f8: ̄g∈(g(θ1,0),g(θ0,1)], that is, at level above the grade that would be obtained by a highest
17:659:41548:15:14:70:540:106:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ability student under low effort. When the equilibrium of the model without minimum grades
17:660:41638:14:15:70:541:92:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:features disclosure (i.e.,θMedianα+κ−c≥Eα[θ]), the minimum grade is innocuous since all
17:661:41725:15:0:70:295:77:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:students would already choose a high effort.
18:662:41771:0:15:88:540:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:When the equilibrium features non-disclosure (Eα[θ]≥θMedianα+κ−c), the minimum
18:663:41849:15:14:70:540:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:grade policy shifts the equilibrium effort of all students from low to high, which increases
18:664:41941:14:22:70:458:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:their payoffs byκ−c >0. Moreover, they still vote for non-disclosure since
18:665:42015:22:21:201:409:658:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:Eα[θ] +κ−c > Eα[θ]≥θMedianα+κ−c.
18:666:42047:21:15:70:540:637:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Hence, any equilibrium with a minimum grade ̄g∈(g(θ1,0),g(θ0,1)]is preferred by all stu-
18:667:42135:15:14:70:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:dents relative to the equilibrium without minimum grade. The minimum grade requirement
18:668:42221:14:15:70:540:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:eliminates "free riding" off of the reduced signal under non-disclosure, leading to a Pareto
18:669:42313:15:14:70:540:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:improvement (it increases all students’ payoffs while leaving firms with the same profit as
18:670:42404:14:17:70:109:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:before).
18:671:42412:17:14:70:541:562:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f8:Model with overlapping grades.In the model of Section 3, it is impossible to simultane-
18:672:42499:14:15:70:540:548:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ously ensure that all types choose high effort and all types achieve the minimum grade under
18:673:42591:15:14:70:540:533:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:non-disclosure. If the minimum grade is set belowg(θ1,0), some types will choose low effort.
18:674:42683:14:15:70:541:519:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:If it is set aboveg(θ0,1), some types will be unable to achieve the minimum grade. Since
18:675:42771:15:14:70:541:504:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:g(θ1,0)< g(θ0,1),no minimum grade is able to simultaneously avoid both issues. Neverthe-

18:677:42948:15:14:70:540:475:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:enough to make sure that all students are able to pass increases ex-ante welfare.18Therefore,
18:678:43041:14:15:70:540:461:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:any mechanism that determines the minimum grade policy by an efficiency criterion would
18:679:43128:15:14:70:540:446:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:select an interior minimum grade.  Such a mechanism may be the outcome of the school
18:680:43212:14:14:70:540:432:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:maximizing student welfare, profits, or a combination of both. Moreover, there exists an

18:702:43992:14:15:70:540:276:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:have grade non-disclosure and low effort. Under the minimum grade policy, the median type

18:710:44451:30:14:70:541:160:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Sinceθ∗< θMedianα, it follows that the median type is better off under minimum grade:

18:713:44642:22:16:70:485:102:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:which establishes that ex-ante welfare is higher under the minimum grade policy.

19:723:44957:15:14:70:540:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in the presence of grade non-disclosure by inducing effort from types with lower ability,
19:724:45046:14:15:70:540:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:thereby increasing the mean wage. It does not, however, affect payoffs in the presence of a
19:725:45137:15:14:70:541:665:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f23:grade disclosure policy. Therefore,a minimum grade requirement increases the support for
19:726:45225:14:15:70:540:651:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:grade non-disclosure. Paradoxically, the same minimum grade policies that have been enacted
19:727:45316:15:34:70:524:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:as a reaction to grade non-disclosure may be helping grade non-disclosure to perpetuate.

19:729:45426:22:15:70:540:580:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Although schools are not allowed to disclose grades to potential employers, they are allowed
19:730:45518:15:14:70:540:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to distribute awards and honors to students with “exceptional performance.”  Moreover,
19:731:45604:14:15:70:540:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:because the law treats awards and honors as directory information, schools may disclose this
19:732:45696:15:14:70:176:536:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:information publicly.
19:733:45717:14:15:88:541:522:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Consider an award or honor given to a fraction of students with the highest grades.
19:734:45800:15:14:70:540:507:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Formally, the award is modeled as a binary signal distinguishing the students with grades in

19:736:45984:14:15:70:540:479:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:reveal any additional information when grades are disclosed, it does not affect the equilibrium
19:737:46079:15:14:70:540:464:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of the continuation game after a grade disclosure policy has been selected. However, in the
19:738:46170:14:15:70:540:450:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:case of grade non-disclosure, allowing students with the highest grades to separate themselves
19:739:46264:15:14:70:483:435:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:reduces the mean wage of the students who have not received such a distinction.
19:740:46343:14:15:88:541:421:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:More formally, consider the continuation game after non-disclosure has been selected (the
19:741:46432:15:14:70:540:406:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:continuation game after disclosure is selected is trivial). There are no pure strategy equilibria.

19:749:46759:30:14:70:540:316:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:If a positive mass of typesθ∈(θ∗α,θ∗∗α)chooses low effort, types slightly belowθ∗αprefer to
19:750:46850:14:14:70:541:302:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:exert high effort and get the prize. However, if types slightly belowθ∗αchoose high effort,
19:751:46941:14:15:70:540:288:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:all types in(θ∗α,θ∗∗α)prefer to choose high effort as well and guarantee that they will get the
19:752:47036:15:14:70:540:273:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:prize. But if all types in(θ∗α,θ∗∗α)choose high effort, those belowθ∗αhave no chance of getting
19:753:47131:14:15:70:541:259:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the prize and, therefore, choose low effort. Yet, if all types belowθ∗αchoose low effort, all
19:754:47224:15:14:70:540:244:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:types aboveθ∗αcan win the prize even with low effort and, therefore, choose low effort. Thus,
19:755:47317:14:15:70:323:230:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:we cannot have an equilibrium in pure strategies.
19:756:47366:15:14:88:541:215:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:There exist, however, equilibria in mixed strategies. We characterize these equilibria in
19:757:47455:14:15:70:540:201:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the Appendix but discuss their intuition here. Any mixed strategy equilibrium partitions the
19:758:47547:15:14:70:541:186:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:type space in three intervals. In the first interval,[θ0,θα)all types choose low effort and never
19:759:47644:14:14:70:541:172:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:win the prize. In the second interval,[θα, ̄θα],almost all types play strictly mixed strategies.
19:760:47740:14:15:70:540:158:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:They get the prize when they playe= 1and they do not get the prize when they playe= 0.
19:761:47826:15:14:70:491:143:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In the third interval,( ̄θα,θ1], all types choose the low effort but still get the prize.
19:762:47915:14:15:88:541:129:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Since a positive mass of students exerts high effort, the ex-ante welfare in all of these
19:763:48004:15:14:70:540:114:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:equilibria is strictly greater than in the equilibria of the model with no awards when effort
19:764:48097:14:25:70:124:100:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is efficient.
19:765:48110:25:0:70:540:75:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f23:Proposition 7.Consider the model of either Section 2 or 3. Suppose it is efficient to exert

20:767:48293:15:24:70:309:694:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:an award strictly increases the ex-ante welfare.
20:768:48341:24:15:70:541:670:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f8:Proof.Existence of a mixed strategy equilibrium for the continuation game follows from
20:769:48427:15:14:70:540:655:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:standard arguments. Since the game does not have an equilibrium in which almost all types
20:770:48516:14:15:70:541:641:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f15:exert low effort, there must be a positive mass of types who exert high effort. Letλ >0
20:771:48603:15:14:70:541:626:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:denote the mass of such types. The ex-ante payoff is thenEα[θ] +λ(κ−c)which is greater
20:772:48689:14:23:70:321:612:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:than the ex-ante payoff without the awardEα[θ].
20:773:48736:23:15:88:541:589:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Whenever the prize is given to less than half of students, the majority will oppose it.
20:774:48823:15:14:70:540:574:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Because the median voter will not be able to obtain the prize without exerting high effort,
20:775:48914:14:15:70:540:560:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:he must be at most indifferent between exerting high and low efforts. However, when the
20:776:49001:15:14:70:540:545:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:median voter exerts low effort, he does not win the prize and obtains a strictly lower wage
20:777:49092:14:15:70:540:531:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:than the wage he would obtain in the absence of this policy. Thus, a prize makes the median
20:778:49183:15:14:70:148:516:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:voter worse off.
20:779:49199:14:14:88:541:502:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:More generally, the exclusion of the top of the distribution lowers the payoff under non-

20:781:49377:15:14:70:541:473:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the distribution( ̄θα,θ1]. Therefore, except when the distribution is sufficiently concentrated
20:782:49472:14:15:70:540:459:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:at the top and the award is given to a large proportion of students, an award policy reduces
20:783:49564:15:40:70:239:444:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:support for grade non-disclosure.
20:784:49597:40:26:70:187:404:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:6  Conclusion
20:785:49610:26:14:70:540:378:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Grade non-disclosure is prevalent among elite MBA programs but not commonly found in
20:786:49694:14:15:70:540:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:lower ranked MBA programs as well as other professional degree programs with external
20:787:49779:15:14:70:540:349:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:certification. Students suggest that grade non-disclosure policies allow them to take more
20:788:49869:14:15:70:540:335:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:difficult classes.  For example, the former president of the student association at Chicago
20:789:49960:15:14:70:540:320:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Booth School of Business, April Park, argues that “grade non-disclosure allows students to
20:790:50050:14:15:70:531:306:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f9:take more challenging courses instead of taking classes in which they are over-qualified.”19
20:791:50142:15:14:88:541:291:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:However, self-reported levels of curriculum effort have actually fallen since grade non-
20:792:50230:14:15:70:540:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:disclosure policies were adopted.  According to the chairman of Harvard’s MBA program
20:793:50315:15:14:70:540:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Richard Ruback, “numerous students had claimed that the non-disclosure policy resulted in
20:794:50404:14:14:70:541:248:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:little motivation to excel.”20Akram Zaman, former co-president of the Harvard’s Student
20:795:50491:14:15:70:540:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Association’s Executive Committee, claims that “there is a perception that general academic
20:796:50582:15:14:70:540:219:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:motivation and rigor has gone down [since the adoption of grade non-disclosure]. (...) People
20:797:50675:14:15:70:540:205:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:think that they won’t be in the top fraction of the class and that they won’t fail out, so many
20:798:50770:15:14:70:541:190:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of them take on the attitude that they don’t need to work as hard.”21As a Stanford GSB
20:799:50856:14:15:70:540:176:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:student puts it, “[t]he grade non-disclosure policy is somewhat of a curse because it inspires

21:806:51256:0:15:88:541:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:At Wharton, the amount of time spent on academics fell by 22% in the first four years
21:807:51341:15:14:70:541:694:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:after grade non-disclosure was implemented.23Moreover, the pattern of courses waved by
21:808:51427:14:15:70:541:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:students was not affected by the introduction of grade nondisclosure.24Therefore, the idea
21:809:51517:15:14:70:540:665:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:that grade non-disclosure allows students to take more challenging courses cannot account
21:810:51606:14:15:70:540:651:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:for the trend in average studying effort among MBA students. It is also not clear why the
21:811:51695:15:14:70:540:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:benefit from taking more difficult classes would be restricted to elite MBA programs, which
21:812:51786:14:14:70:476:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is needed to explain the cross-sectional pattern of grade non-disclosure policies.
21:813:51868:14:15:88:541:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The Student Handbook of Stanford GSB mentions that grade non-disclosure improves
21:814:51948:15:14:70:540:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:student cooperation. This hypothesis is also problematic. As Kreps (2005) argues, “[h]elping
21:815:52040:14:15:70:540:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:one or two or ten classmates here probably does not materially affect your chances of landing
21:816:52133:15:14:70:540:564:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a desirable job (...). There are 370 or so of you. How likely is it that you will compete for
21:817:52226:14:15:70:540:550:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a given job with one of the people in your circle?” Even if there are gains from cooperation,
21:818:52319:15:14:70:540:535:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the time-series evidence suggests that they are coming at the expense of reduced studying
21:819:52408:14:15:70:540:521:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:effort. Moreover, it is again unclear why the importance of cooperation is restricted to elite
21:820:52502:15:14:70:454:506:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:MBA programs and not other MBA or other professional degree programs.
21:821:52571:14:14:88:541:492:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Our model explains why students in elite programs might pass non-disclosure norms
21:822:52652:14:15:70:540:478:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:that reduce both their signal and their level of effort if they dislike studying. Our model also
21:823:52748:15:14:70:540:463:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:explains why non-disclosure appears to be fairly unique to elite MBA programs. Interestingly,
21:824:52841:14:15:70:540:449:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:minimum grade requirements, which were implemented as a way of combating non-disclosure,
21:825:52929:15:14:70:540:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:actually increases its support in equilibrium, precisely by enhancing the wage of colluding
21:826:53020:14:15:70:540:420:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:students. In contrast, awards reduce the support for non-disclosure by reducing the wage of
21:827:53111:15:14:70:540:405:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:colluding students who are not able to earn the distinction. External certification reduces
21:828:53202:14:15:70:459:391:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the support for non-disclosure by reducing the incremental cost of studying.
21:829:53278:15:14:88:541:376:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Our results, therefore, identify two mechanisms – certification exams and awards – that
21:830:53365:14:14:70:540:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:can reduce support for non-disclosure in equilibrium. Most schools with non-disclosure norms
21:831:53457:14:15:70:540:348:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:currently utilize some form of prizes or honors. But MBA students are not subject to certi-
21:832:53548:15:14:70:540:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:fication requirements in a way that would change the level of effort of the median student,
21:833:53639:14:15:70:540:319:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:which is likely substantially more powerful.  Certification (or a minimum grade threshold
21:834:53728:15:14:70:540:304:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:that is more stringent than current practice) is both legal and is not generally practiced, as
21:835:53822:14:52:70:510:290:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in other professional occupations. Future work could explore this issue in more detail.

21:843:54332:16:12:70:540:109:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:don’t always see their studies as their top priority, but instead look to balance their time between academics,
21:844:54443:12:12:70:540:97:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:career search, and social fun. This is made possible by the school’s grade nondisclosure policy, which prevents
21:845:54554:12:8:70:398:85:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:students from sharing their grades with recruiters.” Wise and Hauser, ibid.

25:1129:61431:21:14:88:541:491:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:There are two types of effort:  studying for classese∈ {0,1}, and studying for the

25:1131:61602:15:26:70:268:462:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is additively separable between efforts:

25:1133:61667:26:15:88:541:410:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The cost of effort is represented by the strictly increasing functionc(e,s),satisfying de-

25:1135:61854:14:15:70:540:381:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:s= 1. We maintain the assumption that the distribution of productivities in the case of zero
25:1136:61946:15:24:70:481:366:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:effort for class is skewed to the right so that the median is lower than the mean:

25:1138:62080:24:15:70:540:318:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We also assume that studying for the certification exam does not increase the mean (expected)
25:1139:62173:15:24:70:398:303:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:productivity by more than it increases the median productivity:

25:1144:62575:14:15:70:541:211:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of the benefit of studying for certification is skewed to the right. For example, supposehis

25:1147:62693:21:14:70:541:161:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:whereβ≥0in order to satisfy decreasing differences andγ∈R. Assumption 5 is satisfied
25:1148:62777:14:15:70:222:147:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f14:if and only ifθMedianα≤Eα[θ].
25:1149:62806:15:14:88:541:132:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:It is reasonable to assume that a certification technology that ensures that all students

25:1151:62983:15:14:70:540:103:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:than the productivity of skilled students (decreasing differences). Assumption 5 will then be
25:1152:63076:14:15:70:540:89:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:satisfied as long as the distribution of abilities is skewed to the right, consistent with previous

26:1165:63921:26:25:146:465:493:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f8:f(θMedianα,1,1)−E[f(θ,0,1)] =h(θMedianα,1)−E[h(θ,1)],and

26:1167:64030:20:26:88:298:448:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Suppose inequality (8) is satisfied. Then,

26:1171:64148:25:14:70:540:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:where the first inequality follows by Assumption 5, the second is due to (8) , and the third
26:1172:64240:14:35:70:479:348:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:follows from the decreasing differences property ofc.Hence, (9) is also satisfied.

26:1174:64342:22:14:70:540:291:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In this section, we consider the model with a continuum of effort levels:e∈[e0,e1].Each

26:1184:64760:14:15:88:541:214:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:As before, the student’s utility function isU(w,e) =w−c(e),wherecis strictly increasing.
26:1185:64848:15:14:70:540:199:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Because grades are strictly increasing in ability, there exists an inverse functiong−1(θ,-)such

26:1188:64973:20:25:70:456:150:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:LettingC(θ,g) =c(g−1(θ,g)),we can write the utility function of typeθas

26:1193:65095:10:15:88:541:85:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Treating grades as the student’s choice variable, the continuation game after grade disclo-
