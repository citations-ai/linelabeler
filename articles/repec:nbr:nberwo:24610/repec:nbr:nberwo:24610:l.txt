2:42:2777:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Information  about  children’s  school  performance  appears  to  be  readily  available.  Do  frictions 
2:43:2882:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:prevent parents,   particularly low-income  parents,   from   acting   on   this   information   when 
2:44:2983:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:making decisions? I conduct a field experiment in Malawi to test this. I find that parents’ baseline 
2:45:3083:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:beliefs  about  their  children’s academic  performance  are  inaccurate.  Providing  parents  with 
2:46:3182:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:clear  and  digestible    academic    performance information    causes    them    to    update    their 
2:47:3286:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:beliefs   and correspondingly  adjust  their  investments:  they increase  the  school  enrollment  of 
2:48:3388:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:their  higher-performing  children,  decrease  the  enrollment  of  their lower-performing  children, 
2:49:3489:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:and  choose educational inputs that are more closely matched to their children’s academic level. 
2:50:3585:14:14:71:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:These  effects  demonstrate  the  presence  of  important  frictions  preventing  the  use  of available 
2:51:3689:14:42:71:511:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:information, with heterogeneity analysis suggesting the frictions are worse among the poor.

3:63:4097:0:21:72:208:700:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:C:1Introduction
3:64:4110:21:18:95:539:679:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:It is commonly believed that one reason poor households remain poor is that they lack
3:65:4195:18:18:72:540:661:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:information that the rich possess (World Bank, 1998, 2008). Indeed, there is extensive ev-
3:66:4285:18:18:72:540:643:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:idence that providing information to poor individuals a↵ects their decision-making across
3:67:4374:18:18:72:540:625:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:many domains including health (e.g., Dupas (2011)), education (e.g., Jensen (2010)), and
3:68:4462:18:18:72:540:607:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:labor supply (e.g., Chetty and Saez (2009)). However, the vast majority of this evidence
3:69:4550:18:18:72:540:589:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:concerns information that even richer households may not have or use, such as the economic
3:70:4640:18:18:72:540:571:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:returns to education or market-level summary statistics. The question remains whether fric-
3:71:4731:18:18:72:540:553:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:tions prevent the poor from taking advantage of information that seems available to all, but
3:72:4823:18:18:72:493:535:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:which perhaps only those in richer households or countries can access and exploit.
3:73:4905:18:18:95:539:517:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:I examine these issues in a high-stakes environment: Parents making decisions about
3:74:4988:18:18:72:540:499:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:their children’s education. It is widely presumed that the correct educational decisions (such
3:75:5082:18:18:72:540:481:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:as whether to go to college or sign up for remedial tutoring) vary across individuals. Anec-
3:76:5174:18:18:72:540:463:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:dotally, in developing countries, the most important child-specific factor that determines
3:77:5264:18:17:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parents’ educational decisions is their children’s school performance. School performance
3:78:5353:17:18:72:540:428:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:information also appears to be freely available: schools worldwide deliver report cards to
3:79:5443:18:18:72:540:410:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parents that contain this information, and parents can also observe their children’s academic
3:80:5536:18:18:72:540:392:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:skills directly. And yet, there may be barriers preventing some parents from making use of
3:81:5626:18:18:72:540:374:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:this information (Banerjee et al., 2010). For example, parents in developing countries are of-
3:82:5720:18:18:72:540:356:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ten illiterate and may not be able to read or understand report cards. Limited education may
3:83:5812:18:18:72:540:338:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:also make it di-cult for parents to judge their children’s performance themselves, especially
3:84:5905:18:18:72:533:320:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f6:B:if their children go further in school than they did, as is common in developing countries.1
3:85:5997:18:18:95:539:302:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:This paper establishes that there are in fact substantial and consequential information
3:86:6084:18:18:72:540:284:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:frictions among poor parents regarding their children’s school performance.2First, I show
3:87:6173:18:18:72:540:266:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that many parents in a developing country context have inaccurate beliefs about their chil-
3:88:6264:18:18:72:540:248:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:dren’s school performance. Second, I demonstrate that parents base important educational
3:89:6352:18:18:72:540:230:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:decisions upon their inaccurate beliefs, even though they would like to use the correct infor-
3:90:6446:18:17:72:540:212:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:mation that is, in principle, readily available. Third, I use a randomized experiment to show
3:91:6539:17:18:72:540:195:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that a simple informational intervention can significantly alleviate the impacts of limited
3:92:6630:18:18:72:540:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:information: Providing information directly to parents in a clear and digestible way causes
3:93:6721:18:18:72:540:159:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parents to update their beliefs and adjust their decisions accordingly. Finally, I provide sug-
3:94:6816:18:18:72:540:141:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:gestive evidence on a link between information barriers and poverty, showing that poorer,
3:95:6905:18:16:85:539:123:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:1Free primary schooling in most developing countries only became widely available in the last 10-20 years,
3:96:7011:16:8:72:505:107:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:and the average adult in sub-Saharan Africa has fewer than 5 years of education (UNESCO, 2013).
3:97:7106:8:16:85:539:99:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:2Although this paper does not claim to distinguish between the various frictions at play, they may include
3:98:7212:16:12:72:540:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:parental illiteracy, limited parental ability to directly assess academic skills, the complexity of existing report
3:99:7327:12:0:72:343:71:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:cards, and problems with the report card delivery mechanism.
4:100:7388:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:less-educated parents have less accurate baseline beliefs than richer parents, and that both
4:101:7480:18:18:72:412:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:their beliefs and certain investments respond more to information.

4:103:7618:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:The experiment delivers information to randomly-selected parents with children in primary
4:104:7707:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:school about their children’s “academic performance” (which hereafter refers to performance
4:105:7798:18:18:72:539:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:on achievement tests administered by schools over the previous term).3The information is
4:106:7886:18:18:72:539:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:delivered verbally and in a clear manner. I measure the e↵ect of the information on parents’
4:107:7978:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs, and on a broad range of their investments and decisions, including both a series of
4:108:8070:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:real-stakes investment options and decisions presented to parents through the experiment
4:109:8158:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(“experimental outcomes”), and more traditional endline outcomes such as enrollment and
4:110:8245:18:18:72:517:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:attendance in school (“non-experimental outcomes”). The analysis proceeds as follows.
4:111:8330:18:18:95:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:I use baseline beliefs data to establish my first finding: that parents’ beliefs are inaccu-
4:112:8422:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:rate. On average, parents’ beliefs about academic performance diverge from true performance
4:113:8513:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:by more than one standard deviation of the performance distribution. When comparing two
4:114:8600:17:18:72:537:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of their children, one third of parents are mistaken about which child is higher-performing.

4:116:8766:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:decisions to test whether inaccurate beliefs a↵ect parents’ decisions. I establish my second
4:117:8858:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:finding – that, at baseline, parents base important decisions on their inaccurate beliefs – by
4:118:8952:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:demonstrating that, in the control group, the relationship between believed performance and
4:119:9043:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments is stronger than the relationship between true performance and investments. I
4:120:9132:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:then show my third finding – that the information intervention alleviates knowledge barriers

4:122:9312:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments becomes stronger, increasing to resemble the relationship in the control group
4:123:9402:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:betweenbelievedperformance and investment. This is because parents’ beliefs become more
4:124:9489:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:closely aligned with true performance, and they adjust their investments accordingly. The
4:125:9578:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:analyses show that student performance is an important input into parents’ decisions, but
4:126:9667:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that parents are often quite wrong about performance, resulting in important investment
4:127:9754:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:“mistakes” (i.e., wedges between how parents would like to allocate their investments given
4:128:9845:18:18:72:499:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:their children’s true academic performance, and how they allocate them in reality).

4:131:10095:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:child is not what parents want given children’s academic performance. I test for this using
4:132:10186:18:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:both enrollment in primary school, and an experimental outcome proxying for resources
4:133:10271:18:18:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:allocated towards secondary school. Providing information has impacts on both, causing
4:134:10357:18:18:72:540:98:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:reallocations towards higher-performing students in both cases. This suggests parents prefer
4:135:10449:18:15:85:539:80:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:3As described in Section 3, the Ministry of Education in Malawi requires all schools to send report cards
4:136:10554:15:0:72:523:65:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:to parents; thus, academic performance information should in theory be freely available in this context.
5:137:10659:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to allocate more years of schooling to their higher performers. This analysis clearly shows
5:138:10750:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that information frictions a↵ect investments; the implications for welfare then depend on
5:139:10839:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:whether there are other interacting market frictions, including whether parents are correct
5:140:10930:18:18:72:462:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:about the education production function, which I discuss later in the paper.
5:141:11006:18:18:95:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The second category of mistake I uncover is in thetypesof investment chosen for a

5:145:11347:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:demand for books designed for students of di↵erent performance levels. The prediction is
5:146:11435:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that returns will be higher if the level of the selected book matches the level of the child’s
5:147:11529:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance, and I find that providing information triples the closeness of the match. These
5:148:11621:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:types of parental decisions are now more relevant than ever in developing countries, since

5:151:11871:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that poorer, less-educated parents have less accurate baseline beliefs than richer parents, and
5:152:11966:18:18:72:516:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that they adjust their beliefs and certain investments more in response to information.

5:158:12490:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:such as the (normally unobservable) economic returns to an activity (e.g., Jensen (2010)),
5:159:12580:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:or statistics that require another entity’s private information, such as school-average stu-

5:166:13212:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:demonstrates a more surprising failure of optimization, but also because it provides evidence

7:230:17783:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:this choice diverges from the utility-maximizing choice (s⇤(↵i)6=s⇤(ai)), a “mistake” which
7:231:17874:18:18:72:276:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:causes her utility to be ine-ciently low.
7:232:17915:18:18:95:539:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:If we have data on↵, a,andsfrom a sample of parents investing as described above, what

7:234:18090:18:18:72:539:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:fact that each individual’s chosen investmentsdoes not vary withaaccording to the preferred

7:236:18272:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:across individuals – of investments chosen as a function oftrueperformance,  ̃s(a):=E(s|a),
7:237:18363:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:we thus want to test for a divergence between  ̃s(·)andthepreferredfunctions⇤(·). To

7:247:19205:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:slope. This attenuation in beliefs then causes  ̃s(·)tohaveaflatterslopethans⇤(·).11See
7:248:19292:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Appendix C.1.1 for proof.12The intuition is that parents choose investments based on their
7:249:19382:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(inaccurate) beliefs; thus investments are steeply sloped with beliefs, as depicted in Figure

7:253:19567:19:8:72:398:182:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:the preferred investment function will also depend on parental preferences.
7:254:19642:8:16:85:539:174:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:9This would hold if, for example, a parent’s expected utility problem minimizes a quadratic loss function
7:255:19747:16:8:72:212:158:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:between the chosensands⇤(a).
7:256:19775:8:15:81:539:150:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:10For example, this could be microfounded with a Bayesian updating model where parents’ prior beliefs
7:257:19876:15:9:72:428:135:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:are the population-averagea,and each parentireceives an imperfect signal ofai.
7:258:19954:9:15:81:539:126:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:11This attenuation can be seen as analogous to the attenuation bias caused by classical measurement error,
7:259:20060:15:12:72:539:111:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f22:F:but in order to make that analogy, one needs to think ofbeliefsas the correctly measured regressor andtrue
7:260:20166:12:9:72:537:99:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:ability as the mismeasured regressor. This is because the data generating process forsidepends on beliefs.
7:261:20272:9:15:81:540:90:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:12This assumess⇤(·) is monotonic ina,i.e., that a given investment is always either a substitute or
7:262:20371:15:0:72:516:75:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:complement witha, but does not switch between substitute and complement for di↵erent ranges ofa.
8:263:20468:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:if we look at children who aretrulyat the top of the distribution, many of their parents think
8:264:20562:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:they are below the top, and so on average choose inputs appropriate for lower-performing
8:265:20650:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children. Analogously, many parents of children at the bottom of the distribution choose
8:266:20738:18:18:72:543:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:inputs appropriate for higher-performing children. This causes the slope of  ̃s(·)tobemore

9:312:24603:22:18:95:539:432:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The setting for the experiment is Malawi. Overall, the education system in Malawi is
9:313:24687:18:18:72:540:414:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:similar to the systems in many countries in both sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, in terms
9:314:24778:18:18:72:540:396:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of the information given to parents as well as the overall structure. Primary school in Malawi
9:315:24872:18:18:72:540:378:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:covers grades 1-8. Although it has technically been free since 1994, it does involve expen-

9:317:25045:18:18:72:540:342:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:annually per child, roughly 10.6 USD or 1% of annual household income. The main expendi-
9:318:25133:18:18:72:540:324:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:tures are uniforms (33% of total), informal but required school fees (22%), and supplemental

10:334:26599:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:report cards are often hard for parents to understand, or do not reach them. According to
10:335:26688:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:baseline survey data, 64% of parents state that they do not know their child’s performance
10:336:26778:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:from the last report; the main stated reasons are that the parents (a) were unable to read
10:337:26868:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:or understand the report, or (b) did not receive it in the first place. Students are supposed
10:338:26961:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to deliver the reports, so children could either lose or choose not to deliver them: parents of
10:339:27056:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:students who performed badly are much less likely to receive the report. In addition, among
10:340:27147:18:18:72:539:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the parents whothinkthey know their children’s performance, anecdotally, some do not. For
10:341:27236:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:example, some misunderstand the grading scale (e.g., think a “1” is the highest grade when
10:342:27326:18:29:72:191:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:in fact it is the lowest).
10:343:27352:29:19:72:252:517:206:g_d0_f3:206:g_d0_f3:C:3.1Experimental design
10:344:27374:19:18:95:539:498:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The experiment delivers academic performance information to randomly selected par-
10:345:27456:18:18:72:539:480:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ents and measures the e↵ects on educational investments and decisions. Although the school
10:346:27546:18:18:72:540:462:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:report cards should ostensibly already deliver this information, as described above, the re-
10:347:27638:18:18:72:540:444:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:port card system does not succeed in conveying the information; the experiment presents
10:348:27725:18:17:72:540:426:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the information more clearly. To fit the framework presented in Section 2, the experiment
10:349:27814:17:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:should provide information about the individual-level trait on which parents’ educational
10:350:27903:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments depend. According to qualitative interviews, parents in Malawi think academic
10:351:27992:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance (i.e., scores on school-administered exams) is the most important determinant
10:352:28081:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of both their investments and the returns to educational investments. If parents were wrong
10:353:28172:18:18:72:540:337:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:about the education production function, a second objective relevant for a scale-up would be
10:354:28264:18:18:72:540:319:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to use the trait most correlated withactualindividual-level returns. Academic performance
10:355:28353:18:18:72:540:301:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:likely also meets this second objective: It determines progression through school and selection
10:356:28448:18:18:72:539:283:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:into secondary school, thereby almost surely a↵ecting the returns to investment. “Innate”
10:357:28537:18:18:72:540:265:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ability is another possible determinant of returns, but, as has been extensively documented,
10:358:28629:18:18:72:539:247:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:it is di-cult to measure “innate” ability; any measure would represent some combination of
10:359:28719:18:21:72:433:229:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:innate ability and past inputs. (See Section 4.5 for further discussion.)
10:360:28792:21:18:95:539:208:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f4:A:Sample selection:The study worked with 39 schools in two districts (Machinga and
10:361:28872:18:18:72:540:190:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Balaka) in Malawi. Schools were selected randomly from the universe of primary schools,
10:362:28959:18:18:72:540:172:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:oversampling schools with high and low expected levels of parent education to increase
10:363:29045:18:18:72:540:154:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:heterogeneity in parent education within the sample. The study team first conducted a
10:364:29130:18:18:72:540:136:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:census at schools, mapping the sibling structures for all students in grades 2-6, which were
10:365:29222:18:18:72:540:118:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:chosen because they span most of primary school. Since one of the outcomes to be examined
10:366:29311:18:18:72:540:100:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:is inter-sibling tradeo↵s, multiple-sibling households were used as the sampling frame (fewer
10:367:29404:18:18:72:540:82:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:than 3% of households in Malawi with children have only one child). The team also gathered
10:368:29494:18:0:72:540:64:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:achievement test data from the most recent term (term 2 of the 2011-2012 school year) for
11:369:29584:0:18:72:190:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:use in the intervention.
11:370:29608:18:18:95:539:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Based on the test score and sibling data, a sample of 3,451 households with at least two
11:371:29696:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children enrolled in grades 2-6 with test score data was drawn. For households with more
11:372:29784:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:than two children, two were randomly selected. Because one inclusion criterion was that
11:373:29871:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children needed test score data, students who have the highest absence rates (and whose
11:374:29958:18:22:72:536:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parents might have the largest information problems) are under-represented in my sample.
11:375:30046:22:18:95:539:596:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f4:A:Randomization:I randomly assigned half the households in the sample to a treatment
11:376:30128:18:17:72:540:578:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:group that received information about their children’s test scores, and half to a control group,
11:377:30224:17:18:72:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:which did not.14The randomization was stratified on a test score measure (between-sibling
11:378:30313:18:18:72:540:543:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:score gap), and a proxy for parent education (the estimated literacy rate in the household’s
11:379:30405:18:22:72:487:525:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:village), since oneex antegoal was to look at heterogeneity by parent education.
11:380:30485:22:18:95:540:503:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f4:A:Eligibility interviews:Sample selection and randomization were based on data gath-
11:381:30567:18:18:72:540:485:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ered from students at school and on school administrative data. Household eligibility (i.e.,
11:382:30659:18:18:72:540:467:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:whether both siblings lived in the household and were still enrolled in school) was then
11:383:30747:18:18:72:540:449:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:verified through an eligibility questionnaire with parents. Among the 3,451 sampled house-
11:384:30837:18:17:72:540:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:holds, 21% of households were found to be ineligible during the parent interviews, leaving
11:385:30927:17:18:72:540:414:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:a sample of 2,716 eligible households. Of the 2,716 sampled and eligible households, 97%
11:386:31015:18:18:72:540:396:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(2,634 households) were located at their homes, available, and consented to participate in
11:387:31105:18:18:72:540:378:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the baseline survey. Thus, the final experimental sample comprises 5,268 parent-child pairs.
11:388:31197:18:22:72:516:360:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Both eligibility and baseline survey completion are unrelated to treatment assignment.
11:389:31283:22:18:95:540:338:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f4:A:Baseline survey visit:Surveyors visited all sampled households and asked to speak
11:390:31364:18:18:72:539:320:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:with the parent who is the primary decision-maker about education.15Surveyors then con-
11:391:31451:18:18:72:540:302:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ducted a baseline survey, which included a module on education spending and beliefs about
11:392:31540:18:18:72:540:284:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children’s test scores. While eliciting baseline beliefs about test scores, surveyors explained
11:393:31635:18:17:72:540:266:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the grading scale used by schools to parents; they also reviewed a sample report card with
11:394:31725:17:18:72:540:249:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the same format as those later delivered to the treatment group. This was done to aid the
11:395:31814:18:18:72:540:231:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:elicitation of beliefs and to hold knowledge of the grading scale and report card format con-
11:396:31907:18:18:72:540:213:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:stant across treatment groups. After the survey, during the same visit, surveyors conducted
11:397:31998:18:22:72:345:195:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the information intervention for the treatment group.
11:398:32051:22:18:95:540:173:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f4:A:Information intervention and report cards (Treatment group only):Surveyors
11:399:32125:18:16:81:539:155:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:14Half the treatment group was also assigned to receive an add-on intervention designed to test a hypothesis
11:400:32233:16:12:72:540:139:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:intended for study in separate work: that providing more detailed information would increase parental
11:401:32334:12:12:72:540:127:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:engagement, as measured through non-monetary and monetary investments. This group received additional
11:402:32435:12:12:72:540:115:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:skills information (e.g., whether their child could add 3-digit numbers, see Online Appendix I for sample).
11:403:32542:12:12:72:540:103:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:In this paper, I ignore this add-on treatment and pool the treatment households. I do not find that this
11:404:32646:12:8:72:309:91:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:treatment had an e↵ect on the pre-specified outcomes.
11:405:32699:8:16:81:539:83:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:15If that parent was unavailable, the surveyor spoke with the second parent if that parent was present and
11:406:32805:16:0:72:415:67:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:knowledgeable about educational decisions. If not, the surveyor returned later.
12:407:32885:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:walked parents in the treatment group through two report cards (one per child) describing
12:408:32974:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the academic performance of their children. The order was randomized. The reports showed
12:409:33062:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children’s performance on all tests administered in the most recent school term, specifically:
12:410:33156:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the percent score (an absolute measure), the corresponding grade on the Malawian grading
12:411:33244:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:scale, and the within-class percentile ranking (see Online Appendix J for more details). The
12:412:33336:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:statistics were listed for the three subjects that Malawian educators deem most important
12:413:33425:18:18:72:544:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:–math,English,andChichewa,thelocallanguage–andfor“overall”(theaverageofthe
12:414:33499:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:three). The report card also showed the number of individual tests included in the averages;
12:415:33591:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the sample average is 4.5 tests. The correlation between students’ scores on the di↵erent
12:416:33680:18:18:72:503:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:individual tests is roughly 0.8 for overall performance, and 0.6 - 0.7 within subjects.
12:417:33767:18:18:95:539:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:A sample report card is presented in Appendix B. The format was chosen based on a
12:418:33848:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:series of focus groups, with the primary selection criterion being how well uneducated parents
12:419:33942:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:could understand it. Surveyors, who were trained on how to explain the information clearly,
12:420:34033:18:30:72:426:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:walked treatment parents through every number on the report cards.

12:422:34119:19:18:95:539:425:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The analysis uses several data sources, including data from surveys with parents and
12:423:34203:18:18:72:540:407:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:administrative data from schools. Online Appendix J.1 shows the survey questions that mea-
12:424:34293:18:17:72:540:389:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:sured beliefs and the experimental outcomes, and the scripts for the information intervention.
12:425:34387:17:18:95:539:372:143:g_d0_f9:143:g_d0_f4:A:(1) Baseline survey data:The baseline survey was rolled out immediately after term 2
12:426:34471:18:18:72:540:354:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of the school year ended in March 2012, and ran from April to June of 2012. The survey
12:427:34557:18:18:72:540:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:included modules on demographics, education spending, and the perceived returns to educa-
12:428:34646:18:18:72:540:318:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:tion. Mean beliefs about academic performance were measured by asking parents about the
12:429:34733:18:18:72:540:300:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:same performance metrics that were later delivered in the intervention report cards – average
12:430:34826:18:18:72:540:282:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:scores and percentile rankings on the term 2 school exams in math, English, Chichewa, and
12:431:34915:18:18:72:540:264:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:overall. We used the same measure later used in the intervention so that any gaps between
12:432:35004:18:18:72:539:246:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:believed and true performance represent belief inaccuracies, not di↵erences between mea-
12:433:35092:18:18:72:540:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:sures. Beliefs uncertainty was measured by asking parents to distribute tokens across bins
12:434:35182:18:18:72:262:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:representing score ranges (e.g., 0-20).

12:439:35551:18:18:72:540:121:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:others, allowing the outcomes to more cleanly reflect parents’ preferences, as opposed to the
12:440:35644:18:18:72:540:103:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:preferences of the people they talk to, including their children. Recall that there are two
12:441:35735:18:18:72:540:85:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:main categories of investment outcomes: (i) a series of real-stakes investment options and
12:442:35825:18:0:72:540:67:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:decisions presented to parents through the experiment (“experimental outcomes”); and (ii)
13:443:35916:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:more traditional endline outcomes measured during the year after the intervention, such as
13:444:36006:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:enrollment (“non-experimental” or longer-term outcomes). This survey measured the first
13:445:36093:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:category, which is described in more detail in Section 3.2.1 below, as well as endline beliefs.
13:446:36188:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:When measuring endline beliefs, because I wish to assess whether information a↵ects the
13:447:36275:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs underlying parents’ behavior, I want to know both whether (a) parents understood
13:448:36363:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and believed the information presented in the intervention, and (b) the information is relevant
13:449:36458:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for their decisions going forward. As a result, surveyors asked parents what score they thought
13:450:36553:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:their child would receive if he took an examthat same day. Asking about the previous-term
13:451:36642:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:scores as done in the baseline survey would only have measured (a), since those exams
13:452:36727:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:happened in the past; asking about a (hypothetical) same-day measure allows us to also
13:453:36813:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:assess (b). I refer to these beliefs as “endline beliefs.” Beliefs uncertainty was not measured
13:454:36908:18:18:72:261:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:at endline due to budget constraints.

13:456:37019:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the year following the intervention: (i) a second endline survey of parents 1 year after the
13:457:37111:17:18:72:539:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:intervention (June-July 2013), which I use to examine treatment e↵ects on dropouts and
13:458:37197:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:expenditures, and (ii) administrative data on attendance gathered roughly 1 month after
13:459:37284:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the intervention (July 2012). These outcomes allow me to establish the policy relevance of
13:460:37374:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the findings. For the 1-year second endline data collection, given the very limited budget
13:461:37464:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:available, I focused on outcomes where (a) I expected results, and (b) data collection costs
13:462:37556:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:were lower. I thus focused on dropouts and expenditures, rather than academic performance.
13:463:37646:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Dropouts and expenditures are parental decisions that are easy to adjust, whereas academic
13:464:37736:18:18:72:539:331:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance reflects many other factors. There was su-cient budget to include roughly 900
13:465:37825:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:households in the second endline survey sample. Of the households selected for the sample,
13:466:37915:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:98% (893) were successfully surveyed, balanced across treatment group. The administrative
13:467:38004:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:attendance data was gathered by giving schools templates to record the data for the month
13:468:38093:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:following the intervention, and was collected from 35% of the sample. During the attendance
13:469:38184:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:data collection, we were able to collect data on endline exams for 9% of the sample, which
13:470:38274:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:allows me to validate the accuracy of the baseline academic performance measure, but does
13:471:38363:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:not give su-cient statistical power to look at treatment e↵ects. See Online Appendix J.2 for
13:472:38455:18:22:72:440:188:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:more detail on the sample and data for the non-experimental outcomes.
13:473:38524:22:18:72:251:166:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:C:3.2.1Experimental outcomes
13:474:38550:18:18:95:539:148:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:During the first endline survey, surveyors presented parents with three real-stakes in-
13:475:38637:18:18:72:540:130:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:vestment decisions (the “experimental outcomes”). While the non-experimental outcomes
13:476:38722:18:18:72:540:112:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:are preferable from a policy-relevance perspective, these experimental outcomes have sev-
13:477:38811:18:18:72:540:94:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:eral advantages. The primary advantage is that they enable me to include outcomes that
13:478:38897:18:0:72:539:76:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:are designed to have clear predictions for how the e-cient investment depends on student
14:479:38987:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance, allowing for a clean test of whether misinformation causes mistakes. They also
14:480:39078:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:allow me to include outcomes where the “preferred investment function” is homogeneous by
14:481:39166:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parental education, allowing me to cleanly test for whom inaccurate beliefs matter more.
14:482:39254:18:18:72:451:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Finally, they are very precise, allowing for detailed heterogeneity analysis.
14:483:39331:18:18:95:539:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The outcomes include a combination of monetary investments involving cash outlays,
14:484:39413:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and choices between free options. The latter allow us to abstract away from credit con-
14:485:39500:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:straints, which is useful for heterogeneity analysis as it enables cross-household comparisons
14:486:39594:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that are not confounded by household wealth. The outcomes also incorporate both smaller
14:487:39681:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments that primarily assess e↵ects on thetypesof investments parents choose, i.e.,
14:488:39769:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:whether they tailor the input mix correctly to their children’s needs, and a larger outcome
14:489:39860:18:21:72:473:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:designed to detect treatment e↵ects on thelevelof investment across children.
14:490:39937:21:18:95:540:507:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f4:A:Outcomes capturing thetypeof investment:The first decision presented to par-
14:491:40013:18:18:72:540:489:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ents is a choice among free workbooks with di↵erent di-culty levels. We gave parents four
14:492:40102:18:18:72:540:471:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:free books – an English and a math book for each of their two children. For each book, par-
14:493:40193:18:18:72:540:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ents were allowed to choose between three levels of di-culty: beginner, average, or advanced.
14:494:40286:18:18:72:539:435:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:The obvious prediction is that book di-culty choice will increase in perceived performance.
14:495:40377:18:18:95:539:417:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The second investment is the willingness to pay (WTP) for subject-specific remedial
14:496:40460:18:18:72:540:399:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:textbooks in math and English. WTP was evaluated using a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak
14:497:40540:18:18:72:540:381:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(BDM) methodology, which gives respondents an incentive to report truthfully (see Online
14:498:40628:18:18:72:540:363:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Appendix K for description). The elicitation was real-stakes, with parents paying out-of-
14:499:40717:18:18:72:540:345:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:pocket for the textbooks using their own money, and the maximum price on the price list
14:500:40804:18:17:72:540:327:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:equal to the full market price. The average WTP for a book was substantial: 324 MWK (2
14:501:40890:17:18:72:540:310:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:USD), or roughly 20% of mean annual per-child educational expenditures. We use remedial
14:502:40977:18:18:72:540:292:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:textbooks (textbooks perceived by teachers as substitutes with performance). Thus, the
14:503:41063:18:18:72:540:274:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:prediction is that WTP will be higher for the subject in which parents think their child is
14:504:41154:18:18:72:540:256:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:doing worse; this was anex anteprediction, later confirmed by baseline survey questions
14:505:41241:18:18:72:507:238:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:showing that 95% of parents believe the textbooks are substitutes with performance.
14:506:41324:18:18:95:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Both the textbooks and free workbooks have clear predictions for parents’ beliefs about
14:507:41411:18:18:72:540:202:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the “right choice” (i.e., the perceived production function). An additional advantage is that
14:508:41504:18:18:72:539:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:both have clear predictions for theactualright choice and true production function. For
14:509:41591:18:18:72:540:166:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:example, the advanced workbook was designed specifically to be better for the higher per-
14:510:41680:18:18:72:540:148:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:formers in the sample. This enables a stronger argument that parental mistakes due to
14:511:41765:18:21:72:526:130:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:misinformation about child performance would lower actual (not just perceived) returns.

14:513:41927:18:18:72:540:91:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:is the first high-cost educational investment in Malawi. Few parents in the sample could
14:514:42015:18:0:72:539:73:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:a↵ord these fees for all of their children; many cannot for even a single child. My third
15:515:42106:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investment introduces a short-run, real-stakes proxy for secondary schooling. We conduct a
15:516:42196:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:lottery, in which the prize is four years of government secondary school fees for one child in
15:517:42290:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:every 100 households, worth roughly 120 - 240 USD at the time of the experiment. Parents
15:518:42378:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:were given nine tickets for the lottery and were asked to allocate the tickets across their two
15:519:42473:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children. There are many “binary” choices in education where credit-constrained parents
15:520:42560:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:must choose between a lumpy investment in one child or the other, for example if parents
15:521:42648:18:18:72:539:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:can only a↵ord to send one child to secondary school or college. The lottery ticket allocation
15:522:42742:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:– and in particular, which child the parent allocates more tickets to – was designed to proxy
15:523:42835:18:18:72:220:564:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f6:B:for these types of decisions.16
15:524:42866:18:18:95:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:There are two main channels through which academic performance would a↵ect the ex-
15:525:42948:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:pected return of a lottery ticket. First, through the earnings return to secondary school: 95%
15:526:43042:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(78%) of parents believe that secondary school increases the earnings of higher-performing
15:527:43132:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:students weakly (strictly) more than the earnings of lower-performing students, and, on av-
15:528:43223:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:erage, parents perceive the earnings increase to be 90% higher for a hypothetical child in
15:529:43313:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the top decile of performance than for one in the bottom decile. Second, since admissions is
15:530:43405:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:governed by performance on a standardized achievement test, the probability of admission
15:531:43493:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to secondary school increases with performance – a fact that 98% of parents are aware of.
15:532:43582:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Thus, the (perceived) expected value of the fees paid and the probability of attending in-
15:533:43672:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:crease with performance. Taking both channels together, a back-of-the-envelope calculation
15:534:43762:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:based on parents’ beliefs suggests that the perceived return is over 300% higher for students
15:535:43855:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:in the top vs. bottom performance decile.17Thus the prediction is that parents will allocate
15:536:43947:18:30:72:330:331:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:more lottery tickets to higher-performing children.

15:539:44113:18:18:72:540:264:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:control groups. 77% of respondents are female, and 92% are the primary education decision
15:540:44202:18:18:72:540:246:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:maker in the household. Average levels of parental education are low, at 4.7 years. Households
15:541:44296:18:18:72:540:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:are large, with an average of 5 children. Sampled children were 12 years old on average,

15:544:44565:18:18:72:540:174:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:are never large, with a joint test of equality failing to reject the null that all are 0 (p-value

15:546:44757:18:16:81:539:138:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:16Although a single ticket could have also accomplished this goal, I used multiple tickets to increase the
15:547:44863:16:12:72:540:122:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:power to detect small shifts and to allow me to make use of this lottery in a separate paper studying inequality
15:548:44975:12:12:72:540:110:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:aversion. As expected, most parents (74%) split their nine tickets as evenly as possible, consistent with an
15:549:45083:12:12:72:540:98:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:aversion to inequality between their children. The analysis thus reduces in most cases to analyzing which
15:550:45188:12:8:72:540:86:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:child the parents give their ninth ticket to, which proxies for the child they would choose in a binary choice.

16:553:45432:18:34:72:524:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:academic performance measure, although the results are robust to omitting this control.
16:554:45519:34:21:72:245:656:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:C:4Empirical results
16:555:45537:21:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:I begin by showing that parents have inaccurate beliefs about their children’s academic per-
16:556:45629:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:formance. I then demonstrate, using first the experimental and then the non-experimental
16:557:45717:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes, that their belief inaccuracies cause them to make mistakes when making decisions.
16:558:45808:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Finally, I provide evidence linking information frictions with poverty, and discuss the impli-
16:559:45902:18:29:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:cations of information frictions for welfare and the average level of investment in education.

16:562:46085:17:18:95:539:497:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Data from the baseline survey can be used to assess the accuracy of parents’ beliefs about
16:563:46175:18:18:72:540:479:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:their children’s “academic performance,” i.e., scores on school-administered exams the prior
16:564:46267:18:18:72:540:461:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:term. Figure 3(a) presents the average of the absolute value of the gap between parents’
16:565:46355:18:18:72:540:443:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:mean beliefs about their children’s academic performance and their children’s true academic
16:566:46446:18:18:72:539:425:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance. Scores are absolute percentages, expressed on a scale from 0 to 100.18The
16:567:46532:18:18:72:536:407:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:graph shows the treatment and control groups separately to demonstrate baseline balance.
16:568:46620:18:17:95:539:389:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The average gap is large: 20 points, or 1.2 standard deviations of the performance dis-
16:569:46707:17:18:72:540:372:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:tribution for overall performance. Table 1, Panel F shows that mean beliefs about individual
16:570:46799:18:18:72:540:354:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:subjects like math, between-subject performance (math vs. English), and the between-sibling
16:571:46890:18:18:72:540:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:gap are also inaccurate. Beliefs about the between-sibling gap diverge from the true gap by
16:572:46981:18:18:72:540:318:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:1.1 std. dev. on average, with 31% of parents wrong about which of their own children is
16:573:47069:18:18:72:472:300:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:higher-scoring. While parents overestimate on average, 21% of parents do not.
16:574:47146:18:18:95:539:282:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:As described in Section 2, these belief inaccuracies should cause mean beliefs to not
16:575:47231:18:18:72:540:264:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:move 1-to-1 with true scores and instead to be an attenuated function of true scores. Figure
16:576:47323:18:18:72:540:246:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:3(b) substantiates this for overall performance with a local linear regression of mean beliefs
16:577:47417:18:18:72:540:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:on true performance: the slope is visually less than 1. The attenuation in the slope captures
16:578:47510:18:18:72:540:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the fact that the correlations between believed and true performance are low: 0.3 for overall
16:579:47603:18:18:72:540:192:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance, as depicted in the graph, and 0.2-0.3 for performance in the individual subjects
16:580:47696:18:18:72:540:174:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:like math. Since these tests determine progression through school, these inaccuracies are likely
16:581:47792:18:16:72:285:156:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:relevant for a broad range of investments.
16:582:47834:16:16:81:540:140:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:18The online appendix shows that the main results are robust to using relative performance (within-
16:583:47933:16:12:72:540:124:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:class percentiles) instead of absolute performance. (Tables G.1, G.2, and G.3.) In my sample, absolute and
16:584:48039:12:12:72:539:112:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:relative performance are highly correlated (0.8). Rogers and Feller (2016) compare the e↵ects of relative versus
16:585:48151:12:12:72:540:100:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:absolute information about student absence rates from school; such a comparison was not a goal of this study.
16:586:48260:12:12:72:540:88:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:That being said, Online Appendix G.18 shows results when both measures are analyzed simultaneously, and
16:587:48363:12:12:72:540:76:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:parents seem to respond more to absolute than to relative information. Online Appendix J.4 discusses this
16:588:48468:12:0:72:503:64:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:in more detail, as well as explaining the other reasons that the analysis uses absolute performance.
17:589:48570:0:18:95:539:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:One natural question is whether these “inaccuracies” in beliefs simply reflect noise in
17:590:48657:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the performance measure. The data suggest otherwise. The correlation between tests taken
17:591:48745:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:during the term is 0.8 for overall performance, and 0.6-0.7 within subjects, which suggest
17:592:48835:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:high test reliability; these are notably higher than the correlations between parents’ beliefs
17:593:48929:18:18:72:539:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and the term-average scores (0.2-0.3). I also have data onfuturetest scores for a small
17:594:49016:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:subset of the sample which shows that baseline test scores are nine times more predictive of
17:595:49108:18:18:72:539:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:future test scores than parents’ baseline beliefs are.19Moreover, we can use the experiment
17:596:49199:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:itself to provide more evidence on this issue: If providing information to parents causes them
17:597:49293:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to update their beliefs, it suggests that parents themselves believe that there is additional
17:598:49386:18:22:72:508:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:meaningful content in the information that was not reflected in their baseline beliefs.

17:601:49594:18:17:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the impact of information on mean beliefs measured at endline. Recall that, unlike beliefs
17:602:49684:17:18:72:540:471:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:measured at baseline, the beliefs question asked at endline was not asking about last-term
17:603:49774:18:18:72:540:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:test scores; instead, it asked how well parents thought their child would do on a hypothetical
17:604:49868:18:18:72:540:435:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:test taken that same day. The prediction is thus that providing information should decrease
17:605:49959:18:18:72:540:417:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the gap between parents’ endline beliefs and their child’s last-term scores, as their posterior
17:606:50054:18:18:72:540:399:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs move in the direction of the signal; the gap however should not fall to 0, unless parents
17:607:50151:18:18:72:540:381:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:place no weight on other factors (e.g., their assessment of their child’s recent progress). Fig-

17:609:50338:18:18:72:540:345:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and endline beliefs, separately by treatment group. Consistent with Bayesian updating, in-
17:610:50428:18:18:72:540:327:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:formation cuts the gap nearly in half. Figure 3(d) shows that attenuation correspondingly
17:611:50517:18:18:72:540:309:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:decreases: the slope of endline beliefs on true baseline scores is over twice as steep for the
17:612:50611:18:18:72:284:291:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:treatment group as for the control group.
17:613:50652:18:18:95:539:273:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:I formally test whether information increases the slope of endline beliefs by running the

17:621:51290:12:9:72:540:108:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:does not drive the results: the patterns are similar for within-class percentile ranks (Online App. Table G.1).
17:622:51401:9:15:81:539:99:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:20Results are robust to excluding the controls (see Online Appendix Tables G.5 and G.6). Controls include

18:632:52289:18:18:72:540:569:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:begin by using data from the control group to provide motivating evidence of mistakes, and

18:638:52703:18:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investment function and the likely production function that they have in mind. We can then

18:649:53658:18:18:72:539:260:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f6:B:parametrized as 0/1/2 for simplicity, but the results are robust to other parametrizations.21

18:652:53926:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:is that book di-culty choice should increase in believed performance, and indeed, consistent
18:653:54018:18:18:72:521:188:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:with this prediction, the dashed lines for both English and math slope steeply upwards.

18:655:54194:18:17:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to pay (WTP) for subject-specific textbooks in math and English. Because the textbooks
18:656:54280:17:18:72:540:135:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:are remedial, the prediction is that WTP will be higher for the subject in which parents
18:657:54368:18:23:72:539:117:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:think their child is doing worse. The use of the between-subject WTP (math-English)

18:659:54558:11:9:72:540:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:of observations would be lost if I included stratum FE. But, the results are robust to including stratum FE.

19:662:54850:18:18:72:305:690:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f6:B:for this test as it provides clean predictions.22
19:663:54899:18:18:95:539:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:In Panel (b), as in Panel (a), the dashed lines are the preferred investment lines. The

19:665:55074:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:log of WTP for the math textbook minus the log of WTP for the English textbook;23for
19:666:55158:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:presentation purposes, English is flipped relative to math on the y-axis, so that the prediction
19:667:55254:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:is that the line will have a positive slope. The dashed line slopes steeply upwards, consistent
19:668:55349:18:18:72:523:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:with the prediction that WTP increases the further behind a child is in a given subject.

19:670:55524:18:18:72:539:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:dashed line plots the di↵erence in tickets allocated to the older versus the younger child in
19:671:55617:18:18:72:539:528:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f6:B:the pair, with the x-axis the gap in perceived scores between the older and younger child.24
19:672:55709:18:18:72:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Consistent with theex anteprediction that allocating more tickets to higher-performers
19:673:55795:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:yields higher returns, the line slopes upwards: Parents give more tickets to the child they
19:674:55886:18:17:72:210:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:think is higher-performing.
19:675:55913:17:18:95:539:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:I now compare the slope of the preferred investment functions just discussed with the
19:676:55998:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:slopes of theactualinvestment functions, depicted by the solid lines in Figure 4. The solid
19:677:56089:18:18:72:539:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:lines have the same y-axes as the dashed lines, but di↵erent x-axes: Their x-axes are true
19:678:56179:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance instead of believed performance. The prediction is that if parents base their in-
19:679:56272:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:vestments on their inaccurate beliefs, then the slope of their investments on true performance
19:680:56366:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:will be attenuated relative to the slope on beliefs. And, in fact, the graphs show precisely this
19:681:56463:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:pattern: The slopes on true performance are only 15-40% as large as the slopes on beliefs.
19:682:56553:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:This suggests that parents try to tailor their investments to performance, but that their
19:683:56642:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:inaccurate beliefs prevent them from doing so. Since returns depend ontrueperformance, if
19:684:56731:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parentsknewthat, say, their child had a math score of 80, they would choose the highest dif-
19:685:56823:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ficulty book for him, but many parents do not know that and so fail to choose their preferred
19:686:56916:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:option. This evidence is suggestive, however, not causal; both beliefs and performance could
19:687:57008:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:be correlated with other factors that determine investments. An experiment, in contrast, can
19:688:57100:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:establish causality: I can test whether information undoes the attenuation. It is this I turn
19:689:57193:18:16:81:540:206:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:22Theex anteplan was to analyze within-child, between-subject WTP, since surveys with teachers showed
19:690:57294:16:12:72:539:190:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:that teachers universally think that, within child, the remedial textbooks have higher returns in asubjectin
19:691:57402:12:12:72:540:178:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:which the child is behind. In contrast, teachers have more mixed opinions about whether remedial textbooks
19:692:57508:12:12:72:539:166:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:have higher returns for achildwho is behind in a subject relative to a child who is ahead. These mixed
19:693:57610:12:12:72:540:154:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:opinions reflect the fact that a child who is behind in one subject also has lower performance on average,
19:694:57716:12:12:72:540:142:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:and so might be less inclined to use a textbook, even a remedial one, since he/she may be more likely to
19:695:57820:12:8:72:504:130:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:drop out of school, etc. The within-child, between-subject comparison holds those factors constant.
19:696:57919:8:16:81:539:122:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:23Only 6% of observations are 0’s, which I replace with the log of 10% of the lowest price list value, but
19:697:58025:16:8:72:523:106:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:the results are robust to using other values (e.g., 50%), dropping the 0’s, or using levels instead of logs.
19:698:58133:8:15:81:539:98:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:24Since the lottery is a within-household allocation, to depict it graphically, we need to order the two chil-
19:699:58243:15:12:72:540:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:dren in some way. Parents identified age in focus groups as the second most important factor for investment
19:700:58350:12:0:72:453:71:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:(behind performance), so I order using age, but the graphs look similar with any order.

20:704:58592:18:18:72:540:650:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments on actual performance. Figure 5 shows locally linear regressions of investments
20:705:58683:18:18:72:540:632:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:on true performance for the treatment group (dashed line) and control group (solid line).
20:706:58772:18:18:72:540:614:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Both lines have true performance as the x-axis. Note that Figure 4 examined only the control
20:707:58864:18:18:72:540:596:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:group, and thus the solid lines in Figures 4 and 5 are identical, as they depict the same data.
20:708:58959:18:18:95:539:578:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The figures confirm that information frictions cause mistakes: For all three investments
20:709:59047:18:18:72:540:560:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:considered, the information treatment substantially increases the slope of the investment
20:710:59136:18:18:72:540:542:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:functions. I perform a formal test of the change in slope by estimating equation 1 using the
20:711:59228:18:18:72:540:524:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:experimental outcomes as the outcome variables, and using the relevant academic perfor-

20:713:59404:18:17:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:treatment makes the slope steeper, so thatc1>0(withc1the coe-cient onAij⇥T reati).

20:715:59567:18:18:72:539:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:as it is just driven by the scaling of theAijvariable, representing the treatment e↵ect for

20:717:59741:18:18:72:540:417:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for the textbook regression, it is the treatment e↵ect for those for whom math and English
20:718:59831:18:18:72:351:399:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance are the same (i.e.,math-English=0).

20:722:60142:18:18:72:540:327:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:lottery tickets are inherently a within-household allocation (one child’s allocation fully deter-

20:724:60335:18:18:72:539:291:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:with the graphical evidence, across all outcomes,c1is positive and statistically significant.

20:728:60683:17:18:72:540:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:across the various investments, i.e., the slopes increase by roughly 200-500%. This suggests
20:729:60775:18:18:72:372:202:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that parents were making substantial mistakes at baseline.
20:730:60833:18:18:95:539:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:One question is whether demand e↵ects play a role in the patterns seen here. Although
20:731:60918:18:18:72:539:166:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:demand e↵ects should a↵ect both treatment and control groups and should thus not directly

20:735:61280:18:18:72:540:94:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:which is the standard approach to address demand e↵ects, helps assuage this concern. More-
20:736:61370:18:0:72:540:76:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:over, treatment e↵ects on the longer-term outcomes can also mitigate the concern, since
21:737:61459:0:31:72:522:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:these outcomes should not be subject to demand e↵ects. I analyze these outcomes next.

21:739:61595:19:18:95:539:658:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The above results demonstrate that inaccurate beliefs cause parents to make mistakes
21:740:61679:18:17:72:540:640:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:when allocating educational investments. An open question, however, is the relevance for de-

21:751:62608:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:school enrollment (dropouts), attendance, and expenditures. Of the three, primary school
21:752:62696:18:18:72:539:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:enrollment, which likely proxies most closely for the overalllevelof investment, provides the
21:753:62789:18:17:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:cleanest test: Consistent with the literature, most parents believe additional years of school-
21:754:62884:17:18:72:540:386:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ing are more valuable for higher-performing children, whereas parental beliefs about the
21:755:62972:18:18:72:540:368:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:complementarity of expenditures or attendance with performance, as elicited in interviews,
21:756:63062:18:18:72:539:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:vary widely across parents. The literature on attendance and expenditures is also limited,
21:757:63152:18:18:72:540:332:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and there is little reason to expect the production function to be the same as for years of
21:758:63243:18:18:72:540:314:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:schooling. For example, conditional on having a child enrolled in school, parents may need
21:759:63333:18:18:72:442:296:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to invest more in their lower-performing children to keep them on track.
21:760:63405:18:18:95:539:278:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Column (1) shows the primary school enrollment results. Consistent with the fact that
21:761:63490:18:18:72:540:260:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:nearly all parents believe years of schooling are a complement with academic performance,
21:762:63579:18:18:72:540:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:information increases the slope of the investment function. High-performing students in the
21:763:63670:18:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:treatment group are more likely to be enrolled in school one year later, while low-performing
21:764:63763:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:students are less likely to be enrolled. The change in the slope in Panel A is significant at
21:765:63856:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the 1% level.26Panel B shows that the magnitudes are economically meaningful. Among
21:766:63939:18:15:81:539:170:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:25It is also harder to use control group data to generate predictions for the production function parents have
21:767:64049:15:12:72:540:155:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:in mind; compared with the experimental outcomes, these outcomes have more omitted determinants, making
21:768:64152:12:12:72:540:143:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:the observational regressions harder to interpret. However, we can still use the information treatment e↵ects
21:769:64261:12:8:72:528:131:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:themselves to infer the perceived complementarity/substitutability of the investments with performance.
21:770:64364:8:16:81:539:123:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:26Many evaluations use self-reported enrollment as the outcome of interest (e.g., Bourguignon et al., 2003;
21:771:64471:16:12:72:540:107:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:Schultz, 2004), but Baird and ̈Ozler (2012) show that self-reported and school data do not always match. I
21:772:64577:12:12:72:539:95:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:have dropout data from 10% of the schools and, reassuringly, the coe-cient onTreat⇥Scoreis the same
21:773:64676:12:12:72:540:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:regardless of the data source used, reflecting a high correlation between measures (0.5). Since the dependent
21:774:64785:12:0:72:466:71:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:variable mean is near 1, Online App. Table G.9 shows robustness to a probit specification.
22:775:64877:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children whose parents found out they had above-median performance, dropout falls to
22:776:64961:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:nearly 0% (from a control group mean of 2%), whereas it roughly doubles for those with
22:777:65047:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:below-median performance, increasing from 2% to about 4%. These results highlight that
22:778:65133:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:information does not improve educational outcomes for all: it leads to reallocations, which
22:779:65224:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:can decrease investments for some. Since the literature suggests that schooling and ability are
22:780:65319:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:complements, these reallocations are consistent with an improvement in returns (Pitt et al.,
22:781:65411:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:1990; Aizer and Cunha, 2012). In contrast to the results for primary school enrollment, but
22:782:65502:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:perhaps to be expected given parents’ heterogeneous beliefs regarding complementarity with
22:783:65592:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance, I find no significant e↵ects for either expenditures or attendance. See Appendix

22:789:66042:18:22:72:528:443:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:provides a potential channel for why low-SES parents are less able to access information.

22:802:67024:18:18:72:540:173:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:also respond more to information. I first look at the e↵ects on belief updating, shown in
22:803:67113:18:18:72:540:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:column 1 of Panel B of Table 4, which shows the results of estimating equation 1 fully
22:804:67199:18:16:81:539:137:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:27An alternate way to look at belief accuracy is to test whether the absolute value of the gap between
22:805:67301:16:12:72:540:121:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:beliefs and true scores is larger for less-educated parents. Appendix Table A.1 presents the results of this test
22:806:67414:12:12:72:540:109:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:with consistent results. Online Appendix Table G.2 shows robustness to other measures of parent education,
22:807:67520:12:12:72:540:97:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:as well as child performance. Online Appendix Table G.10 shows robustness to controlling for other variables
22:808:67628:12:0:72:441:85:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:and their interactions with score, including school fixed e↵ects interacted with score.
23:809:67717:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:interacted with household-average years of parent education. The results show that less-
23:810:67805:18:18:72:442:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:educated parents update their beliefs more than more-educated parents.
23:811:67875:18:18:95:539:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:We may also wish to know whether this translates into “larger e↵ects” on their deci-
23:812:67959:18:18:72:539:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:sions. Testing this is non-trivial, since it is di-cult to define exactly what a “larger e↵ect” is.
23:813:68058:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:In particular, the magnitude of a parent’s response will depend on her preferred investment
23:814:68149:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:function, which in turn depends on her preferences and budget, both of which may vary
23:815:68234:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:with SES. Some preferred investment functions may be steeper for richer parents, others
23:816:68321:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for poorer parents. To make an “apples to apples” comparison, then, it is useful to focus
23:817:68410:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:on the investments where the preferred investment function is as homogeneous as possible
23:818:68498:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:across parental education levels – and where thus the heterogeneity speaks directly to het-
23:819:68589:18:18:72:539:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:erogeneity in the impact of information, since,if there were no gapsin the accuracy and
23:820:68676:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty of parents’ baseline beliefs, there would be no heterogeneity in the results by
23:821:68767:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parental education. The choice of di-culty level of free workbooks is most likely to meet this
23:822:68861:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:criterion, and was expressly included in the design to provide homogeneity across education

23:825:69134:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parents are roughly 90% (30%) more steeply sloped for math (English) than the choices of

23:829:69479:18:30:72:466:349:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for heterogeneity in the preferred investment function by parental education.

23:831:69595:19:18:95:539:300:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:This experiment shows that providing information to parents a↵ects their beliefs and
23:832:69679:18:18:72:540:282:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:decisions. This reveals that parents’ decisions at baseline did not fully incorporate the in-
23:833:69772:18:18:72:539:264:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:formation, and that parents themselves think the information makes them better o↵, i.e.,
23:834:69860:18:18:72:540:246:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that, according to their own (perceived) utility functions, information increases utility. Al-
23:835:69954:18:18:72:540:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:though establishing these findings was the key conceptual goal of the paper, one may also
23:836:70043:18:18:72:539:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:wonder about the broader welfare implications. Welfare conclusions are di-cult, since any
23:837:70132:18:18:72:540:192:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:intervention that corrects one market imperfection can decrease welfare if there are multiple
23:838:70225:18:18:72:540:174:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:interacting market failures (the “theory of the second best”). Definitive welfare conclusions
23:839:70318:18:17:72:540:156:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:are thus beyond the scope of this paper. That said, I now provide some speculative discussion.
23:840:70412:17:18:95:540:139:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:First, to draw conclusions aboutparents’welfare, we would need to know whether their
23:841:70496:18:16:81:539:121:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:28Since the workbooks are free, the choice should not be confounded by wealth. Moreover, we expect parents
23:842:70602:16:12:72:540:105:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:to choose the workbook di-culty level most closely matching their beliefs about their child’s performance,

23:844:70809:12:12:72:539:81:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:corroborated by Online Appendix table G.11: regressions of workbook di-culty level on baseline beliefs in

24:848:71196:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:country contexts, there is evidence that grades are correlated with other measures of ability,
24:849:71290:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and that grades and achievement tests may even be better predictors of life outcomes (e.g.
24:850:71380:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:wages) than standard measures of ability (Borghans et al. (2011); Sternberg et al. (2001);

24:855:71838:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:2012). Moreover, there are reasons to expect that the complementarity might be greater in
24:856:71927:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:this setting: the education system in sub-saharan Africa is particularly oriented towards high
24:857:72021:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performers (Duflo et al., 2011), and achievement tests determine progression through school
24:858:72112:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and access to higher levels of schooling, thus mechanically linking them with returns. My
24:859:72201:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:finding that parents allocate more years of schooling to their higher performers suggests they
24:860:72295:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:believe this complementarity exists, and is thereforeconsistentwith parents being correct
24:861:72384:18:18:72:524:439:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:about the production function, but more evidence would be needed for firm conclusions.
24:862:72470:18:18:95:539:421:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Second, to move to social welfare, we would also need to assess both the externalities
24:863:72556:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of education and the social welfare function. Although no single summary statistic could
24:864:72644:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:fully summarize the welfare impacts, the conventional wisdom is that market imperfections
24:865:72733:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(such as positive externalities of education) collectively cause the average level of education
24:866:72828:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to be below the optimum. As a result, it might be concerning from a welfare perspective if
24:867:72918:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:providing information about academic performance caused the average level of investments
24:868:73006:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to fall. Reassuringly, here, information does not appear to decrease the average level of
24:869:73095:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments, although the results are imprecise. Specifically, Panel A of Appendix Table A.2
24:870:73187:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:presents the estimates of the average treatment e↵ect (ATE) of information. I do not find
24:871:73276:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:any statistically significant ATE of information on the investments that could proxy for the
24:872:73368:18:17:72:440:241:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f6:B:overall level of investments: enrollment, expenditures, and attendance.30
24:873:73441:17:18:95:539:224:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:One might be surprised by the absence of an ATE for enrollment. Parents on average
24:874:73523:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:overestimate their children at baseline, and, for enrollment, invest more in higher performers,
24:875:73618:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:suggesting that information might decrease enrollment. Appendix E describes several poten-
24:876:73708:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:tial explanations for the lack of an ATE, one of which I find empirical support for: Parents
24:877:73800:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:respond more to information when the information is positive than when it is negative. This
24:878:73891:18:16:81:539:134:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:29Note that this is much less of a concern when analyzing some of the experimental outcomes (e.g., the
24:879:73993:16:12:72:540:118:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:workbooks and remedial textbooks). These investments were designed to have clear predictions for increased
24:880:74099:12:8:72:519:106:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:returns, and, across the parental education spectrum, parents’ reallocations align with the predictions.
24:881:74203:8:15:81:539:98:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:30The workbooks and textbooks were designed specifically to look at thetypesof investment chosen, and
24:882:74304:15:12:72:540:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:thus their level does not proxy for overall spending. For completeness, however, these ATEs are also reported
24:883:74413:12:0:72:175:71:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:in Appendix Table A.2.
25:884:74437:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:is consistent with the findings of the motivated beliefs literature (Eil and Rao, 2011; Mobius
25:885:74531:18:31:72:510:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:and Rosenblat, 2014). See Appendix E and Table A.3 for the analysis and discussion.

25:887:74627:19:17:95:539:640:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Results 1-4 clearly show that providing student performance information to parents af-

25:889:74805:18:18:72:540:605:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:changes parents’ beliefs about their children’s academic performance? One potential alterna-

25:895:75308:18:18:72:539:497:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:The analyses suggest that the primary mechanism for information’s e↵ects on thetypesof

25:897:75484:18:18:72:540:461:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs, but that changes in the uncertainty of beliefs also play a role for the larger investments

25:899:75625:35:22:72:194:408:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:C:5Conclusion
25:900:75636:22:18:95:539:386:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:This paper highlights an important source of misinformation that a↵ects decisions: par-
25:901:75723:18:18:72:540:368:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ents’ inaccurate beliefs about their children’s academic performance. I show that (perceived)
25:902:75816:18:18:72:540:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:academic performance is an important input into parents’ investment decisions, but that
25:903:75903:18:18:72:540:332:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:despite the ready availability of academic performance information, many parents’ beliefs
25:904:75992:18:17:72:540:314:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:about their children’s academic performance are quite wrong – with important consequences
25:905:76081:17:18:72:540:297:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for the allocation of educational investments. Providing academic performance information
25:906:76170:18:18:72:540:279:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to parents causes them to change both thelevelandtypeof investments they choose for their
25:907:76259:18:18:72:540:261:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:children. The impacts are seen across a broad range of investments, from those with very
25:908:76347:18:18:72:540:243:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:clean predictions about how parents should invest to maximize returns (e.g., remedial text-
25:909:76438:18:18:72:540:225:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:books that are more useful for low-performing students), to more consequential investments
25:910:76528:18:18:72:307:207:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that proxy for overall educational attainment.
25:911:76574:18:18:95:539:189:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:It is perhaps surprising that baseline information is poor if the returns to knowledge are
25:912:76664:18:18:72:540:171:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:high and the information is, in principle, readily available. But, parents may over-estimate
25:913:76756:18:18:72:540:153:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:their own knowledge, or the (perceived) costs of acquiring information may be high, es-
25:914:76843:18:18:72:540:135:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:pecially for uneducated or illiterate parents. Indeed, interviews with parents suggest that
25:915:76934:18:15:81:539:117:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:31If salience e↵ects vary and are correlated with performance, this could a↵ect the slope. But, salience
25:916:77038:15:12:72:539:102:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:would likely be a household-level e↵ect, or correlated with child-level controls. Online Appendix Tables
25:917:77142:12:12:72:540:90:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:G.12 and G.13, which show robustness to household fixed e↵ects and to controlling for child-level controls
25:918:77248:12:12:72:540:78:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:interacted with treatment, thus assuage the concern. For dropouts, we lose statistical power quickly, but the
25:919:77357:12:0:72:376:66:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:coe-cient for enrollment stays stable and the p-value remains0.15.
26:920:77426:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:uneducated parents are intimidated to talk with their children’s teachers. These barriers to
26:921:77518:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:accessing information may be more pervasive in poorer countries and among poorer house-
26:922:77605:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:holds. Consistent with this, I find that less-educated parents in my setting have less accurate
26:923:77700:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs. This same pattern is also evident in beliefs data from other contexts, including the
26:924:77793:18:18:72:508:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:U.S.,32and suggests a potential link between poor access to information and poverty.
26:925:77877:18:18:95:539:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:This paper focused on identifying the causal chain between parents’ beliefs and their
26:926:77962:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments. One area for future research would be to extend the causal chain further to
26:927:78050:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:better understand the link between investments and welfare, for example by measuring the

26:929:78224:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:perceptions. A second direction for future work would be to design and test a scalable

30:1045:85858:13:13:75:716:166:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:inaccuracy is that beliefs will be “attenuated” on true performance, i.e., have a slope less than 1 on true performance (panel (a)). Parents base

36:1304:97416:13:13:94:697:243:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:is a child. Standard errors are clustered at the household level. Workbook di-culty choices are coded as 0 for beginner, 100 for average,
36:1305:97553:13:13:94:698:230:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:and 200 for advanced. The dependent variable in Column (1) corresponds to the parent’s endline beliefs about the child’s overall score on

36:1313:98574:13:13:94:698:126:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:the child’s math score increases by one point, the chance that her parent chooses the next higher di-culty level of the free book increases

48:1693:119424:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the opposite slope. Indeed, if we look at the results separately by school quality (proxied by
48:1694:119518:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:school-average achievement), there are slope e↵ects, with the slope becoming more positive
48:1695:119608:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:at low-quality schools and more negative at high-quality schools (Online Appendix Table
48:1696:119695:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:G.15). Of course, this is just one of many potential explanations – and it implicitly assumes
48:1697:119788:18:36:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:that parents know school quality, which may not be the case – but the results are suggestive.

48:1699:119932:22:18:95:539:542:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:Parents on average overestimate their children’s performance at baseline, and, for en-
48:1700:120018:18:18:72:540:524:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:rollment, invest more in their higher performers. This suggests that providing information
48:1701:120108:18:18:72:540:506:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:might decrease enrollment. However, we do not find a significant e↵ect. There are several
48:1702:120197:18:18:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:potential (non-mutually-exclusive) explanations. First, uncertainty in the control group may
48:1703:120289:18:18:72:540:470:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:decrease investment, akin to uncertainty dampening investment in risky assets. However, I
48:1704:120378:18:18:72:540:452:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:do not observe a positive average level e↵ect for the parents who had more accurate beliefs
48:1705:120469:18:18:72:540:434:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:at baseline, though the power of the test is low (see Panel B of Appendix Table A.2). Sec-
48:1706:120559:18:18:72:539:416:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:ond, parents may already be spending as much as they can on education, and so the e↵ect
48:1707:120646:18:18:72:540:398:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of information is primarily on the allocation of spending, not the level. Unfortunately this
48:1708:120738:18:18:72:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:channel is di-cult to test. Third, parents’ reported beliefs may be biased upwards somewhat
48:1709:120829:18:18:72:539:362:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:relative to true beliefs. This channel is also unfortunately di-cult to test. Fourth, parents
48:1710:120922:18:18:72:540:344:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:could respond more to positive than to negative information; I explore this channel in detail
48:1711:121015:18:22:72:319:326:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:below. Finally, we may lack statistical precision.

48:1715:121303:18:18:72:540:250:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for all outcomes for which (a) one direction of shock is unambiguously positive (e.g., the
48:1716:121393:18:18:72:540:232:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:secondary school lottery depends on between-child performance and so neither direction is
48:1717:121482:18:18:72:540:214:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:“positive”; thus, that outcome is not included); and (b) there is a treatment e↵ect on the

48:1719:121655:18:18:72:538:178:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:parents who receive positive information shocks.38For enrollment, precision is lacking, but
48:1720:121746:18:18:72:539:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the magnitude of the coe-cient is large, suggesting that this channel could help explain why
48:1721:121838:18:17:72:280:142:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:there is no negative ATE for enrollment.
48:1722:121878:17:16:81:539:125:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:38It would potentially be concerning if the positive information shocks were larger, but that is not the case:
48:1723:121988:16:12:72:540:109:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:The absolute gap between believed and true performance is roughly 40% smaller for the positive information
48:1724:122094:12:12:72:540:97:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:shock sample. Another potential concern is that some actions are bounded (e.g., one cannot choose a less
48:1725:122198:12:12:72:539:85:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:di-cult workbook than beginner), but restricting the sample to parents whose predicted behavior (based on
48:1726:122303:12:0:72:460:73:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:baseline beliefs) is in the middle of the range of potential outcomes yields similar results.
49:1727:122398:0:22:72:497:700:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:C:FMechanisms: The role of uncertainty in beliefs
49:1728:122445:22:18:95:539:678:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:My primary analyses show that information increases the slope of investments on true
49:1729:122529:18:18:72:540:660:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:performance, thus suggesting that the slope was attenuated at baseline. As discussed in
49:1730:122616:18:18:72:540:642:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Section 2, both inaccuracies in the mean of baseline beliefs and uncertainty of baseline beliefs
49:1731:122712:18:18:72:540:624:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:could cause that baseline attenuation. A reasonable question is thus whether the channel for
49:1732:122804:18:18:72:539:606:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the treatment e↵ects is an e↵ect on the mean or on the uncertainty of beliefs. The analysis
49:1733:122895:18:18:72:540:588:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of the channels is suggestive in nature, since I did not experimentally vary uncertainty
49:1734:122983:18:18:72:540:570:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:separately from the mean, nor (for budget reasons) did I measure uncertainty at endline.
49:1735:123071:18:18:72:540:552:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:Under an uncertainty channel, uncertainty could decrease the preferred slope of investments
49:1736:123162:18:18:72:539:534:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:as a function of meanbeliefs, since parents may not want to invest as steeply based on their
49:1737:123254:18:18:72:539:516:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:mean beliefs if their beliefs are uncertain.39The attenuation of preferred investments on
49:1738:123343:18:18:72:540:498:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs would then cause attenuation of actual investments ontrueperformance – which is
49:1739:123430:18:17:72:540:480:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the attenuation that has been the focus of the analysis so far. In contrast, under the channel
49:1740:123524:17:18:72:540:463:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of inaccurate means, the slope of investments as a function of mean beliefs is not attenuated;
49:1741:123618:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:rather, the attenuation of investments on true performance stems from the fact that, because
49:1742:123710:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs are inaccurate, they themselves are attenuated functions of true performance. As a
49:1743:123800:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:result, one empirical signature of the uncertainty channel is attenuation of investments on
49:1744:123891:18:18:72:539:391:143:g_d0_f9:143:g_d0_f4:B:beliefsthemselves; to assess uncertainty’s role, I test whether information increases the slope
49:1745:123986:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of investments on beliefs. I use two approaches; both suggest that the primary mechanism
49:1746:124074:18:18:72:539:355:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for reallocations acrosstypesof investments (e.g., di-culty levels of workbooks) is changes
49:1747:124165:18:18:72:540:337:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:to the mean/accuracy of beliefs, but that changes to the uncertainty of beliefs matter more
49:1748:124256:18:18:72:431:319:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:for the larger investments that proxy more for thelevelof investment.
49:1749:124325:18:18:95:540:301:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A:The first approach looks at the treatment e↵ect on the slope for those who have relatively
49:1750:124415:18:18:72:540:283:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:accurate beliefs at baseline. For this group, there is no belief accuracy e↵ect of information
49:1751:124509:18:18:72:540:265:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:(since beliefs were accurate to begin with). Any slope change therefore will likely represent an
49:1752:124605:18:18:72:540:247:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty e↵ect. Panel A of Appendix Table A.4 shows the results of estimating equation

49:1754:124772:17:18:72:540:212:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:the true score. For the smaller investments, such as workbooks, the slope for these parents
49:1755:124863:18:18:72:540:194:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:changes a little (i.e., there is a small uncertainty e↵ect), but the e↵ect is only 30% of the
49:1756:124956:18:18:72:540:176:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude – and significantly di↵erent from – the change in slope in the full sample. This
49:1757:125046:18:18:72:539:158:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that the e↵ect presented earlier for the full sample is driven primarily by changes to
49:1758:125141:18:18:72:540:140:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:belief accuracy. This is not surprising, since the preferred investment function was already
49:1759:125233:18:18:72:540:122:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:steeply sloped in the control group. For the larger investments, on the other hand, the
49:1760:125320:18:18:72:540:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty e↵ects are larger, with e↵ects in the accurate beliefs sample representing 50%
49:1761:125410:18:18:72:540:86:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:of the coe-cient estimated in the full sample for the lottery, and 100% for enrollment. Of
49:1762:125500:18:0:81:347:68:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:F:39See Appendix C.2 for a framework yielding this prediction.
50:1763:125562:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:course, a key caveat to interpretation is that parents with accurate beliefs could be di↵erent
50:1764:125656:18:18:72:430:690:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:from other parents; for example, they could have more certain beliefs.

50:1767:125887:18:18:72:545:636:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:investments as a function of baseline beliefs take the form-0+-1↵.Ifinformationdoes

50:1785:127353:18:18:72:539:313:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:B:low and so the results are somewhat inconclusive; reassuringly, however, the only coe-cient
