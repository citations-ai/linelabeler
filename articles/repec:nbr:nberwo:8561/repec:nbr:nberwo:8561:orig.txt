2:22:1129:57:41:273:338:609:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ABSTRACT
2:23:1137:41:17:108:538:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Population aging is just beginning to hit the industrialized countries in full force, and it will have
2:24:1239:17:17:72:538:551:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a  tremendous  impact  on  capital  markets.  In  this  paper,  we  argue  that  the  capital  market  effects  of
2:25:1353:17:17:72:538:534:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population aging are particularly strong in continental European economies such as Germany, France, and
2:26:1456:17:17:72:538:517:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Italy, with their large and ailing pay-as-you-go public pension systems, relatively thin capital markets, and
2:27:1565:17:17:72:538:500:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:poor capital performance. The younger generations in these countries are quite aware of the need to
2:28:1664:17:17:72:539:483:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:provide for more retirement income through own private saving, and these effects will be accentuated by
2:29:1767:17:17:72:539:466:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fundamental  pension  reforms  that  aim  at  more  pre-funding.  Population  aging  changes  households’
2:30:1872:17:17:72:538:449:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:savings behavior and portfolio composition, and much more assets will be invested on the stock market.
2:31:1974:17:17:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Capital markets will grow in size, and active institutional investors such as pension funds will become
2:32:2077:17:17:72:538:415:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more  important  in  continental  European  countries.  These  changes  are    likely  to  have  beneficial  side
2:33:2190:17:17:72:538:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects  in  terms  of  improved  capital  efficiency,  total  factor  productivity,  and  growth.  Looking  at  the
2:34:2306:17:17:72:538:381:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects of population aging on savings behavior and capital markets therefore adds a new dimension to
2:35:2407:17:17:72:539:364:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the continuing debate about advantages and disadvantages of pay-as-you-go and fully funded pension
2:36:2505:17:59:72:111:347:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:systems.

4:69:3548:35:21:70:544:672:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:France, Germany and Italy, to take the three largest economies in continental Europe, have large 
4:70:3645:21:21:70:545:651:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pay-as-you-go  public  pension  systems  that  face  severe  problems  due  to  population  aging  (see  
4:71:3750:21:21:70:544:630:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:OECD, 1988, and World Bank, 1994). As computed by the International Monetary Fund (Chand 
4:72:3839:21:21:70:543:609:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and Jaeger, 1996), the size of the public pension systems as a percentage of GDP will increase by 
4:73:3937:21:22:70:545:588:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:about  50  percent  from  1995  to  2030  in  France  and  in  Italy,  and  almost  double  in  Germany,  if  
4:74:4047:22:21:70:544:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:benefits stay as they were in 1992 in real terms (see table 1-1).  If the additional expenditures are 
4:75:4149:21:21:70:540:545:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:financed solely by contributions, these will rise approximately in proportion.  Expressed as a per-
4:76:4248:21:21:70:543:524:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:centage of the wage bill, French workers would then pay 38 percent to their pension system in the 
4:77:4346:21:22:70:540:503:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:year 2030 rather than 24 percent in 1995.  In Germany, the contribution rate would rise to 41 per-
4:78:4444:22:21:70:543:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cent, and in Italy even to 62 percent of the wage bill.  If the additional burden was financed solely 
4:79:4546:21:21:70:544:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by debt, it would exceed 100 percent of GDP in France, 115 percent in Germany, and as much as 
4:80:4640:21:21:70:546:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:180  percent  in  Italy  by  the  year  2035.    Similar  numbers  have  been  published  by  the  OECD  
4:81:4745:21:28:70:193:418:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(Rosevaere et al., 1996).  
4:82:4772:28:21:70:544:390:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:At the same time, France, Germany and Italy have thin capital markets in the sense that only few 
4:83:4869:21:21:70:546:369:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:households  own  and  control  productive  capital  (either  directly  or  via  investment  and  pension  
4:84:4975:21:21:70:540:348:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funds). French, German and Italian savers hold a considerable smaller share of stocks than Anglo-
4:85:5072:21:22:70:545:327:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Saxon  households.  As  a  result,  stock  market  capitalization  is  low  in  these  three  countries,  and  
4:86:5183:22:27:70:425:305:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension funds play only a minor role in household saving (see table 1-2).  
4:87:5258:27:21:70:541:278:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Finally,  France,  Germany  and  Italy  have,  in  comparison  to  the  United  States,  poor  capital  per-
4:88:5366:21:21:70:545:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:formance  as  measured  by  capital  productivity  and  various  rates  of  return.    While  international  
4:89:5475:21:22:70:544:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:comparisons of these statistics are difficult and controversial, the existing evidence yields a clear 
4:90:5577:22:21:70:540:214:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:picture, as summarized in table 1-3. Firms in France and Germany have substantially lower capi-
4:91:5672:21:21:70:545:193:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tal  productivity  and  return  on  investment  than  U.S.  companies  achieve.  Relative  to  the  United  
4:92:5780:21:21:70:545:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:States,  financial  underperformance  is  also  correlated  with  lower  levels  total  factor  productivity.  
4:93:5891:21:21:70:540:151:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Many authors claim that an important cause for this underperformance is weak corporate govern-
4:94:5985:21:28:70:535:130:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ance (see, e.g., Wenger and Kaserer, 1998; Börsch-Supan, 1998b; Mueller and Yurtoglu, 2000).  
4:95:6079:28:21:70:544:102:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The linkages among these three observations are a fascinating subject for economic policy. This 
4:96:6175:21:0:70:544:81:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is the topic of this paper. It explores the triangle of (i) population aging and pension reform, (ii) 
5:97:6278:0:21:70:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:life-cycle  saving  and  portfolio  decisions,  and  (iii)  capital  markets,  productivity,  and  economic  
5:98:6387:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:growth, depicted in figure 1-1. We argue that population aging and pension reform, via a change 
5:99:6483:21:21:70:545:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in  the  savings  behavior  and  portfolio  composition  of  households,  and  via  strengthening  capital  
5:100:6591:21:22:70:544:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:allocation and corporate governance through active institutional investors such as pension funds, 
5:101:6689:22:33:70:409:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:can have important beneficial side effects on productivity and growth. 
5:102:6760:33:21:70:543:591:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our line of argument is as follows. Population aging (or, more generally, demographic change) is 
5:103:6857:21:21:70:546:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a  fact  in  virtually  all  countries,  with  substantial  differences  in  timing.  Population  aging  will  
5:104:6968:21:22:70:544:549:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change  households’  saving  behavior  –  even  if  current  pension  systems  were  to  be  maintained  –  
5:105:7076:22:21:70:544:527:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:because their internal rate of return will decrease, making own savings as a vehicle for retirement 
5:106:7176:21:21:70:544:506:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income  both  more  necessary  and  attractive.  Moreover,  in  many  countries,  such  as  France,  Italy,  
5:107:7285:21:21:70:540:485:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and Germany, population aging makes fundamental reform of public pension systems a top prior-
5:108:7378:21:22:70:540:464:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ity,  strengthening  own  savings  for  retirement.  We  show  that  this  results  in  rising  aggregate  sav-
5:109:7489:22:21:70:540:442:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ings  and  capital  stocks  over  the  first  decades  of  this  century,  while  thereafter,  when  the  demo-
5:110:7600:21:21:70:544:421:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:graphic change is over, the higher old-age dependency ratio will lead to lower savings rates. Our 
5:111:7698:21:21:70:544:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:quantitative predictions show that the amount of additional capital generated until about 2035 is 
5:112:7796:21:22:70:545:379:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:substantial.  Finally,  increased  household  saving  and  changes  in  households’  portfolio  structure  
5:113:7903:22:21:70:540:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will also change the nature of capital markets, in particular in those countries that implement fun-
5:114:8003:21:21:70:544:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:damental pension reforms. Even if no additional savings were created, a higher share of savings 
5:115:8099:21:21:70:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will flow through traded shares and bonds. There is ample evidence that the size of capital mar-
5:116:8195:21:21:70:543:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:kets and productivity growth are related. There is also reason to believe that larger capital markets 
5:117:8297:21:34:70:477:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and actively managed investment and pension funds enhance corporate governance.  
5:118:8378:34:21:70:544:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:More concretely, few households in continental European countries such as France, Germany and 
5:119:8472:21:21:70:545:218:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Italy  hold  financial  assets  with  at  least  some  minimal  ownership  rights.  Those  assets  are  highly  
5:120:8584:21:22:70:545:197:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concentrated  among  only  few  households,  in  stark  contrast  to  countries  in  which  a  substantial  
5:121:8692:22:21:70:541:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:share of retirement income is financed through pension funds.1 A lack of relatively actively man-
5:122:8789:21:21:70:540:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:aged pension funds results in diffuse (e.g., pyramidal) corporate control structures and weak cor-

5:125:9043:24:14:70:544:79:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:1  We use the word pension fund in the literal sense and strictly distinguish it from unfunded (pay-as-you-go financed) pension 
5:126:9171:14:0:70:407:65:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:systems – for example, the U.S. Social Security trust fund is not a pension fund in this sense.

6:131:9580:28:21:70:540:618:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Research on these complex issues has not yet come far. Evidence on firm performance in funda-
6:132:9673:21:21:70:545:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mentally  different  institutional  settings  is  scarce,  and  establishing  causality  to  explain  observed  
6:133:9785:21:21:70:544:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences is particularly difficult. The aim of this paper are to provide a coherent framework for 
6:134:9886:21:22:70:544:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:this  line  of  research,  to  use  a  formal  model  to  quantify  potential  effects,  to  gather  the  empirical  
6:135:10003:22:21:70:543:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:evidence that is already available, and to highlight potential implications for public policy. To this 
6:136:10106:21:21:70:544:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:end,  we  focus  on  France,  Germany  and  Italy  because  these  three  largest  countries  in  continental  
6:137:10217:21:21:70:540:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Europe have a particularly severe aging problem and at the same time very monolithic public pay-
6:138:10313:21:22:70:540:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as-you-go systems in need of reform. Examples from Germany appear a bit more frequent – be-
6:139:10404:22:21:70:544:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sides knowing this country better than others, we think that Germany is of particular interest also 
6:140:10504:21:21:70:543:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to an international audience: Germany is a leading example for an institutional setting with both a 
6:141:10604:21:21:70:540:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:paternalistic,  overly  generous  but  unsustainable  public  pension  system,  and  a  bank-based  corpo-
6:142:10710:21:28:70:485:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rate governance system with concentrated ownership and poor shareholder protection.

6:144:10911:21:21:70:540:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:how population aging and pension reform affect capital markets from a macroeconomic perspec-
6:145:11003:21:21:70:544:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tive, and we compute the size of the capital stock generated by households’ optimal response to 
6:146:11099:21:21:70:540:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:population aging and a realistic transition to a partially funded system, using Germany as an ex-
6:147:11196:21:22:70:543:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ample.  The potential magnitude of capital stock changes is an important factor since it shows that 
6:148:11296:22:21:70:544:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension  reform  has  a  large  leverage  for  changes  in  capital  market  structure  and  macroeconomic  
6:149:11404:21:21:70:545:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:performance.  Section  3  delivers  a  picture  of  households’  life-cycle  saving  decisions  in  France,  
6:150:11513:21:21:70:545:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Germany  and  Italy,  in  particular  portfolio  choice,  and  links  it  to  the  pension  systems  in  those  
6:151:11625:21:22:70:543:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries. We then discuss how saving patterns are going to change as a reaction to the decreasing 
6:152:11724:22:21:70:540:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:generosity of public pension systems.  In Section 4, we discuss the role of capital markets for pro-
6:153:11824:21:21:70:544:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ductivity and economic growth. We consider the overall size and liquidity of capital markets, and 
6:154:11922:21:21:70:547:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more  specifically,  the  potential  role  of  activist  pension  and  investment  funds  in  corporate  
6:155:12027:21:0:70:317:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:governance.  Section 5 summarizes and concludes. 
7:156:12077:0:35:70:439:707:197:g_d0_f4:197:g_d0_f4:2. Why and how demographic change affects capital markets 
7:157:12135:35:21:106:543:672:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This section has two purposes. First, we show that Europe’s public pay-as-you-go pension 
7:158:12224:21:21:70:540:651:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:systems face severe problems which can hardly be solved without a introducing a substantial de-
7:159:12319:21:21:70:540:630:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gree  of  pre-funding.  Hence,  capital  markets  and  their  governance  mechanisms  will  play  an  in-
7:160:12424:21:21:70:544:609:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:creasingly important role in the future. Second, we show how large this role is likely to be under 
7:161:12523:21:22:70:545:588:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:realistic  assumptions.  Specifically,  we  use  an  macroeconomic  simulation  model  to  predict  the  
7:162:12628:22:21:70:545:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital  market  effects  of  population  aging,  and  of  introducing  a  funded  component  to  pension  
7:163:12735:21:45:70:117:545:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:systems.  
7:164:12745:45:27:70:381:500:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2.1 Demographic change and pay-as-you-go pension systems 
7:165:12802:27:22:106:540:473:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:As  is  well  known,  population  aging  is  particularly  severe  in  continental  Europe,  particu-
7:166:12903:22:21:70:545:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:larly  in  Italy  and  Germany.  According  to  EcoFin  (2000),  Germany’s  old-age  dependency  ratio  
7:167:13007:21:21:70:544:430:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(i.e.,  the  ratio  of  the  number  of  persons  aged  65  and  older  and  the  number  of  persons  between  
7:168:13119:21:21:70:543:409:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ages 20 and 64) will more than double from 26.0% in 2000 to 54.7% in 2040. Even worse in Italy 
7:169:13214:21:22:70:543:388:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:where the old-age dependency ratio will increase from 28.8% to 63.9% during this period. By this 
7:170:13311:22:21:70:544:366:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measure,  Italy  will  have  the  oldest  population  in  Europe.  France  will  experience  a  milder  aging  
7:171:13422:21:21:70:543:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:process with dependency ratios that are below the European OECD average, but still substantially 
7:172:13519:21:27:70:352:324:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:above those in the United Kingdom and the United States. 
7:173:13576:27:22:106:544:297:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Most European countries have contribution-based pay-as-you-go pension systems (which 
7:174:13661:22:21:70:543:275:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are also the dominant financing mechanisms of old-age social security around the globe), with the 
7:175:13759:21:21:70:544:254:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Netherlands,  Switzerland,  and  the  United  Kingdom  being  notable  exceptions.  Typical  examples  
7:176:13862:21:21:70:544:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for the continental European pension system are France, Germany and Italy whose public pension 
7:177:13957:21:22:70:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:systems are monolithical, cover almost all workers and provide most of their retirement incomes 
7:178:14053:22:21:70:545:190:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:through  a  single  system.2    Until  recently,  the  French,  German  and  Italian  pension  systems  have  
7:179:14163:21:21:70:544:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:been very successful in providing a high and reliable level of retirement income. However, times 
7:180:14260:21:34:70:544:148:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have  changed.  All  three  countries  have  experienced  a  flurry  of  pension  reforms  in  recent  years,  
7:181:14371:34:24:70:217:114:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
7:182:14419:24:14:70:544:90:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:2  For a detailed description of the pension systems in France see Blanchet (1999), in Germany see Börsch-Supan and Schnabel

7:184:14671:11:0:70:268:65:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:pension system can be found in Börsch-Supan (2000). 
8:185:14724:0:21:70:540:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:but  they  have  not  succeeded  in  stabilizing  contribution  rates,  public  support,  and  system  enroll-
8:186:14834:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ment. There are two main reasons for the increasing difficulties of these public pension systems: 
8:187:14932:21:21:70:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:population aging and negative incentive effects on labor supply. In particular, demographic prob-
8:188:15029:21:22:70:540:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lems  have  been  exacerbated  by  a  strong  decrease  in  labor  force  participation  due  to  early  retire-
8:189:15141:22:21:70:543:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ment and unemployment, and by a shift to jobs that escape social security taxation. The declining 
8:190:15239:21:21:70:540:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:labor  force  participation  in  these  countries  can  at  least  partially  be  attributed  to  the  negative  in-
8:191:15355:21:27:70:506:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:centive effects of their public pension systems (Gruber and Wise, 1999; Schnabel, 1999a). 
8:192:15445:27:22:106:540:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Because  of  continuing  population  aging,  contribution  rates  to  public  pensions  must  in-
8:193:15542:22:21:70:540:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:crease  dramatically  from  their  already  high  levels  in  the  first  half  of  this  century  if  current  re-
8:194:15657:21:21:70:540:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:placement rates were to be maintained. Population aging is therefore a serious threat to the stabil-
8:195:15757:21:21:70:540:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ity of the European pay-as-you-go public pension systems. The share of social security contribu-
8:196:15853:21:22:70:540:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tions  in  total  labor  compensation  already  exceeds  50  percent  in  France,  Germany  and  Italy.  Be-
8:197:15961:22:21:70:545:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cause  they  are  largely  viewed  as  taxes  rather  than  insurance  premia  (Boeri,  Börsch-Supan,  and  
8:198:16069:21:21:70:544:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Tabellini,  2001),  they  increase  the  wedge  between  workers’  net  income  and  total  labor  costs  to  
8:199:16179:21:21:70:540:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the employers, reducing labor supply and creating an obstacle to competitiveness vis-à-vis coun-
8:200:16275:21:22:70:545:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tries  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  that  have  lower  total  labor  
8:201:16385:22:21:70:545:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:compensation  (see,  e.g.,  OECD,  2000).  Hence,  increasing  those  contribution  rates  to  the  extent  
8:202:16493:21:21:70:545:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:described  appears  unrealistic,  particularly  so  because  health  costs  will  also  rise,  and  probably  
8:203:16603:21:21:70:540:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:even faster than public pension costs (OECD, 1988). We do not review the arguments that para-
8:204:16696:21:21:70:545:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:metric  pension  reform  cannot  resolve  this  dilemma,  and  that  a  fundamental  pension  reform  is  
8:205:16802:21:22:70:544:279:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:needed. The consensus view in the scientific debate appears to be that a funded component needs 
8:206:16898:22:21:70:540:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to  be  introduced  in  order  to  complement  the  existing  pay-as-you-go  systems,  although  the  as-
8:207:17003:21:21:70:546:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sessments  vary  in  details;  see,  among  others,  Miles  and  Timmermann  (1999),  Boldrin  et  al.

8:209:17155:27:22:106:544:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Because even patched-up pay-as-you-go systems will have extremely low rates of return, 
8:210:17242:22:21:70:544:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more fundamental pension reforms entailing a significant extent of pre-funding have become not

8:213:17543:21:0:70:540:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with  a  funded  pillar.  Germany  and  Italy  have  now  started  to  implement  mixed  multi-pillar  sys-
9:214:17651:0:21:70:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tems.  Following  the  arguments  in  the  previous  subsection,  France  will  have  little  choice  but  to  
9:215:17762:21:27:70:309:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:adopt a significant extent of pre-funding as well.  
9:216:17814:27:21:106:540:661:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Börsch-Supan  (2000)  and  Börsch-Supan,  Heiss,  and  Winter  (2000)  show  that  such  a  re-
9:217:17909:21:22:70:540:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:form  can  be  implemented  without  too  high  a  transition  burden,  using  a  macroeconomic  simula-
9:218:18013:22:21:70:544:618:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tion model. In the next subsection, we present a multi-country overlapping generations model at 
9:219:18109:21:21:70:540:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:allows for quantitative projections for the additional savings that are generated by population ag-
9:220:18208:21:21:70:540:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing and pension reform when capital is internationally mobile. These quantitative models are im-
9:221:18304:21:22:70:544:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:portant elements of our chain of arguments: pension reform is likely to occur, it can be done, and 
9:222:18403:22:21:70:544:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:together with the direct effects of population aging, it has quantitatively important effects on the 
9:223:18504:21:27:70:144:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital market. 
9:224:18520:27:21:106:543:485:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To this end, we need to work through the implications of a realistic transition to a partially 
9:225:18615:21:22:70:544:464:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funded multi-pillar pension system. There are several reasons why it is unrealistic to model a full 
9:226:18715:22:21:70:540:442:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:transition to pre-funding. First, public pension systems traditionally also have redistributive char-
9:227:18816:21:21:70:544:421:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acter, and redistribution is, through one mechanism or the other, always pay-as-you-go. Estimates 
9:228:18914:21:21:70:546:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  the  share  of  pensions  that  are  pure  transfers  range  between  20  to  40  percent  in  Germany  
9:229:19022:21:22:70:545:379:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(mainly  topped-up  pensions  by  a  minimum  retirement  income  mechanism  and  pension  points  
9:230:19121:22:21:70:544:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:earned while in education or while raising children), leaving 60-80 percent of pensions available 
9:231:19219:21:21:70:545:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for  potential  privatization  in  a  multi-pillar  system.  The  shares  are  similar  in  France  and  Italy.  
9:232:19332:21:21:70:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:There are also other reasons to be conservative in the degree of pre-funding. For instance, pay-as-
9:233:19431:21:21:70:544:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:you-go systems have a built-in insurance against inflation and secular capital market failures. For

9:235:19619:28:21:106:546:245:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  fundamental  pension  reform  we  consider  here  implements  a  transition  towards  a  
9:236:19713:21:21:70:540:224:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funded system in which the division of labor between pay-as-you-go and funded pillar is implic-

9:239:20019:22:21:70:544:160:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:der this scheme, the current contribution rate is frozen, implying a decreasing replacement rate of 
9:240:20119:21:45:70:515:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the pay-as-you-go system. The resulting pension gap will then be filled through pre-funding.

10:242:20301:0:21:106:546:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:From  a  macroeconomic  point  of  view,  population  aging  changes  the  balance  between  
10:243:20394:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital  and  labor,  in  particular  in  industrialized  countries.  Labor  supply  is  going  to  be  relatively  
10:244:20510:21:21:70:543:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:scarce whereas capital  is going to be relatively abundant. This will drive up wages relative to the 
10:245:20611:21:22:70:543:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rate of return on capital, reducing households’ incentive to save (if the interest elasticity of saving 
10:246:20715:22:21:70:540:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is positive). In addition, some fraction of the capital stock may become obsolete due to the shrink-
10:247:20815:21:21:70:545:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing  labor  force  and  diminishing  returns  to  scale,  making  the  accumulation  of  capital  even  less  
10:248:20925:21:21:70:540:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:attractive.  Loayza,  Schmidt-Hebbel  and  Servén  (2000)  present  empirical  evidence  for  the  nega-
10:249:21029:21:28:70:411:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tive long-run effect of increasing old-age dependency ratios on saving. 
10:250:21101:28:21:106:544:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In  the  short  term,  that  is,  while  dramatic  changes  in  the  age  structure  are  underway,  the  
10:251:21207:21:21:70:544:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:behavior  of  the  savings  rate  is  quite  different  –  our  simulations  show  that  savings  rates  increase  
10:252:21322:21:21:70:543:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:until about 2020, and the capital held by households in aging countries will be (much) higher than 
10:253:21421:21:22:70:544:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:currently well into the second half of this century. In addition to these domestic effects, there are 
10:254:21523:22:21:70:540:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in timing of population aging across countries – not only between industrialized coun-
10:255:21621:21:21:70:540:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tries and developing countries, but also within the group of industrialized countries as well. Capi-
10:256:21721:21:21:70:544:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tal  exports  from  fast-aging  countries  to  those  countries  with  a  more  favorable  age  structure  can  
10:257:21833:21:22:70:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reduce aging problems in industrialized countries, but cannot solve them entirely (Blommestein,

10:259:22036:21:27:70:331:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital flows is already at work (e.g., Higgins, 1998).

10:265:22583:21:22:70:544:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:households’ and firms’ optimal reactions to movements in the demographic structure and public

10:268:22896:21:31:70:543:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:order effects of demographic change on capital markets. Two features of their model are therefore

10:270:23042:24:14:70:543:90:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:3 Recent examples include De Nardi et al. (2000) and Kotlikoff et al. (2000) for the United States, Miles (1999) for Great Britain 
10:271:23173:14:11:70:543:76:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:and Fehr (2000) and Börsch-Supan, Heiss and Winter (2000) for Germany. Miles and Iben (2000) present a comparative analysis 
10:272:23297:11:0:70:470:65:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:of pension reform schemes for the United Kingdom and Germany based on an overlapping generations model. 
11:273:23402:0:21:70:543:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of particular interest. First, the model consists of several countries with potentially different aging 
11:274:23506:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:processes, and it allows capital mobility. Thus, international capital flows induced by differential 
11:275:23607:21:21:70:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:aging  can  be  explained  endogenously.  Second,  demographic  projections  used  in  this  75-
11:276:23703:21:22:70:546:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:generation  model  are  very  detailed.  For  Germany,  these  projections  are  taken  from  Birg  and  
11:277:23808:22:21:70:540:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Börsch-Supan (1999), and for the other world regions from the United Nations’ World Develop-

11:279:23933:27:21:106:544:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  following  projections  focus  on  Germany  with  its  generous  pension  system,  a  severe  
11:280:24032:21:22:70:544:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:aging problem and persistent calls for a fundamental pension reform that implies a shift to more 
11:281:24129:22:21:70:544:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pre-funding. To separate the direct effect of population aging and the additional effect of pension 
11:282:24229:21:21:70:543:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reform, we present all projections for two scenarios, the current pay-as-you-go system and under a 
11:283:24328:21:21:70:545:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fundamental  pension  reform.  These  scenarios  are  polar  cases,  and  they  are  both  counterfactual:  
11:284:24436:21:22:70:544:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:As we have discussed in the previous section, the current system is politically unsustainable and 
11:285:24534:22:21:70:540:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cannot survive at its current level of generosity, while the pension reform that was passed in Feb-
11:286:24633:21:21:70:544:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ruary  2001  is  by  no  means  as  fundamental  as  the  one  we  consider  in  our  simulations.  Even  the  
11:287:24744:21:21:70:544:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension reform we analyze in our simulations does not imply a full shift to a funded system, but 
11:288:24841:21:22:70:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:only a partial transition with about one third of retirement income coming from the funded pillar. 
11:289:24940:22:21:70:540:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In any case, the eventual outcome of pension reforms might well be somewhere between our sce-
11:290:25033:21:21:70:547:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:narios.  Analyzing  these  polar  cases  is,  however,  helpful  since  they  show  that  a  good  portion  of    
11:291:25147:21:21:70:545:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  capital  market  effects  of  population  aging  would  arise  even  without  a  fundamental  pension  
11:292:25255:21:21:70:543:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reform. In addition to the two reform scenarios, we also consider three alternative capital mobility 
11:293:25356:21:22:70:545:279:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:scenarios:  investment  only  within  Germany  (the  closed-economy  case),  investment  in  the  EU  
11:294:25458:22:27:70:316:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries, and investment in the OECD countries.4 
11:295:25507:27:21:106:544:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The projects depicted in figure 2-1 show that (i) aggregate savings rates rise substantially 
11:296:25600:21:22:70:540:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:even under the current pay-as-you-go system, and (ii) aggregate savings rates under a fundamen-
11:297:25695:22:21:70:543:187:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tal pension reform would be higher than under the present system. For example, in the year 2035, 
11:298:25792:21:21:70:544:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:when the peak of the aging problem occurs, savings rates are projected to be very low under the 
11:299:25888:21:21:70:540:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:current PAYG system. Conditional on the capital mobility scenario, the aggregate household sav-
11:300:25983:21:0:70:544:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ings rate declines from currently around 12 percent (1998) to between 8 and 9 percent, an effect 
12:301:26082:0:21:70:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that  is  due  to  aging.  In  contrast,  under  a  fundamental  pension  reform,  the  aggregate  saving  rate  
12:302:26195:21:21:70:545:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:settles  at  around  9.3  percent  under  the  assumption  of  perfect  capital  mobility  within  the  EU.  
12:303:26304:21:21:70:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:These projections show that optimal life-cycle behavior generates additional saving under a fun-
12:304:26400:21:22:70:545:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:damental  pension  reform  –  it  is  not  the  case  that  additional  retirement  saving  crowds  out  other  
12:305:26512:22:21:70:543:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:saving totally, as often claimed. Our projections indicate a substitution of about one third, leaving 
12:306:26614:21:21:70:544:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:two  thirds  to  new  saving.5  It  is  important  to  note  that  all  variations  of  the  aggregate  saving  rate  
12:307:26732:21:21:70:544:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shown in figure 2-1 are in the range of the historical variation in German household saving rates. 
12:308:26831:21:22:70:540:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Also, we should point out that a recent empirical cross-country study by Samwick (2000) demon-
12:309:26925:22:21:70:545:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:strates  that  the  direct  effect  of  fundamental  pension  reforms  on  savings  rates  is  negative.  It  is  
12:310:27039:21:21:70:545:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:therefore  important  to  stress  that  the  increase  in  the  saving  rate  predicted  by  our  model  for  the  
12:311:27154:21:21:70:540:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:next few decades is primarily due to population aging (much more dramatic than in other coun-
12:312:27247:21:22:70:545:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tries’  historic  experience),  and  that  the  pension  reform  we  consider  exacerbates  the  transitory  
12:313:27356:22:27:70:369:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:positive effect of population aging on aggregate savings rates. 
12:314:27420:27:21:106:543:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Next, we aggregate savings to obtain a country’s foreign position and capital stock. Figure 
12:315:27512:21:21:70:540:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2-2 shows projections of the total capital stock under the current pension system. A first observa-
12:316:27611:21:22:70:543:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tion is that the variations in the time path of the aggregate capital stock are by far less pronounced 
12:317:27714:22:21:70:540:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in  an  open  economy.  These  waves  are  caused  by  the  alternating  dominance  of  demographic  ef-
12:318:27818:21:21:70:544:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fects and of growth in labour productivity. The economy gradually accumulates capital until the 
12:319:27914:21:21:70:544:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:peak of the aging process is reached in 2030, since in the beginning the tendency to disinvest in 
12:320:28012:21:22:70:544:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital due to the aging process is dominated by the modest increase in labour force participation 
12:321:28111:22:21:70:544:278:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and technological progress. After 2030, when the aging process has almost reached its peak, the 
12:322:28207:21:21:70:543:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital stock decreases if Germany is a closed economy. In the open economy case, the growth of 
12:323:28303:21:21:70:545:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  capital  stock  almost  disappears,  but  the  growth  rate  never  becomes  negative.  In  the  open  
12:324:28411:21:22:70:544:215:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economy  scenarios,  the  German  capital  stock  increases  to  about  144  (140)  percent  of  its  current  
12:325:28522:22:21:70:543:193:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:value if the capital is freely mobile within the OECD (EU) relative to 138 percent if Germany is a 
12:326:28621:21:21:70:544:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:closed economy. Under a fundamental pension reform, the decrease in the German capital stock 
12:327:28714:21:24:70:544:151:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the closed economy scenario, that is caused by aging, is less pronounced since more capital is 
12:328:28812:24:24:70:544:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                              
12:329:28969:24:13:70:545:103:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:4  In  all  projections  reported  here,  we  assume  that  all  other  countries  maintain  their  current  pension  systems.  Börsch-Supan,  
12:330:29112:13:11:70:531:90:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:Ludwig and Winter (2001) also consider a scenario in which other countries implement fundamental pensions reforms as well.  
12:331:29236:11:14:70:541:79:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:5 The right panel of Figure 3-1 shows discrete adjustment in behavior that occur when the pension reform takes place, or is an-
12:332:29363:14:0:70:105:65:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:nounced. 
13:333:29374:0:21:70:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accumulated as a result of the pension reform. The increase of the aggregate capital stock is now 
13:334:29472:21:21:70:545:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:higher  than  in  both  the  open  economy  scenarios.  This  indicates  that,  under  the  pension  reform,  
13:335:29582:21:21:70:276:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relatively more capital is invested abroad.  
13:336:29627:21:22:106:545:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Finally,  we  consider  the  general  equilibrium  effects  on  the  return  to  capital.  As  can  be  
13:337:29731:22:21:70:540:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:seen  from  figure  2-3,  the  return  to  capital  in  the  closed  economy  scenario  decreases  by  0.5  per-
13:338:29843:21:21:70:544:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:centage points between the years 2012 and 2026, an effect caused by aging. This decrease is only 
13:339:29940:21:21:70:544:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:around 0.3 percentage points when capital is freely mobile within the European Union, and only 
13:340:30035:21:22:70:544:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:0.1 percentage points in the OECD scenario. The pension reform leads to a reduction in the rate 
13:341:30131:22:21:70:543:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of return to capital caused by the higher supply of capital. In the closed economy scenario the rate 
13:342:30232:21:21:70:544:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  return  is  reduced  by  0.5  percentage  points  in  2050  relative  to  the  rate  of  return  in  the  current  
13:343:30351:21:21:70:543:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension system. This is much less than often claimed in the public debate. Moreover, the decrease 
13:344:30449:21:22:70:545:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in  the  rate  of  return  to  capital  reduces  to  only  0.12  percentage  points  if  capital  is  freely  mobile  
13:345:30567:22:21:70:544:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:within the EU. In the OECD scenario, the yield difference almost disappears; it is as high as 0.04 
13:346:30666:21:21:70:544:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentage  points.  This  suggests  that  the  additional  savings  induced  by  a  pension  reform  should  
13:347:30776:21:21:70:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:be invested internationally, not only for reasons of risk diversification, which we cannot show in 
13:348:30875:21:22:70:543:391:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our deterministic model, but also for sake of higher returns that are possible in the open economy. 
13:349:30975:22:21:70:543:369:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:It is also important to note that substantial positive effects of capital mobility occur even in a very 
13:350:31079:21:21:70:545:348:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:modest  capital  mobility  scenario.  Indeed,  Börsch-Supan,  Ludwig  and  Winter  (2001)  show  that  
13:351:31182:21:21:70:545:327:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:there  is  virtually  no  difference  between  the  OECD  scenario  and  a  scenario  where  we  allow  for  
13:352:31291:21:21:70:282:306:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:perfect capital mobility in the entire world.  
13:353:31338:21:22:106:544:285:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The transition costs of such a reform are relatively modest; we return to this issue in the 
13:354:31430:22:21:70:544:263:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concluding section of this paper. The main result for the next step of analysis is that the amount 
13:355:31529:21:21:70:544:242:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of additional saving generated by population aging and pension reform is substantial. Whether or 
13:356:31626:21:21:70:540:221:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:not this new retirement saving crowds out other savings or not – this is the subject of the follow-
13:357:31725:21:22:70:543:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing section –, the share of pension funds in total productive capital would become substantial, and 
13:358:31825:22:21:70:544:178:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:it  is  likely  that  this  will  change  the  nature  of  the  underlying  capital  markets.  This  link  between  
13:359:31941:21:53:70:379:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension reform and capital markets will be subject of Section 4. 
13:360:32006:53:0:70:419:104:197:g_d0_f4:197:g_d0_f4:3. A closer look at life-cycle saving and portfolio decisions 
14:361:32070:0:21:106:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The simulation model we used in the previous sections was based on a very stylized view 
14:362:32158:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of households’ life-cycle savings behavior, but it allows to get the aggregate effects right. In this 
14:363:32260:21:21:70:545:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:section,  we  take  a  closer  look  at  households’  portfolio  choice  patterns.  We  show  that  they  are  
14:364:32371:21:22:70:543:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:strongly influenced by public pension systems, and we make a prediction of how they are likely to 
14:365:32469:22:27:70:476:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change when public pension systems become less generous due to population aging. 
14:366:32550:27:21:106:545:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Specifically,  we  claim  that  the  saving  patterns  in  France,  Germany  and  Italy  reveal  that  
14:367:32653:21:21:70:544:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:saving for retirement plays only a small role in these countries relative to other savings motives. 
14:368:32753:21:22:70:540:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Turning this argument around, we anticipate a distinct change in savings patterns in France, Ger-
14:369:32850:22:21:70:544:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:many and Italy in wake of a fundamental pension reform because it revives the retirement savings 
14:370:32947:21:21:70:540:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:motive. In particular, a partial transition to a funded pension system is likely to change how sav-
14:371:33046:21:21:70:540:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing  is  related  to  age  and  how  households  select  their  portfolios.  This  is,  of  course,  the  time-
14:372:33157:21:22:70:544:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:honored  question  (Feldstein,  1974;  Barro,  1974)  whether  pay-as-you-go  pension  systems  crowd  
14:373:33260:22:21:70:543:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:out private saving. We give it a new tack by looking at the life cycle pattern of savings in France, 
14:374:33361:21:27:70:165:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Germany and Italy. 
14:375:33380:27:21:106:545:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:As  a  point  of  departure,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  the  pay-as-you-go  financed  public  
14:376:33486:21:22:70:540:379:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pensions  in  France,  Germany  and  Italy  have  very  high  replacement  rates.  They  generate  net  re-
14:377:33593:22:21:70:545:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tirement  incomes  that  are  approximately  70  percent  of  pre-retirement  net  earnings  in  Germany  
14:378:33699:21:21:70:544:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and France, and may even exceed 100 percent in Italy.6 In addition, the public pension systems in 
14:379:33797:21:21:70:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:France, Germany and Italy provide generous survivor benefits that constitute a substantial propor-
14:380:33895:21:22:70:540:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tion of total unfunded pension wealth, and disability benefits at similar and often even higher re-
14:381:33994:22:21:70:543:272:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:placement levels than old-age pensions. As a result, public pensions are by far the largest pillar of 
14:382:34096:21:21:70:540:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:retirement income in these countries and constitute more than 80 percent of the income of house-
14:383:34192:21:21:70:543:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:holds headed by persons aged 65 and older, while funded retirement income, such as asset income 
14:384:34288:21:22:70:543:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from private saving or firm pensions in which the employer saves on behalf of the worker, plays a 
14:385:34386:22:21:70:540:187:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:much smaller role than, e.g., in the Netherlands or the Anglo-Saxon countries. It is not straight-
14:386:34484:21:31:70:543:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:forward, however, to infer from these differences between the pension systems the level of saving 
14:387:34582:31:24:70:217:135:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
14:388:34630:24:11:70:541:111:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:6  This replacement rate is defined as the current pension of a retiree with a 45-year average earnings history divided by the cur-
14:389:34761:11:10:70:543:100:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:rent  average  earnings  of  all  dependently  employed  workers.    This  concept  is  different  from  the  replacement  rate  relative  to  the 
14:390:34907:10:11:70:543:90:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:most recent earnings because these are usually higher than the life-time average. Because the Italian system uses only the last 5 
14:391:35037:11:11:70:540:79:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:years as a pension base and applies a statutory replacement rate of 80% to that base, the replacement rate with respect to the aver-
14:392:35169:11:0:70:221:68:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:age lifetime income often exceeds 100%. 
15:393:35211:0:21:70:540:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rates  in  the  different  countries  –  too  many  other  factors,  from  real  estate  prices  through  the  or-
15:394:35325:21:21:70:543:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ganization of financial markets, are likely to confound such a comparison. We therefore first look 
15:395:35424:21:46:70:353:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:at life-cycle saving patterns, then at portfolio composition. 
15:396:35486:46:27:70:225:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:3.1 Life-cycle saving patterns  
15:397:35518:27:21:106:540:594:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Constructing life-cycle savings profiles is not trivial unless one has long time-series of in-
15:398:35612:21:21:70:540:573:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dividual households – such data, however, is not available. Moreover, comparing saving observa-
15:399:35707:21:21:70:544:552:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tions  in  different  countries  is  tricky  as  variable  definitions  tend  to  vary  greatly  across  countries.  
15:400:35824:21:22:70:545:531:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Fall  (2001),  Börsch-Supan,  Reil-Held,  Rodepeter,  Schnabel  and  Winter  (2001),  and  Brugiavini  
15:401:35927:22:21:70:544:509:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and Padula (2001) have analyzed life-cycle saving patterns in France, Germany and Italy within a 
15:402:36024:21:21:70:544:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:comparable framework. They use repeated cross-section data to separate age from cohort effects, 
15:403:36120:21:21:70:544:467:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and employ comparable variable definitions and data sources as part of the International Savings

15:405:36316:22:21:70:544:424:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consumption  profiles  in  France,  Germany  and  Italy  are  rather  flat  and  show  no  dissaving  in  old  
15:406:36427:21:21:70:545:403:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:age.  This  is  evident  from  Figure  3-1  which  shows,  by  age  group,  median  saving  rates  in  these  
15:407:36537:21:27:70:147:382:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:three countries. 
15:408:36554:27:22:106:545:355:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  samples  employed  in  this  exercise  do  not  include  elderly  living  in  institutions,  so  
15:409:36656:22:21:70:544:333:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:there might be a bias towards households which are less likely to dissave. Börsch-Supan (1992) 
15:410:36751:21:21:70:545:312:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shows  for  Germany  that  this  bias  cannot  explain  the  observed  pattern  at  the  prevailing  rates  of  
15:411:36863:21:21:70:544:291:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:institutionalization. His selectivity correction only reduces the upturn of saving rates at the oldest 
15:412:36966:21:21:70:544:270:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:age categories. The saving profiles in figure 3-1 are also robust to several other specification and 
15:413:37067:21:28:70:423:249:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measurement alternatives; the reader is refereed to Börsch-Supan (2001). 
15:414:37140:28:21:106:540:221:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:There are several elements explaining these saving patterns, all linked to the pension sys-
15:415:37231:21:21:70:540:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tem. First and foremost, the high replacement rates of the public pension systems in these coun-
15:416:37327:21:21:70:544:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tries  make  additional  private  retirement  income  largely  unnecessary  as  pointed  out  above.  Thus,  
15:417:37436:21:22:70:544:158:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:saving  for  retirement,  the  only  motive  under  the  pure  life-cycle  hypothesis,  cannot  be  the  main  
15:418:37547:22:21:70:545:136:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:savings  motive.  In  fact,  Schnabel  (1999b)  shows  that  in  Germany  retirement  is  not  a  time  of  
15:419:37655:21:21:70:540:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:scarce resources for current generations of pensioners. Rather, due to rising productivity and dou-
15:420:37754:21:0:70:545:94:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ble  indexation  of  pensions  to  gross  wages,  retirement  income  has  been  above  average  income  
16:421:37861:0:21:70:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:during  working  life  for  cohorts  born  before  1930.7  Similar  arguments  hold  for  France  and  Italy,  
16:422:37972:21:21:70:545:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:where  pensions  provide  even  higher  replacement  rates  than  in  Germany  (Boeri,  Börsch-Supan,  
16:423:38075:21:22:70:544:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and Tabellini, 2001). If other saving motives, such as precaution and intergenerational transfers, 
16:424:38174:22:21:70:544:645:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are more important than retirement saving, age-saving profiles are likely to be much flatter than 
16:425:38272:21:21:70:544:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:under the famous textbook life-cycle hypotheses which predicts saving in young and dissaving in 
16:426:38368:21:21:70:544:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:old  age.  This  explanation  also  nicely  fits  into  the  work  by  Jappelli  and  Modigliani  (1998)  who  
16:427:38479:21:21:70:540:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:argue  that  the  main  mechanism  for  retirement  savings  –  the  only  savings  motive  under  the  text-
16:428:38588:21:22:70:543:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:book life-cycle-hypothesis – is the pay-as-you-go system. If one, as they do, adds contributions to 
16:429:38688:22:21:70:540:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these  pension  systems  to  savings  and  subtracts  benefits  from  them,  the  familiar  textbook  hump-
16:430:38795:21:27:70:250:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shaped saving profiles return indeed. 
16:431:38833:27:21:106:546:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Another  and  related  element  explaining  why  the  elderly  do  not  appear  to  dissave  is  
16:432:38930:21:22:70:543:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:brought forward by Börsch-Supan and Stahl (1991), Börsch-Supan (1992), and Schnabel (1999b). 
16:433:39023:22:21:70:544:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:They find that after retirement, consumption remains low and there are high inter vivos transfers 
16:434:39121:21:21:70:544:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as well as positive savings. Börsch-Supan and Stahl (1991) argue that due to deteriorating health 
16:435:39219:21:21:70:544:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conditions, the elderly are simply less able to spend as much as they would need to make saving 
16:436:39315:21:22:70:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:negative. A complementary explanation is simply habit persistence in old age. Again, root cause 
16:437:39411:22:21:70:545:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is  the  high  annuitized  pension  income  which  cannot  be  borrowed  against  even  if  the  decline  in  
16:438:39521:21:27:70:187:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:health were anticipated. 
16:439:39546:27:21:106:545:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:While  it  may  be  suggestive  and  plausible  that  the  rather  flat  saving  profiles  in  France,  
16:440:39650:21:22:70:540:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Germany  and  Italy  are  due  to  the  dominant  public  pension  systems  in  these  countries,  the  argu-
16:441:39759:22:21:70:544:272:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ment is vulnerable because we lack a counterfactual. The most appropriate counterfactual would 
16:442:39854:21:21:70:540:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:be  French,  German  and  Italian  data  from  times  when  these  countries  had  no  pay-as-you-go  sys-
16:443:39960:21:21:70:545:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tems.  Of  course,  we  do  not  have  such  data.  Another  alternative  are  international  comparisons  
16:444:40067:21:22:70:545:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:across  countries  with  differing  mixtures  of  pay-as-you-go  and  funded  pension  systems.  Poterba  
16:445:40173:22:21:70:544:187:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1994) provides a comparison of six OECD countries. It suggests that the textbook hump-shaped 
16:446:40267:21:21:70:543:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:life-cycle savings pattern is most pronounced in the U.S. and Canada where the replacement rates 
16:447:40364:21:21:70:543:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the public pay-as-you-go pension systems are lower than in continental Europe. These findings, 
16:448:40462:21:31:70:544:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:however, may be confounded by cohort effects. More significant is therefore the comparison with 
16:449:40558:31:25:70:217:93:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
16:450:40606:25:0:70:397:68:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:7  This holds for (equivalized) household income and even more so for per capita income.

17:452:40801:21:21:70:540:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(2001)  as  part  of  the  International  Savings  Comparison  Project  mentioned  above.  The  Nether-
17:453:40904:21:21:70:544:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lands have, as opposed to France, Germany and Italy, only a small base pension provided by their 
17:454:41001:21:22:70:544:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pay-as-you-go  public  pension  system,  with  benefits  linked  to  the  minimum  wage.  All  additional  
17:455:41108:22:21:70:543:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:retirement income in the Netherlands has to be provided by (mandatory) savings plans, commonly 
17:456:41203:21:21:70:544:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:provided through occupational pension plans. Figure 3-1 shows that the median Dutch household 
17:457:41297:21:21:70:545:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:has  a  much  more  pronounced  hump-shaped  life-cycle  savings  profile  than  the  median  French,  
17:458:41400:21:22:70:544:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:German and Italian households. Moreover, figure 3-1 shows dissaving among the elderly as they 
17:459:41494:22:21:70:544:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:draw  down  their  mandatory  saving  accounts.  Of  course,  we  are  aware  that  this  is  a  comparison  
17:460:41603:21:21:70:543:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between four data points only. We are in the process of collecting similar profiles also for the UK 
17:461:41703:21:27:70:129:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and the US. 
17:462:41715:27:22:106:544:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:If indeed most of the saving patterns currently observed in France, Germany and Italy are 
17:463:41805:22:21:70:543:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:caused by their pay-as-you-go pension systems with their generous retirement benefits, we should 
17:464:41902:21:21:70:544:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:expect  distinct  changes  in  saving  patterns  in  the  future.  As  described  at  the  end  of  Section  2,  a  
17:465:42018:21:21:70:540:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension  reform  towards  a  multi-pillar  system  with  a  substantial  portion  of  funded  retirement  in-
17:466:42127:21:22:70:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:come will revive the retirement motive for saving. In fact, these systems will look very similar to 
17:467:42227:22:21:70:544:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the current Dutch system. Hence, it is likely that saving rates among the young will increase (to 
17:468:42325:21:21:70:544:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accumulate retirement savings), and saving rates among the elderly will decline sharply (because 
17:469:42422:21:27:70:280:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:they will dissolve their retirement savings). 
17:470:42468:27:21:106:544:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  simulation  results  in  Section  2  also  give  us  an  order  of  magnitude  for  those  effects.  
17:471:42574:21:22:70:540:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To the extent that all the induced retirement saving by a multi-pillar pension reform is new sav-
17:472:42671:22:21:70:544:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing,  the  net  saving  rate  of  the  average  German  household  in  mid  age  would  increase  by  about  4  
17:473:42783:21:21:70:544:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentage  points  (from  11  to  15  percent).  The  saving  rate  would  decrease  by  in  old  age,  when  
17:474:42894:21:21:70:540:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:retirement  accounts  are  used  for  consumption,  by  about  6  percentage  points,  from  4  to  –2  per-
17:475:43002:21:28:70:419:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cent). Portfolio composition would also change, see the next subsection. 
17:476:43075:28:21:106:545:160:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Note  that  some  substitution  between  these  new  saving  for  old  age  and  other  savings  is  
17:477:43176:21:21:70:545:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:likely.  This  will  decrease  the  effect  of  a  fundamental  pension  reform  on  the  overall  household  
17:478:43286:21:21:70:545:118:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:saving  rate,  but  will  increase  the  effect  on  portfolio  composition.  We  do  not  know  the  precise  
17:479:43397:21:22:70:540:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:magnitude of such effects. Precautionary saving may even increase, while saving for intergenera-
17:480:43493:22:0:70:540:75:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tional  transfers  is  more  likely  to  decrease  in  response  to  introducing  a  higher  degree  of  self-
18:481:43605:0:21:70:540:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:provided  retirement  income.  The  overlapping  generations  model  of  section  2,  calibrated  to  Ger-
18:482:43711:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:man data and combined with a bookkeeping model of the new multipillar pension system, yields 
18:483:43804:21:21:70:544:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a  rough  estimate  of  substitution.  It  amounts  to  about  one  third,  i.e.,  one  third  of  the  new  saving  
18:484:43921:21:46:70:446:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will be crowded out while two thirds will be net additions to the capital stock.

18:488:44211:21:22:70:544:531:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:using household data from the 1993 wave of the German Income and Expenditure Survey, drawn 
18:489:44302:22:21:70:544:509:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from Börsch-Supan and Eymann (2001) as part of a parallel internationally comparative exercise

18:491:44509:21:21:70:544:467:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:seen from the fact that, in 1993, its share in total financial wealth was about a third. The central

18:493:44718:22:21:70:544:424:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:decisions is its favorable tax treatment (see Brunsbach and Lang, 1998, and Walliser and Winter, 
18:494:44815:21:21:70:545:403:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1999).  At  the  household  level,  financial  saving  in  whole  life  insurance  is  more  important  than  
18:495:44925:21:21:70:545:382:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:saving  in  stocks  and  bonds.8  A  substantial  portion  of  this  saving  is  used  as  a  device  to  finance  
18:496:45040:21:22:70:545:361:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:homeownership.  Pension  funds  do  not  even  appear  in  the  aggregate  statistics,  so  small  is  their  
18:497:45150:22:21:70:540:339:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:share, very different from The Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Guiso, Jappelli and Halias-

18:502:45543:21:21:70:540:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we discuss in Section 4, these restrictions will become less important because of increased avail-
18:503:45641:21:27:70:518:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ability of alternative products and the resulting increase in competition for retirement saving. 
18:504:45738:27:22:106:545:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This  portfolio  composition  is  likely  to  change  under  a  partial  transition  to  a  multi-pillar  
18:505:45844:22:21:70:544:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:system.  We  again  use  the  simulation  results  for  Germany.  If  there  were  no  substitution  between  
18:506:45954:21:21:70:544:136:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:new retirement saving and current saving, the net household saving rate would increase by about 
18:507:46050:21:22:70:544:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:4 percent, as mentioned in the previous subsection. If all of this would be channeled into pension

18:509:46197:25:0:70:486:68:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:8  The majority of stocks and bonds are bonds.  Stocks are less than 10 percent of the average household portfolio. 
19:510:46315:0:21:70:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funds,  pension  funds  would  amount  to  between  15  and  18  percent  of  households’  portfolios,  
19:511:46419:21:21:70:540:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:comparable  to  the  United  Kingdom,  the  U.S.,  the  Netherlands  and  Switzerland.  Substitution  be-
19:512:46524:21:21:70:544:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tween new retirement saving and current saving would increase this share, although part of new 
19:513:46619:21:22:70:540:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:retirement saving may also be made through whole life insurance given its preferential tax treat-
19:514:46716:22:21:70:540:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ment.  Households’  direct  and  indirect  exposure  to  stock  markets  then  depends  on  future  invest-
19:515:46823:21:21:70:545:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ment  decisions  of  life  insurance  companies  who  only  recently  began  to  increase  their  portfolio  
19:516:46932:21:21:70:544:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:share  of  stocks.  Judging  from  the  international  experience  in  countries  as  diverse  as  the  United  
19:517:47044:21:22:70:545:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Kingdom,  the  U.S.,  the  Netherlands  and  Switzerland,  a  more  prominent  role  of  equities  on  the  
19:518:47152:22:21:70:544:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supply side of the capital markets seems very likely when more of the retirement income will be 
19:519:47248:21:27:70:274:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pre-funded in France, Germany and Italy.  
19:520:47290:27:21:106:540:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We  finish  this  section  with  one  important  hint  for  policy  makers:  if  they  want  to  under-
19:521:47393:21:22:70:540:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stand  future  saving  volumes  and  their  allocation  and  design  their  policies  accordingly,  we  re-
19:522:47500:22:21:70:544:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:searchers need better data. If they want forecasts that are more precise than the qualitative trends 
19:523:47601:21:21:70:540:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:derived from our simulation model, we need longitudinal data on portfolio choice and saving be-

19:525:47704:53:35:70:458:353:197:g_d0_f4:197:g_d0_f4:4. How strong capital markets enhance productivity and growth 
19:526:47766:35:21:106:541:318:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In the previous sections, we have shown that in aging countries with predominant pay-as-
19:527:47854:21:22:70:540:297:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:you-go  pension  systems  such  as  Germany,  population  aging,  together  with  an  increase  in  pre-
19:528:47958:22:21:70:544:275:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funding of pension schemes, (i) raises aggregate saving and the balance of assets held by private 
19:529:48056:21:21:70:544:254:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:households, and (ii) changes the portfolio composition of private households, with an increase in 
19:530:48154:21:21:70:546:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the share of risky assets that offer higher expected returns. We now investigate how these changes  
19:531:48254:21:28:70:476:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:may affect productivity and economic growth via their impact on financial markets.  
19:532:48338:28:21:106:541:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our  argument  proceeds  in  three  steps.  First,  we  briefly  review  the  literature  on  the  rela-
19:533:48442:21:21:70:545:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tionship  between  financial  market  conditions  and  economic  growth,  and  we  present  some  new  
19:534:48545:21:21:70:544:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:suggestive  evidence  for  the  impact  of  stock  market  capitalization  and  the  size  of  pension  funds.  
19:535:48657:21:21:70:545:121:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Next,  we  investigate  one  channel  through  which  capital  market  conditions  might  have  affected  
19:536:48763:21:22:70:543:100:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economic growth over the last two decades or so. Specifically, we show that the poor productivity 
19:537:48861:22:0:70:543:78:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:performance of firms in countries such as Germany, France and Italy relative to the United States, 
20:538:48962:0:21:70:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  current  leader  in  productivity  growth  among  the  large  industrialized  countries,  is  related  to  
20:539:49074:21:21:70:540:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:poor corporate governance. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of an increasing role of ac-
20:540:49172:21:46:70:510:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tive investment and pension funds in countries with weak corporate governance structures.  
20:541:49263:46:27:70:297:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:4.1 Financial market conditions and growth 
20:542:49306:27:21:106:541:594:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We are not the first to argue that the development of financial markets is an important fac-
20:543:49398:21:21:70:540:573:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tor in explaining the sources of productivity and economic growth; see Levine (1997) for an ex-
20:544:49493:21:21:70:544:552:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tensive review of this literature. Following Levine (p. 691), one can distinguish five functions of 
20:545:49593:21:22:70:540:531:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the financial system: (i) to facilitate the exchange of goods and services; (ii) to facilitate the trad-
20:546:49697:22:21:70:543:509:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing, hedging, diversifying, and pooling of risk; (iii) to mobilize savings; (iv) to allocate resources; 
20:547:49801:21:21:70:540:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(v)  to  monitor  managers  and  exert  corporate  control.  The  last  two  of  these  functions  are  of  par-
20:548:49913:21:27:70:260:467:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ticular relevance for the present paper.  
20:549:49955:27:22:106:541:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In  our  analysis  of  the  potential  effects  of  population  aging  and  pension  reform  on  eco-
20:550:50056:22:21:70:544:418:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nomic growth, we focus on the role of overall market liquidity and the size stock markets. While 
20:551:50153:21:21:70:540:397:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:theoretical models show that banks can generally perform the basic functions of the financial sys-
20:552:50251:21:21:70:544:376:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tems  in  similar  ways  as  stock  markets,  recent  experience  raises  doubts  that  bank-based  systems  
20:553:50360:21:22:70:544:355:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have  performed  as  well  as  market-based  systems,  at  least  over  the  last  two  decades  (see  section  
20:554:50472:22:21:70:541:333:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:4.2  below).9  Among  the  many  theoretical  models  that  analyze  the  role  of  stock  markets  for  re-
20:555:50580:21:21:70:545:312:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:source  allocation  and  corporate  governance,  we  mention  only  a  few  (Levine,  1997,  lists  many  
20:556:50686:21:21:70:540:291:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more). Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) and Holmstrom and Tirole (1993) show that as markets be-
20:557:50778:21:22:70:545:270:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:come  larger  and  more  liquid,  market  participants  have  more  incentives  to  acquire  information  
20:558:50884:22:21:70:540:248:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:about firms. Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Jensen and Murphy (1990) show that linking man-
20:559:50975:21:21:70:545:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ager  compensation  to  stock  performance  helps  to  align  the  interests  of  managers  with  those  of  
20:560:51084:21:21:70:544:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:owners, and that takeovers are easier in well-developed stock markets, thus improving corporate

20:562:51193:28:21:106:545:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  empirical  literature  that  explores  these  mechanisms  has  grown  dramatically  over  the  
20:563:51293:21:21:70:544:136:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:last few years. In addition to the survey by Levine (1997), see Beck, Levine, and Loayza (2000) 
20:564:51389:21:22:70:543:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for a helpful review of very recent work in this area. Again, we mention only a few results that are 
20:565:51490:22:25:70:217:93:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
20:566:51538:25:0:70:519:68:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:9  Edwards and Nibler (2000) provide a more favorable view of the role of banks and ownership concentration in Germany. 
21:567:51660:0:21:70:540:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of particular relevance to our argument. In a careful time-series study with aggregate data, Neus-
21:568:51758:21:21:70:543:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ser and Kugler (1998) demonstrate that financial sector development predicts GDP growth and, in 
21:569:51854:21:21:70:544:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:particular, total factor productivity. Levine and Zervos (1998) report that stock market liquidity is 
21:570:51956:21:22:70:545:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:positively  and  robustly  correlated  with  contemporaneous  and  future  rates  of  economic  growth,  
21:571:52061:22:21:70:545:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consistent  with  the  view  that  a  greater  ability  to  trade  ownership  of  an  economy’s  productive  
21:572:52170:21:21:70:548:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:technologies  facilitates  efficient  resource  allocation,  physical  capital  formation,  and  faster  
21:573:52275:21:21:70:540:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economic growth. Levine and Zervos also find no negative impact of stock market liquidity, in-
21:574:52369:21:22:70:540:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ternational capital market integration, or stock return volatility on private savings.  Similar find-
21:575:52470:22:21:70:545:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ings  have  been  obtained  by  Rajan  and  Zingales  (1998)  who  compare  industrial  sectors  across  
21:576:52575:21:21:70:546:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries,  arguing  that  financial  development  reduces  the  costs  of  external  finance  to  firms.  
21:577:52682:21:21:70:545:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Wrugler  (2000)  confirms  that  financial  markets  play  an  important  role  in  the  capital  allocation  
21:578:52792:21:22:70:544:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:process. He reports that the efficiency of capital allocation is positively correlated with the degree 
21:579:52895:22:21:70:540:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of legal protection of investors (i.e., in Anglo-American, market-based financial systems). In par-
21:580:52994:21:21:70:544:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ticular, Wrugler argues that market-based systems are more successful in limiting overinvestment 
21:581:53091:21:21:70:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in declining industries. Finally, using cross-country panel data, Beck, Levine, and Loayza (2000) 
21:582:53189:21:22:70:545:391:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and  Levine,  Loayza,  and  Beck  (2000)  show  that  financial  intermediaries  exert  a  large,  positive  
21:583:53298:22:27:70:327:369:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:impact on total factor productivity and GDP growth.  
21:584:53351:27:21:106:541:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:One  frequently  made  objection  against  a  causal  interpretation  of  the  relation  between  fi-

21:587:53642:21:22:70:544:279:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cial  sector.  Such  doubts  have  been  addressed  with  disaggregate  studies  at  the  firm  and  industry  
21:588:53753:22:21:70:540:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:levels, including some of the more recent work we mentioned above. It is our reading of the lit-
21:589:53849:21:21:70:545:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:erature  that  the  well-documented  positive  effect  of  financial  market  development  on  economic  
21:590:53954:21:27:70:263:215:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:growth is not due to reversed causality.

22:599:54751:21:21:70:543:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:number of observations is 211. In addition, we have data on pension funds for 1996 from Bank of 
22:600:54847:21:27:70:523:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:International Settlements (1998, table V.5) and for 1999 from Merrill Lynch (2001, table 10).  
22:601:54942:27:22:106:541:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In table 4-1, we report a Granger causality analysis for the relationship between stock mar-
22:602:55034:22:21:70:544:618:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ket capitalization and economic growth. These regressions confirm that after controlling for fixed 
22:603:55133:21:21:70:544:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effects, there is a significantly positive relation between contemporaneous values of stock market 
22:604:55232:21:21:70:540:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capitalization and the annual growth of GDP. The relation between lagged stock market capitali-
22:605:55327:21:22:70:540:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:zation and current GDP growth is also positive and significant, while future stock market capitali-
22:606:55426:22:27:70:314:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:zation does not significantly predict GDP growth.  
22:607:55477:27:21:106:544:506:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To highlight the relevance of this result for our argument, it is instructive to look at some 
22:608:55571:21:21:70:545:485:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries  in  more  detail.  Figure  4-1  displays  for  ten  countries  the  combination  of  stock  market

22:611:55887:21:21:70:545:421:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Germany,  France,  and  Spain)  cluster  at  low  levels  of  stock  market  capitalization  and  relatively  
22:612:55997:21:21:70:544:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:low GDP growth, compared with the cluster of three countries (the Netherlands, the UK and the 
22:613:56091:21:22:70:543:379:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:US) with funded pension systems, high levels of stock market capitalization, and relatively higher 
22:614:56190:22:21:70:545:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:growth  rates.  Even  though  the  difference  in  growth  rates  might  not  appear  to  be  large  on  first  
22:615:56302:21:21:70:544:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sight, the compound effect of, say, a 0.5 percentage point growth rate difference over ten years is 
22:616:56402:21:21:70:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economically quite significant. Needless to say, we do not claim that this figure alone proves cau-
22:617:56501:21:21:70:540:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sality, and we haste to add that the positions of the remaining countries in this figure (Japan, Ire-
22:618:56602:21:22:70:544:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:land, and Sweden) indicate that there are many other factors than stock market capitalization that 
22:619:56701:22:27:70:193:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:affect economic growth.  
22:620:56726:27:21:106:544:224:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A similar picture arises if we look at the relation of pension fund assets (relative to GDP)

22:622:56916:22:21:70:544:181:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:surprising,  since  the  relationship  between  pension  fund  assets  and  stock  market  capitalization  is  
22:623:57027:21:21:70:544:160:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:itself relatively tight (with a correlation of 0.603 in the 1996 cross-section). Finally, we consider 
22:624:57129:21:21:70:540:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:at the relationship stock market capitalization and total factor productivity. Total factor productiv-
22:625:57231:21:25:70:544:118:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ity growth is one of the major sources of GDP growth (Hall and Jones, 1999). We should expect

22:627:57373:25:0:70:491:68:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:11  Pension fund assets are for 1996 for Japan and the United states, and for 1999 for the remaining eight countries. 
23:628:57493:0:21:70:543:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that countries with deeper capital markets have relatively higher levels of total factor productivity. 
23:629:57596:21:21:70:540:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figure  4-3  shows,  for  the  same  set  of  ten  countries,  the  relationship  between  stock  market  capi-

23:631:57806:21:22:70:543:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1999). Here, the relationship is not very tight, but there is a positive cross-sectional correlation of 
23:632:57911:22:27:70:106:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:0.387.  
23:633:57919:27:21:106:541:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We interpret the evidence presented in this section, together with the wealth of results re-
23:634:58011:21:21:70:540:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ported in the literature, as an indication that there is indeed a relation between the depth of finan-

23:636:58211:22:21:70:543:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:performance. There are, of course, numerous concerns related to small sample sizes and causality, 
23:637:58309:21:21:70:545:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and  we  refrain  from  giving  these  results  a  causal  interpretation.  Rather,  we  present  additional

23:642:58688:27:21:106:545:376:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In  order  to  analyze  the  sources  of  long-run  differences  in  productivity  across  countries,  
23:643:58791:21:22:70:543:355:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Börsch-Supan (1998b) combines two sources of variation, across countries and across companies,

23:647:59196:21:21:70:545:270:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:total  factor  productivity.  Notwithstanding  substantial  variation  across  companies  and  industries,  
23:648:59304:21:22:70:544:249:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the market sectors of West Germany and Japan had significantly lower rates of capital utilization 
23:649:59402:22:21:70:544:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the early 1990s and created less productive capacity per unit of physical assets than the United 
23:650:59502:21:21:70:544:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:States did. Börsch-Supan shows that these low rates of capital utilization were only partially due 
23:651:59601:21:21:70:544:185:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to high labor costs relative to capital, leading to high capital intensity at short work hours.  More 
23:652:59703:21:22:70:540:164:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:important for the aggregate result of poor capital productivity were the many cases in which man-
23:653:59800:22:21:70:544:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:agement did not focus on how productively they were using their assets. Conversely, a focus on 
23:654:59895:21:21:70:540:121:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:financial performance, especially prevalent among U.S. firms, did create a clear performance ob-
23:655:59991:21:0:70:321:100:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jective that was generally aligned with productivity. 
24:656:60047:0:21:106:547:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In  order  to  address  Porter’s  (1992)  criticism  of  short-termism,  Börsch-Supan  (1998b)  
24:657:60143:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:looked at the long-run rates of return.  Over the 1974 to 1993 period, U.S. financial performance 
24:658:60241:21:21:70:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:was significantly better than in Germany, and on average better than in Japan.  He calculated fi-

24:660:60447:22:21:70:544:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital gains) to the inflows into the corporate sector (debt and equity) through the corresponding 
24:661:60547:21:21:70:540:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:internal rate of return, including the initial and final stock of financial wealth.12  Results are dis-

24:663:60762:21:22:70:545:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:return  was  9.1  percent  in  the  United  States  compared  to  7.4  percent  in  Germany.    After  1990,  
24:664:60872:22:21:70:544:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:U.S.  rates  of  return  also  exceeded  Japanese  returns.    These  estimates  are  robust  with  respect  to  
24:665:60985:21:21:70:545:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changes  in  definition  and  computation  period  for  the  U.S.-German  comparison,  while  the  high

24:667:61186:22:21:70:543:475:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the U.S.-Japan comparison subject to higher variance.13 These differences in the long-run rates of 
24:668:61285:21:21:70:540:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:return do not support the view by Porter (1992) that short-termism in the United States compro-
24:669:61380:21:27:70:256:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mises long-run financial performance.

24:672:61625:21:21:70:540:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Mueller and Yurtoglu (2000). These differences in rates of return are also reflected in the persis-

24:674:61822:21:21:70:544:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(about 15 percent lower in Germany, 40 percent in Japan for the 1991--1996 period).  While the 
24:675:61917:21:22:70:540:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:returns to invested capital are, trivially, linked to capital productivity, the link to total factor pro-

24:677:62132:21:21:70:544:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:opposite  differences  in  capital  productivity.    However,  this  is  not  the  case  in  practice  –  just  the

24:685:62854:10:14:70:544:90:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:13  However, comparisons that cover the full cycle of bubble boom and burst, i.e., from 1992 onward, and that exclude the very 
24:686:62981:14:11:70:544:76:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:early  1970s,  when  Japan’s  capital  market  development  was  not  comparable  to  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  yield  a  return  difference

25:688:63207:0:21:106:541:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Needless to say, there are many other reasons for international differences in financial per-

25:690:63398:21:21:70:545:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:competition  in  product  markets.  However,  there  may  be  important  interactions  with  corporate

25:692:63604:22:21:70:544:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ductivity can be traced to a self-reinforcing interaction of weaker product market competition and

25:696:64012:22:21:70:545:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  1986–94  period,  they  find  that  those  industries  which  are  characterized  by  more  intensive  
25:697:64120:21:21:70:540:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:product  market  competition  tend  to  see  higher  productivity  growth  rates,  controlling  for  the  ef-
25:698:64229:21:21:70:543:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fects of corporate governance. Similar findings have been obtained by Nickell et al. (1997) for the 
25:699:64329:21:28:70:102:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:U.K.   
25:700:64336:28:21:106:540:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In summary, a corporate governance system with a highly concentrated ownership of capi-
25:701:64423:21:21:70:540:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tal by banks and cross-holdings (as in Germany, other continental European countries and in Ja-

25:704:64738:22:27:70:480:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tors. This raises the issue of the role of corporate governance structures in Germany.  
25:705:64826:27:21:106:541:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The ultimate owners of capital are households (and the state). However, industrial cross-
25:706:64915:21:21:70:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:holdings  and  bank  ownership  weaken  this  link.  This  effect  is  particularly  pronounced  in  Ger-
25:707:65020:21:21:70:543:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:many: German households (and, on behalf of households, institutional investors other than banks) 
25:708:65117:21:22:70:544:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hold a very small share of productive capital.  In 1996, the corresponding share was 11.4 percent 
25:709:65215:22:21:70:540:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in  Germany  while  it  was  59.8  percent  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  43.4  percent  in  the  U.S.,  re-
25:710:65324:21:21:70:545:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:spectively.    In  turn,  cross-holdings  of  German  banks  and  non-financial  companies  among  large  
25:711:65430:21:21:70:544:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:firms  are  very  common  in  comparison  to  the  Anglo-Saxon  countries.    46.8  percent  of  all  shares  
25:712:65540:21:22:70:543:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(measured as gross capitalization) are held by banks and non-financial companies while this share 
25:713:65638:22:21:70:540:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is only 1.5 percent in the United Kingdom and 2.5 percent in the U.S., mainly due to legal restric-
25:714:65737:21:21:70:540:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tions and tax treatment. Wenger and Kaserer (1998) estimate cross-holdings to be at least 27 per-
25:715:65834:21:21:70:540:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cent  of  gross  capitalization  in  1994  and  presumably  much  more.  Adams  (1999)  provides  a  de-
25:716:65938:21:22:70:540:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tailed  analysis  of  how  current  legal  arrangements  allow  managers  to  hide  the  structure  of  cross-
25:717:66048:22:0:70:544:81:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:holdings from the public. Adams concludes that “it is impossible to discover the ownership and 
26:718:66145:0:21:70:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:control structure in Germany from the mandatory accounting publications” (Adams 1999, p. 80). 
26:719:66239:21:21:70:545:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Becht  and  Boehmer  (1999)  report  that  85  percent  of  all  publicly  traded  firms  have  a  dominant  
26:720:66348:21:21:70:545:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shareholder  who  controls  more  than  25  percent  of  the  voting  rights,  in  most  cases  a  bank  or  a  
26:721:66460:21:22:70:545:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:non-financial  company.  The  concentrated  control  structure  is  pronounced  by  the  German  proxy  
26:722:66564:22:21:70:543:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:voting system which gives the banking system convenient access to the votes of dispersed owners 
26:723:66660:21:27:70:249:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the general shareholder meetings.  
26:724:66698:27:21:106:545:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:While it is undisputed that equity ownership and control rights are highly concentrated in 
26:725:66789:21:22:70:543:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Germany, there is less agreement on the impact of the concentrated ownership of shares by banks 
26:726:66885:22:21:70:544:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and non-financial companies on firm performance. Wenger and Kaserer (1998) provide evidence 
26:727:66977:21:21:70:540:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that the degree of bank involvement is negatively correlated with firm performance, using a sam-
26:728:67073:21:21:70:546:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ple  of  large  German  companies  covering  56  percent  of  market  capitalization.  This  study  has  
26:729:67178:21:22:70:545:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:credibility  because  it  a  common  methodological  problem  encountered  in  the  empirical  debate:  
26:730:67282:22:21:70:545:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Many  effects  are  poorly  identified  in  historical  data  due  to  the  absence  of  any  clear  cut  natural  
26:731:67397:21:21:70:544:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:experiment, and hence most studies lack a counterfactual. Germany has never experimented with 
26:732:67491:21:21:70:544:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:large  institutional  investors,  and  its  corporate  governance  system  has  been  quite  stable  over  the  
26:733:67603:21:22:70:540:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:last decades. Wenger and Kaserer come fairly close to using proper exogenous variation in corpo-
26:734:67699:22:21:70:544:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rate governance because they use a difference-in-difference approach to link changes in returns to 
26:735:67798:21:21:70:544:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changes  in  the  supervisory  board  for  companies  with  high  and  low  bank  involvement.  Edwards  
26:736:67903:21:21:70:540:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and Nibler (2000) provide a slightly more favorable assessment of German banks’ role in corpo-
26:737:67997:21:21:70:544:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rate  governance.  They  report  some  evidence  that  concentrated  ownership  has  positive  effects  on  
26:738:68105:21:22:70:543:279:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:firm performance. To the extent that they find positive effects of concentrated ownership, they are 
26:739:68205:22:21:70:545:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:not  particularly  related  to  the  role  of  banks.    In  some  cases,  concentrated  ownership  has  even  
26:740:68316:21:27:70:151:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:negative effects. 
26:741:68334:27:21:106:544:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:As we argued before, because of population aging and fundamental pension reforms, and 
26:742:68420:21:22:70:540:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:because of households’ optimal reaction, countries such as Germany are likely to move from pre-
26:743:68515:22:21:70:540:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dominantly bank-based financial systems towards a more prominent role of investment and pen-
26:744:68607:21:21:70:543:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sion funds. The evidence reviewed in this section suggest that this should have a positive impact, 
26:745:68706:21:21:70:545:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:but  it  was  primarily  based  on  the  observation  that  a  bank-based  system  does  not  provide  good  
26:746:68815:21:22:70:545:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:corporate  governance  in  many  cases.  The  next  section  discusses  why  investment  and  pension  
26:747:68918:22:0:70:323:81:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funds might actually improve corporate governance. 
27:748:68971:0:27:70:432:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:4.3 Active pension funds, corporate governance and firm performance 
27:749:69039:27:21:106:541:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Pension funds, and investment funds more generally, play almost no role in corporate gov-
27:750:69128:21:21:70:547:661:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ernance  in  most  continental  European  countries.  As  reported  by  the  Bank  for  International  
27:751:69231:21:22:70:540:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Settlements (1998), in 1996 pension fund assets represented only 3 percent of total GDP in Ger-
27:752:69326:22:21:70:540:618:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:many and 4 percent in Italy, while in the U.S. and the U.K., the shares are 57 percent and 77 per-
27:753:69424:21:21:70:543:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cent, respectively (see table 1-2). Götzfried (1998) presents a more detailed analysis of the role of 
27:754:69526:21:21:70:540:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension funds in major European countries. His results are based on a survey conducted by Euro-
27:755:69621:21:22:70:545:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stat  in  1997.  As  might  be  expected,  the  number  of  independent  pension  funds  is  high  in  those  
27:756:69731:22:21:70:546:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries  that  rely  heavily  on  funded  pension  schemes,  i.e.,  the  Netherlands  and  Switzerland  
27:757:69837:21:21:70:543:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(there are no comparable data for the U.K.). In contrast, the number of independent pension funds 
27:758:69935:21:21:70:540:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in  Germany  is  extremely  small.  At  the  same  time,  Germany  has  the  largest  number  of  firm-
27:759:70038:21:22:70:544:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:specific pension plans among those European countries covered, but in terms of their investment 
27:760:70134:22:27:70:429:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:behavior, these are very different from pension funds in the narrow sense.  
27:761:70210:27:21:106:549:421:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:There  are  several  reasons  for  these  differences  in  the  economic  role  of  pension  funds.    
27:762:70313:21:21:70:540:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Again, we take Germany as an example, although similar arguments can be made for other conti-
27:763:70406:21:22:70:544:379:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nental European countries as well. First, and most importantly, the majority of pension income is 
27:764:70504:22:21:70:544:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:provided by the public pay-as-you-go pension system, as has been described in Section 3. Thus, 
27:765:70599:21:21:70:544:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:few households invest in pension funds in the first place. Second, mainly due to tax advantages, 
27:766:70696:21:21:70:544:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:individual retirement saving is channeled into whole life insurance. Life insurance companies are 
27:767:70794:21:21:70:544:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:legally barred from investing more than a small part of their portfolios in stocks – up to about 30 
27:768:70894:21:22:70:544:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent  of  assets  for  traditional  whole  life  insurance  according  to  life  insurance  regulations,  but  
27:769:71008:22:21:70:544:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:much less in practice.14 Finally, assets that are accumulated for funded firm pension schemes are 
27:770:71106:21:21:70:544:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:currently not invested in the capital market, but are set aside as capital reserves in firms’ balance 
27:771:71208:21:22:70:544:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sheets, again because of legal and tax reasons. Even to the extent that these funds are invested in 
27:772:71308:22:21:70:544:187:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:other  firms,  they  are  likely  to  contribute  to  the  network  of  cross-holdings.  As  a  result  of  these  
27:773:71423:21:21:70:540:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:institutional  arrangements,  Germany  has  few  institutional  investors  and  stock  market  capitaliza-
27:774:71529:21:42:70:359:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tion is low by international standards (see table 1-2 above).  
27:775:71592:42:24:70:217:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
27:776:71640:24:14:70:543:79:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:14  In Germany, insurance companies have recently started to offer other life-insurance products which allow heavy investment in 
27:777:71769:14:0:70:438:65:81:g_d0_f3:81:g_d0_f3:risky assets such as stocks in recent years, but until now, they claim only a small share of the market.  
28:778:71877:0:21:106:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Given  the  small  role  that  pensions  have  historically  had  in  countries  with  pay-as-you-go  
28:779:71979:21:21:70:545:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension  systems,  we  cannot  provide  empirical  evidence  based  on  past  experience.  Rather,  we  
28:780:72083:21:21:70:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discuss  how  pension  funds  influence  corporate  governance  in  those  countries  in  which  they  al-
28:781:72189:21:22:70:544:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ready play a major role. To understand pension fund investment and performance, it is useful to 
28:782:72285:22:21:70:540:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:first think about pension funds in a world with complete markets and no agency problems. Cog-
28:783:72378:21:21:70:545:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gin  et  al.  (1993)  note  that  if  one  accepts  the  efficient  market  hypothesis,  “all  active  investment  
28:784:72493:21:21:70:544:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:management  activity  is  futile”  (p.  1040),  and  the  optimal  choice  for  a  pension  plan  would  be  to  
28:785:72606:21:22:70:540:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:invest in a passively managed market index fund. Few people, however, would believe that finan-
28:786:72701:22:21:70:543:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cial markets are efficient – and managed pension funds do exist. But do actively managed pension 
28:787:72798:21:21:70:544:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funds  really  perform  better  than  a  passively  managed  index  fund?  In  their  empirical  analysis  of  
28:788:72909:21:21:70:540:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:U.S. pension funds, Coggin et al. (1993) find that after adjusting returns for risk, some fund man-
28:789:73008:21:22:70:544:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:agers outperform the market while most do not, a result that has been replicated in many similar 
28:790:73105:22:27:70:112:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:studies.  
28:791:73115:27:21:106:543:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:An important way for pension fund managers to improve the performance of their funds is

28:795:73504:21:21:70:540:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pensions. The basic theoretical argument has been made, for example, by Pound (1988): Institu-
28:796:73598:21:21:70:544:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tional investors such as pension funds that have no business relations with a firm can do a better 
28:797:73697:21:27:70:230:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:job in disciplining management.  
28:798:73730:27:22:106:540:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:There is a large number of studies which try to evaluate the effectiveness pension fund ac-
28:799:73821:22:21:70:545:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tivism.  Black  (1998)  surveys  the  literature  on  large  shareholder  and  pension  fund  activism  and  
28:800:73930:21:21:70:544:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concludes that pension fund interventions are generally ineffective. However, there are also quite 
28:801:74029:21:21:70:545:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a  few  studies  which  indicate  that  pension  fund  activism  has  beneficial  effects  and  that  agency  
28:802:74139:21:22:70:545:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:problems  are  not  a  major  concern  in  practice.  For  example,  Del  Guercio  and  Hawkins  (1999)  
28:803:74244:22:21:70:540:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:study shareholder proposals of the largest, most active funds from 1987 through 1993. They con-
28:804:74339:21:21:70:544:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:clude that pension funds are successful at monitoring and promoting change in target firms, and 
28:805:74435:21:21:70:544:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:they do not find evidence to support that funds have other motivations than value maximization. 
28:806:74531:21:22:70:544:103:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This result can be interpreted as indicating that agency problems might not be a major concern in 
28:807:74629:22:0:70:117:81:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:practice.  
29:808:74642:0:21:106:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Several  empirical  studies  concentrate  on  the  best-known  example  of  an  active  pension  
29:809:74739:21:21:70:544:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fund, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest public pension 
29:810:74834:21:21:70:545:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fund  in  the  U.S.  and  third  largest  in  the  world  with  total  assets  over  164  billion  US  Dollar  in  
29:811:74949:21:22:70:544:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1999.  Over  the  last  decade,  CalPERS  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  shareholder  activism,  with  an  
29:812:75060:22:21:70:545:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explicit  goal  “to  efficiently  and  effectively  manage  investments  to  achieve  the  highest  possible  
29:813:75170:21:21:70:544:603:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:return at an acceptable level of risk.” To this end, CalPERS reviews the performance of the U.S. 
29:814:75267:21:21:70:544:582:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:companies in its stock portfolio on a regular basis and identifies those that are among the lowest 
29:815:75366:21:22:70:544:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:long-term relative performers. This review process results in a list of companies that are publicly 
29:816:75466:22:21:70:545:539:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identified  as  a  “CalPERS  focus  company”.  In  1999,  this  list  covered  nine  companies.  Among  
29:817:75570:21:21:70:540:518:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:other interventions, CalPERS filed 65 shareholder’s proposals in order to improve firm perform-
29:818:75665:21:21:70:544:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ance of its focus companies during the 1987-1998 period. The average annual rate of return was 
29:819:75760:21:22:70:545:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:13.2%  over  these  ten  years.15  Nesbitt  (1994)  reports  weak  evidence  that  CalPERS  interventions  
29:820:75867:22:21:70:545:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:affected  stock  prices  of  targeted  firms  positively.  Smith  (1996)  analyzes  51  firms  out  of  the  78  
29:821:75980:21:21:70:544:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:targeting events of CalPERS over the 1987-93 period. He finds that shareholder wealth increases 
29:822:76076:21:21:70:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for  firms  that  adopt  or  settle,  and  decreases  for  firms  that  resist  changes  proposed  by  CalPERS.  
29:823:76189:21:22:70:540:391:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Smith  concludes  that  “shareholder  activism  is  largely  successful  in  changing  governance  struc-
29:824:76294:22:21:70:544:369:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ture,  and,  when  successful,  results  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  shareholder  value”  (p.  
29:825:76410:21:27:70:101:348:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:251).  
29:826:76417:27:21:106:545:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Based  on  these  theoretical  and  empirical  findings  about  the  link  between  active  pension  
29:827:76518:21:22:70:545:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funds  and  firm  performance,  we  expect  that  an  increase  in  the  volume  of  equity  controlled  by  
29:828:76627:22:21:70:540:278:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension funds would have major effects on corporate governance in continental European coun-
29:829:76719:21:21:70:544:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tries, and thus provide positive effects on aggregate productivity. We end this section with a note 
29:830:76819:21:21:70:544:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of warning: While we have seen that pension funds have helped to improve corporate governance 
29:831:76913:21:22:70:540:215:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and  productivity  in  many  instances,  there  are  also  cases  in  which  investment  funds  did  not  per-
29:832:77023:22:21:70:544:193:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:form  so  well.  A  prominent  example  is  the  case  of  the  provident  funds  in  Southeast-Asia  which  
29:833:77132:21:21:70:544:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have destroyed wealth, as detailed by Asher (1998). While they contributed to economic growth 
29:834:77226:21:21:70:543:151:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:through a massive accumulation of capital, they did not increase total factor productivity; see also 
29:835:77327:21:27:70:544:130:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Kim and Lau (1994) and Young (1994). These two faces of the Asian miracle were of dramatic

30:840:77828:21:21:70:543:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:particular, the Asian experience shows the importance of competition among funds, as realized in 
30:841:77925:21:21:70:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  Anglo-Saxon  countries  and  in  Chile,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  the  Netherlands  and  Switzer-

30:843:78041:54:34:70:285:592:197:g_d0_f4:197:g_d0_f4:5. Summary and policy conclusions 
30:844:78075:34:22:70:545:558:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Population  aging  will  change  saving  behavior,  and  pension  reform  –  an  ongoing  process  in  the  
30:845:78183:22:21:70:543:536:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:core European countries – will amplify these changes. Population aging will induce an increase in 
30:846:78281:21:21:70:544:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:savings between 2015 and 2025. Saving rates will decline thereafter. Pension reform adds to the 
30:847:78377:21:21:70:540:494:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase and dampens the decrease even though about one third of saving for retirement will dis-
30:848:78473:21:22:70:544:473:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:place  other  saving.  A  higher  share  of  saving  will  flow  through  stock  and  bond  markets,  thereby  
30:849:78584:22:21:70:544:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changing  the  nature  of  the  capital  markets  in  countries  where  stock  market  capitalization  is  low  
30:850:78696:21:21:70:540:430:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and industrial bond are rare – notably in France, Germany and Italy. Finally, there is ample evi-
30:851:78793:21:21:70:544:409:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dence that the size of capital markets and productivity growth are related. There is also reason to 
30:852:78893:21:22:70:544:388:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:believe  that  larger  capital  markets  and  actively  managed  investment  and  pension  funds  enhance  
30:853:79000:22:27:70:179:366:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:corporate governance. 
30:854:79022:27:21:106:545:339:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:What  does  this  mean  for  economic  policy?  First  and  foremost,  population  aging  is  more  
30:855:79122:21:21:70:543:318:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:than adjusting pensions and the health care system. Population aging actually profoundly changes 
30:856:79219:21:22:70:544:297:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the macroeconomic balance in Europe. While this is not an entirely new insight for economists, it 
30:857:79317:22:21:70:544:275:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tends  to  get  lost  in  the  policy  debate  which  over  and  again  focuses  on  social  policy  issues  in  a  
30:858:79433:21:27:70:139:254:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:narrow sense. 
30:859:79447:27:21:106:545:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Indeed,  and  this  is  our  second  policy  conclusion,  the  debate  about  public  pension  reform  
30:860:79550:21:22:70:545:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:should  be  broadened  accordingly.  Our  main  argument  is  that  fundamental  pension  reform  –  a  
30:861:79654:22:21:70:546:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:transition  from  the  dominant  pay-as-you-go  systems  in  continental  Europe  to  a  substantially  
30:862:79758:21:21:70:544:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:higher extent of pre-funding – has benefits over and above those that are usually in the focus of 
30:863:79856:21:21:70:540:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the transition debate. Here, we have stressed benefits arising through more efficient capital mar-
30:864:79954:21:21:70:544:121:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:kets (another channel for positive effects of pension reform on economic efficiency and growth is 
30:865:80052:21:0:70:544:100:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  reduction  of  labor  market  distortions).  Such  efficiency  gains  are  potentially  large  enough  to  
31:866:80166:0:21:70:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:overcompensate  the  welfare  losses  created  by  the  transition  burden  induced  by  a  fundamental  
31:867:80271:21:27:70:520:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pension reform. They therefore significantly change the political economy of pension reform. 
31:868:80364:27:21:106:540:661:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our argument adds a new and important dimension to the debate of advantages and disad-
31:869:80450:21:22:70:544:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:vantages of pay-as-you-go and fully funded pension systems. While we know that in steady state, 
31:870:80546:22:21:70:545:618:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funded  pension  systems  are  advantageous  relative  to  pay-as-you-go  pension  systems  whenever  
31:871:80648:21:21:70:544:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the interest rate exceeds the growth rate of the wage bill, we also know that this of little help in 
31:872:80749:21:21:70:544:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  case  of  an  economy  which  already  has  a  pay-as-you-go  pension  system,  as  stressed  by  Sinn  
31:873:80858:21:22:70:544:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(2000).  Such an economy has to pay back its implicit debt which had financed pension payments 
31:874:80953:22:21:70:540:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to the first generation of beneficiaries, before being able to enjoy the advantages of a funded sys-
31:875:81053:21:21:70:547:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tem.  Paying back this implicit debt implies a consumption loss – the so-called transition burden.  
31:876:81153:21:21:70:544:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In  a  simple  Solow  economy  with  a  fixed  technology,  the  consumption  loss  due  to  the  transition  
31:877:81263:21:22:70:544:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:burden is exactly equal to the consumption gain that will be achieved through the higher capital 
31:878:81360:22:21:70:540:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stock in a funded pension system (Aaron, 1966).  The result also holds under more general condi-
31:879:81456:21:21:70:540:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tions, e.g., when pension benefits must be financed by distorting payroll taxes that are in propor-
31:880:81555:21:27:70:334:406:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tion to pension benefits (Brunner, 1996; Fenge, 1997). 
31:881:81610:27:22:106:541:379:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This equivalence result, however, rests on a crucial condition, namely fixed household be-
31:882:81700:22:21:70:544:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:havior (i.e., saving rates and portfolio choice) and a fixed technology (i.e., factor productivities). 
31:883:81803:21:21:70:544:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We  argue  in  this  paper  that  these  assumptions  are  counterfactual.  We  will  experience  changing  
31:884:81911:21:21:70:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:saving rates and portfolio choices, and we will see major shifts in the allocation of capital, induc-
31:885:82012:21:21:70:540:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ing  changes  in  efficiency  in  those  countries  that  have  thin  capital  markets,  such  as  France,  Ger-
31:886:82124:21:22:70:545:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:many  and  Italy.  This  opens  the  possibility  that  a  (partial)  transition  from  a  pay-as-you-go  to  a  
31:887:82237:22:21:70:544:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funded  pension  system,  through  its  positive  effects  on  capital  markets,  results  in  efficiency  and  
31:888:82349:21:27:70:293:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:welfare gains in spite of the transition burden. 
31:889:82398:27:21:106:541:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:How important is this quantitatively? Aren’t these irrelevant second order effects? We be-
31:890:82488:21:22:70:544:182:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lieve not. In order to assess the magnitude of the potential feedback effects that must be induced 
31:891:82587:22:21:70:544:160:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by improvements in capital allocation in order to compensate for the transition burden, consider 
31:892:82684:21:21:70:540:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:again our example of a fundamental pension reform in Germany that would imply a partial transi-
31:893:82779:21:21:70:544:118:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tion  towards  a  one-third  funded  pension  system.  Using  our  simulation  OLG  model  of  section  2  
31:894:82886:21:22:70:544:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:again, we compute the utility loss implied by the transition burden of the pension reform. Figure 
31:895:82984:22:0:70:544:75:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:5-1 shows our results. Without positive efficiency effects, some generations would be net losers. 
32:896:83084:0:21:70:543:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figure 5-1 also shows the utility gains and losses for various increases in total factor productivity. 
32:897:83187:21:21:70:546:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Already  a  relatively  small  transient  productivity  effect  of  just  0.2  percentage  points  per  year  
32:898:83297:21:27:70:227:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:makes all generations better off. 
32:899:83331:27:22:106:541:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:This is an important result. It must be appreciated together with the recent Economic Pol-
32:900:83421:22:21:70:541:618:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:icy article by Boeri, Boersch-Supan and Tabellini (2001). They found that people in France, Ger-
32:901:83517:21:21:70:544:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:many and Italy are well aware that population aging will put their pension systems into crisis. A 
32:902:83615:21:21:70:540:576:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:majority  also  agrees  to  a  fundamental  pension  reform  in  wishing  to  opt  out  the  pay-as-you-
32:903:83719:21:22:70:540:555:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:systems in favor of a mandatory partially funded system. Not too surprisingly, however, the peo-
32:904:83815:22:21:70:545:533:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ple  did  not  like  the  idea  of  bearing  a  transition  burden.  This  is  where  this  paper  fills  in:  even  
32:905:83932:21:21:70:540:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rather small gains in the efficiency of capital allocation in the wake of population aging and pen-
32:906:84031:21:21:70:544:491:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sion reform suffice to compensate for this transition burden, thereby fundamentally changing the 
32:907:84128:21:0:70:251:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:political economy of pension reform.
