2:28:1446:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper documents that the time required to initiate and complete a home foreclosure rose from
2:29:1543:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:about 9 months on average prior to the Great Recession to an average of 15 months during the Great
2:30:1641:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:Recession and afterward. We refer to these changes as foreclosure delay. We also document that many
2:31:1740:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:borrowers who are in foreclosure ultimately exit foreclosure and keep their homes by making up for
2:32:1838:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:missed mortgage payments. We analyze the impact of foreclosure delay on the U.S. labor market as
2:33:1934:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:an implicit credit line from a lender to a borrower (mortgagor) within a search model. In the model,
2:34:2034:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:foreclosure delay provides unemployed mortgagors with additional time to search for a high-paying
2:35:2131:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:job. We find that foreclosure delay decreases mortgagor employment by about 0.75 percentage points,
2:36:2230:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:nearly doubles the stock of delinquent mortgages, increases the rate of homeownership by about 0.3
2:37:2328:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:percentage points, and increases job match quality, as mortgagors search longer. Severe foreclosure
2:38:2427:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:delays, such as those observed in Florida and New Jersey, can depress mortgagor employment by up
2:39:2523:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:to 1.3 percentage points. The model results are consistent with PSID and SCF data that show that employment
2:40:2630:14:42:72:480:420:12:Times:12:Times:rates rise for delinquent mortgagors once the mortgagor is in the foreclosure process.

3:52:2911:0:37:72:208:730:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:1    Introduction
3:53:2928:37:18:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Prior to the Great Recession,  the average time required to initiate and complete the pro-
3:54:3018:18:18:72:540:675:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cess  of  home  foreclosure  in  the  United  States  was  about  9  months.   However,  foreclosure
3:55:3118:18:18:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time rose substantially in many states beginning in the Great Recession.  A combination of
3:56:3208:18:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:housing policies, as well as delays due to the enormous increase in the number of delinquent
3:57:3300:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:properties being processed by courts and lenders, considerably increased the time of com-
3:58:3389:18:18:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pleting foreclosure.  Policies include both state and national foreclosure moratoria, as well
3:59:3482:18:18:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as the National Mortgage Settlement (also known as the “robo-signing” settlement) which
3:60:3569:18:25:72:243:567:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:permanently slowed foreclosures.1
3:61:3602:25:18:89:539:542:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:On average, the time to foreclose in the United States rose from about 9 months prior
3:62:3687:18:18:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to  the  Great  Recession  to  about  15  months  around  the  time  of  the  Great  Recession  and
3:63:3786:18:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:continued afterward.  As a result of these delays, the probability that a delinquent borrower
3:64:3879:18:18:72:539:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(hereafter referred to as a delinquentmortgagor)received a foreclosure notice, which is the
3:65:3970:18:17:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:initiation of the foreclosure process,  fell by one-third across all U.S. states.  Similarly,  the
3:66:4068:17:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probability  that  a  delinquent  mortgagor  who  was  already  in  the  foreclosure  process  was
3:67:4166:18:26:72:514:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evicted fell by one-third across all U.S. states.  We call these changesforeclosure delay.
3:68:4256:26:17:89:539:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper analyzes the impact of foreclosure delay on the U.S. labor market, with a focus
3:69:4346:17:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on how this delay has qualitatively and quantitatively affected the labor market decisions
3:70:4436:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of unemployed mortgagors.  Two sets of statistics, which to our knowledge are new to the
3:71:4524:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:literature, motivate this study.  One statistic, which is presented and discussed in detail in
3:72:4618:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Sections 2 and3, is that the employment rate of persistently delinquent mortgagors is very
3:73:4708:18:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low, but this rate increases when the mortgagors are in foreclosure and thus are at risk of
3:74:4799:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:losing their homes.  The second statistic, which is presented and discussed in detail in Section
3:75:4895:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5,  is  that  many  of  the  mortgagors  who  persistently  miss  mortgage  payments  ultimately
3:76:4991:18:18:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:resolve their delinquency before foreclosure is completed.  This resolution is accomplished
3:77:5082:18:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by the mortgagor making up for previous missed payments and late fees.  This process of
3:78:5169:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:successfully exiting delinquency/foreclosure is known ascuring.  Although curing has been
3:79:5258:18:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discussed in the literature (seeAdelino et al.[2009]), the relative frequency of curing as well
3:80:5353:18:25:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as the transitions out of delinquency to curing have not been documented to our knowledge.
3:81:5443:25:18:89:539:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The facts that (i) mortgagor reemployment rises as foreclosure becomes more likely, and
3:82:5530:18:18:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that  (ii)  many  persistently  delinquent  mortgagors  ultimately  cure  lead  us  to  construct  a
3:83:5630:18:16:85:539:133:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:1See Gerardi et al.[2011] andCordell et al.[2013] for a summary of policies and a discussion of congestion
3:84:5736:16:0:72:409:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:which led to foreclosure delays during the 2007-2009 recession and afterward.
4:85:5814:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:search model of the labor market that includes homeownership, mortgages, and mortgage
4:86:5899:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:default with the possibility of curing.  We use this model to assess how foreclosure delay has
4:87:5993:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:had an impact on the level of employment among mortgagors since the Great Recession.  In
4:88:6081:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the model, unemployed households choose their search intensity, which affects the likelihood
4:89:6173:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of receiving a job offer that pays a stochastic wage, and they also choose a reservation wage.
4:90:6267:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Additionally,  households  choose  whether  to  default  on  their  mortgage  payment.   In  this
4:91:6364:18:18:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model, foreclosure delay is an implicit line of credit between the mortgage lender and the
4:92:6454:18:18:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:borrower.  By defaulting on their mortgage payment, mortgagors open an implicit credit line
4:93:6545:18:18:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the lender that has a limited duration that depends on the time it takes to complete
4:94:6634:18:18:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure.  The credit line is closed either with the mortgagor curing or with a completed
4:95:6726:18:17:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure.  Foreclosure  delay  thus provides unemployed  mortgagors with additional  time
4:96:6818:17:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to search for a high-paying job.  However, as foreclosure becomes more likely, mortgagors’
4:97:6908:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:choices  regarding  search  intensity  and  their  reservation  wage  change  as  they  try  to  cure
4:98:7009:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and avoid eviction.  In the past, unemployed mortgagors would use cash-out refinancing to
4:99:7098:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extract equity from their homes to smooth consumption (seeHurst and Stafford[2004]), but
4:100:7186:18:25:72:452:461:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:the cash-out refinancing market collapsed during the 2007-2009 recession.2
4:101:7260:25:18:89:539:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  affect  of  foreclosure  delay  bears  some  similarity  to  the  impact  of  unemployment
4:102:7355:18:18:71:539:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insurance.  Both of these mechanisms allow unemployed mortgagors to smooth consumption
4:103:7441:18:18:71:539:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:while searching for a good match (a high paying job).  Unemployment benefits and mortgage
4:104:7530:18:18:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure delay have two key differences,  however.  One is that the delinquent mortgage
4:105:7620:18:18:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:payments  ultimately  must  be  resolved  if  the  mortgagors  are  to  stay  in  their  homes.   The
4:106:7721:18:18:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second is that the incentives to find a job near foreclosure for a mortgagor may be stronger
4:107:7813:18:18:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than in the case of the expiration of unemployment benefits because of the implications of
4:108:7903:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure for (i) the cost of leaving the home and living elsewhere, (ii) the decline in credit
4:109:8000:18:25:71:489:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:access, and (iii) the potential deficiency judgment against a foreclosed mortgagor.
4:110:8083:25:18:89:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We conduct a quantitative experiment with three economies that are identical except for
4:111:8170:18:18:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:having different foreclosure timelines.  Each economy experiences the analogue of the Great
4:112:8261:18:18:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Recession with exogenously lower productivity, a higher rate of job destruction, and a lower
4:113:8353:18:18:71:539:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate of job creation.  One economy has a 9-month timeline to foreclosure, which is the average
4:114:8447:18:17:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prior to the Great Recession,  another has a 15-month timeline,  which is the U.S. average
4:115:8537:17:18:71:539:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during and after the Great Recession, and another has a 24-month timeline, which is roughly
4:116:8628:18:16:85:539:160:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:2Hurst and Stafford[2004] estimate that during the recession, there were roughly 100 million homeowners,
4:117:8732:16:12:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:roughly 31 percent refinanced in 1993, and 18 percent of the homeowners who refinanced were unemployed.
4:118:8835:12:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:These refinances drew down roughly $16,000 of equity on average.  Appendix15documents the collapse of
4:119:8936:12:0:72:213:120:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the cash-out refinancing market.
5:120:8969:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the average of the 10 longest foreclosure timeline states.  We then compute the solution to
5:121:9060:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the three models and measure unemployed mortgagor decisions regarding mortgage default
5:122:9146:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and curing, homeownership rates, delinquency, search intensity, their reservation wage, their
5:123:9239:18:25:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employment level, and the average match quality, which is measured using the average wage.
5:124:9329:25:18:89:539:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our  main  finding  is  that  the  increase  in  foreclosure  time  had  a  significant  impact  on
5:125:9428:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgagor employment rates.  Specifically, we find that the employment rate for mortgagors
5:126:9518:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is about 1.3 percent lower in the 24-month timeline and is about 0.75 percent lower in the
5:127:9608:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:15-month timeline economy compared with the 9-month timeline economy.  This impact of
5:128:9693:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure delay on employment is roughly comparable to extending employment benefits
5:129:9779:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by 6 months and 4 months, respectively.  Foreclosure delays increase the stock of delinquent
5:130:9871:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgagors by a factor of 2 but also allow more mortgagors to remain in their homes.  As
5:131:9959:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a result homeownership rates rise by .3 percentage points with foreclosure delays.  We also
5:132:10050:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:find that match quality improves in the delay economies as the average wage rises, reflecting
5:133:10143:18:17:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the fact that unemployed mortgagors remain unemployed longer but on average find higher-
5:134:10231:17:26:72:134:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:paying jobs.
5:135:10243:26:18:89:540:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Sections2  and3  document  new

5:141:10770:53:27:71:539:304:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:2    Mortgagor Employment Rates Rise during Foreclo-
5:142:10822:27:37:101:136:277:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:sure
5:143:10826:37:18:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section presents data that are consistent with our theory by showing that employment
5:144:10915:18:18:71:539:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates are higher for delinquent borrowers who are in foreclosure compared with delinquent
5:145:11004:18:18:71:539:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:borrowers who are not yet in foreclosure.  We use data from two surveys:  the Panel Study of
5:146:11096:18:18:71:539:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). These data allow us
5:147:11181:18:17:71:539:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to track employment rates among mortgagors over various mortgage delinquency horizons.
5:148:11267:17:18:71:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  data  show  that  employment  rates  among  delinquent  borrowers  are  roughly  constant
5:149:11361:18:18:71:539:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as delinquency duration increases (e.g., delinquency increases from 60 days late to 90 days
5:150:11452:18:0:71:539:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:late), but the employment rate increases considerably when the mortgagor is in foreclosure.
6:151:11544:0:18:89:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The model economy developed in Section6 will interpret these data on the duration of
6:152:11628:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delinquency, foreclosure, and employment as follows:  unemployed mortgagors will choose to
6:153:11718:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:miss  mortgage  payments  to  smooth  consumption  while  searching  for  a  job,  but  they  will
6:154:11816:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:then lower their reservation wage when losing their home through foreclosure is imminent,
6:155:11905:18:46:72:282:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and thus their employment rate will rise.
6:156:11946:46:33:72:216:612:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2.1    PSID Evidence
6:157:11966:33:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  use  data  from  the  2009-2011  PSID  Core/Immigrant  sample  and  the  2009-2011  PSID
6:158:12058:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Housing, Mortgage Distress, and Wealth Supplement to construct data on mortgagor em-
6:159:12142:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ployment rates and mortgage delinquency and foreclosure status.  The observations are for
6:160:12231:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:all working-age heads of household with mortgages.  The PSID collects data on delinquency
6:161:12320:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:status as of the survey date and whether the lender initiated the foreclosure process as of
6:162:12411:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the survey date.  We then separated these mortgagors into 5 bins according to their reported
6:163:12503:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delinquency status:  (1) “No Missed Payments,” (2) “30 Days Late,” (3) “60 Days Late,”
6:164:12589:18:17:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(4) “90 or More Days Late,” and (5) “In Foreclosure,” and within each bin we classify their
6:165:12680:17:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employment status as either employed or not employed.  In Appendix11, we also consider
6:166:12766:18:25:72:536:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the employment status of the spouse and find a similar patterns to the heads-only sample.
6:167:12855:25:18:89:539:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table1 shows employment rates among mortgagors in these 5 mortgage payment statuses
6:168:12938:18:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for  both  the  2009  and  2011  PSID.  Employment  rates  are  higher  for  those  in  foreclosure
6:169:13037:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compared with those 90 or more days late for all categories except for the 2011 sample of
6:170:13126:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgagors who are in states in which initiating foreclosure requires a court order, which is
6:171:13219:18:25:72:214:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:known as a “judicial state.”
6:172:13247:25:18:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We will show later that there are some statistically significant differences in employment
6:173:13337:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates between delinquent mortgagors who are in the foreclosure process and thus at risk of
6:174:13427:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:losing  their  home  immediately,  and  delinquent  mortgagors  who  have  not  yet  entered  the
6:175:13524:18:25:72:456:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure process and thus have no risk of losing their home immediately.
6:176:13599:25:18:89:539:217:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To estimate the impact of these 5 mortgage payment statuses on employment rates, we
6:177:13682:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fit a linear probability model (LPM), a logit model, and a probit model of a{0,1}binary
6:178:13769:18:18:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employment indicator on dummy variables for each of the 5 mortgage payment statuses.  We
6:179:13857:18:18:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also control for variables that are often used in binary employment/unemployment regres-
6:180:13945:18:0:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sions and which are also available in the PSID: previous income (measured as annual gross
7:181:14035:0:18:72:539:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:family income), unemployment duration, and liquid assets to income.3In addition, we also
7:182:14123:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimate regressions that control for compositional demographic differences.  Demographic
7:183:14212:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:controls include age, sex, marital status, and education.  To capture legal differences in the
7:184:14306:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure process across states,  we also control for whether or not the mortgagor is in a
7:185:14398:18:18:72:539:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:judicial state as described earlier, and whether or not they are in arecourse state, which is a
7:186:14493:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:state in which the borrower may be liable for losses suffered by the lender.  We describe the
7:187:14586:18:18:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure process in judicial states and recourse in detail in Section 4.  We conduct these
7:188:14679:18:25:72:515:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compositional corrections using both a random effects and a fixed effects specification.
7:189:14767:25:18:89:539:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These three approaches (LPM, logit, probit) are all used frequently in analyzing models
7:190:14854:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with a binary dependent variable.  We therefore used all three approaches for completeness.
7:191:14945:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The LPM is cited as performing well in terms of unbiasedness and consistency if there are
7:192:15034:18:18:72:539:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively  few  predicted  probabilities  that  lie  outside  of  the  unit  interval  (seeWooldridge
7:193:15136:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:[2010]  andHorrace  and  Oaxaca[2006]).   This  is  indeed  the  case  in  this  application,  with
7:194:15235:18:17:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only 10 percent of predicted probabilities outside of the unit interval, and many of those are
7:195:15329:17:18:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indeed very close to one.  The logit and probit specifications are also widely used and have
7:196:15421:18:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the benefit of restricting predicted values to lie in the unit interval.  However, the logit and
7:197:15517:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probit  specifications  face  a  challenge  in  that  those  procedures  drop  all  observations  when
7:198:15619:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:using fixed effects for households that either never default or remain in default for the entire
7:199:15715:18:18:72:539:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:panel (2007-2009).4Since the logit and probit results are very similar, we only report the
7:200:15805:18:25:72:135:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:logit results.
7:201:15819:25:18:89:539:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The regression coefficients on the mortgage payment status indicators are used to con-
7:202:15905:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:struct a regression analogue to the data presented in Table1.  Specifically, Figure1 plots the
7:203:15999:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistics from that table, along with the regression constant plus the coefficients from the
7:204:16092:18:18:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgage payment status variables from column (1) of Table2.  We use the random effects
7:205:16179:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model for the compositional correction,  as the fixed effects specification results were very
7:206:16272:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:similar.  Figure1 shows that employment per capita is lower among defaulters, as one would
7:207:16362:18:18:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:anticipate.  However, note that employment increases for those in foreclosure, compared to
7:208:16452:18:18:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the other delinquency states.  Specifically, the employment rate for mortgagors in foreclosure
7:209:16546:18:18:71:539:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is about 17 percentage points higher than it is for those who are 90 or more days late without
7:210:16640:18:17:71:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correcting for demographics,  (Table2,  Column (2)),  and it is about 11 percentage points
7:211:16730:17:18:71:539:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher than it is for those who are 90 or more days late, after controlling for demographic
7:212:16821:18:19:71:248:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differences, (Table2, Column (1)).
7:213:16855:19:15:85:539:141:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:3Here we use the PSID question that asks about checking and savings account balances, money market
7:214:16953:15:9:72:454:126:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:funds, certificates of deposits, Treasury securities, and other government savings bonds.
7:215:17042:9:0:85:363:117:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:4If included, those observations would have fixed effects of±∞.
8:216:17106:0:18:89:539:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Tables 2 and 3show the linear probability and logit regression statistics.  Using the linear
8:217:17198:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probability  model,  we  find  that  in  both  the  random  effects  and  fixed  effects  regressions,
8:218:17300:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the employment rate is significantly different for households that are 90 or more days late
8:219:17391:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:versus households in foreclosure.  Households in foreclosure are more likely to be employed
8:220:17482:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than  households  that  are  90  or  more  days  late,  controlling  for  composition.   In  the  logit
8:221:17585:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specification,  employment per capita is significantly different from households that are 90
8:222:17677:18:18:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or more days late versus those households in foreclosure for the fixed effect specification at
8:223:17771:18:18:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the 10 percent level.  However, the difference in employment in the logit specification with
8:224:17863:18:46:72:356:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:random effects is not significant at the 10 percent level.
8:225:17921:46:33:72:208:540:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2.2    SCF Evidence
8:226:17940:33:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  present  additional  evidence  on  foreclosure  and  employment  by  conducting  the  same
8:227:18034:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analysis  as  earlier,  but  using  the  2007-2009  SCF  panel.   The  SCF  surveys  mortgagors  on
8:228:18133:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their delinquency.  The responses allow us to classify them into one of three statuses:  “30
8:229:18225:18:17:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Days Late,” “60 or More Days Late,” and “In Foreclosure.” The “30 Days Late” and “60
8:230:18309:17:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or More Days Late” statuses refer to mortgagors who are in default on any type of debt,
8:231:18396:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:including mortgage debt.  Thus, we do not know the specifics of their default.  However, our
8:232:18488:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hypothesis that homeowners avoid foreclosure by lowering their reservation wage indicates
8:233:18577:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that  the  SCF  mortgagors  should  also  have  higher  employment  in  foreclosure,  subject  to
8:234:18674:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attenuation bias.  As in the PSID, the sample is all working-age heads of household with

8:236:18799:25:18:89:539:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure2 is analogous to Figure1, as it plots the compositionally corrected LPM coef-
8:237:18883:18:18:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ficients  from  the  delinquency  status  indicator  variables  from  the  2009  SCF.5In  both  sets
8:238:18983:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of data,  even after  controlling  for compositional  differences,  there is  a significant increase
8:239:19083:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in  employment  during foreclosure  compared  with  being delinquent  but not  in foreclosure.
8:240:19177:18:18:72:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table4 shows these results for both the linear probability model (Columns (1) and (2)) and
8:241:19267:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the logit model (Columns (3) and (4)).  The result that employment during foreclosure is
8:242:19355:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher than that in the “60 or More Days Late” category is statistically significant at the 5
8:243:19448:18:18:72:433:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent level in both the linear probability model and the logit model.
8:244:19519:18:15:85:539:177:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:5Mortgagors in the “30 Days Late” category are defined as those who reported being late on debt payments
8:245:19623:15:12:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:over the prior year, but never missing two or more months’ worth of payments.  Those who missed two or
8:246:19725:12:12:72:540:150:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:more months’ worth of payments over the prior year were counted as 60 or more days late.  Due to privacy
8:247:19829:12:12:72:540:138:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:issues, the state of residence is omitted from public use files.  Therefore, we are unable to include the controls
8:248:19943:12:0:72:386:126:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:for judicial/recourse states used in the previous analysis with the PSID.
9:249:20017:0:18:89:539:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Taken together,  data from the PSID and the SCF indicate that employment is higher
9:250:20099:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among  foreclosed  homeowners  than  among  delinquent  homeowners  who  have  not  entered

9:252:20202:53:37:72:450:641:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:3    Mortgage Delinquency as Implicit Credit
9:253:20246:37:17:72:539:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Missing  mortgage  payments  is  a  costlyimplicit  credit  line,  reflecting  late  fees  that  range
9:254:20348:17:18:71:539:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from  3  percent  to  6  percent  per  month.   It  is  therefore  reasonable  to  expect  that  unem-
9:255:20450:18:18:71:539:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ployed mortgagors who do skip mortgage payments have likely exhausted lower-cost means
9:256:20536:18:25:71:376:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of smoothing consumption, such as using their other assets.
9:257:20595:25:18:89:539:526:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We indeed find that unemployed mortgagors who are delinquent have little or no liquid
9:258:20680:18:18:71:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assets.   Figure3  shows  the  PSID’s  measure  of  liquid  asset  holdings  relative  to  income,
9:259:20778:18:18:71:539:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for all heads of household with mortgages from the 2009-2011 PSID. Liquid assets include
9:260:20866:18:18:71:539:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:checking and savings account balances, money market funds, certificates of deposits, Treasury
9:261:20959:18:25:71:315:454:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:securities, and other government saving bonds.6
9:262:21006:25:18:89:539:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The graph splits liquid asset holdings into bins ranging from liquid assets between zero
9:263:21094:18:18:71:539:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to  5  percent  of  prior  annual  gross  family  income,  up  to  50  percent  or  more,  and  shows
9:264:21195:18:18:71:539:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:liquid assets for unemployed and employed mortgagors.  Note that 85 percent of unemployed
9:265:21284:18:18:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgagors have exhausted or nearly exhausted their liquid assets, which suggests that they
9:266:21375:18:52:71:501:357:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:are indeed significantly constrained in being able to make their mortgage payment.7

9:269:21515:37:17:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Before  presenting  statistics  on  mortgage  delinquency,  foreclosure,  and  curing,  we  provide
9:270:21614:17:18:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:some  background  information  on  the  actual  delinquency  and  foreclosure  process.   To  our
9:271:21711:18:18:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:knowledge, the model developed in this paper will include considerably more detail about
9:272:21799:18:18:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the  actual  features  of  the  delinquency  and  foreclosure  process  than  other  papers  in  the
9:273:21899:18:16:85:539:169:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:6The  PSID  definition  of  liquid  assets  does  not  include  stocks  or  bonds  outside  of  federal  government
9:274:22014:16:12:72:540:153:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:bonds.  Adding these measures to the PSID’s liquid assets does not change these results in any substantive
9:275:22120:12:8:72:91:141:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:way.
9:276:22124:8:16:85:539:133:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:7Gerardi et al. [2013] provide additional evidence that mortgagors who default are severely financially
9:277:22227:16:0:72:125:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:constrained.
10:278:22240:0:25:72:517:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:literature.  This detail will be qualitatively and quantitatively important for this study.
10:279:22331:25:18:89:539:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:Adelinquent borrowermeans that a borrower is 30 or more days late.  Anotice of default
10:280:22417:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:begins the process of foreclosure and is typically given to borrowers who are 90 or more days
10:281:22510:18:18:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:late.  Aforeclosure saleis conducted by auction, and anotice of saleis given one month prior
10:282:22602:18:18:72:539:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the auction.  A borrower isevictedfrom the home after the sale.  A foreclosed borrower
10:283:22691:18:18:71:539:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may be liable for adeficiency judgmentif the sales price is less than the mortgage balance.  A
10:284:22785:18:25:71:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosed borrower is ineligible for government-backed loans for 7 years (seeLowrey[2010]).
10:285:22877:25:18:89:539:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There are two main types of foreclosures in the United States:  judicial and nonjudicial
10:286:22965:18:18:71:540:572:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(seeGhent and Kudlyak[2011] for state classifications).  To complete a judicial foreclosure,
10:287:23057:18:18:71:539:554:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the bank that owns the mortgage must sue the person living in the home in a state court.
10:288:23145:18:25:71:450:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A judge is required to rule on the case before a foreclosure sale can occur.
10:289:23221:25:18:89:540:511:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A nonjudicial foreclosure, also known as aforeclosure by power of sale, allows the bank to
10:290:23311:18:18:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sell the house without a court’s approval.  A notice of default is sent to the mortgagor which
10:291:23405:18:18:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:explains that the bank intends to sell the property.  Typically, a sale will not take place for
10:292:23500:18:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at least a month after receiving this notice.  Additional details about the foreclosure process
10:293:23595:18:46:72:226:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are presented in Appendix17.
10:294:23623:46:33:72:314:393:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:4.1    Interest on Missed Payments
10:295:23657:33:18:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Mortgage payments are usually due on the first day of the month, and a late fee is typically
10:296:23749:18:18:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assessed if the payment is not received within the first two weeks of the month.  The late fee
10:297:23843:18:18:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is a fraction of the payment amount.  If the scheduled payment is $1,000 and the late fee is 3
10:298:23937:18:18:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent, then the mortgagor must pay $1,030 in the following month.  Most late fee interest
10:299:24028:18:52:72:489:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates fall in the range of 3 percent to 6 percent per month (seeGoodman[2009]).

10:303:24268:18:18:71:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:payment means that the mortgagor is evicted (seeGarriga and Schlagenhauf[2009],Cor-

11:306:24522:18:18:71:539:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:however,  stands in contrast to two facts that will be relevant for analyzing the impact of

11:308:24715:18:18:71:539:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a borrower repeatedly missing  payments without  being evicted,  and  (2)  mortgagors often
11:309:24806:18:18:71:539:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:successfully exit the delinquency and foreclosure process by making up for missed mortgage
11:310:24896:18:25:71:127:640:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:payments.9
11:311:24906:25:18:89:539:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section presents data that highlight two features of the actual foreclosure process.
11:312:24995:18:18:71:540:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:One is that many mortgagors who are in defaultself-cure,which means that the borrower
11:313:25080:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:makes up for missed payments plus penalties.  In fact,  even mortgagors who miss enough
11:314:25167:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:payments to enter the foreclosure process self-cure about as often as foreclosure is completed
11:315:25261:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(see  Pennington-Cross  [2010]).   The  other  key  feature  of  these  data  is  that  the  time  to
11:316:25362:18:25:72:385:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:complete foreclosure was much longer after 2009 than before.
11:317:25422:25:18:89:539:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 5 presents data that summarizes the evolution of default, which includes missing
11:318:25509:18:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:payments, the foreclosure process, self-cure, and foreclosure completion.  These data are from

11:320:25697:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the data), which has compiled detailed mortgage data on roughly 2/3 of U.S. mortgages.
11:321:25786:18:25:72:450:428:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:LPS is one of two standard datasets that are used in mortgage analyses.10
11:322:25859:25:18:89:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure5 is a transition matrix which describes how mortgagors transit across mortgagor
11:323:25945:18:17:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:payment states.  The possible states are “current,” “60 Days Late,” “90 or More Days Late,”
11:324:26036:17:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“In Foreclosure,” two measures of completed foreclosure (“Real Estate Owned” [REO] and
11:325:26122:18:18:72:539:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“Liquidated”),  and  “Paid  Off,”  which  means  that  the  mortgagor  sold  the  home.11The
11:326:26214:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rows  are  the  beginning  states,  and  the  columns  are  the  ending  states.   The  period  is  one
11:327:26317:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:month.   The  table  includes  two  sets  of  entries:   the  black  entries  refer  to  the  transition

11:329:26511:18:16:85:539:278:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:8Our model is also related toKarahan and Rhee[2011],Hedlund[2011], andHead and Lloyd-Ellis[2012],
11:330:26608:16:12:72:540:262:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:who incorporate search in a model with housing,Herkenhoff[2013] andAthreya et al.[2014] who consider
11:331:26708:12:12:72:539:250:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the way unsecured debt interacts with labor markets, andBenjamin and Wright[2009] andBenjamin and

11:333:26858:8:15:85:539:230:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:9The standard assumption that eviction is immediate also makes it difficult for models to match actual
11:334:26960:15:12:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:default rates.  Several authors use a period length of 2-4 years so that the discount rate is effectively small
11:335:27071:12:9:72:191:203:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:enough to generate default.
11:336:27098:9:15:81:539:194:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:10We use a sample of around 470,000 mortgages per year from LPS. This is a larger sample than used
11:337:27196:15:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in other analyses of mortgages who use Core Logic, Inc., which typically range from 130,000 mortgages to
11:338:27300:12:9:72:316:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:400,000 mortgages (seeElul et al.[2010] among others).
11:339:27354:9:15:81:539:158:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:11We eliminated the “30 Days Late” state, since this state includes mortgagors who miss a payment simply
11:340:27458:15:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:as an error.  These errors include forgetting to send in a payment, mailing the payment late, the payment
11:341:27563:12:0:72:530:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:being lost in the mail, the payment being returned due to insufficient funds in a checking account, so on.

12:343:27760:38:18:86:540:692:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1.  Delinquency is often temporary, with frequent transitions from delinquent to current
12:344:27848:18:18:101:540:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(current means up-to-date on payments) and transitions resulting in a mortgagor be-
12:345:27931:18:18:101:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coming closer to being current (i.e., the lower triangular entries for the states “30 Days
12:346:28021:18:27:101:408:638:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Late,”“60 Days Late,”and “90+ Days Late” are nonsparse).
12:347:28077:27:18:86:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.  Foreclosure,  which  we  define  as  the  time  between  the  delivery  of  the  default  notice
12:348:28177:18:18:101:540:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and eviction, is often temporary.  This means that there are frequent transitions out of
12:349:28265:18:18:101:540:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the foreclosure into curing.  Specifically, the probability that a mortgagor will success-
12:350:28355:18:18:101:540:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fully exit foreclosure is about the same as the probability that a mortgagor who is in
12:351:28441:18:28:101:336:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure will suffer a completed foreclosure.
12:352:28489:28:18:86:540:511:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.  Entry into foreclosure is slow, and became slower after 2008.  Specifically, loans that
12:353:28580:18:18:101:540:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were “90 or More Days Late” were in that category for 3.2 months on average during
12:354:28662:18:18:101:540:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the 2001-2003 period and 6.2 months on average during the 2009-2011 period.  The
12:355:28742:18:18:101:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unconditional monthly hazard rate of receiving a foreclosure notice, after being 90 or
12:356:28828:18:17:101:540:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more days late, dropped by 40 percent between the 2001-2003 survey and the 2009-2011
12:357:28912:17:28:101:352:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survey, declining from 8.3 percent to 4.8 percent.
12:358:28962:28:18:86:540:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.  Foreclosure is a slow process, and became slower after 2008.  Specifically, conditional
12:359:29053:18:18:101:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on reaching foreclosure, mortgagors remained in foreclosure on average for 4.0 months
12:360:29138:18:18:101:540:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during the 2001-2003 period, and for 8.3 months in the 2009-2011 period. Consequently,
12:361:29224:18:18:101:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the unconditional monthly hazard of having a completed foreclosure, either as a bank-
12:362:29309:18:18:101:540:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owned property, or as a liquidated property, dropped by 36 percent, declining from 8.6
12:363:29395:18:18:101:540:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent  in  2001-2003  to  5.5  percent  in  2009-2011.   The  increase  in  time  to  foreclose
12:364:29492:18:18:101:540:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is concentrated among a group of states in which foreclosure delay rose substantially.
12:365:29578:18:18:101:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These  states  include  California,  Florida,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,
12:366:29671:18:18:101:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  Some other states,
12:367:29751:18:17:101:540:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas,
12:368:29834:17:28:101:530:215:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:Virginia, and Washington, did not experience a large increase in time to foreclose.13
12:369:29919:28:18:86:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.  Theself-cure probabilities, which we define as the lower triangular entries of the matrix,
12:370:30013:18:18:101:438:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decreased in every single entry between 2001-2003 and 2009-2011.
12:371:30077:18:15:81:539:151:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:12This is a transition matrix, so in order to read this table, the rows are the starting state at the beginning
12:372:30188:15:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of  the  month  and  the  columns  are  the  possible  states  next  month.   For  instance,  in  a  given  month  the
12:373:30306:12:9:72:509:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:probability of moving from being current to 30 days late is 1.7 percent during the 2009-2011 period.

13:375:30497:0:18:89:539:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  summary,  these  data  show  that  (1)  there  is  considerable  movement  of  mortgagors

13:385:31317:37:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section describes a model that features a labor search process with a reservation wage
13:386:31408:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for unemployed agents and a housing market in which mortgagors can persistently default
13:387:31495:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as well as exit default or exit foreclosure through repaying their delinquent balances.  The
13:388:31587:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model is decision-theoretic in that the prices in the model are exogenous.  This simplification
13:389:31682:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:allows us to include substantial heterogeneity in the model in terms of individual employment
13:390:31775:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:histories, asset histories, and mortgage histories, while at the same time keeping the model
13:391:31867:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tractable.  The analysis thus quantifies how the labor market is affected by changes in the
13:392:31958:18:25:72:234:362:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:time to foreclose, given prices.14
13:393:31992:25:18:89:539:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Unlike other papers in the literature, this paper allows mortgagors to self-cure by making

13:395:32175:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is the first analysis that is consistent with the fact that delinquent mortgagors can self-cure

13:398:32410:18:18:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:populated by a heterogeneous mass of risk-averse and finitely lived agents who are subject
13:399:32500:18:18:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks.  In each period, agents may participate in three
13:400:32592:18:25:72:431:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:markets:  the labor market, the asset market, and the housing market.

13:404:32964:16:12:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:would complicate the solution of the model enormously, particularly in terms of the pricing of mortgages in

14:407:33276:18:18:72:539:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from an exogenous and stationary distributionF(·), and agents can reject or accept offers.
14:408:33366:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This  gives  rise  to  a  reservation  wage  profilew∗(·),  which  is  a  function  of  the  state  space
14:409:33471:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the agent.  Once an offer is accepted and the agent is employed,  we consider two wage
14:410:33560:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:processes:  one in which the wage is constant for the duration of the match and one in which
14:411:33652:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the wage follows a Markov process.  The job match continues until it is terminated by an

14:413:33836:18:25:72:268:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and then searches as described earlier.

15:452:36052:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disutility is given by (x(st)).  The probability of obtaining an offer, which we hereafter call
15:453:36147:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the job-finding probability, is a function of the aggregate state.  This is denoted asπ(st,θt)
15:454:36241:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and is increasing and concave inst.  Note thatπ(st,H)> π(st,L) for allst.  If the agent finds
15:455:36334:18:18:72:539:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a job,  the wage offer is drawn from a stationary distributionF(w).  The agent can either
15:456:36423:18:18:72:539:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accept or reject the job offer, which gives rise to a reservation wage profilew∗(·) that is a
15:457:36516:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function of the state vector of the agent.  We denoteδ(θt) as the state-contingent probability
15:458:36610:18:25:72:316:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of a job being destroyed, in whichδ(H)< δ(L).
15:459:36655:25:18:89:539:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  the  housing  market,  mortgages  are  modeled  as  perpetuities,  which  helps  keep  the
15:460:36749:18:18:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model tractable.  When agents die, they are replaced by newborns, who are endowed with
15:461:36835:18:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:zero liquid assets and who are randomly assigned to homeownership, with fractionfmbeing

15:465:37166:18:18:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nondurable consumption good.  The house price (p(θt)) is governed by the aggregate state
15:466:37254:18:17:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such  thatp(L)≤p(H).   In  the  high  state,  the  price  of  a  home  is  given  asp(H)  =chrb,

15:471:37621:32:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This  section  describes  the  model  details  regarding  mortgagor  decisions  on  their  mortgage
15:472:37720:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:payment and whether they choose to sell the home.  Consider a mortgagor at datet.Mort-
15:473:37806:18:18:72:539:217:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gagors are eithercurrent, which means that they are not delinquent on past payments, or
15:474:37893:18:18:72:539:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:they are indefault, which means that they are delinquent on at least one previous mortgage
15:475:37983:18:18:72:453:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:payment.  We denote the number of periods of delinquency at datetasnt.
15:476:38053:18:15:81:539:163:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:17As Mian et al.[2011] show, foreclosures may lead to house price declines, and thus foreclosure intervention
15:477:38162:15:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:may prevent negative equity.  We note that (i) since foreclosure delays may mitigate house prices drops, in
15:478:38269:12:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:order to avoid overstating the mechanism, we study delays in an environment in which house prices remain
15:479:38373:12:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:constant throughout the Great Recession and no agents are under water, and (ii) closing the housing market
15:480:38479:12:0:72:510:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:would require closing the mortgage market, and either of these tasks makes the problem intractable.
16:481:38580:0:18:89:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A  mortgagor  who  is  current  chooses  to  either  (i)  make  the  datetmortgage  payment
16:482:38671:18:18:71:539:712:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:ch,(ii) miss the datetmortgage paymentch, or (iii) sell the house.  A mortgagor who is in
16:483:38760:18:18:71:539:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:default chooses to either (i) make the two most delinquent payments, including penalties, (ii)
16:484:38854:18:18:71:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:continue in default by missing the datetpayment, or (iii) sell the house.  A mortgagor who
16:485:38944:18:18:71:539:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is delinquent risks foreclosure, which means that the mortgagor is evicted from the home.  A
16:486:39036:18:18:71:539:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delinquent mortgagor can temporarily stop foreclosure by making two delinquent payments,
16:487:39124:18:18:71:539:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:including the penalty interest payment.  If a delinquent mortgagor does this in period t, but
16:488:39217:18:18:71:540:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:has remaining unpaid mortgage payments in periodt+ 1, the mortgagor must make another
16:489:39302:18:25:71:514:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two mortgage payments int+ 1 in order to stop the foreclosure process for datet+ 1.
16:490:39385:25:18:89:539:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:For simplicity, the mortgagor must pay thetwo  longest  outstanding  mortgage  payments
16:491:39472:18:18:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:with penalty interest((1 +rb)n−1ch+ (1 +rb)nch), whererbis the penalty interest rate.  This
16:492:39563:18:18:71:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:feature of the model is consistent with the fact that the empirical transitions in Figure5
16:493:39653:18:18:71:539:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:show that homeowners slowly transit out of delinquency, rather than curing immediately by
16:494:39742:18:17:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:making good on all missed payments and penalties.  Moreover, the assumption in our model
16:495:39830:17:18:71:539:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that initiation of mortgagor self-curing stops the foreclosure process is consistent with the
16:496:39923:18:26:71:480:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fact that lenders prefer receiving late fees to foreclosure (seeThompson[2010]).
16:497:40003:26:17:89:539:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A delinquent mortgagor is able to smooth consumption by missing a payment, but risks
16:498:40087:17:18:72:539:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure.  The time to foreclosure is governed by the functionλF(nt), which denotes the
16:499:40177:18:18:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probability of foreclosure as a function of the number of missed payments by the mortgagor.
16:500:40268:18:18:72:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:As the time spent in default (nt) increases, the probability of foreclosure increases:λF(n)≤
16:501:40360:18:18:72:539:357:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:λF(n′)∀n′> n(see Figure4 for the foreclosure probability for (A) the 9-month timeline,

16:503:40535:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosed upon, they become permanent renters.  The mortgage payment is greater than the
16:504:40624:18:18:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rental payment (ch> cr), but the utility flow from owning a home strictly dominates the
16:505:40711:18:18:72:539:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utility flow from renting (zh> zr).  The rental payment is set to zero such that the renter
16:506:40802:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the lowest possible unemployment benefits given bybcan consume at leastc=b, where

16:508:40916:25:18:89:539:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To model the possibility of a deficiency judgment against a foreclosed mortgagor, a fore-
16:509:41005:18:18:72:539:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:closed house is sold at a discount of 1−χ.  For example, ifχ=.95, this corresponds to a
16:510:41092:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5 percent discount and the house is sold forχ·p(θt).  For homes sold at a loss,G(·) is a
16:511:41180:18:18:71:539:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function which describes the potential deficiency judgment owed by the ex-homeowner as a
16:512:41268:18:25:71:254:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function of the proceeds of the sale.
16:513:41305:25:0:89:539:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The unique focus of this model is that prolonged mortgage default will have an impact
17:514:41392:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the labor market by affecting the reservation wage and search effort of an unemployed
17:515:41480:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:homeowner.  Specifically, initial default will be associated with a low foreclosure probability,
17:516:41576:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which means that agents will have a relatively high reservation wage and may also economize
17:517:41667:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on  their  search  effort.   As  foreclosure  becomes  more  likely,  search  effort  will  rise  and  the
17:518:41773:18:46:72:221:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reservation wage will decline.

17:520:41835:33:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We focus on the recursive representation of the maximization problems for the agents, so we
17:521:41926:18:17:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will now drop time subscripts and use primes to denote the datet+ 1 value.  We denote value

23:879:51840:18:28:71:442:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Lemma6.2shows how search effort declines as protection increases.

23:895:52822:15:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:economy,  we  found  that  the  model  moments  were  changed  very  little  after  2  replications.   We  therefore
23:896:52938:12:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:terminated repeating the procedure at 5 replications.  We also found that 240 model periods per simulation
23:897:53044:12:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:was  sufficient.   Specifically,  since  the  initial  draw  was  from  the  ergodic  age  distribution,  we  found  the

26:987:58786:25:18:89:539:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We analyze three specifications of foreclosure time. The first has a foreclosure timeline of 9

26:991:59152:18:18:71:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure timeline is 15 months (N= 15), which is a nationally representative foreclosure
26:992:59243:18:18:71:540:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline from LPS data for 2009-2011 (see Figure5).  The third foreclosure timeline is based
26:993:59335:18:18:71:539:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the most extreme observed foreclosure delays, which is about 24 months in Florida and

26:995:59513:18:18:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enables the model to roughly approximate many of the observed transitions across mortgage

27:1005:60242:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:[2012]).   The  function  that  governs  the  deficiency  judgmentG(·)  based  on  the  statistics
27:1006:60340:18:33:72:283:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provided earlier is given by the following:

27:1009:60507:18:17:72:540:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This is because states that are often considered to be nonrecourse states can have recourse
27:1010:60598:17:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on some mortgages.  For example, in California all refinanced loans are recourse and subject

27:1024:61757:25:18:89:539:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To specify the mortgagor rate, we use 2007 census data, which is just prior to the Great
27:1025:61845:18:18:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Recession.  These data indicate a homeownership rate of about 68.2 percent and that 64.4
27:1026:61933:18:25:72:527:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent of households have a mortgage.23Therefore, the mortgagor rate is 43.91 percent.

28:1038:62953:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and  an  imputed  unsecured  debt  service  flow  equal  to  14.31  percent  of  the  stock  of  unse-

28:1042:63323:18:25:72:234:622:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:Table 5 tabulates these ratios.25

28:1044:63449:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are taken to be the lower triangular entries in Figure5, summed across columns to yield a
28:1045:63538:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model-equivalent measure.  We target the cure rate from 60 days late (DL) to current and
28:1046:63626:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from 90 days late to 60 days late.  Liquid assets are measured as in Section3 and depicted in
28:1047:63719:18:18:71:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure3.  We target the fraction of homeowners with liquid assets to annual income between
28:1048:63809:18:46:71:154:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:0 and 5 percent.

28:1050:63875:33:18:71:539:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since the model has more targets than parameters, we chose parameters by minimizing the
28:1051:63962:18:17:71:539:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sum of squared deviations between the model and the data statistics.  Table6 shows that
28:1052:64049:17:18:71:539:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the calibration does reasonably well in approximating these targets.  Defaulters have back-
28:1053:64140:18:18:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:end debt-to-income ratios in line with the data, and the mortgagor unemployment rate is
28:1054:64227:18:25:71:511:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:identical to the data.  Defaulters also have similar liquid asset holdings as in the data.
28:1055:64317:25:18:89:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As is standard in any default model, it is necessary to have a high discount rate:  theβin
28:1056:64407:18:18:71:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the model corresponds to an annual discount rate of roughly 16 percent.27The bank interest
28:1057:64497:18:18:71:539:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate corresponds to an annual rate of 5.8 percent, and the savings rate corresponds to an
28:1058:64586:18:18:71:539:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:annual yield of 1.08 percent.  These interest rates primarily determine the cure rate and the
28:1059:64679:18:18:71:539:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction of liquid assets held by homeowners, respectively.  The cure rate is quite high in the
28:1060:64774:18:18:71:539:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data, even during the recession, and thus the bank fees must be low.  Note that by omitting
28:1061:64865:18:18:71:539:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgage modifications, we may be biasing downward the bank penalty rate, since a large
28:1062:64952:18:15:81:539:206:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:24TAXSIM  is  a  program  made  by  the  NBER  specifically  for  computing  tax  liabilities.   As  in  any  tax
28:1063:65065:15:12:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:return, TAXSIM takes as inputs the marital status in filing, exemptions, and deductions, including mortgage
28:1064:65172:12:9:72:455:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:deductibles, etc.  TAXSIM then yields the federal and state tax liabilities of households.
28:1065:65262:9:15:81:539:170:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:25In the event that a household had negative income after these adjustments, we dropped them from the
28:1066:65363:15:9:72:316:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sample, thus understating the burden of mortgage debt.
28:1067:65417:9:15:81:539:146:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:26Our model has no participation margin and thus the unemployment rate in our model corresponds to a
28:1068:65517:15:9:72:167:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:number more like U6.
28:1069:65537:9:0:81:432:122:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:27The discount rate cannot be too high since it also shifts the asset distribution.
29:1070:65622:0:25:72:509:730:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:number of homeowners have had their mortgages modified or had late fees forgiven.28
29:1071:65705:25:18:89:539:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In this calibration, the model does not generate home sales except through foreclosure.
29:1072:65792:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:However, this feature of the calibration may not be important, as home sales were very low
29:1073:65882:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during this period, falling by a factor of eight (see Figure5).  The search disutility parameter
29:1074:65978:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is set to match the 6.5 percent ergodic unemployment rate; however, the disutility of search
29:1075:66070:18:53:72:417:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parameter also indirectly affects the mortgagor rate and cure rates.
29:1076:66138:53:36:72:540:580:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:8    Impact of Foreclosure Delay during Great Recession
29:1077:66193:36:18:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section quantifies the impact of the large increased time to foreclosure that occurred
29:1078:66284:18:18:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during the Great Recession.29Our approach is as follows.  We take three identical economies
29:1079:66375:18:18:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the 9-month foreclosure timeline and which had been in the high aggregate state for the
29:1080:66467:18:18:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:preceding 12 months.  All three economies next enter the low state,θ=L, and remain in that
29:1081:66557:18:18:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:state for 18 months, which is about the length of the Great Recession as defined by the NBER
29:1082:66649:18:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(December 2007 to June 2009).  At the onset of the low state, one economy continues with
29:1083:66737:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the 9-month foreclosure timeline, and we call this the “no delay economy.” The foreclosure
29:1084:66827:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline in the second of the economies increases to 15 months, which corresponds to the
29:1085:66915:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:national average, and we call this the “foreclosure delay economy.” The foreclosure timeline
29:1086:67007:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the third of the economies increases to 24 months, which is roughly the average foreclosure
29:1087:67101:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time for the 10 most delayed states, such as Florida, California, and New York.  We call this
29:1088:67194:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the “long foreclosure delay economy.” Thus, the only difference between the three economies
29:1089:67285:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is that one has a 9-month foreclosure timeline, one has a 15-month foreclosure timeline, and
29:1090:67377:18:25:72:279:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:one has a 24-month foreclosure timeline.
29:1091:67417:25:18:89:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure4 plots how the probability of foreclosure depends on the number of months in
29:1092:67500:18:18:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:default.   In  the  no  delay  economy,  there  is  a  constant  foreclosure  rate  of  3.02  percent  for
29:1093:67606:18:17:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:borrowers who are delinquent between 1 and 8 months, and certain eviction occurs in the
29:1094:67693:17:18:71:539:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:9th  month.   Recall  that  we  chose  the  3.02  percent  eviction  rate  to  account  for  the  small
29:1095:67796:18:18:71:539:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of early foreclosures that do occur in the data.  In the delay economy, there is also a
29:1096:67890:18:18:71:539:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constant foreclosure rate of 3.02 percent for borrowers who are delinquent between 1 and 14
29:1097:67981:18:16:81:539:178:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:28In  a  working  paper  version  of  the  model  we  include  modifications  as  a  random  event  that  competes
29:1098:68095:16:12:72:539:162:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:with foreclosure.  Including means tested modifications distorts job taking behavior even more.  SeeMulligan

29:1100:68252:8:16:81:540:142:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:29This experiment relates to work byMulligan[2008,2010,2011] andHerkenhoff and Ohanian[2011b]

29:1102:68448:12:0:71:346:114:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:unemployment by distorting incentives to find and accept jobs.
30:1103:68512:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:months, and certain eviction occurs in the 15th month.  There is an analogous process for
30:1104:68601:18:25:72:463:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the long foreclosure delay economy, with certain eviction in the 24th month.
30:1105:68677:25:18:89:539:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The job-finding rate and the job destruction rate during the Great Recession were quite
30:1106:68764:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different  from  those  in  previous,  milder  recessions.   We  therefore  adjust  the  model’s  job-
30:1107:68866:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:finding and job destruction rates, using data from JOLTS. We find that the job-finding rate
30:1108:68957:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fell by about 37 percent and that the job destruction rate rose by about 27 percent between
30:1109:69048:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2007 to 2009.  Table 7 summarizes the impact of the 2007-2009 recession on job-finding and
30:1110:69138:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:layoff rates in the data.  To capture the severity of the Great Recession,  we unexpectedly
30:1111:69229:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduce  job  offers  and  increase  job  destruction  rates  during  the  18  months  for  which  the
30:1112:69330:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy is in the low aggregate state.  Specifically, the job-finding rate in the low state is
30:1113:69424:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:adjusted down fromαf(L) =.76 to.64.Similarly, the job destruction rate in the low state,
30:1114:69512:18:25:71:331:525:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f3:δ(L), is adjusted from 1.5 in the low state to 1.7.30
30:1115:69565:25:18:89:539:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:At the end of 18 months in the low state,  both economies enter the high state,  which
30:1116:69651:18:18:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:continues thereafter, and in which job destruction and job creation rates return to their high
30:1117:69745:18:25:71:316:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:state levels, and the time to foreclose continues.
30:1118:69795:25:38:89:332:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The main experiment is summarized as follows:

30:1128:70447:18:18:127:529:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maintains a 9-month foreclosure timeline, which we call the no delay economy.

31:1140:71534:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion matrix across mortgage payment states for the no delay economy and for the foreclosure
31:1141:71625:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delay economy from this experiment.  The black numbers are for the foreclosure delay econ-
31:1142:71715:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:omy, and the red underlined numbers are for the no-delay economy and are thus interpreted
31:1143:71804:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as the counterfactual.  For simplicity, note that the model transition matrix does not include
31:1144:71898:18:25:72:401:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as many states as the empirical transition matrix from Figure5.
31:1145:71961:25:18:89:539:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We focus on two features of these model statistics.  The first is that the model approxi-
31:1146:72050:18:18:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mately captures the impact of foreclosure delay, as the probability of a borrower who is in
31:1147:72141:18:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure  and  who  remains  in  foreclosure  is  about  89  percent  in  the  data  for  2009-2011
31:1148:72243:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and is about 88 percent in the model for this period.  The second is that foreclosure delay
31:1149:72334:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:results in a lower foreclosure rate.  The model foreclosure rate is 9.9 percent for the no delay
31:1150:72430:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy and is 4.5 percent for the foreclosure delay economy.  Although there is no empirical
31:1151:72523:18:17:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analogue for comparison, given that the no delay economy is a counterfactual, it is interest-
31:1152:72616:17:18:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing to note, however, that the actual foreclosure rate drops from 8.6 percent in 2001-2003 to
31:1153:72709:18:26:72:200:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.5 percent in 2009-2011.
31:1154:72734:26:17:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Foreclosure  delay  also  has  an  impact  on  borrowers’  decisions  to  default  and  to  cure.
31:1155:72831:17:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Specifically, borrowers default more frequently and cure more slowly with foreclosure delay.
31:1156:72923:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The model predicts that the monthly default rate is about 0.3 percentage points (.0105-.0077)
31:1157:73016:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher when there is a 15-month foreclosure timeline (this is roughly a third higher relative
31:1158:73109:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the 9-month foreclosure timeline).  Similarly, the cure rate from 90 or more days late to 60
31:1159:73204:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:days late in the 15-month foreclosure economy drops by about 0.8 percentage points (.1762-
31:1160:73294:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:.1685).  Since more borrowers default and also remain in the 90 or more days late category
31:1161:73384:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer, they experience more foreclosures.  Thus, with foreclosure delay the foreclosure rate
31:1162:73477:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rises  roughly  3.8  percentage  points  (.1063-.0675),  which  represents  a  57  percent  increase
31:1163:73577:18:0:72:298:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compared with the economy with no delays.
32:1164:73620:0:33:72:401:730:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:8.2    Quantitative Impact of Foreclosure Delay
32:1165:73667:33:18:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figures 7 to 11 illustrate the time paths of mortgagor employment, aggregate employment,
32:1166:73755:18:18:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the stock of homes with delinquent mortgages, and the fraction of households with mortgages
32:1167:73846:18:18:72:540:661:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(the  mortgagor  rate)  in  the  three  economies  during  the  experiment.   The  main  finding  is
32:1168:73946:18:18:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that foreclosure delay considerably affects borrower decisions to default and cure.  This in
32:1169:74038:18:18:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turn  depresses  employment  but  improves  match  quality  as  unemployed  mortgagors  have
32:1170:74130:18:18:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:additional time to search, which results in higher wages.  As we describe later, the impact
32:1171:74221:18:18:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from  foreclosure  delay  on  employment  is  equivalent  to  extending  unemployment  benefits
32:1172:74316:18:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between  about  4  months,  which  is  for  the  average  foreclosure  delay  across  all  states,  to
32:1173:74418:18:41:72:398:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about 6 months, which is for the states with the longest delays.

32:1175:74532:33:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 7 plots employment per capita among mortgagors in the three economies.  We find
32:1176:74618:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that mortgagor employment in the economy with the 24-month foreclosure timeline, which
32:1177:74704:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:characterizes  the  increase  in  foreclosure  delays  that  occurred  in  Florida,  New  York,  New
32:1178:74804:18:18:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Jersey, California, and several other large states, is about 1.3 percentage points lower than
32:1179:74897:18:18:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the no delay economy.  In levels, the employment rate is about 89.5 percent in the economy
32:1180:74990:18:18:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with a 9-month foreclosure timeline and about 88.2 percent in the economy with the 24-month
32:1181:75081:18:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure  timeline.   Aggregate  employment  in  these  states,  which  combines  mortgagor
32:1182:75175:18:18:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employment with employment of renters and of homeowners without mortgages, is about 0.5
32:1183:75262:18:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percentage points lower, which reflects the fact that those with mortgages make up roughly
32:1184:75352:18:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:43 percent of the model economy’s agents.  The employment rate among mortgagors in the
32:1185:75438:18:17:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy with the 15-month foreclosure timeline, which captures the average increase that
32:1186:75526:17:18:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:occurred for all states, and which includes several states with little if any foreclosure delay,
32:1187:75622:18:18:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is  about  0.75  percentage  points  lower  than  in  the  economy  with  the  9-month  foreclosure
32:1188:75721:18:25:72:449:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline, and aggregate employment is about 0.3 percentage points lower.
32:1189:75793:25:18:89:539:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure  8  plots  the  differences  in  mortgagor  employment  rates  for  the  three  economies
32:1190:75889:18:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in  order  to  highlight  these  differences.   Lemmas  6.1and6.2indicate  why  employment  is
32:1191:75983:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lower  when  time  to  foreclose  rises.   Specifically,  the  self-insurance  provided  by  mortgage
32:1192:76084:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:default results in lower employment as the foreclosure timeline becomes longer.  Thus, longer
32:1193:76177:18:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure delay means greater default protection, which in turn means a larger difference in
32:1194:76271:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employment between these economies.  Foreclosure delay is a de facto implicit line of credit
32:1195:76363:18:0:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from  the  lender  to  the  mortgagor,  and  by  extending  the  duration  of  this  credit  line  with
33:1196:76468:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure  delays,  this  extra  self-insurance  has  an  impact  on  unemployed  worker  search
33:1197:76566:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decisions  and  reservation  wages.   To  gauge  the  model  relative  to  the  data,  we  note  that
33:1198:76667:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mortgagor employment among PSID respondents drops by about 6 percent between 2007
33:1199:76748:18:18:72:539:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and 2009,  which is of similar magnitude to our experiment.  Appendix16shows that the
33:1200:76833:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drop in employment per capita among mortgagors in the model is consistent with the data.
33:1201:76921:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Averaging  across  states  with  delays  and  without  delays,  Figure9  plots  the  difference  in
33:1202:77020:18:18:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:aggregate  employment  per  capita,  which  includes  both  mortgagors  and  nonmortgagors  in
33:1203:77114:18:25:72:180:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each model economy.
33:1204:77133:25:18:89:539:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To  assess  whether our  model produces a  reasonable quantitative impact  of foreclosure
33:1205:77222:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delay on employment, we measure the impact of changes in unemployment insurance in this
33:1206:77309:18:18:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model, given that this topic has been studied considerably.  We do this as inNakajima[2012],
33:1207:77401:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:who constructs a Mortensen-Pissarides model with risk aversion and asset heterogeneity to
33:1208:77490:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assess the impact of unemployment insurance (UI) extensions on unemployment during the
33:1209:77576:18:17:72:539:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:2007-2009 recession.  We find that our model produces anunemployment  benefit  elasticity
33:1210:77665:17:18:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of .43, which is defined as the increase in unemployment durations in weeks resulting from
33:1211:77755:18:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a  10  percent  increase  in  the  benefit  replacement  rate  for  a  regular  6-month  duration  of
33:1212:77856:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:UI. Unemployment benefit elasticity is commonly referenced in the empirical literature on
33:1213:77945:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unemployment insurance.Card et al.[2015] provide a summary of this literature and report
33:1214:78033:18:18:72:539:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that this same elasticity measure varies from 0.3 to 2 in U.S. data across several studies.Card
33:1215:78128:18:18:72:539:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:et al.[2015] also report measures of this elasticity from data during the Great Recession,
33:1216:78218:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which range from 0.65 to 0.9.  Our model therefore produces a response of employment to
33:1217:78305:18:25:72:467:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unemployment benefit changes that is on the lower end of existing estimates.
33:1218:78381:25:18:89:539:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since the topic of foreclosure delay and its impact on employment has not been previously
33:1219:78470:18:18:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:studied,  we next place our quantitative estimates in context by calculating the equivalent
33:1220:78561:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:impact on employment within our model that results from extending unemployment benefits.
33:1221:78649:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Specifically, we calculate how many additional months of unemployment benefits would result
33:1222:78740:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in 0.5 percent lower aggregate employment, which is the employment decline in the 24-month
33:1223:78830:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline economy,  and 0.3 percent lower aggregate employment,  which is the employment
33:1224:78917:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decline in the 15-month timeline economy.31We find that the employment decline resulting
33:1225:79005:18:17:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from  the  24-month  foreclosure  timeline  is  equivalent  to  the  impact  of  about  a  6-month
33:1226:79103:17:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extension of unemployment benefits, and that the employment decline from the 15-month
33:1227:79188:18:18:72:445:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure timeline is equivalent to about a 3.7-month benefit extension.
33:1228:79262:18:16:81:539:142:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:31A 24-month UI policy increases the unemployment rate by 1.9 percent.  We simply scale this ratio of UI
33:1229:79366:16:0:72:540:126:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:duration to UR to arrive at our estimates in the paper of the impact of foreclosure delay on unemployment.
34:1230:79474:0:18:89:539:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The employment declines resulting from foreclosure delay are the consequence of different
34:1231:79563:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:levels of search intensity and reservation wages, both of which depend on delinquency status.
34:1232:79656:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Specifically,  reservation  wages  are  about  4  percent  higher  with  the  24-month  foreclosure
34:1233:79755:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline compared with the 9-month foreclosure timeline economy at a mortgage payment
34:1234:79840:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delinquency ranging between 1 to 4 months.  Near foreclosure, however, reservation wages
34:1235:79928:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in both the 9-month timeline economy and the 24-month timeline economy drop by roughly
34:1236:80014:18:18:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:10 percent, and search effort increases as households attempt to find a job quickly in order
34:1237:80106:18:25:72:171:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to prevent eviction.
34:1238:80126:25:18:89:539:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Although foreclosure delay does not account for the majority of the decline in U.S. em-
34:1239:80213:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ployment observed since 2008, its relative quantitative impact appears to be similar to several
34:1240:80308:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:other factors that have been studied.  This includes analyses of mismatch employment (Kara-

34:1243:80581:18:17:72:539:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:account  for  only  a  modest  amount  of  the  recent  change  in  employment.Fratto  and  Uh-

34:1246:80870:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wage/price markup shocks, and find that no single factor accounts for more than 2-3 per-

34:1249:81092:18:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of  mortgages  in  default  reaches  its  maximum  6  quarters  after  the  recession  begins.   The
34:1250:81192:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delinquent stock declines thereafter as the economy switches back to the high state.  In the
34:1251:81284:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy with the 24-month foreclosure timeline, delinquencies peak at about 14.2 percent
34:1252:81372:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the total stock of mortgages, which is roughly equal to the delinquent stock among the
34:1253:81461:18:18:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:10  most  delayed  states.32The  economy  with  a  15-month  foreclosure  timeline  has  a  peak
34:1254:81557:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delinquency  stock  of  11.2  percent,  which  is  modestly  higher  than  the  national  average  of
34:1255:81658:18:18:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about  10.57  percent.33The  economy  with  the  9-month  foreclosure  timeline,  which  is  the

34:1257:81846:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the stock of delinquencies are driven by households’ choices to default more frequently and
34:1258:81937:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cure more slowly with foreclosure delay.  Empirical work byPace and Zhu[2011] has demon-
34:1259:82025:18:17:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:strated  a  similarly  strong  link  between  delays  and  default.   The  consumption  smoothing
34:1260:82122:17:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:motive of default is also consistent with evidence inBaker and Yannelis[2015] andGelman

35:1266:82537:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy with the 24-month foreclosure timeline, homeownership (with mortgages) drops by
35:1267:82624:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about 0.5 percentage points, from 42.5 percent to 42.0 percent, 6 quarters after the onset of
35:1268:82717:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the recession, whereas homeownership drops to 41.7 percent over this same time period in
35:1269:82805:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the counterfactual economy with the 9-month foreclosure delay timeline.  Thus, foreclosure
35:1270:82895:18:42:72:381:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delay results in fewer foreclosures and more ultimate curing.

35:1274:83187:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which corresponds to no delay and which is consistent with many states such as Arizona,
35:1275:83274:18:17:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Georgia, Iowa, Texas, and Washington, predict that foreclosure delay reduces employment.
35:1276:83362:17:18:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section uses the Current Population Survey (CPS) to assess the model’s quantitative
35:1277:83450:18:18:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:results.  To exploit the variation in foreclosure times across states, we categorize households
35:1278:83545:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:according  to  their  state  and  conduct  a  difference-in-difference  analysis.   Specifically,  we
35:1279:83646:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compare employment rates across renters and homeowners in slow and fast foreclosure states,
35:1280:83737:18:18:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:controlling for a host of individual characteristics. We rank states based on the speed at which
35:1281:83833:18:18:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:homeowners transition from foreclosure to liquidation (including REO). Table 9 includes our
35:1282:83924:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:classification of slow and fast foreclosure states.  We then isolate the top 10 fastest and top
35:1283:84019:18:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:10 slowest foreclosure states in the 2001 through 2013 March Supplement CPS surveys.  We
35:1284:84107:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:then  compare  employment  status  of  homeowners  and  renters  in  fast  and  slow  foreclosure
35:1285:84204:18:25:72:499:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:states, splitting the sample before and after the large increase in foreclosure delays.
35:1286:84291:25:18:89:539:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table  10presents  these  results.   The  dependent  variable  is  a  dummy  variable  if  the
35:1287:84385:18:18:71:539:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:household  is  employed,  and  we  include  demographic,  occupation,  and  industry  controls.
35:1288:84480:18:18:71:540:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Columns  (1)  and  (2)  of  Table10show  that  homeowners,  as  compared  with  renters,  have
35:1289:84574:18:18:71:539:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a lower employment rate in states with slow foreclosure processes as compared with states
35:1290:84663:18:18:71:539:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with fast foreclosure processes.  The magnitude of this effect ranges between a 0.4 percent
35:1291:84754:18:17:71:539:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to a 0.8 percent reduction in employment per capita depending on the control set, which is
35:1292:84844:17:18:71:540:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consistent with the results of our structural model presented Section6.  Columns (3) and
35:1293:84932:18:19:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(4) of Table10split the sample between pre-2007 and post-2007.  We see that the impact
35:1294:85018:19:15:81:539:138:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:34Evidence in Dobbie and Song [2013] about earnings outcomes and debt protection is consistent with our
35:1295:85121:15:0:72:123:123:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:mechanism.
36:1296:85133:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of foreclosure delay is weaker in the 2003-2007 period, which is consistent with the fact that
36:1297:85227:18:42:72:468:712:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:there was much less variation in foreclosure time across states in 2003-2007.35

36:1299:85351:33:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Foreclosure delay also affects the quality of jobs that are accepted by the unemployed,  as
36:1300:85442:18:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:well as the economy’s wage bill.  Table8 shows that foreclosure delays result in wages that
36:1301:85533:18:18:71:539:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are higher by about 0.2 percent to about 0.3 percent.  The extra self-insurance provided by
36:1302:85624:18:18:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the default protection has two effects:  (i) fewer people are working, which results in a lower
36:1303:85719:18:18:71:539:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employment rate, but those who are working have higher wages.  Table8 indicates that the
36:1304:85807:18:25:71:539:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:improved match quality (higher average wages) more than offsets the effect of fewer workers.
36:1305:85899:25:18:89:540:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This  result  is  consistent  with  a  large  literature  that  includesEhrenberg  and  Oaxaca
36:1306:85993:18:18:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:[1976],Feldstein  and  Poterba[1984],Addison  and  Blackburn[2000],  andHagedorn  et  al.
36:1307:86082:18:17:71:539:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:[2013],  who have found that unemployment insurance extensions improve wage outcomes.
36:1308:86167:17:18:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  our  model,  we  find  that  unemployed  defaulters  find  jobs  that  pay  0.8  percent  greater
36:1309:86268:18:18:71:539:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in a stochastic steady state with the 15-month foreclosure timeline relative to the 9-month
36:1310:86359:18:18:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure timeline. As noted earlier, the 15-month foreclosure timeline is roughly equivalent
36:1311:86454:18:18:71:539:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the 4 month benefit extension, which implies that our wage gains from foreclosure delay
36:1312:86544:18:18:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are at the lower end of estimates from U.S. data.36Some studies based on European data
36:1313:86630:18:18:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such  asSchmieder  et  al.[2013]  find  mixed  evidence  regarding  wage  outcomes,  but  other
36:1314:86725:18:18:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:studies such asNekoei et al.[2013], who use Austrian data, find that a UI extension of 9
36:1315:86813:18:25:71:528:343:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:weeks raises re-employment wages by 0.5 percent, which is consistent with our findings.37

36:1319:87168:18:18:71:539:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that credit access is an important source of self-insurance for unemployed households.  They

36:1321:87320:12:15:81:539:234:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:36Addison and Blackburn [2000] provide a comprehensive survey of the literature, showing that the major-
36:1322:87424:15:12:72:540:219:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ity of studies that consider the impact of unemployment benefits on re-employment earnings find significant
36:1323:87531:12:12:72:540:207:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and positive impacts of UI on wages.  The magnitudes vary, and the units of analysis vary, but the general
36:1324:87637:12:8:72:443:195:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:consensus of the literature is that unemployment insurance improves wage outcomes.
36:1325:87719:8:16:81:540:187:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:37The results in Schmieder et al.[2013] are not particularly informative for our study because of large
36:1326:87822:16:12:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:differences in the asset positions of the households we study, and of the 40-42 year old German workers studied
36:1327:87933:12:12:71:539:159:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:inSchmieder et al.[2013].  Specifically, the OECD reports that the German household private savings rate
36:1328:88037:12:12:71:539:147:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:is 10 percent, which suggests that the German households have a significant buffer stock of assets, whereas
36:1329:88144:12:12:71:539:135:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we documented that the delinquent mortgagors we study have no buffer stock.  Thus, our theory indicates
36:1330:88247:12:0:71:455:123:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that the impact of UI extensions will be very different across these two different groups.
37:1331:88339:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:find that households with greater amounts of unsecured credit, and thus more insurance, take
37:1332:88431:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer to find jobs, and find higher wage jobs that are in line with the estimates presented

37:1335:88592:33:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 12 shows the model’s employment per capita by delinquency status for the 15-month
37:1336:88680:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline economy.  Employment rises in the model as delinquencies rise, with borrowers rais-
37:1337:88772:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing their search intensity and reducing their reservation wages.  The mortgagor employment
37:1338:88862:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate in the model rises by about 5 percent between being 60 days late and being in the fore-
37:1339:88954:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:closure process.  This increase in the model’s mortgagor employment rate is smoother than
37:1340:89043:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the increase in the data, in which the latter is characterized by an increase that primarily
37:1341:89135:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:occurs for mortgagors who are in the foreclosure process.  The increase in the employment
37:1342:89224:18:25:72:294:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate in the actual data is about 10 percent.
37:1343:89268:25:18:89:539:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There are two likely reasons why the model employment increase is smoother than the
37:1344:89351:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increases displayed in Figures 1 and 2 from the PSID and the SCF, and is also not as large
37:1345:89441:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as in those data.  One reason is that our model, like all standard search models, does not
37:1346:89531:18:17:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:produce as many long-term unemployed as in the data.  This is because unemployment in
37:1347:89616:17:18:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:standard  search  models  is  Markovian.   This  means  that  search  models  generate  very  few
37:1348:89713:18:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:individuals who are unemployed for long periods of time (e.g.,  more than a few months),
37:1349:89801:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereas 45 percent of the unemployed between 2009 and 2011 were unemployed for longer
37:1350:89886:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than 6 months.  We are unaware of any models that are capable of producing this share of
37:1351:89974:18:25:72:209:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:long duration unemployed.
37:1352:89999:25:18:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Another reason is that there is no heterogeneity in the flow utility derived from housing
37:1353:90088:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in our model.  This means that the opportunity cost of eviction is identical for all borrowers.
37:1354:90183:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:However,  it is likely that there are some households who are very strongly attached (well
37:1355:90273:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:matched) to their homes, and who choose to prevent eviction even at a very high cost.  This
37:1356:90364:18:0:72:222:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is not included in this model.

38:1358:90453:27:37:101:318:703:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:Unemployment Insurance
38:1359:90475:37:18:72:540:666:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section considers the sensitivity of the results to two changes to the benchmark model:
38:1360:90567:18:18:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(i) wage ladders as inLjungqvist and Sargent[1998] and (ii) unemployment insurance ex-
38:1361:90653:18:46:72:116:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tensions.
38:1362:90662:46:33:72:209:584:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:9.1    Wage Ladders
38:1363:90681:33:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This  section  reports  findings  for  the  case  of  a  wage  ladder,  rather  than  the  fixed  wage
38:1364:90783:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contract.  The impact of foreclosure delay is similar to that with fixed wages.  Figure13shows
38:1365:90877:18:18:71:539:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the difference in employment per capita between the economy with a 15-month foreclosure
38:1366:90964:18:18:71:539:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:timeline and the economy with a 9-month foreclosure timeline under different assumptions
38:1367:91052:18:18:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about on-the-job wage growth.  From SIPP data, we calculate that the probability of a wage
38:1368:91142:18:18:71:539:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase of at least $1 per month is about 4.66 percent.38This measure includes transitory
38:1369:91232:18:18:71:539:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wage changes, so we take this as an upper bound on the rate at which a worker may climb
38:1370:91319:18:18:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the  wage  ladder.   Prior  studies  such  asLjungqvist  and  Sargent[1998]  indirectly  inferred
38:1371:91416:18:18:71:539:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this parameter, and if we use their values for wage growth, the model results remain largely
38:1372:91508:18:18:71:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unchanged.  As Figure13shows, the difference in employment rates between the 24-month
38:1373:91593:18:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure timeline relative to the 9-month foreclosure timeline is about 0.1 percentage points
38:1374:91689:18:46:72:208:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:smaller with wage ladders.
38:1375:91715:46:33:72:351:307:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:9.2    Extended Unemployment Benefits
38:1376:91752:33:17:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Next,  to  assess  the  relative  importance  of  foreclosure  delays  in  an  environment  with  ex-
38:1377:91853:17:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tended unemployment benefits,  we compare our benchmark model with a model in which
38:1378:91936:18:18:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment insurance lasts for 2 years (in expectation).  The impact on thesteady state
38:1379:92025:18:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the economy from a 2-year permanent benefit extension is to raise the unemployment rate
38:1380:92115:18:18:72:539:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by 1.9 percent.  This increase in unemployment is nearly identical to that found inNakajima
38:1381:92206:18:16:81:539:185:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:38See Appendix 13for the full transition matrix.  We use the SIPP-constructed wage rate “wage,” which
38:1382:92307:16:12:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:is described as the “Hourly rate this month” deflated by the CPI. The gross probability reported earlier is
38:1383:92414:12:12:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the average probability of transiting up the wage ladder by $1 or more in any given month.  If we calculate
38:1384:92521:12:12:72:540:145:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:net wage increases, i.e.  we subtract from this measure the probability of going down at least $1 or more, the
38:1385:92631:12:11:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:transition probability is 1.36 percent.  If we further isolate permanent changes, this number declines further
38:1386:92741:11:0:72:457:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and the fixed contract model becomes a closer approximation to the wage ladder model.
39:1387:92828:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:[2012] (Table 4 of his paper) who also considers a 2-year permanent benefit extension but in
39:1388:92920:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a Mortensen-Pissarides style model.  AsNakajima[2012] discusses, this magnitude response
39:1389:93008:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is consistent with UI studies such asKatz and Meyer[1990],Chetty[2008],Rothstein[2011]
39:1390:93094:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:andHagedorn  et  al.[2013].  To complete  the sensitivity  analysis,  Figure14demonstrates
39:1391:93184:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the impact of foreclosure delay on employment in the economy with a 2-year benefit
39:1392:93271:18:52:72:501:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extension is only about 0.05 percentage points weaker than under the baseline case.
39:1393:93354:52:37:72:329:588:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:10    Summary and Conclusion
39:1394:93382:37:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper documents the fact that mortgage default as well as the home foreclosure process
39:1395:93473:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are persistent and reversible states, as homeowners who enter mortgage default often remain
39:1396:93564:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in default for a long period of time, and that these same homeowners often exit default or
39:1397:93654:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cure even when they have entered the foreclosure process.  To our knowledge, the persistence
39:1398:93746:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of default and foreclosure,  and the frequent curing from these states,  are absent from the
39:1399:93838:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:literature.  We also present evidence from the PSID and the SCF that mortgage default is
39:1400:93926:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated  with  job  acceptance,  as  the  employment  rate  among  delinquent  mortgagors  in
39:1401:94022:18:25:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure is higher than that for delinquent mortgagors who have yet to enter foreclosure.
39:1402:94114:25:18:89:539:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We construct a labor search model with homeownership that structurally interprets these
39:1403:94201:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:facts as unemployed households using mortgage default as a means to help smooth consump-
39:1404:94289:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion and search for a high-paying job, and who accept jobs to exit foreclosure when eviction is
39:1405:94384:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:imminent.  Our main finding is that the large increase in time to foreclose in some U.S. states
39:1406:94479:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in which foreclosure required about two years, including New York, New Jersey, and Florida
39:1407:94569:18:17:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(among others),  reduced the employment rate of homeowners with mortgages by 1.3 per-
39:1408:94654:17:18:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cent and reduced total employment within these states by about 0.5 percent.  To assess the
39:1409:94744:18:18:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:plausibility of this impact, we conducted a difference-in-difference estimate of employment
39:1410:94835:18:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates between homeowners and renters across states and find that homeowner employment
39:1411:94920:18:18:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates were between 0.4 percent to 0.8 percent lower.  The model also predicts that foreclo-
39:1412:95011:18:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sure delay of 15 months (the national average) increases the stock of delinquent loans by 45
39:1413:95103:18:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent, resulting from longer foreclosure processing time and slower mortgagor curing.  To
39:1414:95194:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:put the model’s prediction in context, our results indicate that a 15-month increase in the
39:1415:95285:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure timeline has an impact on the aggregate economy roughly equal to a 6-month
39:1416:95371:18:25:72:241:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unemployment benefit extension.
39:1417:95402:25:0:89:539:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  model  also  predicts  an  increase  in  match  quality,  as  foreclosure  delay  results  in
40:1418:95502:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer unemployment spells, which allows the unemployed to wait for higher-wage jobs.  We
40:1419:95591:18:18:72:540:712:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:find  that  the  wage  bill  in  the  economy  with  foreclosure  delay  rises  by  about  0.3  percent.
40:1420:95695:18:18:72:540:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This positive analysis of foreclosure delay provides an input to policymaking discussions on
40:1421:95787:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:alternative approaches in providing additional insurance to homeowners during periods of
40:1422:95875:18:62:72:287:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:substantial job loss and mortgage default.

61:1922:122620:34:18:71:539:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:Proof.Consider  an  unemployed  agent  that  is  comparing  the  options  of  (i)  turning  down

61:1926:123012:18:18:71:539:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Implicitly,  the  reservation  wage  depends  on  the  degree  of  default  protection,  thus  denote

65:2112:127753:37:18:72:540:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This section provides background information on the way mortgage default and foreclosure
65:2113:127841:18:18:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:typically work.  It is important to note that there is considerable variability across servicers
65:2114:127937:18:25:72:303:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and states as to how they handle foreclosure.
65:2115:127982:25:18:89:539:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  order  of  events  in  a  foreclosure  has  potential  to  distort  buyers’  incentives  to  pay
65:2116:128083:18:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:since foreclosure is a slow and relatively predictable process.  The usual order of events is as
65:2117:128179:18:38:72:110:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:follows:
65:2118:128187:38:28:86:362:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1.  Miss payments (30+ days late, Enter Delinquency)

66:2126:128542:38:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Legally, if a mortgagor breaks the terms of the mortgage, the bank can ask for the entire
66:2127:128631:18:18:71:539:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:debt  to  be  paid  immediately.   If  the  mortgagor  cannot  pay  this  entire  amount,  the  bank
66:2128:128731:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:can foreclose.  There are two main types of foreclosures in the United States:  judicial and
66:2129:128823:18:18:71:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nonjudicial (seeGhent and Kudlyak[2011] for state classifications).  To complete a judicial
66:2130:128914:18:18:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure,  the  bank  that  owns  the  mortgage  must  sue  the  person  living  in  the  home  in
66:2131:129015:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a state court.  A judge is required to rule on the case before a foreclosure sale can occur.
66:2132:129107:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A  foreclosure  sale  is  called  a  “sheriff  sale.”   A  non-judicial  foreclosure,  also  known  as  a
66:2133:129212:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreclosure by power of sale, allows the bank to sell the house without the court’s approval.
66:2134:129305:18:17:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A notice of default explains that the bank intends to sell the property and that if the debt
66:2135:129397:17:18:71:539:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is not cured, there will be a public auction for the house.  A notice of sale is issued 1 month
66:2136:129492:18:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prior  to  the  foreclosure  auction  date.   If  the  bank  is  unable  to  sell  the  home  in  a  public
66:2137:129599:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:auction, which means “no acceptable bids are made,” or the bank bids for the house itself,
66:2138:129689:18:25:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:then the house becomes owned by the bank.  The term for this is “real estate owned” (REO).
66:2139:129779:25:18:89:539:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:It is possible to temporarily postpone the foreclosure process by bankruptcy (however
66:2140:129864:18:18:71:539:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the courts cannot modify loans) or by challenging the banks’ right to the property they are
66:2141:129955:18:18:71:539:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trying to foreclose upon.41One component of the recent robo-signing scandal has to do with
66:2142:130045:18:25:71:478:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the banks’ inability to prove that they had the right of interest in the property.
66:2143:130127:25:18:89:539:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Regardless of the foreclosure procedure, each state has laws about recourse and nonre-
66:2144:130213:18:18:71:539:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:course  loans.   In  a  state  with  recourse,  selling  a  home  for  less  than  the  amount  due  may
66:2145:130317:18:18:71:539:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:result in a deficiency judgment.  Deficiency judgments mandate that the borrower pay the
66:2146:130405:18:18:71:539:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:difference between the sale price and the amount owed on the mortgage.  Many mortgages
66:2147:130491:18:18:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:however are nonrecourse loans,  meaning that the bank cannot sue to obtain the assets of
66:2148:130579:18:18:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the person who held the mortgage.  As a result, in most cases, borrowers are exempt from
66:2149:130667:18:18:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:deficiency judgments.  In California, for instance, the first purchase-money mortgage for a
66:2150:130758:18:18:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:residential property is a nonrecourse loan.  However, the state laws are not entirely uniform
66:2151:130851:18:25:71:438:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:across all mortgages, e.g.  all refinanced loans in California are recourse.
66:2152:130927:25:18:89:539:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is also a chance for homeowners to ‘redeem’ their homes after foreclosure if they

67:2155:131126:0:18:72:540:730:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are able to raise enough money.  These redemption periods can last up to a year and vary
