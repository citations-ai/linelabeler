2:25:1155:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:A model is developed which rationalizes contracts that give depositors the right to obtain funds on
2:26:1254:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:demand even when depositors intend to use these funds for consumption in the future. This is explained
2:27:1356:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:by depositor overoptimism regarding their own ability to collect funds in a run. Capitalized institutions
2:28:1461:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:serving depositors with such beliefs emerge in equilibrium even if depositors and bank owners have
2:29:1559:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:the same preferences and the same investment opportunities. Various government regulations of these
2:30:1658:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:institutions, including minimum capital levels, requirements concerning the assets they may hold,
2:31:1755:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:deposit insurance and compulsory clawbacks in bankruptcy can raise the average ex post welfare of
2:32:1852:14:42:72:124:490:12:Times:12:Times:depositors.

3:40:1996:0:22:89:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper shows that a simple cognitive bias that seems consistent with experimental
3:41:2081:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:evidence can account for the popularity of demandable deposits. The cognitive bias I consider
3:42:2174:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is a form of overconfidence: people are too optimistic about their future position in line
3:43:2264:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:when they expect scarce resources to be distributed on a first-come first-served basis. For
3:44:2355:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors, this would imply overoptimism concerning their chances to recover their funds
3:45:2444:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in a bank run. This does not require depositors to consider themselves well informed. It is
3:46:2535:22:22:72:531:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sufficient for them to believe that other depositors are even slower to react than they are.
3:47:2627:22:22:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The main result of the paper is that this overconfidence can rationalize demandable de-
3:48:2714:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:posit contracts even when everyone derives the same utility from consumption in every state
3:49:2805:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of nature, everyone has the same investment opportunities and everyone has the same beliefs
3:50:2896:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:regarding the payoffs of these investments. Overoptimistic agents deposit their endowment
3:51:2985:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with other agents in exchange for the right to be paid on a first-come first-served basis. They
3:52:3080:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:do this even though they are risk averse and they rationally recognize that first-come first
3:53:3172:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:served contract are risky because they lead early withdrawers in a run to more consumption
3:54:3262:22:22:72:147:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:than late ones.
3:55:3277:22:22:89:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:Because some agents are overoptimistic, it is possible to increase their averageex post
3:56:3364:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:utility with suitably designed policy interventions. This leads me to consider four different
3:57:3457:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:types of policies. The first is a policy of imposing “clawbacks” in bankruptcy so that deposi-
3:58:3551:22:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tors who arrive too late to receive anything from their bank can recover resources from those
3:59:3644:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who withdrew earlier. The result is that all depositors end up being treated symmetrically
3:60:3734:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:at all times, as assumed by Allen and Gale (1998). In the U. S., bankruptcy law requires
3:61:3822:22:22:72:535:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:such clawbacks in the case of nonfinancial bankruptcies but exempts financial institutions.
3:62:3913:22:22:89:539:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The second policy I examine is the provision of deposit insurance financed by taxation.
3:63:4000:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Like clawbacks, this avoids inefficient runs, which is particularly useful when runs lead to
3:64:4092:22:21:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costly transfers of assets. When such transfers (or liquidations) are costless, an alternative
3:65:4186:21:22:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:policy that also tends to raiseex postwelfare, and which may be administratively more
3:66:4271:22:22:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expedient, is to force bank owners to put up more of their own capital. Finally, I demonstrate
3:67:4365:22:0:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that it is possible to raise this welfare by forcing banks to hold assets that they would
4:68:4455:0:22:72:151:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:otherwise shun.
4:69:4470:22:22:89:539:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:A central motivation for the analysis in this paper is that demandable liabilities,i.e.,
4:70:4558:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:liabilities with the property that claimants are entitled to receive predetermined quantities
4:71:4651:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of a valuable asset whenever they want to, have been ubiquitous for a long time. Mueller
4:72:4739:22:22:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(1997, p. 15-25) shows that they were important in XIVthcentury Venice, well before any
4:73:4826:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:government provided deposit insurance might have made such deposits safe.  Indeed, de-
4:74:4912:22:22:72:539:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mandable deposits have proven unsafe in a number of instances.1This was particularly true
4:75:5001:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the American Free Banking era where, as Hasan and Dwyer (1996) report, numerous
4:76:5083:22:22:72:464:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:banks closed without fulfilling all their contractual obligations to depositors.
4:77:5163:22:22:89:539:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In the current U.S. context, a different but equally remarkable feature of demandable
4:78:5248:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:liabilities is their enormous volume. According to the Flow of Funds Accounts, total financial
4:79:5342:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets of households were about $ 31 trillion in 2000.2At the same time, Buckset al.(2009)
4:80:5432:22:21:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:report that in the Survey of Consumer Finances Surveys of both 1998 and 2001, households
4:81:5520:21:22:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:held 11.4 % of their financial assets in “transactions accounts” (which are basically accounts
4:82:5614:22:22:71:539:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that are immediately available). This means that the total held in these accounts was about
4:83:5705:22:22:71:539:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:$ 3.5 trillion. For comparison, total annual consumer expenditure on goods and services in
4:84:5795:22:22:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the U.S. equaled $ 6.8 trillion in 2000. Most consumers are also receiving income from other
4:85:5887:22:22:71:539:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sources with at least a monthly frequency, so that transactions balances of the same size as
4:86:5979:22:22:71:539:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:monthly consumer expenditures ought to be sufficient to pay for these expenditures in the
4:87:6068:22:22:71:539:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:vast majority of circumstances. It follows that many households have “transactions balances”
4:88:6160:22:22:71:539:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that exceed the maximum they could possibly need for transactions over an horizon of, say,
4:89:6250:22:22:71:142:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:three months.
4:90:6263:22:22:89:539:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The enormous volume of demandable deposits suggests that the most widely used the-
4:91:6345:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:oretical rationale for their existence, namely the rationale offered in Diamond and Dybvig
4:92:6435:22:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(1983), may not suffice.  Diamond and Dybvig (1983) let consumers be uncertain about
4:93:6519:18:16:85:539:176:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:1Mueller (1997) also documents several instances of bank failures and notes their cost to “the unlucky
4:94:6621:16:8:72:348:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:depositors who failed to withdraw his money in time” (p. 121).
4:95:6683:8:16:85:539:152:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:2This is the last year for which Supplemental table L100a lists the assets of nonprofit institutions. For
4:96:6788:16:0:72:442:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:subsequent years, only the total of households and nonprofit institutions is available.
5:97:6876:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whether they will need funds relatively quickly, and show that demandable deposits provide
5:98:6966:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:insurance against the risk of having such a need. This insurance has a price, however, so
5:99:7055:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that consumers with funds that are intended for consumption beyond a short horizon would
5:100:7143:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be better off holding long term assets.3In my analysis, by contrast, depositors who intend to
5:101:7236:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:consume far into the future hold demandable assets because these give them the opportunity
5:102:7326:22:22:72:449:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to change their portfolio at will on terms that are determined in advance.
5:103:7400:22:22:89:539:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:An essential component of the model is that depositors all seek to change their portfolio,
5:104:7490:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and thus run on the institution that issued demand deposits, when there are bad news
5:105:7574:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:regarding the assets held by the institution. The model is thus consistent with the empirical
5:106:7667:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:literature on the incidence of banking panics. Gorton’s (1988) pioneering paper studied runs
5:107:7759:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the U.S. National Banking Era (1863-1914) and showed that these occurred mostly at
5:108:7844:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:times of weak business conditions, when bank loans were presumably impaired. Similarly,
5:109:7931:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Hasan and Dwyer (1996) show that bank runs in the Free Banking Era (1836-1863) mostly
5:110:8016:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:took place when banks held bonds that had fallen in value. Lastly, Schumacher (2000) shows
5:111:8106:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that the banks that experienced runs in Argentina after the 1994 Mexico crisis tended to
5:112:8194:22:22:72:255:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have relatively weak balance sheets.
5:113:8230:22:22:89:539:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The best studied runs involve deposits at commercial banks. Still, U.S. Money Market
5:114:8314:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Mutual Funds seem to be subject to similar runs even though they do not explicitly specify
5:115:8404:22:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:how much their depositors will be able to withdraw in the future. They may do so implicitly,
5:116:8496:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:however.  At least some of these funds have maintained the right of investors to redeem
5:117:8583:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:each “share” for one dollar when the assets underlying these shares were worth less. As an
5:118:8673:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:example, a fund called the “Reserve Primary Fund” suffered declines in the value of its claims
5:119:8767:22:22:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on Lehman Brothers as Lehman was going bankrupt in 2008, and this led to a run. The
5:120:8850:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fund’s liabilities stood at $62.6 billion on Friday, September 12, and a flood of redemptions
5:121:8943:22:17:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:reduced this to $23 billion by Tuesday, September 16 at 3 p.m. Redemption requests received
5:122:9034:17:16:85:539:177:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:3It is worth noting that Bryant (1980) models the risk of needing to consume early as being the risk
5:123:9134:16:12:72:540:161:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of learning early in one’s life that one will die imminently, and then wishing to consume all one’s assets.
5:124:9241:12:12:72:540:149:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:I have interpreted this as a metaphor for short term changes in the desire to consume but it may apply
5:125:9343:12:12:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:more broadly. Bryant (1980) motivates his paper as providing a rationalization for deposit insurance and
5:126:9447:12:0:72:278:125:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the current paper could be motivated similarly.
6:127:9495:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:before this point were honored at $1 a share. At 3 p.m. redemptions were frozen, and the
6:128:9583:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fund was then slowly liquidated. Investors who remained at 3 p.m. were paid off gradually,
6:129:9673:22:22:72:324:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and received substantially less than $1 per share.
6:130:9723:22:22:89:539:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The bias considered in this paper is closely related to forms of overconfidence demon-
6:131:9809:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:strated that have been documented in the past. One oft-cited finding in the literature is that
6:132:9903:22:22:72:539:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:survey responses display an “optimistic bias.”4Weinstein (1980) was one of the first to ex-
6:133:9994:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:hibit this phenomenon. He showed that survey respondents tend to say that the probability
6:134:10083:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that they will obtain desirable outcomes (like having a mentally gifted child) is higher than
6:135:10176:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the probability that their peers will obtain these outcomes. By contrast, respondents report
6:136:10268:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that their own probability of a bad outcome such as a heart attack or a drinking problem
6:137:10356:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is lower than that of their peers.5Weinstein (1980) also reports that this bias is larger for
6:138:10449:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:events that people judge to be controllable. The finding that perception of control is corre-
6:139:10542:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lated with increased optimism about risky outcomes has been reproduced by a number of
6:140:10627:21:22:72:117:436:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:authors.6
6:141:10636:22:22:89:539:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:One issue that arises at this point is how people come to have the perception that they
6:142:10723:22:22:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:control an outcome. Interestingly, this does not appear to require much actual influence.
6:143:10812:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As Langer (1975) shows, numerous manipulations can give people an “illusion of control.”
6:144:10900:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:One of the most striking pieces of evidence for this can be found in Strickland, Lewicki and
6:145:10992:22:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Katz (1966) and Rothbart and Snyder (1970). These papers show that people express more
6:146:11078:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:confidence that they know the outcomes from rolls of dice, and that are willing to wager
6:147:11166:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:more of their own funds on these outcomes, when they place their bets before they roll the
6:148:11256:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:dice rather than afterwards. This is true even though the one would not expect the outcome
6:149:11346:22:22:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of a dice throw to depend on whether a bet is placed on it beforehand. What is particularly
6:150:11437:22:17:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:useful about these experiments is that they do involve actual payoffs and therefore the
6:151:11524:17:12:85:405:199:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:4In October 2010, Google Scholar lists about 5,000 works using the term.
6:152:11596:12:16:85:539:187:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:5Harris and Hahn (2010) point out that these results could be a statistical artifact which results from
6:153:11699:16:12:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the fact that many of the positive outcomes studied by Weinstein (1980) (like getting a job one likes) were
6:154:11806:12:12:72:540:159:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:common while many of the negative outcomes (like attempting suicide) were uncommon. Still, the base rates
6:155:11911:12:12:72:540:147:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:for several of the positive and negative effects demonstrated by Weinstein (1980) (including those I mention
6:156:12019:12:8:72:202:135:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:in the text) seem comparable.
6:157:12048:8:0:85:319:127:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:6See Thompsonet al(1998) for a valuable discussion.
7:158:12100:0:22:72:487:721:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:interpretation of the results is not marred by the ambiguity of natural language.7
7:159:12182:22:22:89:539:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Obtaining a scarce product that is distributed on a first-come first-served basis does
7:160:12268:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:require one to take action, and people may well feel quite a bit of control over this outcome.
7:161:12362:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Moreover, people who entrust a debtor with funds often have a strong desire to receive it
7:162:12451:22:22:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:back. This too may foster a false sense of control. As Thompsonet. al(1998, p. 151) put
7:163:12538:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:it, “When people have a strong need for an outcome or a strong commitment to getting
7:164:12622:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the outcome, they know that their intention to obtain the outcome is strong, and this may
7:165:12711:22:22:72:259:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:influence their judgment of control.”
7:166:12748:22:22:89:539:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f1:Related Literature.This paper is related to two behavioral literatures in economics. The
7:167:12836:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:first concerns overconfidence about one’s own abilities. B ́enabou and Tirole (2002), Compte
7:168:12928:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and Postlewaite (2004), and K ̈oszegi (2006) discuss methods agents use to manipulate their
7:169:13019:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:own beliefs that can lead to overconfidence. Yildiz (2003) analyzes the effect of overconfi-
7:170:13111:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:dence in bargaining games. Sandroni and Squintani (2004) propose a model in which over-
7:171:13198:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:confidence affects insurance markets. Manove and Padilla (1999) and Landier and Thesmar
7:172:13285:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(2009) develop models of equilibrium contracts between rational lenders and overoptimistic
7:173:13375:22:22:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:entrepreneurs. Landier and Thesmar (2009) also present evidence that, consistent with their
7:174:13466:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:theory, entrepreneurs who respond with more excessive optimism in a survey also take on
7:175:13553:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:more short term debt. Also focusing on empirical differences in overconfidence across people,

7:177:13735:22:22:72:392:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that they are more overconfident trade stocks more frequently.
7:178:13797:22:22:89:539:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This last paper also belongs to a second literature that is related to the current paper.
7:179:13886:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This second literature studies the effect of cognitive limitations on the behavior of financial
7:180:13981:22:22:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:market participants. This includes, notably, Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam (1998)
7:181:14069:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and Odean (1998), who show that various puzzles in the behavior of stock prices can be
7:182:14155:22:17:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rationalized by the existence of investors who are overconfident about their ability to predict

7:184:14351:16:12:72:540:161:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:if they are overconfident. Their subjects express more willingness to participate in an “investment game,”
7:185:14457:12:12:72:540:149:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and thereby make it more likely that they will receive low payoffs, when the outcome of the game depends
7:186:14561:12:0:72:497:137:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:on their relative skill at a trivia task than when the outcome depends on a randomization device.
8:187:14659:0:22:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the future.8Incorrect predictions about the future play a role in many other papers concerned
8:188:14752:22:22:71:539:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with asset prices, including Barberis, Shleifer and Vishny (1998) and Hong, Stein and Yu
8:189:14840:22:22:71:539:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(2007). Gennaioli, Shleifer and Vishny (2010) show that incorrect beliefs can also lead agents
8:190:14934:22:22:71:539:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to hold new asset classes that appear safe to them because they have not yet become aware
8:191:15023:22:22:71:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of some of their incipient risks. One distinction between this literature and the current paper
8:192:15118:22:22:71:539:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is that I focus on beliefs that people have about their own future actions rather than beliefs
8:193:15212:22:22:71:238:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:they have about external events.
8:194:15244:22:22:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The paper proceeds as follows. The next section introduces my formulation of overcon-
8:195:15329:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fidence into a one period model with certainty. By showing how individuals trade off risk
8:196:15418:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:aversion, which makes demand deposits undesirable, with excessive optimism, this section
8:197:15506:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lays the foundation for the subsequent analysis. Section 2 shows that overconfidence can
8:198:15594:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:make demand deposits emerge in equilibrium in a simple stochastic environment where ev-
8:199:15681:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:eryone starts with an identical endowment whose payoff is stochastic. With two aggregate
8:200:15769:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:states of nature, depositors are fully paid off in the favorable state while there is a run in the
8:201:15867:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unfavorable one. In Section 3, I let bank owners capitalize their banks in order to attract
8:202:15958:22:22:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors and show that they quite generally do it in equilibrium. Section 4 studies policy
8:203:16050:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:interventions that have the potential for raising the averageex postutility of depositors.
8:204:16140:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:These include minimal capital requirements, mandatory clawbacks in bankruptcy, deposit
8:205:16226:22:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:insurance and the regulation of bank assets. Section 5 expands the model to include three
8:206:16315:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:periods so that it is possible to analyze costly withdrawals in the middle period. The sec-
8:207:16406:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tion demonstrates that banks may offer contracts that induce these costly withdrawals in
8:208:16494:22:18:72:334:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:response to bad news. Finally, Section 6 concludes.
8:209:16545:18:15:85:539:242:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:8These papers rely on miscalibration,i.e.,people’s tendency to overstate the precision of their knowledge.
8:210:16651:15:12:72:539:227:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:For direct evidence of miscalibration by financial managers, see Ben-Davidet al.(2010).  Ben-Davidet
8:211:16751:12:12:72:539:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f5:al.(2010) distinguish between miscalibration, which they see as a form of overconfidence, and “optimism”
8:212:16855:12:12:72:540:203:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:regarding the mean exogenous random variables. Following Weinstein (1980), I use the term “optimism”
8:213:16955:12:12:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to describe a different kind of overconfidence, namely people’s excessive confidence in their ability to affect
8:214:17066:12:0:72:202:179:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:their own outcomes favorably.
9:215:17096:0:34:72:485:721:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:1  Queuing Optimism with Aggregate Certainty
9:216:17140:34:22:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To introduce the idea of optimism regarding one’s position in a queue, consider first a general
9:217:17235:22:22:72:539:665:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:setting of rationing. Suppose a firm has givenNindividuals the right to obtain a good at
9:218:17323:22:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a price that is lower than consumers’ valuation of the good. Suppose further that the firm
9:219:17413:22:22:72:539:621:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:has onlyZ < Nunits available and that it has promised to allocate its units to creditors
9:220:17501:22:22:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on a first-come first-served basis, as is common in shortage situations. Then, if creditors are
9:221:17596:22:22:72:539:577:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:symmetric and rational, each of them should each expect to receive it with probabilityZ/N.
9:222:17686:22:22:89:539:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The simplest way to formalize this probabilistic outcome is to suppose that some random
9:223:17773:22:22:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:elements, however insignificant in size, affect creditors’ position in line. Suppose then, that
9:224:17868:22:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creditors’ actual order of arrival depends on the realization they draw of a random variable
9:225:17960:22:21:72:539:489:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:d, with creditors who obtain a lowerdarriving before those who obtain a higher one. One
9:226:18047:21:22:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:interpretation for this is thatdis the distance between a creditor and the firm at the moment
9:227:18140:22:22:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the creditor decides to obtain the good. An alternative interpretation would have all creditors
9:228:18235:22:22:72:539:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:start out at the same distance from the firm, while the outcomedwould represent the inverse
9:229:18326:22:22:72:454:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the speed with which a particular creditor is able to cover this distance.
9:230:18403:22:22:89:540:380:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:LetFbe the cumulative density function ford.  Then, creditors whosedis smaller
9:231:18481:22:22:72:539:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:than or equal toF−1(Z/N) receive the good while others do not. SinceF(d) is distributed
9:232:18568:22:22:71:539:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:uniformly between zero and one, the probability of obtaining such adisZ/N. Since creditors
9:233:18658:22:22:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are affected only by the order in which they arrive, one can equivalently think of them as
9:234:18748:22:22:72:485:292:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:drawing a realization forx=F(d), wherexhas a standard uniform distribution.
9:235:18823:22:22:89:539:270:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Queuing optimism is captured as follows. Each creditor is assumed to correctly believe
9:236:18909:22:22:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that thex’s of other creditors are drawn from a standard uniform distribution. On the other
9:237:19000:22:21:72:539:226:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:hand, creditors believe that their ownxis drawn from a truncated exponential distribution

10:263:19571:22:22:72:539:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:individual with aλequal to one is essentially certain to be the first in line. More generally,
10:264:19665:22:22:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f8:the Appendix shows thatG(x) is strictly increasing inλfor 0< x <1. The parameterλ
10:265:19746:22:22:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is thus a measure of optimism: creditors with higherλ’s are strictly more optimistic about
10:266:19836:22:22:71:540:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that the likelihood that they will be among the first 100x% of creditors to ask for the good.

10:277:20184:22:22:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:probability of being among the firstxrises more rapidly than the actual probability. This
10:278:20273:22:22:72:539:190:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:can be seen by noting thatG′(0) equalsλ/(1−e−λ), which is greater than one forλ >0.
10:279:20356:22:22:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f8:For high values ofx, on the other hand, the subjective probability of being among the firstx
10:280:20448:22:22:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rises more slowly than the actual probability because, as I show below, the Einstein function
10:281:20541:22:0:72:539:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:λe−λ/(1−e−λ) is smaller than one. There thus exists an interior value ofxat whichG′(x) = 1

11:283:20715:22:22:72:110:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:follows.
11:284:20723:22:22:89:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:So far, the analysis applies to any firm that is required to ration its customers.9This
11:285:20810:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bias may be particularly relevant in situations where actual rationing is infrequent, so that
11:286:20903:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:people have not had an opportunity to learn about their actual tendency to be at the front
11:287:20993:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the line. As long as there are only occasional bank runs, the bias should be particularly
11:288:21085:22:22:72:377:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pronounced for the rationing that takes place in these runs.
11:289:21145:22:22:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:While queueing optimism affects people’s subjective probability of receiving funds, it need
11:290:21236:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not affect how creditors value the funds they receive. It is thus consistent with individuals
11:291:21329:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:having a standard expected utility function.  For convenience, suppose that this utility
11:292:21417:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:function takes the CRRA form with relative risk aversion between 0 and -1. Creditors thus
11:293:21506:22:22:72:203:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expect their welfare to be
11:294:21532:22:28:237:540:457:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:Uc= ̄E(Cγ)    0< γ≤1,(3)

11:296:21642:22:21:89:539:407:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To understand the implications of queueing optimism on financial contracts, it is worth
11:297:21729:21:22:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:starting with the simple case where a bank has signed contracts that entitle a continuum of
11:298:21820:22:22:72:539:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creditors of mass one to receive a quantity of fundsYon a first-come first-served basis. The
11:299:21912:22:22:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bank, meanwhile hasZ≤Yfunds available. The bank’s owners are assumed to have limited
11:300:21996:22:22:72:539:320:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:liability so that the bank closes afterZhas been paid out and onlyZ/Yarrive in time to
11:301:22082:22:22:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:receive funds from the bank. The amount that these creditors get to keep, and the amounts
11:302:22171:22:22:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:received by the rest, depend on the legal regime. Under laissez-faire, the government does
11:303:22261:22:22:72:539:254:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not intervene so that theZ/Ycreditors that arrive first keep theYthey obtained from the
11:304:22348:22:22:72:282:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bank and the rest remain empty-handed.
11:305:22386:22:22:89:540:210:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:An alternative is for the government to allow the last 1−Z/Ycreditors to clawback
11:306:22467:22:22:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funds from those who were paid by the bank. In ordinary bankruptcy, payments made up
11:307:22551:22:18:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to 90 days before the filing of bankruptcy (what is known as the “preference period”) are
11:308:22640:18:16:85:539:148:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:9This bias may also help explain why people often favor non-price rationing.  For example, Frey and
11:309:22739:16:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Pommerehne (1993) find that many respondents prefer to distribute a limited supply of water on a first-
11:310:22842:12:0:72:371:120:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:come first-serve rather than using high prices to discourage demand.
12:311:22911:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:potentially subject to such clawbacks. Under many circumstances, creditors that are paid
12:312:22999:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:during the preference period can be forced to return these funds to a bankruptcy trustee,
12:313:23088:22:22:72:298:677:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:who then treats them like other claimants.10
12:314:23132:22:22:89:539:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Suppose first that creditors are rational so that, whenZ≤Y, they each expect to receive
12:315:23219:22:26:72:439:633:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:Yfrom the debtor with probabilityZ/Y. Their expected utility is then
12:316:23287:26:16:292:300:607:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Z
12:317:23288:16:0:292:299:591:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Y

12:319:23295:34:22:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The derivative of this expression with respect toYis (γ−1)ZYγ−2, which is negative if
12:320:23380:22:22:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:γ <1. This means that risk averse creditors would prefer loweringYtowardsZwhenever
12:321:23462:22:22:71:539:521:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:YexceedsZ. They thus strictly prefer a clawback regime that givesZto all creditors. This
12:322:23550:22:22:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:result ought to generalize. WheneverY > Z, laissez-faire leads to a gamble that pays zero
12:323:23639:22:22:72:539:477:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with probability 1−Z/YandYwith the remaining probability. For risk-averse individuals,
12:324:23725:22:21:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this is less desirable than the clawback regime, which pays the expected value of this gamble

13:366:24822:22:21:71:539:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creditors prefer settingYaboveZfor anyγlarger than this critical value and prefer setting

13:368:24996:22:22:71:539:371:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:people to prefer not to have their outcome be determined by their random position in line.
13:369:25086:22:22:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:However, there is now a counteracting force, namely thatλ >0 leads people to be confident

13:391:25643:25:16:81:540:136:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:11While the functionUcneed not be globally concave inY, a straightforward calculation establishes that

14:393:25843:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The optimum thus requires that the ratio ofZtoYo, which is the probability that depositors

14:396:26049:22:22:89:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:While (7) implies that creditors prefer a payment ofYoto one ofZ, they do not prefer the
14:397:26137:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:laissez faire outcome for allYhigher thanYo. This is seen in (5), which implies that the limit

14:399:26318:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:aversion at all, there exist values ofYlarge enough that creditors prefer the certain clawback

14:401:26496:22:22:72:539:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is satisfied, there is a maximum value ofYsuch that people would find the laissez faire
14:402:26583:22:22:72:539:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:outcome acceptable relative to the clawback outcome. At this value ofY, denoted byYm,
14:403:26668:22:22:72:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creditors are indifferent between havingZfor sure or the laissez faire outcome. Therefore,

14:416:26852:27:22:72:539:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The variablerm(γ, λ) represents the minimum probability of a distribution ofYthat creditors

14:418:27032:22:22:71:539:337:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whereas it is lower if (7) is satisfied. This condition also implies thatrmis smaller thanro,

14:420:27218:22:31:71:447:293:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:leads to indifference. Differentiating the second equation in (10), we have

14:424:27519:22:22:71:438:186:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:changes in parameters induce a greater desire to participate in a queue.
14:425:27591:22:22:89:539:164:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Before closing this section, it is worth discussing the implicit assumption that the amount
14:426:27682:22:22:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a creditor is paid depends only on whether the bank is able to pay the creditor with its existing
14:427:27779:22:0:72:540:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funds, and does not otherwise depend on a creditor’s position in line. This assumption turns
15:428:27873:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:out to be restrictive, in the sense that households wouldex anteprefer a more flexible
15:429:27959:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contract. To see this, imagine a contract that paysy(x) to the household that arrives right
15:430:28050:22:22:72:539:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:after a fractionxof households have received their required payments from the bank. Since
15:431:28139:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:each household believes that its probability of being among the firstxto claim funds is
15:432:28226:22:18:72:413:633:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:G(x, λ), its expected utility from an arrangement that paysy(x) is

15:443:28456:34:21:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:where this equation takes into account that allx’s are in fact equally likely and assures that

15:445:28638:22:28:72:266:432:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:subject to this constraint implies that

15:455:28791:21:22:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to regardx1as having more density thanx2, creditors’ expected utility is higher if the bank
15:456:28882:22:22:72:539:319:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:makes somewhat larger payments to the creditor that shows up in positionx1. I neglect such
15:457:28972:22:22:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contracts for two related reasons. The first is that the contracts we observe do not appear
15:458:29063:22:22:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to have the property that different people who request funds while the bank remains open
15:459:29151:22:22:72:212:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are treated asymmetrically.
15:460:29178:22:22:89:539:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The second reason to neglect these more elaborate contracts is that their enforcement
15:461:29263:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:requires the dissemination of a great deal of information, and this is likely to be either costly
15:462:29360:22:22:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f8:or impossible. At the very least, they require that an individual who arrives in positionx
15:463:29450:22:22:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be able to demonstrate this position to the courts that enforce this contract. The first-come
15:464:29543:22:22:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:first-served contract requires less hard information. All that needs to be verifiable for this
15:465:29637:22:0:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contract to be enforceable is whether the bank still has sufficient funds at the moment the
16:466:29730:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:individual shows up, and whether the individual is in fact paid the fixed quantity stipulated
16:467:29823:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the contract. One thing that is not required, in particular, is for people who are paid to
16:468:29916:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:either know or be able to prove to others the quantity of funds available to the bank. When
16:469:30007:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the bank runs out of funds, it needs to prove that its funds have been properly used. This,
16:470:30098:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:however, is a single tally, which needs to be audited just once, as opposed to a running tally
16:471:30192:22:22:72:218:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:after each individual is paid.
16:472:30222:22:22:89:539:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:One can rationalize a contract whose payment is constant with the following set of strong
16:473:30311:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assumptions. Suppose it is impossible to keep track of the number of people who have been
16:474:30400:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:paid already. Suppose further that the firm must pay a fixed cost every time it verifies the
16:475:30492:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:current state of its assets. This verification process also checks whether all payments that
16:476:30584:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have been made to date are legitimate repayments to creditors. This verification process
16:477:30672:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:leaves behind hard evidence that can be shown to an outside party. Moreover, once hard
16:478:30758:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:evidence exists that the bank has no further assets, it is common knowledge that the bank
16:479:30847:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:has zero assets from then on. Once a creditor arrives at the bank, the order of moves is the
16:480:30939:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:following. First, the bank makes a payment to the creditor. Then, if the creditor receives
16:481:31029:22:22:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:any less than the maximum amount he is entitled to under a contract, he forces the bank
16:482:31116:22:22:72:539:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to verify its level of current assets (unless this is already known to be zero).12If the fixed
16:483:31210:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cost of verification is sufficiently large, the bank avoids all but one verification by setting its
16:484:31309:22:18:72:501:326:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:contractual payment to a constant and waiting to verify until it runs out of funds.13
16:485:31394:18:15:81:539:308:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:12This assumption fits broadly with the idea in Rotemberg (2008) that an agent who is “upset” lashes out
16:486:31498:15:12:72:540:293:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:at the individual he is upset with. In the current context, individuals who are disappointed at the amount
16:487:31604:12:9:72:528:281:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:they receive can then be thought of as going to a judge who, in turn, forces the bank to verify its assets.
16:488:31711:9:15:81:539:272:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:13There is some similarity between these assumptions and those used in the costly state verification
16:489:31811:15:12:72:540:257:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:literature pioneered by Townsend (1975). Both have in common that no verification costs have to be paid
16:490:31914:12:12:72:540:245:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:if the firm had sufficient funds to fulfill all its obligations. One difference is that I have emphasized the
16:491:32023:12:12:72:540:233:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:difficulties in verifying a firm’s current assets in a context where payments are made in sequence while the
16:492:32131:12:12:72:540:221:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the costly state verification literature supposes that, at a cost, it is possible to know the total resources that
16:493:32245:12:12:72:540:209:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the firm has available before it distributes any of them. As a result, the allocation in the case where the
16:494:32352:12:12:72:540:197:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:state is verified treats all debt claimants symmetrically. The resulting allocation often coincides with what
16:495:32461:12:0:72:234:185:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:I have termed the clawback outcome.
17:496:32498:0:34:72:427:721:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:2  Deposit contracts with no bank equity
17:497:32538:34:22:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:There are now two periods labeled 0 and 2 (a third period, period 1, will be added below).
17:498:32628:22:22:72:540:665:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The people who are alive at time 0 have utility functions that depend only on the consump-
17:499:32718:22:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tion in period 2. Each of these individuals has an endowment of one unit of an asset called
17:500:32809:22:22:72:538:621:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f11:Kand this asset pays off in period 2. The payoff of each unit ofKis random: it equalsZH
17:501:32896:22:22:71:496:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the high state (which occurs with probabilityπ) and equalsZLin the low state.
17:502:32976:22:22:89:539:577:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:There are two types of individuals. One group consists of potential creditors, and these
17:503:33064:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creditors have the utility function given by (3) with risk aversion coefficient (1−γ). Under
17:504:33156:22:22:72:215:533:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:autarky, their utility level is
17:505:33187:22:28:243:540:511:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:Uca=πZγH+ (1−π)ZγL.(12)
17:506:33210:28:22:89:539:483:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The other group consists of potential bank owners. These have utility functions given
17:507:33295:22:22:72:84:461:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by
17:508:33297:22:28:238:540:439:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:Ub= ̄E(Cξb)    0< ξ≤1,(13)

17:510:33409:22:22:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is identical to the utility function of creditors ifξ=γ. The case where the two types
17:511:33499:22:22:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have the same utility function is particularly interesting because, since they also have the
17:512:33591:22:22:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:same endowment, it leaves them without any standard motivation for trading with one
17:513:33674:22:22:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:another. Below, I also consider the more traditional case where bankers are risk neutral (so
17:514:33766:22:22:72:298:301:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thatξ= 1) while creditors are risk averseγ.
17:515:33809:22:22:89:539:279:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Groups of 1/ωbank owners can offer contracts to a unit mass of creditors. These contracts
17:516:33898:22:22:72:539:257:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:stipulate the amountYthat the bank will distribute in period 2 on a first-come first-served
17:517:33989:22:21:72:539:235:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:basis to any creditor who has “deposited” their unit ofKin period 0.  I consider only
17:518:34074:21:22:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contracts where the contractual paymentYis independent of the state of nature.  This
17:519:34158:22:22:71:539:192:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assumption, which reduces the attractiveness of the contract relative to laissez-faire, can
17:520:34249:22:22:71:539:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be justified by supposing that the state is not verifiable at the time that individuals start
17:521:34342:22:22:71:177:148:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:making withdrawals.
17:522:34361:22:0:89:539:126:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Bank owners compete for depositors and I capture this by supposing that the equilib-
18:523:34447:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rium contract maximizes the expected utility of creditors subject to the constraint that bank
18:524:34540:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:owners are no worse off than they are under autarky. As I show in the next section, this com-
18:525:34633:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:petition among potential bank owners can lead them to assign some of their own endowment
18:526:34721:22:22:72:230:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ofKas equity into their bank.
18:527:34750:22:22:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:For simplicity, this section ignores such equity infusions. This can be rationalized by
18:528:34837:22:22:72:539:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:supposing thatωis very large so that bank owners have only a trivial endowment relative
18:529:34924:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to the deposits at their bank. In terms of modern-day institutions, the analysis without
18:530:35012:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bank capital corresponds most closely to the analysis of money market mutual funds, whose
18:531:35101:22:22:72:384:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:managers receive fees but do not invest in an equity cushion.
18:532:35162:22:22:89:539:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This section studies whether bank contracts give more expected utility to potential de-
18:533:35249:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:positors than autarky. This is a nontrivial question because banks without capital do not
18:534:35338:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:change the aggregate that depositors consume in any given state of nature.  Their only
18:535:35424:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:role is to redistribute funds from some creditors to others. Nonetheless, I demonstrate that
18:536:35516:21:22:72:490:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creditors prefer to give their endowment to banks for broad ranges of parameters.
18:537:35597:22:22:89:539:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I consider two cases. In the first, banks are not allowed to setYaboveZH. One reason
18:538:35681:22:22:71:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this case is interesting is that a contract that offers a payment aboveZHin period 2 is in
18:539:35771:22:22:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:some sense fraudulent, since there is no state of nature where the bank would be able to
18:540:35859:22:22:71:465:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fully honor it. Limiting the payment toZHeliminates this promissory fraud.
18:541:35933:22:22:89:539:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:One can interpret this limitation as fitting broadly with the government’s prohibition
18:542:36019:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that money market mutual funds pay their shareholders more than the ”net asset value”
18:543:36104:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the fund. Money market funds in the U.S. are regulated pursuant the 1940 Investment
18:544:36190:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Company Act, which specifies both the assets that a mutual fund may hold and the maximum
18:545:36278:22:22:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:amounts that it can pay to investors who wish to redeem their shares. Rule 2a-7 of the
18:546:36364:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Investment Company Act of 1940 stipulates that Money Market Funds are allowed to value
18:547:36450:22:21:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:their assets using the “Amortized Cost Method of Valuation.” As Rule 2a-7 puts it, this
18:548:36537:21:22:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:method values assets at their “acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or
18:549:36627:22:22:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:accretion of discount rather than at their value based on current market factors.” One can
18:550:36717:22:0:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thus interpret this rule as saying that money market funds are allowed to make payments
19:551:36806:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:based on optimistic assessments of returns, which corresponds toZH. The result, of course,
19:552:36896:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is that less favorable outcomes lead the market value of the funds’ assets (in dollars) to be
19:553:36989:22:22:72:305:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lower than the number of shares outstanding.
19:554:37033:22:22:89:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Within the context of the model itself, allowing payments of more thanZHin period 2
19:555:37116:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is worse forex postaverage depositor welfare than restricting them so they are no larger
19:556:37204:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thanZH. This could lead the government to prohibit contractual obligations that exceed
19:557:37290:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the bank’s maximum possible resources. Nonetheless, I also consider the case where banks
19:558:37378:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are free to set any payment that they wish. Part of the interest in doing this is that, even
19:559:37470:22:22:72:539:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:when banks have this freedom, the equilibrium contract has a payment equal toZHunder
19:560:37554:22:22:71:165:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:certain conditions.
19:561:37573:22:22:89:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A payment ofZHgives the same utility in the high state as both the clawback outcome
19:562:37656:22:22:72:539:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and autarky. For potential creditors to prefer bank contracts with required payments ofZH,
19:563:37746:22:25:72:499:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:these contracts must give more expected utility in the low state. This requires that

19:583:38222:32:21:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f1:Proof.Because (15) requires thatn(λ)< γ, it implies that potential depositors prefer to be
19:584:38312:21:22:72:538:171:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:paid more thanZLin the low state. Ifγwere equal to log((1−e−λr)/(1−e−λ))/log(r),ZH
19:585:38394:22:22:72:539:149:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:would equalZL/rm. A necessary and sufficient condition for (14) to be true is thus thatγbe
19:586:38484:22:0:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:greater than this. Thus, in the low state, depositors prefer a payment ofZHto a payment
20:587:38573:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ofZL. With a payment ofZH, depositors are indifferent in the high state between the bank
20:588:38661:22:22:71:539:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contract and autarky. When the state is unknown at time 0, depositors are thus strictly
20:589:38748:22:22:71:470:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:better off with a bank contract that offers a paymentZHthan under autarky.
20:590:38822:22:22:89:539:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:If depositors prefer a payment belowZH, banks would offer such a payment. Depositors
20:591:38906:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:would still prefer this contract to autarky even though it would lead bank owners to make
20:592:38995:22:31:72:240:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:positive profits in the high state.
20:593:39030:31:22:89:539:580:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The restriction thatY≤ZHgenerally reduces the attractiveness of deposit contracts.
20:594:39112:22:22:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Under some additional conditions, however, banks would want to offer a contract with a

21:645:40264:32:22:72:539:667:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f1:Proof.I first show that (18) defines a nontrivial region. Because thenfunction decreases
21:646:40352:22:22:71:540:645:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in its argument,n(λ)< n(λr). If the second inequality in (18) were to hold as an equality,
21:647:40442:22:22:71:539:623:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:rwould be equal ton−1(γ)/λ. Creditors would then get more utility fromZL/rthan from
21:648:40525:22:26:71:454:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:receiving a payment ofZLin the low state. It would then be the case that
21:649:40597:26:16:263:305:575:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:1−e−λr
21:650:40603:16:0:265:303:559:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:1−e−λ
21:651:40608:0:34:306:349:567:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:r−γ>1.
21:652:40614:34:22:89:540:533:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Taking logarithms on both sides, and noticing thatr <1, so that the logarithm ofris
21:653:40697:22:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:negative, establishes thatγis then strictly larger than log((1−e−λr)/(1−e−λ))/log(r). The
21:654:40786:22:22:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:left hand side of (18) is thus strictly smaller than the right hand side, so that values ofγthat
21:655:40882:22:21:71:539:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:satisfy (18) can always be found. As we saw in Proposition (1), the first inequality in (18)
21:656:40974:21:22:71:540:446:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:implies that creditors prefer the contract that paysZHto autarky. When this inequality is
21:657:41063:22:22:71:540:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:violated, a contract withZHis less desirable than autarky because it gives lower utility in
21:658:41154:22:22:71:336:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the low state and the same utility in the high state.
21:659:41207:22:22:89:540:380:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The second inequality in (18) implies that the numerator ofψis positive so that the left
21:660:41295:22:22:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:hand side of (19) is between zero and one. In addition, (7) implies thatγ−n(λ) is positive
21:661:41385:22:22:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:so that the right hand side is both larger than the left hand side and between zero and 1.
21:662:41475:22:22:72:531:314:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As a result, there exists a nonempty set of values ofπsatisfying both inequalities in (19).

22:732:42430:22:30:71:339:475:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:inequality in (19) is necessary and sufficient for this.
22:733:42486:30:22:89:540:445:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The second inequality in (18) requires thatrbe smaller thann−1(γ)/λso thatZHhas to
22:734:42568:22:22:72:539:423:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be greater thanZL/ro. The reason this is needed is that (7) implies that creditors prefer a
22:735:42659:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:payment larger thanZHin the high state. IfZHwere lower thanZL/ro, they would prefer it
22:736:42745:22:22:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the low state as well, and the result would be thatZHwould not be the optimal payment
22:737:42833:22:22:71:540:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:level. The fact that, at the equilibrium contract,ZHcan be “too large” in the low state
22:738:42920:22:22:71:301:335:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:plays a key role in some of the results below.
22:739:42966:22:22:89:540:313:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Whenγis close to the upper limit defined by (18),ψis close to zero so thatπhas to be
22:740:43050:22:22:71:540:291:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:close to zero as well. The reason is thatZHis nearly ideal forZLso that, if the probability
22:741:43141:22:22:71:539:269:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ofZHwere substantial, creditors would prefer a higher payment. Asγis reduced below its
22:742:43227:22:22:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:upper limit,ψrises and the acceptable values ofπrise. There is a limit, however, to the
22:743:43314:22:22:71:540:225:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:size ofπ, Since creditors would like the payment to exceedZHwhen the state is high, the
22:744:43401:22:21:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:probability of the high state cannot be large. This is illustrated in Figure 3, which depicts

23:766:43816:34:22:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Before committing to deposit their funds at a bank, potential creditors are assumed to
23:767:43902:22:22:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:observe the bank’s equity.14This equity consists ofk≥0 units ofKper depositor that
23:768:43984:22:21:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the bank owners have “invested” in their bank. The proceeds from these investments are
23:769:44070:21:22:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:available to pay depositors in period 2. A bank with equitykwhose contract offersYis

23:772:44325:22:22:71:540:268:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:owners in proportion to their initial contributions. If (1 +k)ZL=Y, depositors are fully
23:773:44413:22:22:71:540:246:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:insured against the state. I restrict attention to contracts with (1 +k)ZL≤Y. This is
23:774:44498:22:22:71:540:224:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:without loss of generality because increasingkbeyond this point does not have any effect

23:776:44673:22:18:71:236:180:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from the additional units ofK).
23:777:44704:18:16:81:539:162:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:14Because each bank ends up with a volume of creditors equal to one, creditors can determine the amount of
23:778:44810:16:12:72:540:146:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:capital that each bank has per creditor (or deposit). An alternative formulation would have banks announce
23:779:44916:12:0:72:540:134:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:their capital per unit of deposits and impose a mechanism that ensures compliance with this announcement.

24:785:45311:29:21:89:539:604:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Bank owners have a concave utility function so they benefit from sharing the investment
24:786:45398:21:22:72:539:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ofkequally among themselves. This means that the owners of a bank with equitykhave to

24:793:45913:22:22:72:539:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the high state for givenY. By the same token, creditors benefit from a higherkin the low

24:795:46089:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital infusions are possible, the equilibrium utility of bank owners cannot exceed their
24:796:46179:22:21:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:utility under autarky. The reason is that it would then be possible to increase the utility of
24:797:46273:21:22:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors by raisingkwhile still giving bank ownersUba. As a result, the equilibrium must

26:910:48727:22:22:71:539:580:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of (18) and (19), the insurance is offered because creditors in the low state would prefer a
26:911:48819:22:22:71:539:558:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lower value ofY. This motivation for insurance remains valid when banks are not allowed to

26:914:49060:22:22:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As might be expected, this willingness of bankers to insure depositors by infusing equity

26:916:49237:21:22:71:539:449:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this case is whether bank owners would then fully insure their depositors by placing sufficient

26:919:49509:22:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:this in both states of nature. Since banks only have (1 +k)ZLin the low state, (1 +k)ZL
26:920:49596:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:must equal the expected value ofZias well.  This is possible only if bank owners have
26:921:49681:22:22:71:540:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sufficient resources. When bank owners stake their entire endowment as equity,kequals
26:922:49766:22:34:72:485:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1/ω. Therefore, bank owners have sufficient resources to provide full insurance if

28:1012:52923:32:22:72:539:347:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f1:Proof.The conditions of this proposition imply that potential creditors deposit their endow-
28:1013:53015:22:22:72:537:325:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f8:ment and thatk >0 in equilibrium. Since (24) holds, the equilibrium is interior anddUc/dY
28:1014:53104:22:22:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:in (23) equals zero. ThereforeUcY+Uckφ′= 0, whereUcYandUckare both positive.Ex
28:1015:53182:22:22:71:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f1:postaverage utility would increase by raisingkifˆUcY+ ̃Uckφ′were negative. The first term
28:1016:53271:22:22:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of ̃UcYis smaller than the first term ofUcybecause (1−e−λ(1+k)ZL/Y)/(1−e−λ) is larger
28:1017:53356:22:24:71:508:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:than (1 +k)ZL/Y. Thus, a sufficient condition for ̃UcY+ ̃Uckφ′to be negative is that
28:1018:53440:24:16:259:326:213:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f11:λe−λ(1+k)ZL/Y

28:1020:53458:0:63:332:353:205:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:<1.
28:1021:53461:63:22:89:540:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The ratio (1 +k)Zl/Ygives the actual probability that depositors receiveYin the low
28:1022:53544:22:0:72:540:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:state. This proposition thus says that, if this probability is above the value given by the
29:1023:53637:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:right hand side of (26),ex postutility is increased by raising the capital of banks above its
29:1024:53730:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:equilibrium value. The value of (1 +k)ZL/Ythat satisfies (26) with equality is the value of
29:1025:53821:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:xthat leadsG′(x) in (2) to equal one. In other words, it is the value ofxsuch the subjective
29:1026:53913:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:probability of being among the firstxhas a slope of one with respect tox, just as does
29:1027:53999:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the true probability. The second equation in (2) implies that the slope of the subjective
29:1028:54088:22:22:72:433:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:probability is larger for smaller values ofxand smaller for larger ones.
29:1029:54160:22:22:89:539:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This result has the following interpretation: One important benefit of raisingkwhile re-
29:1030:54248:22:22:72:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ducingYis that depositors have an increased probability of receivingYrather than nothing.
29:1031:54337:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:For (1 +k)Zl/Yabove the value on the RHS of (26), however, the subjective probability of
29:1032:54425:22:22:72:539:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:receivingYrises less than the objective probability so that depositors perceive this benefit
29:1033:54517:22:22:72:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:as being smaller than it is. As a result, they end up better off on average ifkis increased
29:1034:54608:22:22:72:438:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(andYreduced) relative to the contract that they find most attractive.
29:1035:54678:22:21:89:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:SincekandYare determined in equilibrium, condition (26) does not apply directly to
29:1036:54760:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the exogenous parameters. However, becausek >0 andY < ZH, (1+k)ZL/Yis necessarily
29:1037:54841:22:22:71:539:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:larger than the exogenous ratioZL/ZHso a stronger sufficient condition than (26) involves
29:1038:54930:22:22:71:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:puttingZL/ZHon the left hand side. Even in this stronger form, condition (26) is not very
29:1039:55019:22:22:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:demanding. Figure 4 demonstrates this by depicting the value on the RHS of (26) for various
29:1040:55110:22:22:71:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:values ofλ. Its limit is .5 forλarbitrarily low and then falls steadily asλrises. This is
29:1041:55199:22:22:71:539:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:consistent with the fact that, for high values ofλthe probability of being among the first
29:1042:55289:22:22:71:540:304:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:xis close to one even ifxis small, so thatG′(x) becomes smaller than one for quite small
29:1043:55377:22:22:71:129:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:values ofx.
29:1044:55388:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Even when (26) is satisfied, depositors oppose capital requirements that raisek, since they
29:1045:55479:22:34:72:346:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:obtain the contract they most like under laissez faire.

29:1047:55570:30:22:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A second policy choice is to treat financial contracts like non-financial ones and subject them
29:1048:55665:22:22:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to clawback in bankruptcy. This would mean that depositors who arrive after all the funds

30:1070:56303:22:22:71:539:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is thus the same as under autarky even if bank owners are allowed to add capital to their
30:1071:56392:22:22:71:539:230:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:banks. The end result of this is that a policy of clawbacks essentially eliminates the incentive
30:1072:56488:22:22:71:539:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to deposit in a bank, though this result obviously depends crucially on my assumption that
30:1073:56578:22:22:71:355:186:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:everyone is endowed with the same asset to begin with.
30:1074:56632:22:22:89:539:164:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Now consider a policy of offering deposit insurance, which is financed by lump sum taxes
30:1075:56720:22:22:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on those individuals who are potential depositors. Since creditors take taxes as given, outlays
30:1076:56815:22:0:72:540:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from the deposit insurance scheme raise the attractiveness of deposits. Indeed, deposits with
31:1077:56910:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:insurance are more attractive than either autarky or the outcome with clawbacks as long as

31:1079:57082:22:22:89:539:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:All the taxes that pay for the insurance are assumed to come from the depositors them-
31:1080:57168:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:selves, however. Depositor consumption in the high state is thus equal toY, whereYis the
31:1081:57256:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:amount bank owners pay out in this state. Similarly, depositor consumption in the low state

31:1083:57427:22:22:72:539:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expected utility of depositors is once again given by (27) as long asYis interpreted as the
31:1084:57518:22:22:72:392:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:amount the government takes from the bank in the high state.

31:1086:57668:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with my assumption that only potential depositors are taxed, (21) must still hold. When

31:1089:57926:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:welfare.  When financed in this way, the best deposit insurance outcome is the autarkic

31:1092:58087:30:22:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Since the economy considered so far has a single productive asset, it has to be modified to

31:1094:58270:22:21:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets. In this subsection, I examine a particularly simple modification for this purpose. I
31:1095:58362:21:22:72:538:306:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:introduce an alternate asset that is similar toKin the sense that it has a payoff ofZH+dZU
31:1096:58452:22:22:72:539:284:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:with probabilityπ+dπand a payoffZL+dZLwith probability 1−π−dπwheredZH,dZL
31:1097:58525:22:22:71:540:262:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:anddπare all small. AssetKcan be converted into this alternative asset, but there are
31:1098:58610:22:22:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:some restrictions. First, individuals who manage their own asset can only convert either
31:1099:58698:22:22:71:540:218:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:their entire endowment or none of it. Second, banks can convert theirKinto the alternative
31:1100:58788:22:22:71:539:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:asset but can only do it if they convert all the assets in their possession. Moreover, I require
31:1101:58884:22:22:71:539:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors to either hand over their entire endowment to a bank or to keep it all themselves.
31:1102:58977:22:22:89:539:152:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:These rather strong assumptions ensure that no one can hold a diversified portfolio,
31:1103:59061:22:0:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and thereby simplify the analysis considerably. In particular, they make it easy to state a
32:1104:59154:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:condition under which the alternative asset would be undesirable to depositors if they were
32:1105:59245:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to hold it directly. Using the autarkic utility (12), and supposing thatdZH,dZLanddπare
32:1106:59332:22:31:71:440:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:small enough that they affect utility only to first order, this condition is

33:1246:61791:22:22:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Proposition’s proof also establishes that, assuming (15) holds, the first inequality in (19)
33:1247:61883:22:22:72:539:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:implies thatYis no lower thanZH. Thus, the conditions of the proposition imply that (29)

33:1249:62055:22:21:89:539:354:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The first inequality in (31) implies thatd ̃Uc>0. The inequality with the first term of

33:1251:62231:22:22:71:539:311:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:negative. I first demonstrate that the left hand side of (31) is always smaller than the first
33:1252:62325:22:22:71:540:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:term of the min operator. The former is actually the same as the latter withγset to equal
33:1253:62414:22:22:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:one. For the left hand side of (31) to be smaller, the derivative ofγ/(r−γ−1) with respect
33:1254:62504:22:22:71:540:245:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:toγbe negative. The expression tends to 1/log(1/r) whenγtends to zero while it equals

34:1262:62883:0:22:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:impossible because the derivative of the numerator with respect toγequals−γ2(log(r))2r−γ,

34:1264:62998:22:22:89:539:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I now prove that the left hand side of (31) is smaller than the second term of the min

34:1275:63656:22:22:72:487:450:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:equals zero. As a result,x/(1−e−x) is monotone increasing fromx= 0 onwards.
34:1276:63731:22:22:89:540:428:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The first inequality of (32) implies that alternate assets with this property lead tod ̃Uc>0
34:1277:63823:22:22:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:while the second inequality ensures that they satisfy (28). The numerator of the left hand

34:1288:64463:22:22:71:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:carried out, this turned out to be true whenever (1−e−λr)r−γ>(1−e−λ) as required by

34:1291:64681:30:22:89:539:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Proposition 6 shows that there are two broad ways of raisingex postwelfare by changing
34:1292:64767:22:0:72:540:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the characteristics of bank assets. They both involve increasing the probabilityπof realizing
35:1293:64862:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a favorable outcome. In the first, depositors give up some payoff in the low state by lowering
35:1294:64956:22:22:72:539:699:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:ZL, while in the latter they give upZH. If the rise inπis sufficiently modest, utility would fall
35:1295:65053:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:if the assets were held directly by depositors and perceived utility from having the alternate
35:1296:65147:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets at the bank would fall as well. It is nonetheless possible to raiseex postaverage welfare
35:1297:65243:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:because lowering the probability of the low state reduces an inefficiency. This inefficiency is
35:1298:65338:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the result of the fact that depositors are not all treated the same in a bank run. Depositors,
35:1299:65432:22:22:72:539:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:of course, are attracted to this difference in treatment even though it is bad for themex

35:1301:65526:40:22:72:540:527:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:5  A three period model with the potential for costly
35:1302:65579:22:33:101:222:505:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:asset transfers
35:1303:65594:33:22:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I maintain the assumption that creditors can deposit their endowment at a bank in period
35:1304:65682:22:22:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:0 and that they care only about consumption in period 2. The key issue I take up in this
35:1305:65770:22:22:72:539:428:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:section is the effect of permitting the assetKto be reassigned, at a cost, before it yieldsZi.
35:1306:65864:22:22:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This transfer (or liquidation) is allowed to occur in period 1. As in Allen and Gale (1998),
35:1307:65956:22:22:72:539:384:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this is the period where uncertainty about the realization ofZiin period 2 is resolved. Even
35:1308:66048:22:22:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:though I suppose that no depositor wishes to consume in this period, I show that depositors
35:1309:66139:22:22:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:may choose bank contracts that allow them to withdraw from their bank account in period
35:1310:66226:22:22:72:81:318:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1.
35:1311:66228:22:22:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To make the cost of these withdrawals transparent, I introduce a new class of agents
35:1312:66312:22:22:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which I call arbitrageurs. For simplicity, arbitrageurs live only in period 1 and 2. They are
35:1313:66405:22:22:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:born with a substantial endowmentMof a good that they can consume in period 1. This
35:1314:66488:22:21:72:539:230:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:good is called good 1, with good 2 representing the good that is produced byK. The utility
35:1315:66578:21:34:72:282:209:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:function of arbitrageurs is assumed to be
35:1316:66619:34:33:265:540:175:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:Ua=C1a+C2a,(33)
35:1317:66634:33:22:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whereCiarepresents their consumption of goodiin periodi. Arbitrageurs are thus willing
35:1318:66720:22:0:72:539:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to buy assetKin period 1 for a price that equals the yield they expect to receive from this
36:1319:66813:0:22:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:asset in period 2. When controlled by arbitrageurs, this yield isρZiin statei. The constant
36:1320:66904:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:ρ≤1 captures the idea that the transfer of control between a bank and an arbitrageur is
36:1321:66991:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costly, perhaps because some knowledge about how to manage the asset is lost in the process.
36:1322:67083:22:22:89:539:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Arbitrageurs are also assumed to be able to credibly pledge assetKto agents that give
36:1323:67168:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:them units of good 1.  The existence of arbitrageurs makes it possible for banks to give
36:1324:67256:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors units of good 1 that banks obtain by selling units of assetK. These depositors
36:1325:67345:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:can then turn to arbitrageurs, and offer them the units of good 1 they obtained from their
36:1326:67435:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bank in exchange for promises to receive good 2. Competition among arbitrageurs ensures
36:1327:67522:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that the price in terms of good 1 for a unit of good 2 is one. The result is that, if banks
36:1328:67613:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:offer deposit contracts with a promised payment ofY1in period 1, those depositors who
36:1329:67698:22:22:72:528:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:successfully withdraw their funds in period 1 obtainY1units of consumption in period 2.
36:1330:67785:22:22:89:539:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The critical question is whether equilibrium contracts offered by banks allow depositors
36:1331:67873:22:21:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to withdraw funds in period 1. It is a nontrivial question because, whenρ <1, period 1
36:1332:67959:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:withdrawals costs resources. It turns out that there are two different reasons for equilibrium
36:1333:68053:22:22:72:318:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:deposit contracts to be demandable in period 1.
36:1334:68100:22:22:89:539:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:First, depositors may have more queue optimism in period 1, right after information
36:1335:68183:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:about the state becomes available, than in period 2. The idea here is not that depositors are
36:1336:68276:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:particularly well informed, only that they might see themselves as reacting more promptly
36:1337:68365:22:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:than others to public information. The example of the 2007 run on Northern Rock, a UK
36:1338:68450:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bank dedicated to mortgages, may be useful for illustration. Northern Rock financed many
36:1339:68538:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of its mortgages in public securities markets, and the cost of this funding rose through
36:1340:68626:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2007 with the result that its stock price halved between January and September 1, 2007.
36:1341:68713:22:22:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Lines of depositors wishing to withdraw funds did not form until September 15, the day
36:1342:68799:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:after the Bank of England first pledged that it would support Northern Rock with its own
36:1343:68887:22:21:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funds. This does not demonstrate that depositors would not continue to be optimistic about
36:1344:68977:21:22:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:withdrawals if their deposits did not allow them to obtain their funds on demand at all times.
36:1345:69071:22:22:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:It is, however, consistent with the possibility that depositors may be particularly optimistic
36:1346:69165:22:0:72:366:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:regarding their capacity to react quickly to public events.
37:1347:69226:0:22:89:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Imagine, then, that depositors have a subjective probability that they will be among the
37:1348:69314:22:22:72:539:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:firstxto withdraw in the low state equal toG(x) in period 1 and equal toxin period 2.
37:1349:69399:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Suppose, further, that we restrict attention to banks that put up no capital and to contracts
37:1350:69492:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that promise a payment ofZHin period 2. If the contracts does not give a depositor access
37:1351:69581:22:17:71:446:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to funds in period 1, the depositors expected utility from the contracts is

37:1373:70347:22:32:71:424:334:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f17:preferred by depositors to the contract that gives only the latter right.
37:1374:70420:32:22:71:540:302:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f1:Proof.The Appendix proves thatG(x) is strictly increasing inλ, which implies that the
37:1375:70505:22:22:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:right hand side of (35) is smaller than one. As a result, there exist values ofρ <1 satisfying

37:1377:70615:22:22:89:539:236:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The conditions of the proposition imply that, if banks were unable to offer payments in
37:1378:70702:22:22:72:539:214:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:period 1, the equilibrium contract would have a payment ofZH. The modified contract that
37:1379:70790:22:21:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:allows withdrawals ofρZHin period 1 does not create runs in period 1 if the state is high
37:1380:70879:21:22:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:because depositors have nothing to lose by waiting until period 2. The only equilibrium in
37:1381:70969:22:22:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the low state with the modified contract involves a run. If a depositor expects all others
37:1382:71059:22:0:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to withdraw, he should run too because otherwise he gets nothing.  Even if no one else
38:1383:71147:0:22:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:withdraws, an individual withdrawing in the low state getsρZHwhile he would only expect

38:1385:71318:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(ρZH)γwhile that of the latter is (ZL/ZH)ZγHso the former is larger than the latter if (35)

38:1387:71415:22:22:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Since the modified contract gives the same utility as the original one in the high state, it
38:1388:71507:22:23:72:411:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is preferable if it gives more utility in the low state. This occurs if

38:1396:71632:30:22:89:539:519:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This proposition thus shows that, if optimism exists only about withdrawals in period
38:1397:71717:22:22:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1, certain contracts that allow withdrawals at time 1 will be preferred to contracts that are
38:1398:71810:22:22:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:otherwise identical but allow withdrawals only in period 2. This idea should also extend
38:1399:71898:22:22:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to more elaborate contracts than those considered in the proposition.  I do not consider
38:1400:71986:22:22:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the issue further because it turns out that there is also a subtler reason for contracts that
38:1401:72079:22:22:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:allow withdrawals in period 1 to dominate those that do not. Allowing for these withdrawals
38:1402:72170:22:22:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:has the advantage of allowing contractual terms to be modified to suit the queuing bias of
38:1403:72260:22:22:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors. Instead of being forced to make a single contractual payment in both states of
38:1404:72350:22:21:72:475:343:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nature, banks can offer a payment in period 1 that is tailored to the low state.
38:1405:72430:21:22:89:539:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To show that this is valuable on its own, I now let depositors be equally optimistic about

38:1414:72859:22:22:72:538:164:12:g_d0_f17:8:g_d0_f11:that satisfy (36), the equilibrium contract offers depositors a choice between withdrawingZH

39:1417:73084:0:22:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f17:12:g_d0_f1:Proof.The right hand side of (36) gives the ratio ofUcin the low state when resources equal

39:1443:73940:22:22:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:state because depositors run to the bank in period 1. The reason they withdraw their funds
39:1444:74030:22:22:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in this state is that, whether others withdraw their funds or not, they thereby guarantee
39:1445:74119:22:22:72:398:413:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:themselves a higher level of utility than they obtain by waiting.
39:1446:74184:22:22:89:538:391:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f11:They do not run in the high state because the required payment,ρZL/rois less thanρZH
39:1447:74268:22:22:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which is less than the amount that depositors obtain by waiting. Waiting nets depositors
39:1448:74356:22:21:72:539:347:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:ZHwhether others withdraw in period 1 or not because depositors who withdraw in period
39:1449:74442:21:22:72:539:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1 get less thanρZH. Relative to a contract that only allowsZHto be withdrawn in period
39:1450:74528:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2, the proposed contract therefore gives the same utility in the high state and higher utility
39:1451:74622:22:22:72:155:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the low state.
39:1452:74639:22:22:89:540:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Lastly, the derivation of (8) implies thatρZL/rois indeed the depositor’s favorite payment
39:1453:74729:22:30:72:263:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:when the bank’s resources equalρZL.
39:1454:74764:30:22:89:540:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The advantage of the contract that gives depositors the right to withdrawρZL/roin
39:1455:74845:22:22:72:539:186:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:period 1 is that it lets banks make a payment that depositors prefer toZHwhen the state is
39:1456:74935:22:22:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:low. Note that, if banks were free to adjust their second period payment to raise the utility
39:1457:75028:22:22:72:539:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of their depositors, condition (7) would lead them to set it equal toZH/ro, which exceeds
39:1458:75117:22:0:71:540:120:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f1:ZH. This would raise utility in the high state as well and would make contracts that allow
40:1459:75209:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:deposits to withdraw funds in period 1 even more desirable. Moreover, since the payment
40:1460:75296:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and the utility obtained in the high state would be even larger, the arguments in Proposition
40:1461:75389:22:22:72:539:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:8 would still establish that the optimal payment in period 1 isρZL/ro. As a consequence,
40:1462:75477:22:22:72:289:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:there would still be a run in the low state.
40:1463:75521:22:22:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I now turn to the analysis of bank capital in the three period model. As far as bank
40:1464:75605:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:owners are concerned, the addition of period 1 does not matter. For the bank to be able
40:1465:75692:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to make payments based on (1 +k) units ofKper depositor, each bank owner must give
40:1466:75774:22:22:71:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:upωkunits. Since the proceeds from this equity injection are paid out to depositors in the
40:1467:75864:22:22:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:low state, owners’ consumption in the low state remainsZH(1−ωk). Owner utility thus
40:1468:75947:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:remains equal to the left hand side of (21), whereYequals the payments made to depositors
40:1469:76036:22:22:71:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the high state. Since bank owners are only allowed to keep the bank resources that remain
40:1470:76128:22:22:71:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:after all depositors have been paid their contractual obligations,Ymust equal the amount
40:1471:76216:22:21:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that depositors are entitled to collect in period 2 (if they do not withdraw in period 1). For
40:1472:76310:21:22:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:bankers to be willing to provide positive quantities of capital, (21) and (22) must hold with
40:1473:76403:22:22:71:195:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this interpretation ofY.
40:1474:76427:22:22:89:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As long as (1 +k)ZL/rois smaller thanY, the argument made in Proposition 8 implies
40:1475:76509:22:22:71:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that depositors prefer to have the choice ofρ(1+k)ZL/roin period 1 orYin period 2 rather
40:1476:76597:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:than having only the right of demandingYin period 2. Indeed, the contract that allows
40:1477:76682:22:22:72:539:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors to withdrawρ(1 +k)ZL/roin period 1 is the one that depositors prefer among
40:1478:76767:22:22:72:539:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:all those in which the firm pays outYin period 2 and has (1 +k) units ofKwith which to
40:1479:76853:22:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pay off depositors in the low state. For low levels of capital, conditions (18) and (19) thus
40:1480:76946:22:22:72:296:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ensure that this is the equilibrium contract.
40:1481:76991:22:22:89:540:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Because the equilibrium contract sets the payment in period 1 toλρ(1 +k)ZL/n−1(γ)
40:1482:77072:22:22:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and the firm hasρ(1 +k)ZLunits of good 1 available in the low state of period 1, the
40:1483:77156:22:21:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:actual probability that depositors are paid in this state equalsλ/n−1(γ). This probability
40:1484:77246:21:22:72:539:173:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is independent ofkbecause the period 1 payment is adjusted upwards when owners inject
40:1485:77331:22:0:72:220:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:more capital into their bank.

42:1586:80199:22:22:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:also withdraw funds in the first period. Here, bank owners who add capital also increase the

43:1629:81334:31:22:89:539:449:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This result of proposition 10 is quite different from the one in Proposition 5, which
43:1630:81419:22:22:72:539:427:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:stated that increasing capital above its equilibrium level raisedex postdepositor welfare
43:1631:81508:22:22:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:under fairly weak conditions. In both cases, raising capital requirements has the effect of
43:1632:81599:22:21:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increasing the total amount that banks pay out in the low state while compensating bank
43:1633:81686:21:22:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:owners by reducing their obligations in the high state. The difference is that, in the two
43:1634:81776:22:22:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:period model considered above, the amount obtained by successful withdrawers in the low
43:1635:81863:22:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:state also fell alongside the high state payment when capital was increased. This resulted
43:1636:81953:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in a benefit that depositors often did not value sufficiently, namely that it increased their
43:1637:82046:22:22:72:326:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:probability of succeeding in obtaining a payment.
43:1638:82095:22:22:89:539:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In the three period model studied here, by contrast, the amount obtained by successful
43:1639:82181:22:22:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:withdrawers in the low state payment rises when capital is increased, while their probability of
43:1640:82277:22:22:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:being successful stays constant. As a result, there is no social gain that is being insufficiently
43:1641:82375:22:22:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:valued by depositors.  In fact, the opposite is true.  Depositors with queuing bias find it
43:1642:82466:22:22:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:attractive to be given a larger payment in the low state when they are successful. However,
43:1643:82557:22:22:72:539:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from the point of view of averageex postwelfare, this introduces undesirable consumption
43:1644:82645:22:0:72:120:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:volatility.
44:1645:82658:0:22:89:539:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Before closing this section it is worth showing that clawbacks and deposit insurance can
44:1646:82746:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:also reinstate the autarkic Pareto Optimum in the three period model. Consider clawbacks
44:1647:82834:22:22:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:first. If depositors were to accept a contract that offered a payment of more thanZLin
44:1648:82920:22:22:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:period 1, there would still be a period 1 bank run in the low state, and they would all end up
44:1649:83014:22:22:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:withρZL. Such a contract would not attract depositors because they would do better under
44:1650:83102:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:autarky. Banks could, instead, offer a contract with a lower period 1 payment. However,
44:1651:83189:22:22:72:307:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this would again yield the autarkic allocation.
44:1652:83236:22:22:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Now consider deposit insurance.  As we saw earlier, deposit insurance eliminates any
44:1653:83320:22:22:72:539:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:incentive for banks owners to contribute capital to their banks, so I setk= 0.  In their
44:1654:83408:22:22:72:539:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:competition for depositors, banks would set a second period payment no lower thanZH,
44:1655:83492:22:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:since lower payments would reduce expected depositor utility. Because of my assumption of
44:1656:83581:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lump sum taxes, setting a higher payment does not change the equilibrium. For concreteness,
44:1657:83672:22:21:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:suppose this equalsZH. If the promised period 1 payment is even slightly smaller, there are
44:1658:83763:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:no runs in period 1. While banks do not have any preference regarding this payment, the
44:1659:83850:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:government would gain by making sure it is belowZH. As in Diamond and Dybvig (1983),
44:1660:83934:22:22:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:one important benefit of deposit insurance is that it eliminates inefficient liquidations by
44:1661:84026:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:giving depositors confidence in their deposits. One importance difference, however, is that
44:1662:84117:22:40:72:530:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:here the government has to collect taxes in the low state to make good on this insurance.
44:1663:84206:40:34:72:194:308:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:6  Conclusion
44:1664:84219:34:22:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper has provided a justification for various policies that governments use to regulate
44:1665:84312:22:22:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial institutions, including a deposit insurance policy where the government makes
44:1666:84399:22:22:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:actual losses in bad states of nature as well as regulations that control the assets of uninsured
44:1667:84496:22:21:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:institutions.  The benefit of these policies is their ability to help depositors who are too
44:1668:84588:21:22:72:300:187:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:optimistic about how they will fare in a run.
44:1669:84633:22:22:89:539:165:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Both to simplify the analysis and to preserve its comparability with important earlier
44:1670:84719:22:22:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:studies like Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Allen and Gale (1998), the structure of the
44:1671:84805:22:0:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:model I have presented is extremely sparse. Unfortunately, this raises the question of how
45:1672:84897:0:22:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the policy implications of the model would carry over to a richer environment. The model
45:1673:84985:22:22:72:540:699:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:implies, for example, that clawbacks in bankruptcy and deposit insurance both eliminate
45:1674:85072:22:22:72:343:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:inefficient runs and achieve the same final allocation.
45:1675:85127:22:22:89:539:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In practice, these two forms of regulation differ in other ways. Clawbacks, for example,
45:1676:85215:22:22:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lead to more uncertainty for individuals who withdraw funds since the withdrawal can be

45:1678:85392:22:22:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:could be a reason why non-financial bankruptcies are subject to clawbacks in the U.S. while
45:1679:85483:22:22:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial institutions are not. It does remain uncertain, however, whether there should also
45:1680:85575:22:22:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:exist financial institutions such as money market funds that are subject to neither clawbacks
45:1681:85668:22:22:72:207:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nor government insurance.
45:1682:85693:22:22:89:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The model suggests that the advisability of requiring financial institutions to hold more
45:1683:85782:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital than they would on their own depends crucially on the contracts that they write. If
45:1684:85873:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increased capital leads them to reduce their contractual obligations in panics so that more
45:1685:85964:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depositors are able to withdraw, the model provides a rationale for increasing this capital.
45:1686:86056:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Capital is advantageous in this case because it reduces the volatility of consumption induced
45:1687:86149:22:22:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by depositors’ unwarranted optimism. If, however, banks with more capital find a way to
45:1688:86236:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increase the amount that they pay out to successful withdrawers in a panic, forcing banks to
45:1689:86328:22:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have more capital may be counterproductive. In the model, banks ability to do this depends
45:1690:86418:22:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on the timing of withdrawals, consumption and the resolution of uncertainty. It would thus
45:1691:86508:22:0:72:517:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be valuable to learn how banks react to increases in capital in a richer dynamic model.
