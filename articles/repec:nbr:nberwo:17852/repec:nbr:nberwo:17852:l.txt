2:32:1632:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Our paper provides a comparative perspective on the development of public primary education in four
2:33:1731:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:of the largest developing economies circa 1910: Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). These four
2:34:1829:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:countries encompassed more than 50 percent of the world’s population in 1910, but remarkably few
2:35:1925:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:of their citizens attended any school by the early 20th century. We present new, comparable data on
2:36:2024:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:school inputs and outputs for BRIC drawn from contemporary surveys and government documents.
2:37:2116:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:Recent studies emphasize the importance of political decentralization, and relatively broad political
2:38:2217:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:voice for the early spread of public primary education in developed economies. We identify the former
2:39:2318:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:and the lack of the latter to be important in the context of BRIC, but we also outline how other factors
2:40:2422:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:such as factor endowments, colonialism, serfdom, and, especially, the characteristics of the political
2:41:2524:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:and economic elite help explain the low achievement levels of these four countries and the incredible
2:42:2625:14:42:72:291:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:amount of heterogeneity within each of them.

3:67:3214:0:23:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:68:3230:23:28:108:498:685:144:Times:144:Times:?:Economists have argued that the “Great Divergence” between the developed and 
3:69:3307:28:28:72:471:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:underdeveloped world in the 19th century was reinforced – if not caused – by rapid 
3:70:3390:28:27:72:530:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:improvements in schooling that occurred in the advanced economies. For example, the leading 
3:71:3482:27:28:72:530:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:positions of the US and German economies in 1900 have been linked to their highly developed 
3:72:3574:28:27:72:513:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:education systems (Goldin and Katz, 2008; and Becker et al., 2009). Few nations in the last 
3:73:3666:27:28:72:525:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:century have undergone growth convergence without also experiencing sustained increases in 
3:74:3757:28:28:72:521:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:human capital investment. Therefore, explaining differences in economic development today 
3:75:3847:28:27:72:538:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:may hinge on understanding why most societies failed to develop adequate primary education in 
3:76:3941:27:28:72:251:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  
3:77:3982:28:27:108:509:436:144:Times:144:Times:?:This challenge was laid down by Richard Easterlin in “Why isn’t the Whole World 
3:78:4062:27:28:72:498:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:Developed?” his famous 1980 presidential address to the Economic History Association 
3:79:4147:28:28:72:535:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Easterlin, 1981). Thirty years later, our paper takes up this challenge. Unlike most comparative 
3:80:4245:28:27:72:530:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:research on the economic history of education, which focuses on differences among developed 
3:81:4337:27:28:72:517:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:societies, or between developed and developing countries, our paper investigates the limited 
3:82:4430:28:27:72:532:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of public primary schooling in four of the largest developing economies at the turn of 
3:83:4527:27:28:72:535:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 20th century: Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).1 These countries comprised more than 
3:84:4622:28:27:71:518:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:50 percent of the world’s population in 1910, but only 12, 20, 8, and 4 percent of school-age 
3:85:4716:27:28:71:506:216:144:Times:144:Times:B:children in Brazil, Russia, India and China, respectively, were enrolled in primary school, 
3:86:4808:28:68:72:528:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to more than 80 percent in Germany, UK and the USA.2 A comparative study of the

3:88:4953:7:16:72:542:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 Important recent works that do take a broader comparative perspective on the emergence of mass schooling include 
3:89:5068:16:7:71:263:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:Frankema (2010) and Lindert (2004 and 2010). 
3:90:5113:7:16:72:522:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 See Table 1. Note that Lindert’s figures differ from the ones we provide. This stems from different geographic 
3:91:5226:16:0:72:423:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:units he considers, as well as slightly different numbers for the school-age populations. 
4:92:5318:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:slow emergence of public schooling in BRIC offers a valuable contrast to works that focus on 
4:93:5411:27:28:72:192:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:more advanced nations.  
4:94:5435:28:27:108:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Collectively, these four countries enjoy recognition today for their common status as fast 
4:95:5526:27:28:72:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:growing emerging economies. But their relevance for studying the origins of public primary 
4:96:5617:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:education in the late 19th and early 20th century lies in their level of comparative economic and 
4:97:5715:28:27:72:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:political underdevelopment, the large scale and variability of their politics and geography, and 
4:98:5812:27:28:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the availability of previously unexplored data on basic schooling. The main contribution of our 
4:99:5908:28:27:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper lies in presenting an analytical framework to understand new empirical evidence on the 
4:100:6001:27:28:72:493:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation of educational development within and between these four different societies. 
4:101:6089:28:28:72:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Investigating the heterogeneous experiences of the four countries is useful not because of the 
4:102:6184:28:27:72:493:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:BRIC acronym’s modern connotations, but rather because it broadens the discussion of 
4:103:6269:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Easterlin’s important question. We also view the BRIC experiences as representative of the 
4:104:6360:28:27:72:524:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority of the world that had limited publically provided schooling by the early 20th century. 
4:105:6456:27:28:108:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Conditions in BRIC were fundamentally different from the more educationally advanced 
4:106:6541:28:27:72:504:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries by the late 19th century. Clearly, high incomes and structural economic changes 
4:107:6631:27:28:72:504:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased the demand for schooling in the United States and Germany, but broad political 
4:108:6720:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation also played an important complementary role in these and other successful cases of 
4:109:6817:28:27:72:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:early publicly financed primary education (Lindert, 2004; and Gallego 2010). In more advanced 
4:110:6911:27:28:72:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:economies, the spread of primary education typically entailed a shift towards more progressive 
4:111:7006:28:27:72:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax policies and away from the private provision of schooling. Granting larger shares of the 
4:112:7099:27:28:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:population formal voice over education and fiscal policies prevented elites from blocking the 
4:113:7193:28:28:72:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:expansion of publically funded mass schooling. The impact of democracy was also reinforced by 
4:114:7287:28:0:72:525:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:the relative homogeneity of the populations (in terms of income, ethnicity, or religion), which 
5:115:7385:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:enabled majorities to coalesce around support for public schools (Go and Lindert, 2010; and 
5:116:7477:27:28:71:193:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Goldin and Katz, 2008).  
5:117:7502:28:27:107:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Unlike these successful cases, BRIC was less developed, had more restricted political 
5:118:7588:27:28:71:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation, and, exhibited low levels of public schooling despite decentralized political 
5:119:7681:28:28:71:511:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:structures. As with most of the world in the early 20th century, these developing economies 
5:120:7773:28:27:72:493:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:exhibited low per capita incomes, which limited private and public funding for primary 
5:121:7860:27:28:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling. These primarily agrarian economies may have had limited demand for high skilled 
5:122:7951:28:27:72:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor, and rural households may have faced substantial opportunity costs to educating their 
5:123:8043:27:28:72:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:children.3 But even accounting for low incomes and potentially low demand for education, we 
5:124:8135:28:28:72:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:argue that a political economy framework involving public sector capture by local elites helps 
5:125:8230:28:27:72:543:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:explain not only the limited overall supply of schooling in BRIC but also the variation within and 
5:126:8329:27:28:72:209:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the four countries.  
5:127:8358:28:27:108:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:In the face of weak central authorities, decentralization of education led to the capture of 
5:128:8451:27:28:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:local public resources and political institutions by elites in all four societies. Resources were 
5:129:8549:28:27:72:484:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:often funneled towards private or secondary education catering to the elites, and poor 
5:130:8636:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:communities were forced to rely on scarce public funds or voluntary contributions to finance 
5:131:8729:28:28:72:498:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary schools. However, we do not find that a unified elite was always trying to block 
5:132:8818:28:27:72:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures on education, because decentralization and subsequent local capture did not always 
5:133:8914:27:28:72:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:constrain the development of primary schooling. In more commercial, higher-growth areas, 
5:134:9003:28:27:72:508:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:where there was more demand for education, many elites supported the expansion of mass 
5:135:9090:27:27:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling because they needed skilled labor and could more easily afford the resulting taxes. In 
5:136:9187:27:7:72:219:130:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
5:137:9243:7:16:72:514:123:42:Times:100:Times:F:3.Schultz (1971 and 1983) and others have argued for relatively high returns to literacy and basic numeracy in 
5:138:9354:16:12:71:536:107:100:Times:100:Times:F:developing agricultural economies. We acknowledge that this may have been true to some degree within BRIC, but 
5:139:9465:12:11:71:541:95:100:Times:100:Times:F:data limitations prevent us from explicitly comparing the returns to education in our four societies. We also note that 
5:140:9585:11:0:71:403:84:100:Times:100:Times:F:the nature of child labor might have affected demand for basic schooling in BRIC. 
6:141:9669:0:27:72:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:other areas of BRIC, elites supported public education because they perceived direct political 
6:142:9764:27:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits. Finally, in all four cases, changes in the composition of, and mobility into and out of, 
6:143:9863:28:27:71:518:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:the elites – whether defined by wealth, status, or political power – influenced the support for 
6:144:9959:27:28:71:264:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:publically financed primary education.  
6:145:9999:28:28:107:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:The composition and policy preferences of the local elite varied across and within BRIC 
6:146:10087:28:27:71:505:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:according to economic conditions, barriers to entry into elite circles and the (endogenous) 
6:147:10179:27:28:71:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:progressiveness of the fiscal structure. In applying a common political economy framework, a 
6:148:10272:28:27:71:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:key contribution of our study is to characterize the heterogeneity of the elite (or the economic 
6:149:10369:27:28:71:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:and political conditions they faced) within and across each country and relate how such variation 
6:150:10467:28:28:71:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:accounts for the differences in educational outcomes. We also show how the mechanisms of elite 
6:151:10562:28:27:71:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:control of education were delineated by the structure of central – local government relations. 
6:152:10657:27:28:71:518:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:From Brazil’s adoption of federalism in the 1891 Constitution, to the deterioration of central 
6:153:10752:28:27:71:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:authority in China in the late-Qing and the Republican periods, to British colonialism in India, 
6:154:10849:27:28:71:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:the national governments in our countries generally exhibited little substantive involvement in 
6:155:10945:28:27:71:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:basic education. Only in the case of Tsarist and Soviet Russia after 1900 were central authorities 
6:156:11044:27:28:71:411:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly active in subsidizing the local provision of primary schooling. 
6:157:11117:28:28:107:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:We develop our argument in three steps. First, we present and discuss data on primary 
6:158:11203:28:27:71:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:school enrollment rates and expenditure levels for BRIC and a set of comparison countries, circa 
6:159:11300:27:28:71:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:1910. Drawing on a variety of unexplored contemporary publications and official sources, we 
6:160:11392:28:27:71:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:move beyond simple cross-country comparisons to also report and comment upon within-country 
6:161:11484:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in BRIC. In the second step, we outline a simple theoretical framework explaining how 
6:162:11580:28:28:71:520:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the provision of public education in developing societies might be subject to capture by local 
6:163:11675:28:0:71:534:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites. A key insight is that heterogeneity among elites is an important factor behind variation in 
7:164:11777:0:27:72:493:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling, especially in the contexts of decentralized policymaking and imperfect local 
7:165:11865:27:28:72:493:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:democracy that characterized all of our cases. The third step of the analysis applies this 
7:166:11956:28:27:71:526:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:theoretical framework to analyze the early development of public primary education in Brazil, 
7:167:12050:27:28:71:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Russia, India, and China, roughly over the period 1880-1930. While acknowledging the negative 
7:168:12144:28:28:71:493:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of low income levels, we show how variation in income, economic and political 
7:169:12230:28:27:71:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions, and the social status of the elites interacted with decentralized fiscal policies across 
7:170:12331:27:28:71:428:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the four countries to influence the provision of public primary education.

7:172:12407:24:23:71:215:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:2. Comparative Perspective 
7:173:12434:23:28:107:518:468:144:Times:144:Times:?:In Table 1 we present data on primary education from BRIC and a set of comparison 
7:174:12516:28:28:71:526:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries around 1910. We include high-income countries such as England, Germany, and the 
7:175:12606:28:27:71:526:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:United States; middle-income European countries such as Italy and Spain; Japan – the leading 
7:176:12699:27:28:71:516:385:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy in Asia at the time; other middle-income countries such as South Africa, Uruguay, 
7:177:12789:28:27:71:520:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chile, and Mexico; and several low-income countries like Peru, Jamaica, and Sri Lanka. The 
7:178:12880:27:28:71:536:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:education data for BRIC are from contemporary surveys, government reports, and other original 
7:179:12974:28:28:71:502:302:144:Times:144:Times:B:materials, while the data for the other countries come from the Commissioner of the U.S. 
7:180:13063:28:27:71:513:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Department of Education (United States, 1910).4  We match these indicators to Maddison’s 
7:181:13152:27:28:72:509:247:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2006) per capita income figures and to Lindert’s (2004) enrollment rates for comparison.  
7:182:13243:28:27:240:374:219:144:Times:144:Times:?:[Insert Table 1 about here] 
7:183:13270:27:28:108:535:192:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 1 starkly reveals the low education levels and expenditures in BRIC relative to the 
7:184:13360:28:34:72:525:164:144:Times:144:Times:B:rest of the world. Estimated primary school enrollment rates averaged 8.3 percent, well below 
7:185:13454:34:7:72:219:130:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
7:186:13510:7:16:72:514:123:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 There are a variety of other sources on education attainment and investments that cover our time period (e.g. 
7:187:13622:16:12:71:505:107:100:Times:100:Times:F:Frankema, 2009; Lindert, 2004; and Morrison and Martin, 2009), but we focus on the sources and countries 
7:188:13727:12:11:71:533:95:100:Times:100:Times:F:documented in Tables 1-3 because we view them to be representative. Extending the sample in Table 1 in different 
7:189:13840:11:0:71:278:84:100:Times:100:Times:F:ways does not alter the points we are making here.  
8:190:13894:0:27:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:less developed parts of Europe (Italy – 38 percent, Spain – 46 percent), middle-income countries 
8:191:13991:27:28:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Latin America (Chile – 28 percent, Mexico – 20 percent), and even poorer countries such as 
8:192:14085:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Jamaica (41 percent) and Peru (24 percent).5 The poverty of BRICs was clearly an important 
8:193:14176:27:28:72:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:factor driving the low enrollment rates, as GDP per capita averaged a mere $762 for BRIC in 
8:194:14268:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:1913 (in 1990 PPP-adjusted dollars). But income alone cannot fully account for the observed 
8:195:14360:28:27:72:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in educational performance. A graph of enrollment rates against income in Figure 1 
8:196:14455:27:28:72:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that primary school enrollment rates in BRIC were below what would be expected 
8:197:14543:28:27:72:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:given their income levels.6  Although we provide evidence only for the 1910 cross-section, this 
8:198:14639:27:28:72:379:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:picture is representative of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
8:199:14708:28:28:237:377:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:[Insert Figure 1 about here] 
8:200:14737:28:27:108:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:We find similar patterns for primary school expenditures. BRIC averaged $0.6 per school 
8:201:14825:27:28:72:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:age child (nominal US$, c1910), compared to over $20 in the United States and over $1 in Japan 
8:202:14920:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Mexico. Russia was the leader among BRICs, spending $2.80 per child, followed by Brazil 
8:203:15012:27:28:72:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:at almost $1.32. India and China – two of the three poorest countries in our sample – spent only 
8:204:15109:28:27:72:219:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:$0.10 and $0.16 respectively.  
8:205:15140:27:28:108:516:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Beyond per capita expenditures or enrollment rates, we think it is valuable to look at 
8:206:15227:28:28:72:513:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary school expenditures per pupil as a measure of how elitist the education system was 
8:207:15318:28:38:72:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:within BRIC. On average, BRIC spent $3.6 per enrolled student, higher than Spain, Japan, and 
8:208:15411:38:8:72:219:201:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
8:209:15467:8:16:72:526:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 We measure enrollment rates as the number of enrolled children in public primary schools over the total school-
8:210:15580:16:11:71:528:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:age population, which we take from censuses and other sources. “Primary students” refers to students in surveyed 
8:211:15693:11:12:71:538:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:institutions of basic or elementary education below secondary schools. The original data gatherers may have missed 
8:212:15808:12:11:71:538:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:some schools, but we are confident that our measures for BRIC are improvements on the existing literature. Finally, 
8:213:15924:11:12:71:512:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:note that the data for BRIC are meant to cover public primary schooling and expenditures only (i.e. schooling 
8:214:16034:12:11:71:513:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:financed out of formal fiscal resources), but other sample countries may include some private schooling. To a 
8:215:16144:11:7:71:377:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:limited degree, we take up the issue of private schooling in the case studies. 
8:216:16223:7:16:72:541:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 The relatively low provision of schooling in BRIC persists even if the sample of countries in Table 1 is extended to 
8:217:16342:16:12:71:524:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:include other observations available in Lindert (2004). Additional evidence that income cannot explain all of the 
8:218:16456:12:11:71:517:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:variation in schooling within Brazil, Russia, India, and China may be found  in Martinez-Fritscher et al., 2010; 
8:219:16569:11:0:71:402:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:Nafziger, “Political,” 2011; Chaudhary, 2009 and 2010; and Bai and Kung, 2011.  
9:220:16651:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:close to the level of expenditures in Italy.  Governments in BRIC spent significant resources on 
9:221:16748:27:28:72:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:the very few students that actually attended any school.  In most of our cases, the children of 
9:222:16844:28:27:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites or of upper middle classes close to the ruling elites were significantly overrepresented in 
9:223:16943:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:publically financed primary schools. For instance, in the case of Brazil, mostly white children 
9:224:17039:28:28:72:486:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:attended school and, in India, education catered largely to the privileged upper castes. 
9:225:17127:28:27:107:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:The patterns in school size and teachers per school age population further reinforce the 
9:226:17216:27:28:71:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence on spending. Students in BRIC attended schools of a similar or in some cases even 
9:227:17307:28:27:71:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller size (31 students per teacher) than in developed parts of the world.7 School size averaged 
9:228:17406:27:28:72:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:34 students in the United States and the UK and 48 students in Japan. Yet, there were very few 
9:229:17501:28:28:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:teachers available to serve the school-age population in BRIC with only 3.7 teachers per 1000 
9:230:17595:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:children of school age compared to 28 in the United States, 10 in Japan and 4.8 in Bolivia. Table 
9:231:17693:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:1 broadly suggests the educational system in BRIC favored the very small number of students 
9:232:17785:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:who were able to attend school compared to the vast majority of the school age population that 
9:233:17880:27:28:72:160:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:was not enrolled.  
9:234:17899:28:27:108:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:In addition to the similarities and differences in outcomes between BRIC and the rest of 
9:235:17988:27:28:72:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the world, there was enormous variation in educational outcomes (enrollments) and inputs 
9:236:18077:28:28:72:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:(expenditures) within BRIC.8 Table 2 reports primary school enrollment rates by region or 
9:237:18167:28:27:72:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:province, and Table 3 reports primary school expenditures per children of school age, both for 
9:238:18262:27:24:72:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:roughly the year 1910. These tables highlight the wide variation in each country.  The provinces

9:240:18415:8:16:72:516:180:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 One must be cautious in drawing strong conclusions from such an indicator because it says nothing about the 
9:241:18525:16:11:71:509:164:100:Times:100:Times:F:quality of instruction. Moreover, because we are measuring school size with students per teacher, we may be 
9:242:18633:11:12:71:529:153:100:Times:100:Times:F:missing the emergence of a small number of multi-grade schools in BRIC. Recent work by McKinnon and Minns 
9:243:18739:12:11:71:495:141:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2009) shows that the shift to multi-grade schools in British Columbia led to substantial improvements in 
9:244:18845:11:7:71:263:130:100:Times:100:Times:F:educational outcomes in the early 20th century.  
9:245:18894:7:16:72:512:123:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 Admittedly, such intra-country variation was not uncommon in the early 20th century. In 1907, spending per 
9:246:19003:16:12:71:507:107:100:Times:100:Times:F:school-age child varied from less than $5 in Mississippi and South Carolina to more than $40 in Nevada and 
9:247:19110:12:11:71:525:95:100:Times:100:Times:F:Washington (U.S., 1910). The coefficient of variation for state-level spending per capita on primary education in 
9:248:19224:11:0:71:347:84:100:Times:100:Times:F:Mexico in 1907 was 0.73 (Engerman, Mariscal and Sokoloff, 2009). 
10:249:19291:0:27:72:509:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Brazil and India with low levels of enrollment had comparable enrollment to the typical 
10:250:19382:27:28:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:province in China. Yet provinces with above average enrollment in Brazil or India look more 
10:251:19474:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:like Russia, which had a much higher GDP per capita. It is worth noting that these numbers are 
10:252:19569:27:28:72:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:themselves averages over very large regions – in the Russian case, individual provinces had 
10:253:19661:28:28:72:528:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment rates as low as 15 percent (Right Bank Ukraine) and as high as 33.5 percent (Baltic 
10:254:19756:28:27:72:129:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Provinces). 
10:255:19768:27:28:258:392:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:[Insert Table 2 about here] 
10:256:19796:28:27:108:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:The substantial heterogeneity is also on display in Table 3, which shows the variation in 
10:257:19886:27:28:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:elementary expenditures per children of school age within BRIC. In the richer regions of Russia, 
10:258:19983:28:28:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:such as the Baltic and Capital (Moscow and Petersburg) provinces, spending was almost double 
10:259:20076:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:the level in the less developed interior regions. In Brazil the variation was such that in rich states 
10:260:20179:27:28:72:502:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:like São Paulo the level of expenditures per school age child was comparable to the more 
10:261:20268:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:developed parts of Russia.9 Yet the poorest provinces in Brazil had expenditures of less than 10 
10:262:20365:27:28:72:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:cents per child, a level comparable to China and India. The Brazil-Russia comparison also 
10:263:20455:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that factors other than income influenced enrollment and expenditures. Despite being 
10:264:20549:27:28:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:poorer than Russia, Brazil spent $11 per enrolled student, compared to $7 in Russia (Table 1), 
10:265:20644:28:28:72:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Brazil exhibited far greater geographic inequality in both spending and enrollment (Tables 2 
10:266:20741:28:27:72:108:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 3).

10:268:20776:28:27:108:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:We identify similar parallels between China and India. Even if India enjoyed a higher 
10:269:20862:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:GDP per capita, expenditures per enrolled student were only 35% of the level in China (Table 1). 
10:270:20959:28:20:72:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Overall, expenditures per school age population in China also exceeded India’s average (16 cents

10:273:21223:16:11:71:526:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:(across or even within countries) in the relative costs of educational inputs such as school buildings, instructional 
10:274:21341:11:0:71:195:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:supplies, and teacher salaries.  
11:275:21377:0:27:72:491:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to 10 cents), while regional variation was considerable in each country. Less 
11:276:21464:27:28:72:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:developed parts of British India such as the United Provinces were spending 5 cents per school 
11:277:21559:28:27:72:517:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:age population compared to 28 cents in Bombay. The variation within China was also large: 
11:278:21649:27:28:72:424:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Henan province spent 13 cents compared to $1.12 in Liaoning province.  
11:279:21720:28:28:107:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:As we show in the case studies, elites in China were less constrained by social status and 
11:280:21811:28:27:71:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:by higher levels of government compared to India. On account of these differences, local elites 
11:281:21907:27:28:71:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:in China may have been more successful at promoting public education when it suited their 
11:282:21997:28:27:71:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic interests. These comparisons suggest supply side factors may have influenced the 
11:283:22087:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual education systems that developed in BRIC. Drawing on the literatures on the United 
11:284:22181:28:28:71:498:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:States (e.g., Go and Lindert, 2010; Margo, 1990; and Naidu, 2010), Latin America (e.g.,

11:287:22457:28:27:71:499:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the franchise as important for the emergence of public education, we sketch a theoretical

11:290:22636:28:27:71:266:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:3. Towards a Theoretical Framework 
11:291:22671:27:28:107:486:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:In this section, we outline how three interrelated political factors – democratic 
11:292:22753:28:27:71:504:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanisms of governance (even if imperfect); fiscal and policy decentralization; and the 
11:293:22843:27:28:71:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:composition and exclusiveness of the economic and political elite – influenced the development 
11:294:22938:28:27:71:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:of publicly funded mass schooling in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Of course, we recognize 
11:295:23034:27:28:72:527:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:that other reasons such as the levels of personal and government incomes, the relative demand 
11:296:23128:28:0:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:for skilled workers, the availability of private alternatives, and cultural factors were also relevant. 
12:297:23235:0:27:72:493:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the case studies, we try to take these other factors into account, but here we focus on 
12:298:23326:27:28:72:425:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing a political framework to understand what transpired in BRIC. 
12:299:23398:28:27:108:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:The emergence of public education in more developed economies has often been tied to 
12:300:23483:27:28:72:500:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the broadening of democracy in the 19th century. Before the extension of the franchise in 
12:301:23573:28:28:71:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Western Europe and its offshoots, national political and economic elites saw little need to 
12:302:23665:28:27:72:501:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:redistribute fiscal resources towards education and resisted state policies to support mass 
12:303:23757:27:28:72:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling. Even where some form of representative politics existed, it was often limited to a 
12:304:23851:28:27:72:475:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:select few in what Lindert (2004) has termed an “elite democracy.” But as property 
12:305:23934:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:qualifications and other voting restrictions were lifted, the political economy shifted in favor of 
12:306:24034:28:28:72:428:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:more redistributional policies, including publically provided education.10  
12:307:24110:28:27:108:492:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:It was the decentralization of school policy and financing that enabled the early 
12:308:24192:27:28:71:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:development of mass schooling in the 19th century in countries such as Prussia and the United 
12:309:24286:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:States. In theory, decentralization allows for a tighter fit between local preferences and policies, 
12:310:24387:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:and a closer monitoring of politicians by constituents (see Bardhan and Mookherjee, eds., 2006). 
12:311:24484:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:When decentralization also includes the devolution of fiscal authority (i.e., by allowing for local 
12:312:24584:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:taxes), this may ease the budget constraints of local governments. In both Prussia and the United 
12:313:24682:28:28:72:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:States (as well as in Canada and, later, Japan, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere), the 
12:314:24770:28:73:72:479:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:responsibility of financing public schooling was decentralized to local authorities.11

12:316:24914:7:16:72:526:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) and Lizerri and Persico (2004) study the expansion of the franchise in the 19th 
12:317:25025:16:12:71:495:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:century. Aidt et al. (2006), Gallego (2010) and Lindert (2004) provide cross-country evidence of positive 
12:318:25131:12:11:71:535:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:relationships between various measures of democratization and school enrollments and public spending on primary 
12:319:25243:11:12:71:502:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:education in the long 19th century. Engerman, Mariscal and Sokoloff (2009) document how variation in the 
12:320:25348:12:11:72:508:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:provision of schooling in late 19th early 20th century Latin America was related to the extent of voting rights. 
12:321:25461:11:12:72:513:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:Stasavage (2005) provides modern empirical evidence for a link between democratization and primary school 
12:322:25567:12:7:72:163:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:support across Africa. 
12:323:25590:7:0:72:515:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 On public school provision in Prussia and the United States, see Lindert (2004) and Go and Lindert (2010).  
13:324:25704:0:27:108:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:While Prussia – and later Imperial Germany – retained central oversight of primary 
13:325:25787:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:education, public schooling in the United States was entirely left to states and communities.12 
13:326:25882:28:27:71:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:The decentralization of schooling to local authorities led communities in the North and Midwest, 
13:327:25979:27:28:71:485:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:with relatively representative politics, homogenous populations, and high incomes, to 
13:328:26065:28:28:71:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasingly finance public education through property taxes over the 19th century (Go and 
13:329:26156:28:27:72:514:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lindert, 2010; and Goldin and Katz, 2008).13 In contrast, racial biases and unequal political 
13:330:26250:27:28:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:rights in the South resulted in limited local funding of schooling for African Americans and 
13:331:26343:28:27:72:465:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower overall expenditures on public education (Margo, 1990; and Naidu, 2010).  
13:332:26423:27:28:108:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:The U.S. case directly relates to the third element of our framework – the role played by 
13:333:26513:28:28:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites in the functioning of local governments. Well-functioning local democracies can overcome 
13:334:26609:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:elite resistance to decentralized and publically financed schooling via political channels.14 But 
13:335:26707:27:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization does not always lead to more provision of public goods such as education when 
13:336:26802:28:27:71:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:local institutions and, hence, policymaking are controlled by an elite minority with interests that 
13:337:26902:27:46:71:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibly diverge from the majority (Bardhan, 2002).15 The availability of private schools and the

13:339:27056:7:16:72:523:297:42:Times:100:Times:F:12 From the 18th century onwards, the highly centralized Prussian state mandated that local governments provide 
13:340:27168:16:12:72:502:281:100:Times:100:Times:F:public schools according to a national model and was eventually adopted in Meiji Japan (Duke, 2009). The 
13:341:27273:12:11:72:516:269:100:Times:100:Times:F:decentralization of financial authority that this required – whether conducted through local governments or the 
13:342:27385:11:12:72:520:258:100:Times:100:Times:F:church – was effective in generating relatively high enrollment rates by the mid-19th century (Herbst, 2002; and 
13:343:27498:12:11:72:536:246:100:Times:100:Times:F:Lindert, 2004). Post-Napoleonic France enacted a strongly centralized school system that required departments and 
13:344:27612:11:12:72:523:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:local communities to create and fund public schools. After Falloux’s Law was passed in 1850, special education 
13:345:27723:12:11:72:532:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:taxes were supposed to be enacted by each community, although central government subsidies were also available 
13:346:27834:11:12:72:526:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Grew and Harrigan, 1991). Lindert (2004) notes the lagging education performance of the United Kingdom was 
13:347:27942:12:7:72:442:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:due, in part, to the inadequacy of decentralized fiscal resources before the Fees Act of 1891. 
13:348:28037:7:16:72:535:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 From private tuition and “rate bills” of the early 19th century, the decentralized provision of primary education in 
13:349:28157:16:11:71:539:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:the United States increasingly became more “public” with the installation of state and local property taxes under the 
13:350:28275:11:7:72:362:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:control of communities and local school boards (Go and Lindert, 2010). 
13:351:28346:7:16:72:528:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 Engerman, Mariscal, and Sokoloff (2009) emphasize that the highly unequal societies of late 19th century Latin 
13:352:28460:16:12:72:531:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:America led to elite capture of local and national governments and the formation of institutions – including school 
13:353:28576:12:11:72:541:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:systems – that perpetuated inequality. They contrast this with relatively equal societies of northern United States and 
13:354:28696:11:12:72:499:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:Canada. The political economy model of Go and Lindert (2010) – which assumes a well-functioning local 
13:355:28798:12:11:72:510:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:democracy – generates a positive relationship between inequality and support for public schooling in the 19th 
13:356:28907:11:7:72:352:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:century U.S. because the wealthy, taxable elites were in the minority. 
13:357:28978:7:16:72:533:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:15 For example, and as we examine further below, Wenegast (2010) argues that the traditional landed elite strongly 
13:358:29093:16:0:72:539:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:resisted mass schooling in Imperial and Republican Brazil. As Bandiera and Levy (2010) have also recently pointed 
14:359:29210:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:burden of taxation necessary to fund public schooling frequently reduces elite support for mass 
14:360:29306:27:28:72:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.16 Moreover, local elites may constrain educational opportunities to limit upward 
14:361:29398:28:27:71:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:mobility into elite circles; thereby, allowing them to hold on to power, even if a broadening of 
14:362:29495:27:28:71:465:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:education would fuel economic development (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006).17  
14:363:29571:28:28:108:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:At the same time, exactly who comprises the “local elite,” and their preferences regarding 
14:364:29662:28:27:72:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:publically financed schooling, may be very different in different places and may change within a 
14:365:29759:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:society over time. For example, commercial interests, civic engagement, fears of unrest, or other 
14:366:29857:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:idiosyncratic factors may make some elites willing or especially unwilling to expand educational 
14:367:29954:27:28:72:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and political) opportunities to the local population. Furthermore, significant differences may 
14:368:30050:28:28:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:exist between “national elites” and local ones, and the problem of elite capture may also vary 
14:369:30145:28:27:72:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:between levels of government. As a result, national policies may aim to undermine local elite 
14:370:30239:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:resistance to public schooling or other forms of redistribution.18 Alternatively, weak central 
14:371:30334:28:27:72:495:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments may create openings for local elites to enact their own education policies.  
14:372:30423:27:28:108:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:We argue that differences in what constituted the “elite” in each country are key to 
14:373:30508:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:understanding the variation in the development of schooling across BRIC.  Most models of the 
14:374:30601:27:28:72:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of public education assume an undifferentiated elite, defined by wealth or political 
14:375:30696:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:power (i.e. Gallego, 2010; or Galor and Moav, 2006).19  Hence, such models tend to generate at 
14:376:30791:28:38:72:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:most two equilibriums – one without mass schooling (and privately provided education for the

14:382:31418:7:16:72:535:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:17 In this sense, local or national religious “elites” in many European countries may have resisted efforts at creating 
14:383:31538:16:7:72:429:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:publically funded secular schooling in the late 19th century (West and Woessman, 2008). 
14:384:31626:7:16:72:540:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 Prussia and Meiji Japan possessed strong, centralized governments that enacted and enforced decentralized school

14:386:31790:7:16:72:532:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 Ansell (2010) offers a formal model of public schooling that assumes an existence of an elite that do not wish to 
14:387:31907:16:11:72:540:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:be taxed to finance schooling for the non-elite (due to the burden and to the loss of scarcity rents from skilled labor).

15:390:32169:27:28:72:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:shifting the equilibrium from one to the other. In contrast, we argue and provide evidence that 
15:391:32265:28:27:71:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:local and national elites, or rather their preferences, varied across the four cases. Consequently, 
15:392:32365:27:28:71:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:elite capture – i.e., the shift of policies away from those preferred by the majority – under 
15:393:32459:28:28:71:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralized policymaking resulted in multiple “equilibriums” in the provision of schooling.  
15:394:32554:28:27:107:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:?: Brazil, Russia, India, and China had very different political structures by the early 20th 
15:395:32644:27:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:century. Although each country possessed some form of “elite democracy,” none of the countries 
15:396:32739:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:allowed broad representation in policymaking bodies.20 The absolutism of Qing China gave way 
15:397:32832:27:28:72:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:to some elected bodies after the 1911 revolution, but these highly circumscribed bodies gave 
15:398:32925:28:28:72:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:little voice to the non-elites. Colonial India had no substantive elections before 1919, and British 
15:399:33026:28:27:72:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:officials chaired provincial and local councils with some feedback from appointed locals.  In 
15:400:33120:27:28:72:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Russia, while most provinces possessed quasi-representative local governments after 1864 (the 
15:401:33214:28:27:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:zemstvo – see below), and an elected national assembly existed after 1906, the nobility continued 
15:402:33312:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:to hold sway in both institutions. After 1889, Brazil possessed national and state elections with a 
15:403:33412:28:27:72:435:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:restricted and easily co-opted electorate dominated by various elite groups. 
15:404:33489:27:28:108:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Central governments in all four countries largely absolved themselves from the direct 
15:405:33575:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of public education, and substantial autonomy was devolved, formally or by default, to 
15:406:33672:28:27:72:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:local government institutions. In post-1889 Brazil, a strong form of federalism entailed the 
15:407:33765:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:devolution of fiscal authority – especially export tax revenues – to provinces, which contributed 
15:408:33863:28:27:72:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:to extreme inter-regional disparities in education spending and outcomes. The creation of the 
15:409:33957:27:28:72:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:zemstvo in much of European Russia transferred some property taxes and authority over how to

15:413:34313:16:0:72:320:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:British India was not given a score. See Marshall et al., 2009.

16:415:34471:27:28:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:authority. In China, decentralization was more accidental than policy driven. Political instability 
16:416:34571:28:27:71:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the late Qing and the Republic allowed local actors to take military or political power relative

16:419:34793:28:27:71:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:local governments and influence education policy. However, in the face of relatively low per 
16:420:34886:27:28:71:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:capita incomes among the masses, the unwillingness of most elites to engage in redistributive 
16:421:34980:28:27:71:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:policymaking led to low public financing of primary education, as most models of the political 
16:422:35075:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy of education would suggest (e.g. Ansell, 2010). But variation in local economic and 
16:423:35167:28:28:72:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:social conditions, as well as heterogeneity within the elite, meant that the willingness (or ability) 
16:424:35269:28:27:72:530:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:to fund mass schooling differed from place to place and over time. Furthermore, the possibility 
16:425:35365:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:of mobility into and out of the elite likely influenced policies towards advancing education. For 
16:426:35463:28:27:72:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:instance, in more commercially developed areas of Brazil and China, traditional local elites – 
16:427:35558:27:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:often with roots in land ownership – were under political and economic pressure from newer 
16:428:35649:28:27:72:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups of elites with closer ties to more modern sectors of the economy. It is precisely in those 
16:429:35747:27:28:72:386:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:places where we find governments spending more on education.

16:434:36074:27:28:71:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces and over time in each BRIC country. We, however, acknowledge that a number of 
16:435:36162:28:28:71:515:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:other factors – from income to religion – may have also been important in the emergence of 
16:436:36253:28:0:71:496:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:publically provided primary schooling. At the same time, we do not wish to oversell the 
17:437:36344:0:27:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison between developments in these large countries, because each possessed a primary 
17:438:36435:27:28:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:school system that arose from a specific historical context. In the conclusion, we discuss the 
17:439:36530:28:27:72:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:similarities and differences between the four cases and describe how the development of 
17:440:36618:27:28:72:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:education in these and other less developed and less democratic countries departed from the 
17:441:36710:28:28:72:466:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:model of the United States and other successful nations by the early 20th century.

17:443:36805:27:28:108:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:After independence in 1822, the provision of elementary education in Brazil was 
17:444:36885:28:27:72:510:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralized. The Constitution of 1824 put states in charge of providing publically funded 
17:445:36977:27:28:72:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:elementary education, with some transfers coming from the central government.21 Yet these 
17:446:37067:28:28:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:transfers and other sources of funds available to local governments were relatively low. Hence, 
17:447:37163:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:between 1824 and 1891, the overall level of expenditures and enrollments remained low.  The 
17:448:37255:27:28:72:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:first education data published in the early 1870s show that expenditures per school-age child 
17:449:37349:28:27:72:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:were less than US$ 0.30 (1910 dollars) and enrollment rates were approximately 12 percent of 
17:450:37442:27:28:72:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:the school age population. At that time, there was also wide disparity in funding per student, 
17:451:37537:28:27:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment, and literacy across states. Literacy rates fluctuated from 12 percent in states like 
17:452:37634:27:28:72:470:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Minas Gerais and Paraíba to 26 percent in Pará and Paraná (de Carvalho, 1878).22  
17:453:37716:28:28:107:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Until 1878, the Brazilian education system was similar to that of Russia in that all of the 
17:454:37808:28:27:71:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:4,500 public schools included Catholicism as a core part of the curriculum, and there were also 
17:455:37904:27:28:71:506:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:721 private schools that were mostly Catholic parochial schools. These public and private 
17:456:37994:28:41:71:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools were located predominantly in states controlled by the landed elites that dominated

17:458:38142:7:16:72:503:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 Prior to 1889, state-level legislation often put the actual provision of schools and teachers in the hands of 
17:459:38255:16:12:71:536:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:municipalities and other local government bodies. These entitites financed education with property and commercial 
17:460:38369:12:11:71:523:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:taxes. For a brief discussion of local public finances in São Paulo in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, see de 
17:461:38489:11:7:71:223:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:Carvalho Filho and Colistete (2010).  
17:462:38527:7:16:72:534:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 Slavery and the limited demand for skilled labor in the agrarian and commodity-driven Brazilian economy likely 
17:463:38641:16:0:72:339:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:reduced demand for even basic education in the mid-19th century.  
18:464:38710:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:politics during the colonial period (e.g., the sugar elite of Pernambuco). Moreover, these schools 
18:465:38809:27:28:72:491:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:served the children of the free, mostly white population of Brazil (de Carvalho, 1878).  
18:466:38898:28:27:108:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:A significant decentralization of Brazilian public finances occurred after 1891. Before the 
18:467:38990:27:28:72:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Constitution of 1891, the federal government collected the majority of taxes (mostly from 
18:468:39080:28:28:72:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:exports and imports) and spent most of the total budget in the capital or on defense (Villela, 
18:469:39175:28:27:72:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:2007). The new Constitution gave states the sole right to tax exports, property, industries and 
18:470:39271:27:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:professions, land transfers, and other transactions. Just the transfer of the right to tax exports 
18:471:39370:28:27:72:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the central government to the states significantly increased revenues at the state level 
18:472:39464:27:28:72:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Martinez-Fritscher, 2009). Furthermore, articles 55 and 56 of the Constitution also gave 
18:473:39554:28:28:72:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:autonomy to municipalities to organize public finances, collect taxes, and spend on schools if 
18:474:39649:28:27:71:179:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:they wished to do so.  
18:475:39672:27:28:107:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Following this fiscal decentralization, the elementary school system in Brazil improved 
18:476:39760:28:27:72:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:steadily over the four decades of the Republic (1889-1930) as states used their new fiscal 
18:477:39851:27:28:72:509:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:authority to increase education funding. Literacy increased from less than 20 percent to 40 
18:478:39943:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent, and enrollment rates went from 12 percent to 23 percent by 1930.23 Education levels, 
18:479:40037:27:28:71:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, were still low compared to other countries, and expenditures per school age population 
18:480:40133:28:28:71:500:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:were small (Table 1). We interpret the high level of expenditures per enrolled student (in 
18:481:40224:28:27:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison to low overall expenditures) and the low enrollment rate as evidence of the persistent 
18:482:40322:27:57:71:304:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:elite bias against publically provided education.

18:484:40428:8:16:72:521:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 There were some efforts at improving the quality of education prior to these changes in fiscal federalism. The 
18:485:40542:16:11:72:525:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:Ministry of the Interior pushed for a shift away from the Lancaster system of education and improvements in the 
18:486:40654:11:12:72:518:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:quality of teacher preparation after 1878. However, the limited resources invested in these efforts reduced their 
18:487:40768:12:11:71:492:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:effectiveness and the decentralization of education allowed states to adopt only the reforms they deemed 
18:488:40873:11:12:71:522:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:appropriate. There is evidence that in states controlled by more positivist Republican elites, schools modernized 
18:489:40987:12:11:71:533:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:more rapidly, including subjects like science, math, and physical education as individual courses sometimes taught 
18:490:41102:11:0:71:306:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:by different teachers. See Martinez-Fritscher et al. (2010). 
19:491:41166:0:27:108:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:One important outcome of Brazil’s decentralization of tax revenues was that more trade 
19:492:41253:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:oriented states ended up spending more on education, as they were able to collect greater export 
19:493:41350:28:27:72:506:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:taxes. Indeed, the amount of the revenues collected depended on the exact export mix and 
19:494:41439:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:international commodity prices. States such as Para and Amazonas saw greater revenues because 
19:495:41533:28:28:72:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:they exported high value wild rubber; São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais exported 
19:496:41624:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:coffee, which saw rising prices in the late 19th century; but other states like Pernambuco and 
19:497:41719:27:28:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bahia exported primarily sugar in the face of falling international prices. According to Martinez-
19:498:41817:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fritscher et al (2010) the correlation between exports per capita and expenditures on education is 
19:499:41916:27:28:72:381:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:almost 0.6, even after controlling for basic state characteristics.  
19:500:41985:28:28:108:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:The variation in commercial orientation among Brazilian states is similar to what we find 
19:501:42075:28:27:72:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:for China, where the elites in provinces with maritime ports had incentives to spend more on 
19:502:42168:27:28:72:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:education to improve the skills of the local labor force. In Brazil, higher exports per capita 
19:503:42263:28:27:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:usually led state elites to invest more on education. Exports were positively associated with 
19:504:42357:27:28:71:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:income level, but merchants, trading companies, and small industries in more commercially 
19:505:42447:28:27:71:370:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:developed areas also required a larger pool of educated labor. 
19:506:42510:27:28:107:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Decentralization of export tax revenues cannot explain all of the variation in Brazilian 
19:507:42599:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling in the Republican period. Similar to what we observe in the other BRIC countries, the 
19:508:42695:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in education expenditures and enrollment rates in Brazil was closely related to specific 
19:509:42794:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives of local (state) elites.24 Topik (1989), and others have emphasized that in the late 19th 
19:510:42894:28:27:71:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:century, the traditional Imperial landed elites increasingly splintered into local and regional 
19:511:42990:27:28:71:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups, often with ties to new export sectors.  Heterogeneity also existed in the extent to which 
19:512:43088:28:20:71:505:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:local elites were able or willing to capture state and municipal governments. In particular,

19:514:43237:8:16:72:530:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 After 1889, the structures of muncipal politics and revenues echoed those at the state level. As a result, many of 
19:515:43355:16:11:72:506:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:the factors driving the state-level variation that we emphasize here are evident at the municipal level as well 
19:516:43467:11:0:72:224:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Carvalho Filho and Colistete, 2010). 
20:517:43508:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in the rate of mass political participation in local and national elections influenced the 
20:518:43609:27:28:72:412:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:scope of elite capture and education policies in the Republican period. 
20:519:43681:28:27:107:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Before 1889, state politicians had few incentives to provide mass education because the 
20:520:43769:27:28:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:electoral system minimized political accountability and limited participation to a few. Between 
20:521:43865:28:28:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 1820s and the 1880s Brazil was a constitutional monarchy with a handpicked senate, and 
20:522:43956:28:27:72:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:congressmen and municipal governments elected by a few voters who passed stringent income 
20:523:44046:27:28:72:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:and literacy requirements to vote. A reform in 1881 eliminated indirect elections through 
20:524:44136:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:electoral colleges and introduced secret ballots and direct elections for all electoral posts (except 
20:525:44238:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:senate seats). Then, between 1889 and 1890, the Republican movement overthrew the monarchy 
20:526:44329:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:and introduced direct elections for president and governors. The income requirement to vote was 
20:527:44425:28:27:72:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:eliminated and replaced with a stricter literacy requirement.25 After 1889, states with a larger 
20:528:44522:27:28:72:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of voters as a percentage of the population saw higher education expenditures. This 
20:529:44613:28:27:71:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests a positive relationship between political voice and education, one where elites spent 
20:530:44708:27:28:71:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:more on education to increase the number of voters, rather than greater political participation 
20:531:44804:28:27:71:354:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly leading to larger investments in public schooling.  
20:532:44865:27:28:107:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:In other contexts, Engerman, Mariscal and Sokoloff (2009) and Lindert (2004) have 
20:533:44947:28:28:71:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:argued that the causality goes from franchise expansion to expenditures on education. In Brazil, 
20:534:45044:28:27:71:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, competition in presidential elections created incentives for state politicians and parties 
20:535:45144:27:28:71:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:to increase expenditures on education as a way to increase the number of literate white male 
20:536:45237:28:27:71:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:voters, either through adult education in the short run, or through public primary education for 
20:537:45334:27:28:71:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:children over the long run (Martinez Fritscher et al., 2010). The incentives to do this emerged 
20:538:45430:28:28:71:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:because the federal executive and the ruling coalition in Congress during the Republic were 
20:539:45522:28:15:71:525:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:under the control of the Republican parties of the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Elites

20:541:45674:8:0:72:424:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:25 After 1889, voters had to write their names and birthdates to get a voter registry card. 
21:542:45769:0:27:72:500:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:and their political allies in these and other states used their capacity to mobilize voters in 
21:543:45864:27:28:72:479:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:presidential elections as a bargaining chip with this dominant coalition in the federal 
21:544:45952:28:27:72:518:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:government.  In exchange, they received transfers, less political or military intervention, and 
21:545:46048:27:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:support during elections against opposition parties in their respective states.26  Since Congress 
21:546:46146:28:28:71:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:scrutinized elections and electoral disputes, it was easy for the ruling coalition to disqualify 
21:547:46243:28:27:71:338:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:unwanted opposition in state elections (Porto, 2002). 27 
21:548:46299:27:28:107:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:The importance of elite electoral control via educational policies is evident when we look 
21:549:46390:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:closer at state-level differences. For example, the state of Pará had twice the export tax revenues 
21:550:46490:27:28:72:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:per capita as São Paulo, yet it spent less than half of what São Paulo spent on education per 
21:551:46584:28:28:72:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:school age population. The pressure São Paulo elites felt to mobilize a larger electorate to 
21:552:46677:28:27:72:541:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:maintain their influence at the federal level led state politicians to increase education spending as 
21:553:46779:27:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:a way to increase the number of voters.28 In contrast, the small political elite in Pará represented 
21:554:46880:28:97:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the interests of rubber exporters, who were not politicians with national aspirations. There was

21:556:47033:8:16:72:510:272:42:Times:100:Times:F:26 On the evolution of electoral politics and this “politics of governors” system in the late 19th and early 20th 
21:557:47147:16:11:72:503:256:100:Times:100:Times:F:centuries, see Love (1980). He goes on to note that this quasi-patronage system extended to lower levels of 
21:558:47255:11:7:72:127:245:100:Times:100:Times:F:government.  
21:559:47268:7:16:72:541:238:42:Times:100:Times:F:27 The demand for skilled labor by industrialists or immigrant demand for schools may have also increased pressures 
21:560:47384:16:12:72:515:222:100:Times:100:Times:F:for education in particular locations (i.e., São Paulo), but these pressures were not that important in Brazil as a 
21:561:47500:12:11:72:541:210:100:Times:100:Times:F:whole, because industrialization did not occur with technology that was especially complementary with skilled labor 
21:562:47616:11:12:72:533:199:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Goldin and Katz, 1998). Moreover, the bulk of immigrants that went to Brazil between 1889 and 1930 came from 
21:563:47726:12:11:72:523:187:100:Times:100:Times:F:Italy, Spain, and Portugal (with Germans only in fourth place), countries that Lindert (2004) associates with low 
21:564:47840:11:12:72:535:176:100:Times:100:Times:F:expenditures on education. De Carvalho Filho and Colistete (2010) find evidence that the presence of more foreign-
21:565:47954:12:11:72:517:164:100:Times:100:Times:F:born farm workers was associated with greater municipal spending on education in São Paulo at the turn of the 
21:566:48064:11:12:72:496:153:100:Times:100:Times:F:century, but econometric work at the state level shows no correlation between immigration and education 
21:567:48168:12:7:72:254:141:100:Times:100:Times:F:expenditures (Martinez-Fritscher et al.2010). 
21:568:48214:7:16:72:540:134:42:Times:100:Times:F:28 In contrast, local political bosses (coronéis) in the state of São Paulo did not need to increase the number of voters 
21:569:48336:16:11:71:522:118:100:Times:100:Times:F:as a way to win local elections. The Republican Party of São Paulo won sweeping victories in all local elections 
21:570:48449:11:12:71:540:107:100:Times:100:Times:F:during the Republican period. Yet, the Republican Party of São Paulo needed to show its capacity to mobilize voters 
21:571:48565:12:11:71:537:95:100:Times:100:Times:F:in national elections as a way to convince the Republican Party of Minas Gerais to keep them in the ruling coalition 
21:572:48682:11:0:71:381:84:100:Times:100:Times:F:(their coalition broke twice during the Republican period). See Love (1980).  
22:573:48763:0:27:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:no significant threat from local opposition or federal authorities to cause the state’s governors to 
22:574:48864:27:28:72:376:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase education spending to mobilize voters for elections.29  
22:575:48929:28:27:108:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:The majority of investment in education between 1889 and 1930 came from state 
22:576:49007:27:28:72:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments, and this is where we see the variation in elite interests and behavior having the 
22:577:49102:28:28:72:509:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:largest impact. While many decisions over building and staffing schools were delegated to 
22:578:49192:28:27:72:506:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:community and municipal education officials, municipality-financed schools only held 25 
22:579:49280:27:28:72:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of total enrollment in the country at the turn of the century, and most policymaking 
22:580:49373:28:27:72:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:remained under the authority of the state government. States were able to provide the bulk of 
22:581:49467:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:public school finances because the majority of them collected significant revenues from taxes on 
22:582:49564:28:28:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:exports; while municipalities collected more limited property and land transfer taxes. Although 
22:583:49660:28:27:72:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites avoided sending their children to public schools, enrollment in private schools was only 20 
22:584:49759:27:28:72:488:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of total primary enrollment, and, over time, municipal and private schools lost 
22:585:49847:28:27:72:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollments to state schools. That did not mean that state schools were equally available to all 
22:586:49944:27:28:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazilians. Census data shows that the cohort of students who attended elementary schools in 
22:587:50037:28:27:72:495:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazil between 1900 and 1920 were mostly white Brazilians, even though a third of the 
22:588:50123:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:population was composed of blacks and mixed race citizens (Martinez-Fritscher et al., 2010). 
22:589:50216:28:28:108:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:The case of the state of Pernambuco also illustrates how variation in elite behavior 
22:590:50301:28:27:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:influenced educational policies. In overwhelmingly rural Pernambuco, the traditional landed 
22:591:50393:27:28:72:489:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites dominated politics. Most of the local political elites that portrayed themselves as 
22:592:50484:28:27:72:538:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:“Republican,” were in fact the same families, which controlled state and local politics during the 
22:593:50583:27:28:72:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:Imperial period. Rural political bosses, coronéis, mobilized voters using a combination of 
22:594:50674:28:20:72:513:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:violence and patronage. This elite behavior existed in other states, including São Paulo, but 
22:595:50768:20:8:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
22:596:50824:8:16:72:542:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:29 For further accounts of elite conflict and dominance across states in Brazil see De Souza (1984). Like Love (1980) 
22:597:50942:16:11:72:535:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:and others, we emphasize the central policymaking role of the state governors. We estimated electoral participation 
22:598:51058:11:0:72:331:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:rates using the voting data reported in the Diario do Congresso.  
23:599:51127:0:27:72:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:elsewhere, political pressure from local voters, national political competition, and greater 
23:600:51220:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercial opportunities provided different incentives that led to better education outcomes. 
23:601:51314:28:27:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Elites in Pernambuco, in contrast, controlled power with patronage, did not face intense political 
23:602:51413:27:28:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition, and were not exposed to a major commercial boom because its main export, sugar, 
23:603:51506:28:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:faced stagnant prices from the late 19th century onwards. Thus, the government in this state had 
23:604:51603:28:27:72:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:one of the lowest expenditures on education and did not see any major improvement in literacy 
23:605:51697:27:28:72:249:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates during the period 1889-1930.30 
23:606:51733:28:27:108:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:In the Brazilian case, the significant regional variation in expenditures and enrollment 
23:607:51822:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:was related to state-level differences in export tax revenues and the political incentives of elites. 
23:608:51924:28:28:72:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:These factors often determined whether and how the dominant elite in a state (or municipality) 
23:609:52019:28:27:72:509:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:captured the local electoral system and influenced (and financed) educational policy. Even 
23:610:52110:27:28:72:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:though Brazil had a lower GDP per capita than Russia in 1910, public expenditures per pupil 
23:611:52202:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceeded those in Russia, perhaps because local elites were less constrained by higher levels of 
23:612:52299:27:28:72:490:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:government and perceived greater rewards in directing expenditures toward education. 
23:613:52384:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Moreover, the provision of education in Brazil shares certain parallels to China where again local 
23:614:52483:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites successfully expanded public education to meet their economic needs for skilled labor.

24:626:53423:27:28:108:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:As in the other BRIC, the primary explanation for the low provision of basic schooling is 
24:627:53513:28:28:72:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:that Tsarist Russia was poor, and both private and public funding for education were limited as a 
24:628:53611:28:27:72:543:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:result. Per capita income levels in the countryside or among the urban working classes were quite 
24:629:53709:27:28:72:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:low (Table 1).32 Until the last decades of the period, the central government, primarily through 
24:630:53805:28:27:71:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Ministry of Education (the MNP) and the state-sponsored Orthodox leadership (the Holy 
24:631:53895:27:28:72:374:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Synod), provided only limited funding for primary schooling.  
24:632:53957:28:28:108:505:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:In 1861, neither central nor local state authorities in Russia expended much public 
24:633:54041:28:27:72:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:attention or money on education. Private schools and tutors catered to the landed and urban 
24:634:54133:27:28:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites, while only a small number of villages and towns (and even fewer serf owners) supported 
24:635:54228:28:27:72:511:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary schools out of their own resources. In 1864, the state established an administrative 
24:636:54321:27:28:71:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:structure for oversight of the Empire’s schools under the MNP, but this reform did not entail the 
24:637:54419:28:27:71:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:release of any new resources from the center, nor did it extend to the thousands of schools under 
24:638:54517:27:28:71:253:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the supervision of the Holy Synod.33  
24:639:54555:28:28:108:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Over the ensuing fifty years, conflict emerged between the MNP, the Holy Synod, and 
24:640:54639:28:38:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:local actors over control of primary education, as decentralized policymaking was never fully

24:642:54789:8:16:72:535:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:31 On pre-1917 literacy, see Mironov (1991). Over 50 percent of the population older then 9 years old was recorded 
24:643:54904:16:7:72:298:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:as literate in the 1926 census (Perrie and Davies, 1991). 
24:644:54962:7:16:72:523:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:32 Tables 2 and 3 show that the richer Baltic, Capital, Central Industrial, and “New” Russian provinces exhibited 
24:645:55076:16:11:72:535:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:higher expenditures per school-age child and greater enrollment rates. Despite possibly high returns to education in 
24:646:55193:11:12:72:531:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:agriculture, a greater share of the population in agricultural employment was associated with lower investments in 
24:647:55308:12:7:72:516:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:schooling (Nafziger, “Political,” 2011). On per capita income levels over our time period, see Gregory (1982). 
24:648:55419:7:16:72:516:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:33 The 1864 Reform granted the right to open primary schools to state ministries, to the Holy Synod, to private 
24:649:55531:16:11:72:520:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:citizens, and to towns and rural communities. Formally, these different entities were supposed to submit school 
24:650:55643:11:12:72:529:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:proposals for approval by newly created district school councils. Prior to 1861, the Ministry of State Domains did 
24:651:55758:12:11:72:531:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:make some efforts to encourage basic education among the state peasantry, but these attempts were ill-funded and 
24:652:55871:11:0:72:209:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:resulted in relatively few schools. 
25:653:55910:0:27:72:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:endorsed by the central authorities. The MNP slowly expanded control over curriculum and 
25:654:55999:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:teaching personnel until the early 1880s, when reactionary policies led to a shift towards church 
25:655:56097:28:27:72:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:control of schooling during the last years of Alexander III’s reign (1881-1894).34 But under 
25:656:56190:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nicholas II, the MNP responded to the growing public awareness of Russia’s poor educational 
25:657:56282:28:28:71:499:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:record by expanding its school inspection system and increasing its involvement in local 
25:658:56371:28:27:71:508:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:educational affairs. With the Educational Statute of 1908, the MNP formally took over the 
25:659:56461:27:28:71:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:management of all primary schools in the Empire. This late shift towards centralization was 
25:660:56553:28:27:71:482:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:accompanied by an increase in state funding to subsidize local efforts at building and 
25:661:56640:27:28:71:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:maintaining schools. This brought total central government spending on primary education from 
25:662:56734:28:28:71:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:less than 0.6 percent of the state’s budget in 1902 to just over 2.2 percent in 1913 (Hans, 1964; 
25:663:56832:28:27:71:499:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Nafziger, “Financing,’ 2011). Although significant in comparison to the other BRIC 
25:664:56919:27:28:71:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries, this was a small increase when compared to the United Kingdom, for example, where 
25:665:57012:28:27:71:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:central government spending on human capital investments accounted for 16.1 percent of total 
25:666:57105:27:28:71:353:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures in 1910-12 (Davis and Huttenback, 1986).35  
25:667:57162:28:27:107:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:While local education policies were subject to interference from above, the funding of 
25:668:57249:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Russian primary schools was decentralized to local communities and sub-provincial governments 
25:669:57343:28:28:71:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior to the 1890s. For many “public” schools, a village or town assessed its own citizens to fund 
25:670:57442:28:27:71:494:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the construction or rental of a building and to pay someone to provide instruction. Such 
25:671:57531:27:23:71:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:arrangements may have suffered from significant collective action problems, including intra-

25:673:57679:7:16:72:533:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:34 Throughout the post-reform period, religious instruction remained a core component in the curriculum of almost 
25:674:57793:16:12:72:540:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:every primary school. Schools in the Holy Synod’s system generally had instruction provided by the local priest and 
25:675:57909:12:11:72:542:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:were financed by local (community) contributions. It was during Alexander III’s reign that the parochial system took 
25:676:58026:11:12:72:533:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:over many of the remaining informal peasant literacy schools (shkoly gramotnye). On the evolution of institutional 
25:677:58141:12:7:72:498:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:control over schooling, see Eklof (1986), Nafziger (“Political,” 2011), Sinel (1972), and Sorenson (1992). 
25:678:58248:7:16:72:528:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:35 In Davis and Huttenback (1986), education is the dominant category of human capital expenditures, which also 
25:679:58360:16:11:72:531:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:include spending on medicine, charity, relief, and immigration.  and on occasion religion. It is unclear whether the 
25:680:58477:11:12:71:532:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:numbers for UK include the National Insurance Act of 1911, which may bias their expenditures upwards. Even so, 
25:681:58588:12:11:71:540:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:human capital expenditures accounted for 11.6 percent of the budget in the earlier period between 1905-09 and were 
25:682:58703:11:0:71:387:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:consistently larger than the Russian average in the 19th and early 20th century.  
26:683:58788:0:27:72:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:community conflicts between groups (ethnic, religious, wealth, generational, etc.) that held 
26:684:58881:27:28:72:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:different preferences over schooling. In towns and cities, local elites continued to send their 
26:685:58977:28:27:72:484:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:children to private academies rather than the public school (e.g. Lieven, 1989). In the 
26:686:59065:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:countryside, the largest property owners – the landed gentry, merchants, and rich townsmen – 
26:687:59158:28:28:72:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:were not liable for local assessments by exclusively peasant institutions.36 In the absence of more 
26:688:59258:28:27:72:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:formal local fiscal mechanisms for enforcing contributions from larger property owners, funding 
26:689:59354:27:28:72:352:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:for rural primary education would have remained limited. 
26:690:59411:28:27:108:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:For a large part of European Russia, a newly created, all-class institution of local self-
26:691:59501:27:28:72:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:government known as the zemstvo functioned as just such a mechanism. A reform of 1864 
26:692:59587:28:28:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:established district and provincial-level zemstvo in 34 of the 50 provinces of European Russia, a 
26:693:59685:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:region that included most of the Russian heartland. Members of zemstvo assemblies were elected 
26:694:59780:27:28:72:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:by different groups of property owners: private rural property owners (mostly from the landed 
26:695:59874:28:27:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:nobility), owners of urban property, and peasant communes. These new bodies were granted the 
26:696:59967:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:power to levy property taxes on all local land holdings and fixed capital. Moreover, the zemstvo 
26:697:60063:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:was explicitly called on to engage in programs encouraging local economic development, a 
26:698:60152:27:28:72:301:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:calling that quickly came to include education.  
26:699:60201:28:28:108:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Although intended to include representation from all social classes, the zemstva electoral 
26:700:60292:28:27:72:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:system was biased in favor of the local non-peasant elites. Peasants were allocated few seats 
26:701:60386:27:28:72:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative to their population shares, and the elections that did occur frequently attracted little 
26:702:60484:28:41:72:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest or simply reinforced the existing structure of political power. Therefore, the policies

26:704:60637:7:16:72:522:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:36 Township-level units of peasant self-government (volosti) also contributed to primary school funding in some 
26:705:60749:16:12:72:542:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:areas, although their contributions were less than direct expenditures by village communities. While initiative for the 
26:706:60869:12:11:72:539:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:school often came from the village itself, township authorities frequently stepped in to fund the initial outlays out of 
26:707:60990:11:12:72:482:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:their own tax collections. According to data on local government expenditures in 1905, rural societies 
26:708:61093:12:11:72:534:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:(administrative versions of the traditional peasant commune) in European Russia spent about two times as much as 
26:709:61206:11:0:72:535:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:township governments did on education: 4 million vs. 2 million rubles. See Russia. Statisticheskoe, Mirskie, 1909.  
27:710:61325:0:27:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:enacted by a given zemstvo were frequently dictated by the composition of the private propertied 
27:711:61422:27:28:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:elite that formed the assembly majority (Nafziger, “Did,” 2011). The resulting heterogeneity of 
27:712:61518:28:27:72:536:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:this form of local “elite democracy,” coupled with the absence of the zemstvo in 16 provinces of 
27:713:61615:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:European Russia, helps explain the variation in expenditures on education evident in Table 3.37 
27:714:61710:28:28:107:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:Where the institution existed, zemstvo funds came to supplant financing from rural 
27:715:61793:28:27:71:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:communities. Between 1880 and 1894, the share of total expenditures on rural primary schools 
27:716:61886:27:28:71:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(in European Russia) undertaken by village communities – either directly or through the local 
27:717:61980:28:27:71:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Orthodox parish – fell from 36 to 18 percent.38 In provinces that did not possess zemstvo, village 
27:718:62079:27:28:71:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and township) and town governments held almost all responsibility for school funding. In these 
27:719:62175:28:28:71:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces, not only was spending on primary education per capita less (about 10 percent lower in 
27:720:62272:28:27:71:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:1911), but enrollments and the growth in the number of formal schools per 1000 people were 
27:721:62363:27:28:71:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:also lower. This variation is reflected in Tables 2 and 3, where the non-zemstvo right-bank 
27:722:62455:28:27:71:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ukraine and Byelorussian provinces exhibited lower spending and lower enrollments.39  
27:723:62541:27:28:107:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Therefore, the decentralized “democracy” of the zemstvo seemed to have supported 
27:724:62622:28:27:71:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater investments in public education. Those districts where the zemstvo assemblies included 
27:725:62717:27:28:71:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively more representatives from peasant communities exhibited greater spending on primary 
27:726:62812:28:28:71:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools that catered to the rural majority. But this correlation was strongest in those districts that 
27:727:62915:28:15:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:also possessed a greater number of nobles with small-sized holdings. In contrast to the traditional 
27:728:63015:15:8:71:219:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
27:729:63071:8:16:72:541:216:42:Times:100:Times:F:37 Other factors – religion, economic structure, etc. – contributed to this variation beyond income differences and the 
27:730:63191:16:11:72:538:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:zemstva (Nafziger, “Political,” 2011). The interaction between communal villages, township authorities, and district 
27:731:63308:11:12:72:530:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:and provincial administrators varied substantially across European Russia, even within the non-zemstvo region. In 
27:732:63422:12:7:72:371:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:the Baltics, all rural education finance came from township governments.  
27:733:63496:7:16:72:524:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:38 As early as 1879, over 40 percent of funds allocated to rural primary education in European Russia came from 
27:734:63608:16:11:72:519:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:zemstvo budgets. By 1894, this share had reached 54 percent. These and other numbers on rural primary school 
27:735:63717:11:12:72:535:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:expenditures are taken from ibid. By 1905, provincial and district zemstvo were spending approximately 25 million 
27:736:63831:12:11:72:502:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:rubles on education, or about 4 times the expenditures of all townships and rural societies together (Russia, 
27:737:63941:11:12:72:504:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:Statisticheskoe, Dokhody, 1909). Expenditures on primary education occasionally took the form of loans to 
27:738:64047:12:7:72:520:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:communities; but, more often, spending involved grants and the direct hiring of teachers as zemstvo employees. 
27:739:64158:7:16:72:538:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:39 In 1911, enrollment rates (out of the school age population) were 3.5 percent higher (32.9 versus 29.4) in zemstvo 
27:740:64275:16:11:72:533:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:provinces. Between 1860 and 1911, the annualized rate of growth in the number of formal schools was 6.5 percent 
27:741:64387:11:0:72:415:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:in non-zemstvo and 7.5 percent in zemstvo provinces. See Nafziger, “Political,” 2011.

28:744:64667:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:historians have labeled “zemstvo liberalism,” which tended to support broader schooling for the 
28:745:64763:27:28:71:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:masses. The imperfect democracy embedded in the zemstvo meant that the composition of the 
28:746:64853:28:28:71:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:local property-owning elite was critical in determining the level of decentralized school 
28:747:64943:28:27:71:240:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision (Nafziger, “Did,” 2011). 
28:748:64978:27:28:107:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:Similar to British India, the heterogeneity of the Russian population limited the 
28:749:65060:28:27:71:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:development of public schooling. This was especially true in peripheral areas where the zemstvo 
28:750:65155:27:28:71:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:did not exist. Peasants in these areas maintained informal or confessional schools that relied 
28:751:65250:28:28:71:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:exclusively on community contributions and were often of poor quality.41 In contrast, the 
28:752:65340:28:27:72:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:consolidation of local fiscal authority in the zemstvo enabled some catch-up growth in rural 
28:753:65433:27:28:72:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling by overcoming collective action problems and allowing a broader tax base to be 
28:754:65522:28:27:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:tapped. This was more likely to take place where the composition of the nobility involved in the 
28:755:65619:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:zemstvo was favorable to mass education and willing to help foot the bill (even though most of 
28:756:65714:28:41:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:these nobles utilized private education for their own children).42 We focus here on the distinction 
28:757:65814:41:7:72:219:281:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
28:758:65870:7:16:72:541:274:42:Times:100:Times:F:40 Although he was from a slightly earlier period, the character of Konstantin Levin in Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina 
28:759:65985:16:7:72:531:258:100:Times:100:Times:F:provides an example of such a liberal noble estate owner. We thank a referee for reminding us of this comparison. 
28:760:66099:7:16:72:530:251:42:Times:100:Times:F:41 This was especially true among Jewish and Muslim communities, which preferred to maintain informal schools 
28:761:66209:16:12:72:524:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:rather than give up any authority over education. By 1894, there were still 16779 informal literacy schools, 5949 
28:762:66323:12:11:72:514:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:Jewish kheders, and 11589 Islamic madrases in the Empire. Comparing the 1894 and 1911 data for peripheral 
28:763:66429:11:12:72:536:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:provinces in European Russia suggests that despite aggressive efforts by the MNP, many informal religious schools 
28:764:66543:12:11:72:528:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:remained outside the formal administration system in 1911. Inequality or other forms of heterogeneity among the 
28:765:66655:11:12:72:514:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:peasantry likely compounded local collective action problems when it came to the local financing of a school. 
28:766:66765:12:11:72:525:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:However, the fact that many peasant communinities did support informal or village-funded schools suggests that 
28:767:66876:11:7:72:533:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:there was considerable demand for basic education, perhaps independent of its economic return (see Eklof, 1986).. 
28:768:66990:7:16:72:522:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:42 Most zemstvo funding for education went towards rural primary schools that catered almost exclusively to the 
28:769:67102:16:12:72:538:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:peasantry – local nobility and other social classes sent few of their children to such village schools. For more on the 
28:770:67222:12:11:72:520:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:internal debates within the zemstvo over schooling, see Nafziger (“Did,” 2011; and “Political,” 2011) and Eklof 
28:771:67334:11:12:72:516:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:(1986). The actually decisions to build school, hire staff, or change curriculum generally resided with the local 
28:772:67448:12:11:72:527:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:school district committees, which often included representatives of the zemstvo and relied on zemstvo funding for 
28:773:67562:11:12:72:532:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:their initiatives. These and other bodies involved in education policies were all subject to intervention by powerful 
28:774:67680:12:11:72:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:local elites and outside bureaucrats. Of course, even where the peasantry held more power in the zemstvo or other 
28:775:67794:11:0:72:439:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:local institutions, their representatives may not have given voice to their (median) interests. 
29:776:67893:0:27:72:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the traditional nobility and a growing group of more liberal ‘middling’ gentry, but 
29:777:67985:27:28:72:502:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:ethnicity, religion, profession, and other characteristics also divided the local elite. These 
29:778:68080:28:27:72:512:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:divisions varied regionally and over time, especially as economic development reduced the 
29:779:68170:27:28:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:competitive viability of agriculture in less productive areas, and trade and industrial growth 
29:780:68265:28:28:72:456:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:generated newly wealthy elites elsewhere (Becker, 1985; and Hamburg, 1984).  
29:781:68342:28:27:108:506:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:Decentralization, variation in local democracy, and characteristics of the elite help 
29:782:68428:27:28:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:explain the within-country differences in Russian public primary schooling by the early 20th 
29:783:68520:28:27:71:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:century. Other factors – such as the religious composition of the population, the level of 
29:784:68611:27:28:71:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercial development, and the institutional legacy of serfdom – contributed to this variation, 
29:785:68708:28:28:71:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:and these factors had parallels in the experiences of India and China. However, we view the 
29:786:68800:28:27:71:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative success of Russia among the BRIC countries as the outcome of slightly higher per capita 
29:787:68897:27:28:71:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:income and the increased financial involvement of the central government after the mid-1890s. 
29:788:68991:28:27:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Intriguingly, the timing of the acceleration of central government spending – especially with the 
29:789:69089:27:28:71:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Education Act of 1908 – suggests that the advent of a limited form of national elections (for the 
29:790:69187:28:27:71:506:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Duma) after the revolution of 1905 may have had positive consequences for schooling.43   
29:791:69276:27:28:108:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Similar to all the BRIC, but especially the Brazilian case, Russian political reforms led to 
29:792:69369:28:28:72:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:more resources being invested in public schooling, specifically through the decentralization of 
29:793:69465:28:27:72:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal resources (via the zemstvo) in those areas where local elites founds it in their interest to 
29:794:69565:27:28:72:501:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:support education. But unlike the Brazilian case (or India and China, for that matter), the 
29:795:69657:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased fiscal and policy involvement of the central government appears to have catalyzed a 
29:796:69751:27:25:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:shift towards widespread schooling. However, despite these gains, primary education in Russia

29:798:69901:8:16:72:533:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:43 Duma voting rights were limited by property ownership and social estate, but the parliaments that met in the last 
29:799:70018:16:11:72:520:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:decade of the Tsarist regime included peasant and non-elites representatives and possessed some central budget 
29:800:70129:11:12:72:508:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:oversight. The broader political participation at the national level after 1905 may have partially overcome or 
29:801:70240:12:11:72:529:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:compensated for local elite resistance to schooling in particular regions, a shift that fits the frameworks of Lindert 
29:802:70359:11:0:72:184:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2004) and Gallego (2010). 
30:803:70389:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared unfavorably with other parts of Europe by World War I. The achievement of near-
30:804:70477:27:28:72:497:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:universal primary schooling in Russia only occurred in the 1930s under a decidedly non-
30:805:70564:28:27:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:democratic Soviet regime that left little autonomy to local governments (Fitzpatrick, 1979).44   
30:806:70661:27:28:71:119:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.3 India 
30:807:70671:28:28:107:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:?: By the early 20th century, India had made limited progress in increasing mass primary 
30:808:70757:28:27:72:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:education. Crude literacy rates were under 10 percent and less than 1 in 10 children of ages 5 to 
30:809:70855:27:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:14 was enrolled in any primary school. Only China had a lower enrollment rate, but even China 
30:810:70949:28:27:72:499:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:had higher spending per school age population. A relatively low level of GDP per capita 
30:811:71037:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:certainly constrained the amount of public and private funds available for education, but low 
30:812:71131:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:income alone cannot explain the low spending. Public educational spending in areas under direct 
30:813:71227:28:27:72:541:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:colonial control (British India, which accounted for almost two thirds of the Indian subcontinent) 
30:814:71326:27:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:was among the lowest in the world, lower than countries at similar levels of development and 
30:815:71419:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:even lower than neighboring Indian ‘Princely States’ under indirect colonial control (Davis and 
30:816:71515:27:28:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Huttenback, 1986). The following discussion focuses on the constraints in British India.45   
30:817:71607:28:27:108:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:British officials were cognizant of the inadequate provision of schooling. Official reports 
30:818:71699:27:28:71:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:often bemoaned the low levels of spending, but the goal of extending mass education was never 
30:819:71793:28:28:71:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:seriously promoted (Nurullah and Naik, 1951; Chaudhary, 2009). As a dependent colony, any 
30:820:71883:28:27:71:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential benefits of educating a large share of the population were outweighed by both the 
30:821:71975:27:34:71:511:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:monetary costs (additional taxes to fund public education) and the non-monetary costs (the 
30:822:72066:34:8:71:219:178:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
30:823:72122:8:16:72:515:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:44 School enrollments actually decreased in the chaotic early 1920s before recovering by the end of the decade 
30:824:72233:16:11:72:520:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Holmes, 1989). Soviet authorities then passed compulsory schooling laws, which led to near universal primary 
30:825:72343:11:7:72:193:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:enrollment by the mid-1930s. 
30:826:72372:7:16:72:539:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:45 The Princely States were local kingdoms of varying size ruled by individual kings that maintained their autonomy 
30:827:72488:16:12:72:535:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:in local affairs while deferring to colonial authority in matters of defense and foreign policy. Although many of the 
30:828:72606:12:11:72:537:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:same forces were likely at work, we focus on British India because it was a single administrative unit with the same 
30:829:72723:11:12:72:531:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:institutional organization. In comparison, there is significant heterogeneity among the numerous Princely States in 
30:830:72839:12:11:72:506:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:both the set up of educational systems and educational outcomes although recent work suggests educational 
30:831:72945:11:0:72:456:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:outcomes on average were higher in the Princely States compared to British India (Iyer, 2010).  
31:832:73044:0:27:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially destabilizing effects of a more educated populace). On account of the meager public 
31:833:73140:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds, the colonial government actively encouraged private schooling and made some limited 
31:834:73231:28:27:72:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:efforts to increase schooling among groups with traditionally low levels of education such as 
31:835:73325:27:28:72:297:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Muslims, the lower castes and tribal groups.46  
31:836:73373:28:28:107:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:Beginning in the early 1880s, the provision of primary education was decentralized to 
31:837:73459:28:27:71:485:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:rural and urban local boards, although they received important grants from provincial 
31:838:73545:27:28:72:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments. The boards managed some schools in addition to providing grants to private aided 
31:839:73639:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools. In general, there was significant heterogeneity across provinces in school systems, grant 
31:840:73738:27:28:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:rules and subsidy amounts. Even though public revenues funded local boards, upper caste Indian 
31:841:73833:28:28:72:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites were disproportionately represented on the local boards and in principle could influence 
31:842:73929:28:27:72:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:public allocation decisions.47 However, the boards had no power of taxation. They received a 
31:843:74022:27:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed pot of money partially based on the land taxes collected in their district and, they allocated 
31:844:74123:28:27:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the money between primary education, local infrastructure and medical services. Unlike in Brazil 
31:845:74220:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Russia (at least prior to the 1900s), central and provincial authorities dictated the levels of 
31:846:74320:28:27:72:237:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:local public expenditure in India.  
31:847:74356:27:28:108:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Within this institutional framework, colonial policies influenced regional public spending 
31:848:74447:28:28:72:495:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:patterns, often exacerbating pre-existing economic differences between provinces. Both 
31:849:74534:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment and literacy rates were twice as high in the coastal provinces of Bengal, Bombay and 
31:850:74630:27:7:72:219:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                        
31:851:74686:7:16:72:515:205:42:Times:100:Times:F:46 For example, larger public grants were made available to schools in “backward districts,” scholarships were 
31:852:74797:16:7:72:501:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:introduced to encourage schooling among these groups, and training schools for teachers were established. 
31:853:74903:7:16:72:537:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:47 The rules on the exact composition of district boards varied from province to province. A British colonial officer, 
31:854:75022:16:12:72:532:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:often the district magistrate was the board chairman in most provinces. He was assissted by nominated and elected 
31:855:75136:12:11:71:521:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:Indian members. Despite the presence of non-official members, historians have argued that official control over 
31:856:75248:11:12:71:538:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:these bodies was strong and the elective principle was not widely implemented (Cross, 1922).  Nominated members 
31:857:75360:12:11:71:519:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:were almost always important landlords, while traders and lawyers accounted for many of the elected members 
31:858:75468:11:12:71:539:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Cross, 1922; Gopal, 1953; Tinker, 1968). In subsequent decades especially in the 1920s, minority group leaders for 
31:859:75584:12:11:71:529:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:Muslims and lower castes were also among the nominated members. Thus, the acts of local self-government were 
31:860:75693:11:12:71:537:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:not enacted with the view of introducing democratic self-government with equal representation of all groups. While 
31:861:75808:12:11:71:536:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:we focus on rural districts here, self-government and revenue reforms brought similar debates over education to the 
31:862:75924:11:0:71:303:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:fore in municipalities over our period (e.g. Bayly, 1971).

32:864:76081:27:28:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and United Provinces (3.5 percent in 1911). The coastal provinces had big urban centers with 
32:865:76174:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger bureaucracies such as Bombay and Calcutta that offered more opportunities for educated 
32:866:76268:27:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:workers. This likely increased the private demand for education. Nonetheless there were regional 
32:867:76365:28:28:71:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences even among the coastal provinces. From 1881 to1931, Bombay led the way in public 
32:868:76458:28:27:71:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:education expenditures and developed a large network of public schools. But, public spending in 
32:869:76554:27:28:71:448:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bengal, Bihar and Orissa lagged relatively behind both Bombay and Madras.  
32:870:76629:28:27:107:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:Much of the difference in public expenditures was due to heterogeneity of land tax 
32:871:76712:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:revenues. Bombay and Madras had higher land revenues on average, and hence, they had more 
32:872:76802:28:28:71:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:public money available to spend on education (and other local services) when compared to 
32:873:76891:28:27:71:489:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bengal, where land revenues were lower on account of the Permanent Settlement. The 
32:874:76974:27:28:71:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Settlement was a contract between the English East India Company and the landlords of Bengal 
32:875:77067:28:27:71:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Bihar whereby the revenue demand on land (land tax) was fixed in cash for perpetuity in 
32:876:77159:27:28:71:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:1793.  In comparison, Temporary Settlement areas such as Bombay and Madras were assessed 
32:877:77248:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:land taxes at higher rates that were periodically adjusted to account for changes in price levels 
32:878:77346:27:28:71:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:and productivity. Thus, public education spending varied with the land tax regime and, along 
32:879:77439:28:28:71:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:with private spending on education, jointly influenced the development of mass schooling.48 
32:880:77530:28:27:72:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Roughly, land revenues explain approximately 32 percent of the district-level variation in total 
32:881:77627:27:28:72:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending on education (Chaudhary, 2010). Thus, colonial policies influenced national spending 
32:882:77721:28:41:72:491:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:per capita, as well as the regional variation in public spending on primary education.49

32:884:77867:7:16:72:536:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:48 Private revenue sources accounted for a larger share of total spending (40 percent) in Bengal than in Bombay (20 
32:885:77983:16:7:72:427:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:percent). On the sources of the numbers provided here, see Chaudhary (2009 and 2010). 
32:886:78069:7:16:72:516:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:49 Of course, private school fees and the high opportunity costs of lost child labor were key factors in reducing 
32:887:78183:16:12:72:524:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:enrollments in many parts of India. As in the other case studies, our focus on the political economy of publically 
32:888:78298:12:11:72:537:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:provided education at the district level is meant as a complement rather than a substitute for these underlying micro-
32:889:78416:11:0:72:366:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:level factors that likely helped determined school provision and take-up.  
33:890:78494:0:27:108:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:While colonial rule probably constrained the development of primary education and 
33:891:78576:27:28:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:created strong interregional disparities in spending, this does not necessarily imply that India 
33:892:78673:28:27:72:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:would have enjoyed better outcomes as an independent state. Indian elites, the chief beneficiaries 
33:893:78772:27:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of English education under the colonial system, were often complicit in blocking the extension of 
33:894:78870:28:28:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education to the rural masses. For example, in the province of Bengal, the elites actively 
33:895:78969:28:27:72:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:opposed George Campbell’s (Bengal’s Lieutenant Governor) policy of providing more public 
33:896:79058:27:28:72:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for mass education in the 1870s: “The Bengali Hindu bhadraloks, a newly emerging 
33:897:79147:28:27:72:527:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:social group mostly consisting of persons belonging to higher Hindu castes, after imbibing the 
33:898:79242:27:28:72:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:best fruits of western education were trying desperately in the second half of the nineteenth 
33:899:79336:28:28:72:501:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:century to assume the social leadership of the Bengalis. This social group, ambitious and 
33:900:79426:28:27:72:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruthless, wanted to keep the masses ignorant in order to maintain their leadership over them” 
33:901:79520:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Mandal, 1975).50 Although colonial rule created such new elites, there was considerable overlap 
33:902:79617:28:27:72:491:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the traditional land owning elites and the new western educated elites. In fact, 
33:903:79706:27:28:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:researchers have argued that the colonial educational system may have increased inter-caste 
33:904:79798:28:27:72:214:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:inequality (Srinivas, 1996).51 
33:905:79828:27:28:108:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Such resistance frequently occurred at the district level, either through actions of local 
33:906:79919:28:28:71:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:boards, or through direct lobbying of colonial officials responsible for education policy. For 
33:907:80014:28:27:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, Mr. C. T. H. Johnson, a district officer in Madras province, told the committee working

33:911:80356:7:16:72:529:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:50 See Mukhopadhyay (1984) for more details on how elites in Bengal successfully petitioned colonial officials to 
33:912:80470:16:7:72:269:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:restrict the extension of mass primary schooling. 
33:913:80520:7:16:72:532:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:51 Srinivas argues that the new opportunities from western education “had the twin effect of increasing the cultural 
33:914:80637:16:12:72:506:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:and ideological divide between the high and the low castes, as well as making the new opportunities doubly 
33:915:80744:12:11:72:542:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:desirable. In the first place, they were well paid and prestigious, and in the second, only the high castes had access to 
33:916:80866:11:0:72:156:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:them” (1996, p. 78). 
34:917:80890:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased primary education, because it makes labor more difficult to handle; they are not in 
34:918:80984:27:28:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:favor of a reduction of lower secondary education because they like to have the lower secondary 
34:919:81080:28:27:72:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools to which men of their type send their children.” While the initial emphasis on English 
34:920:81175:27:28:72:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:medium secondary education was due to colonial policies, many upper caste Indians actively 
34:921:81266:28:28:72:500:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:embraced English instruction and became the chief promoters of secondary education.52  
34:922:81353:28:27:107:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:The influence of elites is also visible in the provision of private aided schools receiving 
34:923:81445:27:28:71:504:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:public subsidies. Despite public subsidies, the Government had limited control over these 
34:924:81535:28:27:71:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools because private individuals pooled the necessary resources, set up the school, applied for 
34:925:81634:27:28:71:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:a grant, and managed the school. Chaudhary (2009) finds that characteristics of the local elite 
34:926:81730:28:28:71:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:strongly influenced the provision of the different types of primary schools. Brahmans and other 
34:927:81826:28:27:71:518:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:educated upper castes successfully directed private and, to a smaller extent, public resources 
34:928:81921:27:28:71:495:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:toward establishing secondary schools for their children. Districts with a larger share of 
34:929:82012:28:27:71:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brahmans, the traditional elite caste of Hindus, had more public and private secondary schools 
34:930:82107:27:28:71:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:plus a smaller ratio of primary to secondary schools. However, upper castes were unable to 
34:931:82198:28:27:71:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:completely co-opt the public policy-making process because districts with larger proportions of 
34:932:82294:27:28:71:407:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower castes and Muslims also had more public secondary schools.53  
34:933:82362:28:28:107:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Colonial and elite-dictated policies occurred amidst hierarchical divisions among Hindu 
34:934:82450:28:27:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:castes that further constrained the provision of mass primary education. Districts with high levels 
34:935:82550:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:of caste and religious diversity had fewer private aided and unaided primary schools as well as a 
34:936:82648:28:41:71:510:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller ratio of primary to secondary private schools. The presence of many religions with

34:938:82795:7:16:72:519:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:52 See Nurullah and Naik, 1951 and Basu, 1974. For example, according to Basu (1974), the number of English 
34:939:82903:16:12:72:521:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:secondary schools and arts colleges more than doubled from 1881/82 to 1921/22 from 2,133 to 4,904, while the 
34:940:83012:12:11:72:539:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:number of pupils more than quintupled from 149,233 to 823,416 (p. 105). Most of this increase was in private aided 
34:941:83127:11:7:72:417:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:(private schools that received some funds from public revenues) and unaided schools. 
34:942:83212:7:16:72:532:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:53 This was a misguided outcome of colonial policy, which set up these schools (as opposed to primary schools) in 
34:943:83326:16:0:72:419:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:educationally backward districts hoping they would increase literacy in these districts. 
35:944:83418:0:27:72:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneous preferences over public and private education compounded the situation. For 
35:945:83508:27:28:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, Muslims in heavily Muslim dominant districts had worse literacy outcomes because the 
35:946:83602:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Muslim religious schools were less effective at the margin at promoting literacy compared to 
35:947:83695:27:28:72:341:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:secular colonial schools (Chaudhary and Rubin, 2011).  
35:948:83750:28:28:108:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:While colonial rule did not create the divisions in Indian society, colonial policies did not 
35:949:83844:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:ameliorate the situation. Overall, public spending was low and susceptible to elite capture at the 
35:950:83943:27:28:72:507:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:local level. Lower castes and the aboriginal tribes were rarely represented on the councils. 
35:951:84036:28:27:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, they had limited political voice to influence local education policy. In contrast, landed 
35:952:84133:27:28:72:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:and educated elites – defined by caste, wealth, and profession – did hold positions on district 
35:953:84229:28:28:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:councils and utilized these to influence local spending.54 Colonial attempts to secure greater 
35:954:84324:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:representation for marginalized groups and improve educational outcomes for the non-elites 
35:955:84415:27:28:72:344:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:were generally insubstantial and weakly implemented.55 
35:956:84469:28:27:108:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:India’s experience both parallels and contrasts with the other BRIC countries. Similar to 
35:957:84559:27:28:72:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:China, there were big differences in spending and enrollments between the coastal and interior 
35:958:84654:28:27:72:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces linked to commercial development and new types of economic activity. However, the 
35:959:84746:27:28:72:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:size of the colonial bureaucracy and potential for educated employment were perhaps more 
35:960:84835:28:28:72:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:important in accounting for these differences than income and economic development—
35:961:84918:28:15:72:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:urbanization rates in the coastal and interior provinces were similar, and the pattern of spending

35:963:85073:8:16:72:525:216:42:Times:100:Times:F:54 For example, Brahmans and other upper castes comprised over 80 percent of lawyers and almost 75 percent of 
35:964:85183:16:7:72:483:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:landowners in Bengal, and these were the two most common occupations of district council members. 
35:965:85281:7:16:72:541:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:55 Ghurye (1961) discusses this issue. For example, as early as 1856, a court case was filed in the district of Dharwar 
35:966:85401:16:11:72:540:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:of Bombay where a lower caste boy was denied admission to the government school. In 1858 the courts released the 
35:967:85514:11:12:72:535:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:following press-note “Although the Governor-in-Council does not contemplate the introduction of low caste pupils 
35:968:85627:12:11:72:523:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:into schools, the expenses of which are shared with Government by local contributors and patrons who object to 
35:969:85738:11:12:72:524:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:such a measure, he reserves to himself the full right to refusing the support of Government to any partially aided 
35:970:85853:12:11:72:524:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:school in which the benefits of education are withheld from any class of persons on account of caste or race, and 
35:971:85967:11:12:72:538:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:further resolved that all schools maintained at the sole cost of Government shall be open to all classes of its subjects 
35:972:86088:12:11:72:514:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:without distinction.” This stated policy was not seriously implemented. Schools that relied on government aid 
35:973:86198:11:12:72:538:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:continued to receive grants regardless of their policy towards lower castes (Nurullah & Naik, 1951). It was not until 
35:974:86316:12:11:72:514:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:1923 that a government resolution was passed stipulating that government grants would be unavailable to any 
35:975:86424:11:0:72:273:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:schools that denied admission to the lower castes. 
36:976:86478:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:on education is not fully explained by differences in income levels (Chaudhary, 2009 and 2010). 
36:977:86574:27:28:72:492:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:But unlike China, Indian elites were more anti-schooling because they were unlikely to 
36:978:86661:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:economically benefit from an extension of mass primary education. Like Brazil and Russia, the 
36:979:86755:27:28:71:500:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:extent of political participation in India did influence public spending, but since political 
36:980:86849:28:28:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:representation was generally limited to land and caste based elites public spending was targeted 
36:981:86946:28:27:71:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:to secondary education and away from mass primary education. Nonetheless, colonial policies 
36:982:87038:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the associated fiscal system based on centrally dictated land taxes were important drivers of

36:984:87222:27:28:72:486:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization of export taxes to provincial governments. Like in Tsarist Russia, the 
36:985:87310:28:28:72:495:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization of primary education to local district councils in British India made the 
36:986:87401:28:27:72:470:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of public funds a function of the preferences and ethnic, religious, and 
36:987:87487:27:28:72:403:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:socioeconomic composition of the elites who sat on these councils.

36:989:87566:27:28:108:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:With the lowest per capita income among the BRIC countries, it is not surprising that 
36:990:87652:28:27:72:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:China possessed the lowest enrollment rates and one of the lowest levels of expenditures on 
36:991:87744:27:28:72:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:education per school-aged child among our sample countries (Table 1). However, certain areas 
36:992:87837:28:28:72:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:(the lower Yangzi; coastal regions – see Ma, 2008; and Mitchener and Yan, 2010) did experience 
36:993:87932:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:some hints of industrial development and higher economic growth in the late 19th and early 20th 
36:994:88027:27:28:72:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:centuries, which contributed to heterogeneity in educational outcomes in the late-Qing and 
36:995:88118:28:27:72:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:Republican periods (Tables 2 and 3). But we argue that differences in schooling across China 
36:996:88211:27:28:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:were also a product of policies enacted by heterogeneous local elites, who acquired considerable 
36:997:88308:28:0:72:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:power in the face of Qing decline and the weak central governments of the Republican era. 
37:998:88401:0:27:108:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:China experienced a structural break in education in 1905. Prior to that, the primary 
37:999:88487:27:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:education system was based upon Confucian classics and aimed at success in the Imperial Civil 
37:1000:88581:28:27:72:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Service Exam (ICSE).56 The rewards to high achievement on this exam generated considerable 
37:1001:88672:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand for privately provided traditional schooling (sishu) throughout the country. Such schools 
37:1002:88769:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:were frequently financed by contributions from wealthy households, lineages, or local voluntary 
37:1003:88865:28:27:72:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:associations such as guilds. As a result, these schools catered to the children of local elites, and 
37:1004:88966:27:28:72:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:county quotas on the number of passing exam grades capped the returns to such human capital 
37:1005:89058:28:27:72:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:investment.57 In the wake of the Taiping rebellion of the 1850s and 1860s, the Qing dynasty 
37:1006:89150:27:28:72:504:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:expanded these quotas and encouraged the development of additional classical academies 
37:1007:89237:28:28:72:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Woodside and Elman, 1994; and Keenan, 1994). There was some growth in the number of 
37:1008:89322:28:27:72:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:“community” or charitable schools catering to the non-elite, but these were generally funded by 
37:1009:89418:27:28:72:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:contributions of local elites from lineage or clan wealth. Overall, not only was there essentially 
37:1010:89517:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:no publically financed mass schooling in the late Qing, but the particular structure of the exam 
37:1011:89614:27:28:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:system, although avowedly meritocratic, limited entry into the bureaucratic elite.58 While as 
37:1012:89708:28:27:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:many as 40 percent of males attended sishu for at least a few years by the end of the 19th century, 
37:1013:89808:27:28:71:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:many students achieved only limited literacy and gained few applied skills (Borthwick, 1983; 
37:1014:89901:28:66:71:184:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Yuchtman, 2010).

37:1016:89979:8:16:72:541:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:56 The ICSE was the main avenue to wealth and power in late imperial China. In the words of Ping-ti Ho’s, the exam 
37:1017:90094:16:11:72:539:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:was “the ladder to success” (1955), while a Chinese proverb called it “the gate that fishes jump through and become 
37:1018:90210:11:7:72:116:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:dragons.”  
37:1019:90221:7:16:72:529:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:57 In the traditional education system, the initial stages of training and preparing a son for the civil service was the 
37:1020:90342:16:12:72:532:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:private responsibility of families seeking to attain or maintain elite status as “official” families. Clans and families 
37:1021:90463:12:11:72:521:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:had, whenever possible, mobilized their financial and cultural resources to provide young boys with the tools of 
37:1022:90576:11:12:72:537:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:classical literacy. The government, central or local, maintained a hands-off approach towards funding mass primary 
37:1023:90691:12:7:72:118:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:education.  
37:1024:90703:7:16:72:512:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:58 Under the Qing, provincial civil servants and county magistrates were rotated frequently, which made them 
37:1025:90812:16:11:72:542:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:somewhat distinct from traditional local elite, often defined as those achieveing the lowest exam rank of sheng-yuan.

38:1027:91029:0:27:108:494:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:Growing economic openness and industrialization in the late nineteenth century 
38:1028:91108:27:28:72:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:generated rising demand for modern education, particularly in science, technology, and other

38:1030:91291:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:started in some coastal cities as early as the 1860s, the abolishment of the ICSE in 1905 marked 
38:1031:91388:28:28:72:488:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the beginning of a nationwide remodeling of the education system and the structure of 
38:1032:91474:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:government support of basic schooling.59 A Ministry of Education was established in 1905, and 
38:1033:91568:27:28:72:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Offices of Provincial Education were founded in many provinces (along with similar county 
38:1034:91658:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:level institutions known as “Education Exhorting Offices” – see Abe, 1987; and Bailey, 1990). 
38:1035:91752:27:28:72:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:After 1905, the Ministry of Education called on community, county, and provincial officials to 
38:1036:91847:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:enact compulsory and modern primary schooling, but central and provincial authorities allocated 
38:1037:91943:28:27:72:265:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:very limited funds towards this goal.60   
38:1038:91985:27:28:107:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Instead, new modern primary schools were typically financed by a combination of county 
38:1039:92072:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax receipts, the reallocation of endowments from traditional schools, and private contributions 
38:1040:92169:27:28:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:by local elites (Thøgersen, 2005; and Vander Ven, 2005).61 The devolution of fiscal authority 
38:1041:92263:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:that occurred after the Taiping Rebellion  (and was formalized in local government reforms of 
38:1042:92357:27:37:71:482:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 1900s) left most tax revenues to provincial and county-level authorities.62 Private

38:1044:92501:7:16:72:506:251:42:Times:100:Times:F:59 These “New Policies” (xinzheng) were enacted locally by the existing elite, often with substantial conflict 
38:1045:92612:16:7:72:146:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Prazniak, 1980).  
38:1046:92631:7:16:72:510:228:42:Times:100:Times:F:60 An influential proposal for education reform – Zhang Zhidong’s Exhortation to Study (1898) – called for a 
38:1047:92740:16:12:72:539:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:national three-tiered system of modernized schools located in provincial, prefecture, and county capitals, along with 
38:1048:92858:12:11:72:509:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:a network of basic primary schools in towns and villages. This system was to incorporate existing traditional 
38:1049:92968:11:12:72:540:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:academies and other types of schools (Ayers, 1971; and Baily, 1990). The village primary schools were to be funded 
38:1050:93083:12:11:72:527:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:by local resources, while the other two tiers were to have access to funds from central or provincial treasuries (on 
38:1051:93200:11:7:72:227:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:Shandong province, see Buck, 1974).  
38:1052:93237:7:16:72:534:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:61 According to data gathered by Thøgersen (2005), less than one percent of public primary school funding in three 
38:1053:93352:16:12:72:520:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:counties of Shandong province in 1908 came from extra-county government sources. For similar numbers from 
38:1054:93458:12:7:72:282:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:Zhejiang province in 1907-1909, see Rankin (1986) 
38:1055:93508:7:16:72:541:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:62 Some of this was unwilling, as local authorities refused to remit taxes back to the (weakening) center. Measures in 
38:1056:93627:16:11:72:518:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:1908-1909 created elected institutions of self-government at the national, provincial, and county levels. Voting 
38:1057:93740:11:12:72:541:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:rights were determined by property ownership, and, as a result, each body was dominated by landed and commercial 
38:1058:93853:12:11:72:533:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:elites. These decrees paralleled growing movements for more local self-government in a number of provinces (e.g. 
38:1059:93966:11:0:72:526:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:Zhang, 2000; on Henan). In the 1900s, the central government also encouraged the establishment of various civil 
39:1060:94081:0:27:72:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:contributions by lineages, specific endowments, or associations of local elites continued to be 
39:1061:94177:27:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:important sources of school finance, especially in less developed, more isolated areas.63 Whether 
39:1062:94275:28:27:71:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:funded from public, private, or a mix of sources, the initiative to build new schools in the last 
39:1063:94373:27:28:71:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:decades of the Qing era generally resided with local elites who either possessed the necessary 
39:1064:94468:28:28:71:431:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:wealth or held positions of authority in public or quasi-public institutions.  
39:1065:94547:28:27:107:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:These decentralizing administrative and fiscal reforms of the late Qing did generate some 
39:1066:94637:27:28:71:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth in the provision of primary schooling. By 1909, roughly 51,700 modern primary schools 
39:1067:94730:28:27:71:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:catered to over 1.5 million students, and by 1912, over 86,000 schools enrolled roughly 2.8 
39:1068:94822:27:28:71:482:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:million students (Abe, 1987; and First Education Yearbook of China, 1934).64 These 
39:1069:94905:28:28:72:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:developments in primary education, however, did not put China in a favorable position when 
39:1070:94996:28:27:72:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to other BRICs. China still had the worst education indicators when the Qing Empire 
39:1071:95089:27:28:72:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:fell in 1911. Moreover, there was considerable provincial variation in the pace of new school 
39:1072:95183:28:27:72:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:formation and in the share of education funding dedicated to primary education.65 This carried 
39:1073:95278:27:69:72:230:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:over into the Republican period.

39:1078:95834:11:7:72:407:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:revenues and government authority met strong reesistance in the 1910s and 1920s.

39:1081:96144:12:11:72:524:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:mostly located along the coast), rising entrepreneurs were one of the major patrons financing primary education. 
39:1082:96257:11:12:72:530:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:According to the First Education Yearbook of China, the total amount of education donations from private parties 
39:1083:96370:12:11:72:523:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:amounted to 11,414,253 Yuan in the first twenty years of the Republic, and the leading two provinces in private 
39:1084:96482:11:7:72:466:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:donation were Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where modern industry and commerce were most prevalent.  
39:1085:96574:7:16:72:526:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:64 This movement towards school building and education modernization overshadowed the few thousand schools

39:1088:96829:7:16:72:540:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:65 Between 1907 and 1909, the number of official lower primary schools in Shandong province increased by a factor 
39:1089:96943:16:11:72:540:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:of nine, from 3,200 to over 31500, while in Guangxi and inland Xinjiang, the number actually declined. While some 
39:1090:97057:11:12:72:535:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:provinces dedicated a considerable share of total education funding from the provincial treasury to primary schools 
39:1091:97173:12:11:72:511:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:(e.g. Guangdong or Liaoning) in 1909, others favored more advanced or specialized education (e.g. Gansu or

40:1094:97452:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:became a republic in 1912, decentralization and local capture by elites continued to influence the

40:1096:97644:27:28:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:from provincial and, especially, district or local sources.66 Much of the administrative system of

40:1098:97837:28:27:71:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:provincial and county-level bodies.67 But political instability grew as the death of President and 
40:1099:97936:27:28:72:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:self-proclaimed emperor Yuan Shikai in 1916 initiated a period of internal conflict, when local

40:1101:98128:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:During the “warlord” period (1916-1927), and under the Nationalist regime (1927-1937), the 
40:1102:98219:28:28:72:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:administrative and fiscal structures remained intact, but military expenditures frequently 
40:1103:98310:28:27:72:542:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:siphoned resources away from local public services such as schooling. The geography of military 
40:1104:98406:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:conflict and heterogeneity in local-central government relations contributed to the variation in 
40:1105:98503:28:27:72:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the supply of basic education across Republican China (Wong, 2000; and Zhang, 2000).  
40:1106:98589:27:28:107:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Throughout the Republican period, traditional and new types of elites controlled local 
40:1107:98676:28:27:71:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions responsible for education (Chauncey, 1992). Government and other local institutions 
40:1108:98773:27:106:71:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:rarely offered political opportunities to the masses, and there were few, if any, democratic

40:1110:98922:7:16:72:540:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:66 In the 1910s and 1920s, education accounted for less than 3 percent of the Republic’s central budget, out of which 
40:1111:99040:16:12:72:498:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:primary education was 64.3 percent, secondary education 21.4 percent and tertiary education 14.3 percent 
40:1112:99145:12:7:72:490:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:(calculated from The First Education Yearbook of China, 1934; also see Bailey, 1990; and Buck, 1974). 
40:1113:99247:7:16:72:523:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:67 The education promotion bureaus, elite education associations, and provincial-level education administrations 
40:1114:99360:16:11:72:501:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:initially set up in the late Qing continued to operate during much of the Republican period. The division of 
40:1115:99469:11:12:72:528:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:responsibilities between them and various other local government appointees continued to differ from province to 
40:1116:99582:12:11:72:523:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:province (Baily, 1990). The new Republican government did initiate a new national school system (lasting from 
40:1117:99692:11:12:72:517:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:1912 to 1922), but it was essentially identical to the multi-tiered structure set up in the late Qing. The national, 
40:1118:99809:12:11:72:522:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:provincial, and country-level elected assemblies had elections and, in many cases, began conducting business in 
40:1119:99921:11:0:72:517:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:1912 and 1913. They were abolished by Yuan Shikai in 1914, although some coninued to meet after his death. 
41:1120:100031:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:elements in local public policy.68 Therefore, decentralization occurred with little democratization 
41:1121:100131:27:28:71:220:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and considerable elite capture. 
41:1122:100163:28:27:107:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:However, the “policy” preferences of the local elites, and the particular institutions 
41:1123:100250:27:28:71:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:through which they were exercised, varied considerably from place to place. In some areas, the 
41:1124:100345:28:28:71:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:more traditional landed elite with ties to the old exam-based system of education often supported 
41:1125:100443:28:27:71:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:private schools, while in others, a newly emerging “modern” elite tended to work within the new 
41:1126:100539:27:28:71:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:local government and non-governmental institutions to encourage publically financed schools. 
41:1127:100632:28:27:71:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:As a result, funding for primary education continued to come from a varied combination of 
41:1128:100722:27:28:71:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:public sources (based on remitted taxes or specific local land or business tax surcharges) and 
41:1129:100817:28:28:71:470:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:private funds (endowments, individual contributions, lineage or clan funds, etc.).69 
41:1130:100901:28:27:108:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:Both before and after 1911, a variety of local economic, security, and political conditions 
41:1131:100993:27:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:influenced the nature of elite capture of decentralized policymaking (Esherick and Rankin, eds., 
41:1132:101090:28:27:72:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:1990; and Schoppa, 1982). Such heterogeneity helps explain much of the variation that we 
41:1133:101179:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:observe in provincial enrollment rates and expenditures on education in 1912 (Tables 2 and 3). 
41:1134:101274:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Particularly telling are the high expenditure levels and enrollment rates for Jiangsu, Liaoning, 
41:1135:101371:27:37:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Zhejiang, all of which were coastal provinces with significant commercial development.70

41:1137:101519:7:16:72:511:251:42:Times:100:Times:F:68 Chang and Nathan (1978) summarize the electoral processes for the National Assembly of 1913. They also 
41:1138:101625:16:12:72:526:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:provide provincial data on the share of the population with voting rights in the Assembly election. These data are 
41:1139:101740:12:11:72:528:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:completely uncorrelated with the variation in school expenditures per school-age child (Table 3), suggesting that, 
41:1140:101855:11:7:72:506:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:unsurprisingly, this national and quasi-representative structure played almost no role in education decisions. 
41:1141:101966:7:16:72:538:205:42:Times:100:Times:F:69 In some provinces where a new generation of elites were supportive of primary education, education constituted a 
41:1142:102082:16:12:72:542:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:large part of total government expenditure. A famous example is Liaoning. The leader, Zhang Zuoling, committed to 
41:1143:102196:12:11:72:538:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:a share of education spending out of government fiscal expenditures of at least 40 percent. This partly explains why 
41:1144:102313:11:12:72:532:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:Liaoning stood out in terms of the development of primary education in the Republic era. See also the evidence on 
41:1145:102427:12:11:72:531:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:provincial and county budgets for the 1910s and 1920s provided in Buck (1974 – Shandong), Van de Ven (1996 – 
41:1146:102536:11:7:72:285:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:Liaoning), and Duara (1987 – Hebei and Shandong). 
41:1147:102585:7:16:72:515:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:70 On the increasingly commercialized elites of Zhejiang, see Schoppa (1982). According to Culp (1994), who 
41:1148:102693:16:12:72:505:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:studied elite activities in support of schooling in two counties of Zhejiang province, the level of commercial 
41:1149:102804:12:11:72:536:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:development and bureaucratic capacity of local state institutions dictated how and whether elites actively supported 
41:1150:102921:11:12:72:536:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:public education. In the poorer interior county of Lanqi, any support for education came not from local government 
41:1151:103036:12:11:72:531:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:institutions, but through funds provided by lineages to private (sili) schools. In Jiashan county, which was near the 
41:1152:103154:11:0:72:535:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:coast and much more developed, local economic elite controlled more substantive government budgets and various 
42:1153:103268:0:27:72:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:The “new” elites in these and other areas were especially interested in developing a skilled 
42:1154:103361:27:28:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:workforce, and they saw modern public education as a necessary element of a new China. Elites 
42:1155:103455:28:27:72:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the commercially developed areas were more frequently exposed to western ideas regarding 
42:1156:103547:27:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:politics and education. For example, Yan Xishan, governor of Shanxi, and Tang Jiyao, governor 
42:1157:103641:28:28:71:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of Yunnan, both had some experience with modern education. The concentration of power in the 
42:1158:103733:28:27:72:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:hands of these and other such westernized “warlords” and local elites made the channeling of 
42:1159:103826:27:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:resources towards modern primary education more likely in the Republican period (e.g., Barkan, 
42:1160:103921:28:27:72:166:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:1990, on Jiangsu).  
42:1161:103941:27:28:108:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:Provinces with relatively high levels of schooling were less subject to the political and 
42:1162:104031:28:28:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:social chaos of the 1910s and 1920s. Some areas of provinces, such as coastal Jiangsu, were 
42:1163:104123:28:27:72:542:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:under a degree of control by various western powers, which allowed them to avoid civil wars and 
42:1164:104219:27:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:conflicts. In these and other “quiet” parts of the Republic, a stable political regime allowed local 
42:1165:104320:28:27:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites to allocate more resources to primary education. Unfortunately, such areas of relative 
42:1166:104414:27:28:72:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:peace and calm were rather rare. Banditry and locally controlled militia, along with civil war and 
42:1167:104513:28:27:72:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:foreign conflict, gripped much of China over the period (McCord, 2009, on Hunan; and Buck, 
42:1168:104604:27:28:72:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:1974, on Shandong). Therefore, despite local control and efforts by some elites and the (weak) 
42:1169:104699:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:central government to initiate a national public school system, the chaos and poverty of much of 
42:1170:104796:28:27:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Republican China limited the widespread development of publically financed primary education.  
42:1171:104891:27:28:108:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:In sum, despite the shift towards a more modern system of schooling after 1905, public 
42:1172:104978:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education in China was the least developed of BRIC. In the late Qing and Republican 
42:1173:105070:27:28:72:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:periods, the feedback between low income levels and political instability created conditions 
42:1174:105163:28:32:72:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:where resources were not available to finance schooling, and where the state was too weak to

42:1176:105435:12:11:72:524:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:school committees. This allowed them to fund the expansion of different types of public (gongli) schools, which 
42:1177:105547:11:0:71:472:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:were typically larger and followed a more modern curriculum than did the private schools of Lanqi. 
43:1178:105649:0:27:72:527:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:prevent local elites from capturing political structures and educational institutions. There were 
43:1179:105747:27:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:practically no formal representative bodies with real authority over education, and communities 
43:1180:105843:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:were generally left to their own devices (and resources) when it came to decisions over primary 
43:1181:105939:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling. However, and in contrast to Brazil or Russia, relatively few elites were supportive of 
43:1182:106037:28:28:71:528:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:expanding modern educational opportunities through greater public funding – only in the most 
43:1183:106130:28:27:71:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercially developed and politically stable areas did this process take place. When compared 
43:1184:106225:27:28:71:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:to other BRICs in and around 1911, China’s political situation was the least settled, least 
43:1185:106317:28:27:71:494:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:“democratic,” and most beholden to provincial and local elites who had little interest in 
43:1186:106407:27:28:71:208:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:supporting mass education.

43:1189:106449:27:28:107:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our study sheds new light on the comparative experiences of BRIC during the formative 
43:1190:106535:28:27:71:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:years of their primary education systems. Brazil, Russia, India, and China were among the 
43:1191:106625:27:28:71:482:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:largest and poorest states in the world in the early 20th century, and their low level of 
43:1192:106715:28:27:72:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:development limited investments in mass schooling. Central authorities in each country mostly 
43:1193:106809:27:28:72:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:absolved themselves of the responsibility of providing primary education.  As a result, the 
43:1194:106901:28:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of education was frequently decentralized to lower levels of government, where the 
43:1195:106994:28:27:72:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:absence of accountable and representative democracy allowed local elites to capture political 
43:1196:107088:27:28:72:504:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions, limit redistributive taxation, and dictate how public resources were allocated. 
43:1197:107182:28:27:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, variation among elites or in the political and economics conditions they faced (whether 
43:1198:107279:27:28:72:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:across space or over time) generated multiple schooling equilibriums across and within BRIC.  
43:1199:107373:28:28:108:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:?:In India and China, the lack of functional democracy and weak central authorities meant 
43:1200:107461:28:0:72:534:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:elites were able to fully capture the local government institutions responsible for public funding 
44:1201:107563:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:of education. Colonial restrictions on fiscal resources and caste and religious divisions among 
44:1202:107659:27:28:72:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:local elites limited public spending on primary schooling in India. Indian elites and colonial 
44:1203:107754:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies jointly contributed to India having the lowest levels of primary school expenditures per 
44:1204:107852:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:school age population. In China, the devolution of political and fiscal authority in the late-Qing 
44:1205:107951:28:28:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Republican eras was associated with the collapse of central authority, growing local political 
44:1206:108050:28:27:72:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:involvement by old and new elites, and rising social and military conflict. There was a shift 
44:1207:108144:27:28:72:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:towards modern forms of primary education supported by public funds, but elite-control of 
44:1208:108234:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:school policies and limited local fiscal resources constrained this development.  Only more 
44:1209:108326:27:28:71:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercially developed areas and places where the traditional elite gave way to one interested 
44:1210:108421:28:28:71:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:in modern education saw any substantive investments in mass public schooling. Such new elites 
44:1211:108515:28:27:71:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:in China were less constrained by central authorities and were often more pro-schooling because 
44:1212:108611:27:28:71:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:of their economic needs, unlike Indian local elites, who were perhaps more anti-public schooling 
44:1213:108708:28:27:71:380:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:because it presented fewer direct political or economic benefits. 
44:1214:108774:27:28:107:511:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Brazil and Russia – marginally richer and possessing slightly broader forms of elite 
44:1215:108859:28:27:71:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:democracy – saw greater investments in public primary schooling than India and China. In 
44:1216:108948:27:28:71:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazil, fiscal federalism and literacy restrictions on voting after 1891 increased elite support for 
44:1217:109049:28:28:71:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:education in states and municipalities that had high export tax revenues or where the elite 
44:1218:109141:28:27:71:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:required greater voter turnout to maintain political power. Until the 1900s, variation in the 
44:1219:109235:27:28:71:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for mass pubic education in Russia was driven by differences in who controlled political 
44:1220:109332:28:27:71:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions at the local level. The zemstvo offered some channels for the expression of broad 
44:1221:109427:27:28:71:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:popular interest in schooling, but elite control of this and other local institutions meant that it was 
44:1222:109531:28:28:71:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:generally those districts with more liberal nobility that invested more in public education. The 
44:1223:109628:28:0:71:533:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:founding of a national assembly in 1906 with some popular representation coincided with more 
45:1224:109724:0:27:72:495:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:funding for basic education from the central government, but it took the Soviet Union’s 
45:1225:109812:27:28:72:447:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:centralized policies to push the country towards universal primary education.  
45:1226:109891:28:27:107:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:New data and detailed analyses of the political economy of schooling in the early 20th 
45:1227:109977:27:28:72:489:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:century BRIC countries lend support for the basic framework we laid out in Section 3. 
45:1228:110063:28:28:71:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Decentralization in the face of weak or absent democratic mechanisms led to local elite capture 
45:1229:110159:28:27:71:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:of political institutions, compounding the constraints of low income, high opportunity costs, and 
45:1230:110257:27:28:71:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited public funds. This meant that relatively little was spent on mass schooling, as the elites 
45:1231:110356:28:27:71:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:tended to utilize private education and saw little need to engage in redistributive policies that 
45:1232:110454:27:28:71:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:might have brought challenges to their political and economic control (as also described for Latin 
45:1233:110553:28:28:71:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:America in Engerman and Sokoloff, 2002). Democratically driven central government policies 
45:1234:110644:28:27:71:518:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:and investments may have helped overcome low incomes and local constraints (i.e. Gallego, 
45:1235:110734:27:28:71:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010), as was perhaps evident following the (slightly) representative national elections in Tsarist 
45:1236:110834:28:27:71:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Russia after 1906. But as the Soviet example, or even the cases of Meiji Japan and 19th century 
45:1237:110930:27:28:72:502:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Prussia, would suggest, strong but relatively undemocratic initiatives can force backward 
45:1238:111020:28:27:72:306:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries towards universal primary schooling.   
45:1239:111069:27:28:107:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:We view the limited and heterogeneous expansion of public primary education in BRIC 
45:1240:111153:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:over our period as a series of local stories. Only where the characteristics or preferences of the 
45:1241:111252:28:27:72:495:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:local elite and their decentralized freedom to influence local policies coincided with the 
45:1242:111343:27:28:72:501:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:advancement of basic public schooling were initiatives put in place to build schools, hire 
45:1243:111434:28:27:71:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:teachers, and reform curricula.71 In all four cases, local economic conditions and the “liberalism” 
45:1244:111534:27:28:71:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the elite were two such characteristics, but what constituted the elite, and what determined 
45:1245:111630:28:22:72:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in their composition differed between each country.  We have argued that in the context

45:1247:111784:7:16:72:508:100:42:Times:100:Times:F:71 A similar argument is proposed Persson and Zhuravskaya (2011), who note that elite capture may actually 
45:1248:111891:16:0:72:509:84:100:Times:100:Times:F:substitute for fully accountable local governments when their preferences are aligned with majority interests. 
46:1249:112005:0:27:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:of poor, relatively undemocratic societies such as BRIC, the heterogeneity of the elites and the 
46:1250:112102:27:28:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies they proposed help explain both the cross-country differences observed in Table 1 and 
46:1251:112197:28:27:72:301:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:the within-country variation of Tables 2 and 3.  
46:1252:112246:27:28:108:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Given the wideness of our comparative lens, we do not attempt to explain all of the 
46:1253:112330:28:28:71:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in schooling outcomes evident in Tables 1-3. Our theoretical framework is intended as 
46:1254:112426:28:27:71:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:a tool to help understand just one set of possible mechanisms behind the unsuccessful cases of 
46:1255:112521:27:28:71:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:educational development that Easterlin’s original question targeted and that we explore in our 
46:1256:112616:28:27:71:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:analytical surveys of the experiences of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. In laying out our 
46:1257:112709:27:28:71:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:argument regarding decentralization, imperfect democracy, and elite capture in BRIC, we have 
46:1258:112802:28:28:71:356:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:left open a number of important issues for future research.  
46:1259:112863:28:27:107:542:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:It is evident from the case studies that there was persistent variation in the extent to which 
46:1260:112958:27:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education was “public,” (i.e., financed with some form of tax revenue and open to the 
46:1261:113052:28:27:71:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority of the population) or “private” (supported by endowments, student fees, and religious 
46:1262:113147:27:28:71:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizations and exclusive in some respect). An important topic that demands more attention is 
46:1263:113243:28:27:71:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:the extent to which private education for elites crowded out spending on public schooling à la De 
46:1264:113341:27:28:71:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:la Croix and Doepke (2009). Furthermore, we have focused on public primary schooling, mostly 
46:1265:113434:28:28:71:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:as a compromise over data availability and the scope of the paper. But the allocation of resources 
46:1266:113533:28:27:71:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:by governments and elites also took place between different levels of education. In terms of the 
46:1267:113630:27:28:71:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns to public spending, each of our countries likely overcommitted funds to secondary and 
46:1268:113724:28:27:71:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:tertiary schooling at the expense of primary education. To fully evaluate the costs of such 
46:1269:113816:27:28:71:436:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:misallocation, comparable data on upper levels of schooling are necessary.  
46:1270:113892:28:28:107:501:129:144:Times:144:Times:?:Finally, we have limited our analysis to the decades around 1910. This covers the 
46:1271:113974:28:0:71:484:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:consolidation of mass public financed education in much of the developed world, but 
47:1272:114061:0:27:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:developments in the BRIC countries took very different trajectories. The Soviet Union quickly 
47:1273:114155:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:moved towards universal schooling after 1920, but India, China, and Brazil continued to provide 
47:1274:114251:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively limited basic education well into the 20th century. Only in the last 30 years have these 
47:1275:114351:27:28:71:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:three countries made substantial inroads in primary education. It is worth considering whether 
47:1276:114446:28:28:71:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the recent advances of education in these countries – which some scholars have linked to 
47:1277:114535:28:27:71:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralized policymaking – have historical roots, and if regional variation today is similar to 
47:1278:114633:27:0:71:207:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:what we find a century ago.
