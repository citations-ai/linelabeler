2:33:1866:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Sovereign  CDS  quanto  spreads—the  difference  between  CDS  premiums  denominated  in  U.S. 
2:34:1961:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:dollars and  a  foreign  currency—tell  us  how  financial  markets  view  the  interaction  between  a 
2:35:2064:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:country's likelihood of default and associated currency devaluations (the Twin Ds). A noarbitrage 
2:36:2161:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:model applied to the term structure of quanto spreads can isolate the interaction between the Twin 
2:37:2259:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:Ds  and  gauge  the  associated risk  premiums.  We  study  countries  in  the  Eurozone  because  their 
2:38:2363:14:14:72:543:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:quanto spreads pertain to the same exchange rate and monetary policy, allowing us to link cross-
2:39:2458:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:sectional variation in their term structures to cross-country differences in fiscal policies. The ratio 
2:40:2561:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:of the risk-adjusted to the true default intensities is 2, on average. Conditional on the occurrence 
2:41:2661:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:of  default,  the  true  and  risk-adjusted  1-week  probabilities of  devaluation  are  5%  and  77%, 
2:42:2763:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:respectively.  The  risk  premium  for  the  euro  devaluation  in  case  of default  exceeds  the  regular 
2:43:2870:14:28:72:280:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:currency premium by up to 0.3% per week.

3:62:3333:0:36:90:203:691:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1    Introduction
3:63:3350:36:14:90:522:655:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The risk of sovereign default and exchange rate fluctuations are inextricably linked.  The
3:64:3440:14:13:90:522:641:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation of a country’s currency is often a reflection of poor economic conditions.  De-
3:65:3532:13:14:90:522:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fault events tend to be associated with currency devaluations.  Such devaluations may either
3:66:3624:14:13:90:522:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strategically support the competitiveness of the domestic economy, or penalize a country’s
3:67:3714:13:26:90:522:601:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:growth due to increased borrowing costs or reduced access to international capital markets.
3:68:3805:26:13:90:522:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Despite the importance of studying theTwin Ds(default and devaluation), the subject has
3:69:3892:13:14:90:522:562:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:received relatively limited attention in the literature.  In our view,  one reason for this is
3:70:3986:14:13:90:522:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that it is exceedingly difficult to measure the interaction between the two.  Indeed,  both
3:71:4077:13:14:90:522:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:types  of  events  are  rare,  so  few  data  are  available  for  researchers  to  use.   Disagreement
3:72:4180:14:13:90:521:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:over measurements are a clear manifestation of the problem.  For example,Reinhart(2002)
3:73:4267:13:14:89:521:508:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates the probability of devaluation conditional on default at 84%, whileNa, Schmitt-
3:74:4356:14:13:89:521:494:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Groh ́e,  Uribe,  and Yue(2017) find it to be 48%.  Another hard-to-measure dimension of
3:75:4444:13:14:89:521:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  Twin  Ds  is  whether  default  has  an  immediate  or  long-term  impact  on  the  exchange
3:76:4541:14:13:89:522:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate.Krugman(1979) argues that default leads to a change in the expected depreciation
3:77:4626:13:14:89:522:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate (change in exchange rate), whileNa, Schmitt-Groh ́e, Uribe, and Yue(2017) suggest a
3:78:4714:14:25:89:300:440:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:one-off drop in the exchange rate at default.
3:79:4759:25:14:89:521:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this study, we are the first to take advantage of a recent development in financial markets
3:80:4853:14:13:89:521:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to offer an asset-pricing perspective on the measurement of the risk premia associated with
3:81:4944:13:14:89:521:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Twin Ds.  Specifically, sovereign credit default swap (CDS) contracts are available in
3:82:5034:14:13:89:521:374:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:different currency denominations starting from August 2010.  For example, contracts that
3:83:5122:13:14:89:521:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:protect against a credit event in Germany could be denominated in euros (EUR) or U.S.
3:84:5207:14:13:89:521:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dollars (USD) (we use the terms default and credit event interchangeably).  The difference
3:85:5297:13:14:89:522:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:between  the  two  respective  CDS  premiums  of  the  same  maturity,  also  known  asquanto
3:86:5390:14:13:89:522:320:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:CDS spread, reflects the market’s view about the interaction between the Twin Ds.  Quanto
3:87:5479:13:25:89:521:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spreads of different maturities are informative about the interaction over different horizons.
3:88:5573:25:14:89:521:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We focus on quanto spreads in the 17 European countries that share the euro as the common
3:89:5662:14:14:89:521:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exchange rate.  We find the associated CDS markets particularly interesting for two reasons.
3:90:5754:14:13:89:521:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:First,  despite  the  common  currency  and  monetary  policy,  the  term  structures  of  quanto
3:91:5851:13:14:89:521:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spreads are different, suggesting intriguing implications regarding the different fiscal policies.
3:92:5949:14:13:89:521:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Second,  the  contractual  arrangements  of  the  European  contracts  make  observed  quanto
3:93:6042:13:14:89:521:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spreads transparent in terms of the implications for the Twin Ds.  Specifically, in contrast
3:94:6134:14:13:89:521:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to contracts for emerging markets (EM), payouts on Western European sovereign CDS of
3:95:6218:13:14:89:521:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:all denominations are triggered irrespective of whether a default is associated with domestic
3:96:6311:14:25:89:163:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or foreign debt.
3:97:6327:25:13:89:521:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We start by explaining the institutional arrangements behind sovereign CDS in different
3:98:6414:13:14:89:521:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:currencies.  We then explain how quanto spreads are related to the interaction between the
3:99:6504:14:13:89:521:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Twin  Ds.   Next,  we  develop  a  model  that  allows  us  to  characterize  the  relation  between
3:100:6604:13:0:89:267:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:default and devaluation probabilities.
4:101:6643:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Describing  the  joint  behavior  of  17  different  term  structures  and  an  exchange  rate  is  a
4:102:6744:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:daunting task.  Therefore, we limit ourselves to a no-arbitrage affine term structure model
4:103:6835:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  allows  us  to  evaluate  whether  it  is  possible  to  reconcile  all  of  this  evidence  within
4:104:6940:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a tractable specification.  Along the way,  we encounter a typical problem in the analysis
4:105:7030:14:13:90:522:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of credit-sensitive financial instruments:  as the realization of credit events is rare, we can
4:106:7125:13:14:90:522:623:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identify only the risk-adjusted distribution of these events based on asset prices.  We exploit
4:107:7220:14:13:90:522:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(i) the interaction between credit risk and currency risk, and (ii) the currency commonality
4:108:7312:13:14:90:522:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to identify the true distribution of credit events.  As a bonus,  our approach allows us to
4:109:7403:14:13:90:522:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identify the loss given default (LGD), which we assume to be constant and the same for all
4:110:7493:13:14:90:522:569:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:countries.  While this assumption is an oversimplification, it nevertheless offers progress on
4:111:7587:14:24:90:223:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a thorny empirical problem.
4:112:7614:24:14:90:522:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  model  we  propose  features  the  following  critical  components:   a  model  of  the  U.S.
4:113:7712:14:14:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reference interest rate curve, a model of credit risk, and a model of the spot/forward FX
4:114:7801:14:13:90:522:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:curve.   We  use  overnight  indexed  swap  (OIS)  rates  as  a  reference  curve  and  construct  a
4:115:7901:13:25:90:290:490:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two-factor model to capture its dynamics.
4:116:7942:25:13:90:522:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The starting point for our credit risk model is a credit event whose arrival is controlled by
4:117:8035:13:14:90:522:452:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a doubly-stochastic Cox process, a popular modeling device in the literature.  The default
4:118:8125:14:13:90:522:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensity  in  each  country  is  controlled  by  two  factors  –  global  and  regional  –  which  are
4:119:8228:13:14:90:522:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:weighted differently for each country.  We identify the global factor by setting the weights
4:120:8320:14:13:90:522:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on  Germany’s  regional  factors  to  zero.   Given  that  our  data  are  from  countries  in  the
4:121:8419:13:14:90:522:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Eurozone during the sovereign debt crisis, we derive an extension of our model to allow for
4:122:8510:14:13:90:522:384:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the possibility of credit contagion:  the occurrence of a credit event in one country affecting
4:123:8605:13:25:90:337:371:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the probability of a credit event in another country.
4:124:8658:25:13:90:522:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Last but not least, we model the behavior of the spot USD/EUR FX rate and the associated
4:125:8746:13:14:90:522:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:forward rates.  We follow the literature on realistic modeling of the time series on FX rates.
4:126:8840:14:14:90:522:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We allow for time-varying expected changes in the depreciation rate, heteroscedastic regular
4:127:8932:14:24:90:282:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shocks to the rates, and extreme events.
4:128:8972:24:14:90:522:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We connect jumps in the FX rate to sovereign credit risk by requiring them to take place
4:129:9060:14:13:90:522:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:simultaneously with credit events.  This modeling feature is our identifying assumption that
4:130:9152:13:14:90:522:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:helps us to establish the true distribution of credit events.  To enhance the statistical relia-
4:131:9248:14:13:90:522:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bility of our estimates, we follow Bai, Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Helwege(2015) and
4:132:9337:13:14:90:522:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:complement our identification strategy by associating realized credit events with extreme
4:133:9426:14:24:90:234:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:movements in quanto spreads.
4:134:9454:24:14:90:522:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  use  joint  data  on  the  term  structure  of  the  quanto  spreads  of  six  countries,  which
4:135:9554:14:13:90:522:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:represent  the  most  liquid  CDS  contracts  across  the  European  core  and  periphery,  some
4:136:9650:13:14:90:522:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:data on Greece prior to its credit event, the spot and forward FX rates, and a cross-section
4:137:9742:14:13:90:522:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  credit  events  for  the  six  countries.   We  estimate  the  model  via  the  Bayesian  Markov
4:138:9842:13:14:90:522:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.  The model offers an accurate fit to the data.  It also
4:139:9930:14:13:90:522:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fits the quanto spreads of the remaining 10 Eurozone countries that were not used in the
4:140:10018:13:0:90:143:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimation.
5:141:10030:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We find that a more parsimonious model without contagion fits the data just as well and
5:142:10117:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:does not differ significantly from the larger model in terms of its likelihood.  Therefore, we
5:143:10211:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:perform the rest of the analysis using the simpler model, which features only four factors:
5:144:10302:13:22:90:462:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:three credit factors (one global and two regional) and one FX variance factor.
5:145:10380:22:14:90:522:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We find a substantial cross-sectional variation in how the credit risks of countries load on
5:146:10472:14:13:90:522:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the credit factors.  For instance, exposure to the global factor varies from a high of 4 times
5:147:10566:13:14:90:522:601:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the German level (for Spain) to a low of 1/14 times (for Finland).  Finland is unambiguously
5:148:10658:14:13:90:522:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the least risky country.  There are multiple candidates,  primarily from Southern Europe,
5:149:10747:13:14:90:522:574:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the most risky.  Some countries, both core and peripheral, have significant exposure to
5:150:10838:14:22:90:195:560:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the global factor only.
5:151:10861:22:14:90:522:538:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As we conjectured earlier, a large part of this cross-sectional variation (44% to be precise)
5:152:10954:14:13:90:522:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is driven by differences in the fiscal policies as measured by a country’s debt.  A fixed effects
5:153:11051:13:14:90:522:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regression of hazard rates on the debt-to-GDP ratio implies that a one percentage point
5:154:11138:14:13:90:522:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increase in the ratio of a given country is,  on average,  associated with an increase in its
5:155:11231:13:22:90:343:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CDS premium of approximately 8 basis points (bps).
5:156:11281:22:14:90:522:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our setting allows for the estimation of the true distribution of credit events.  As a result, we
5:157:11378:14:13:90:522:448:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can characterize the time-varying credit risk premium, which is typically measured by the
5:158:11467:13:14:90:522:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ratio of the risk-adjusted to the true default intensity.  We find that the credit risk premium
5:159:11562:14:14:90:522:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is about 2, on average.  This estimate is consistent with earlier studies of corporate credit
5:160:11655:14:13:90:522:407:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk that were estimating a constant risk premium.  We also find evidence for a significant
5:161:11746:13:14:90:522:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amount of variation over time, as the credit risk premium ranges between 1 and 6 during
5:162:11833:14:22:90:179:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our sample period.
5:163:11851:22:13:90:522:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our estimated model can also inform the measurement issues highlighted earlier.  For in-
5:164:11939:13:14:90:522:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stance,  we  find  the  true  1-week  probability  of  devaluation  conditional  on  default  to  be
5:165:12039:14:13:90:522:331:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:4%, which is consistent with the view byNa, Schmitt-Groh ́e, Uribe, and Yue(2017) of a
5:166:12125:13:14:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:large drop in the exchange rate upon default.  In addition, we find that that the expected
5:167:12215:14:22:90:520:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation rate is unrelated to credit factors, contradicting the view ofKrugman(1979).
5:168:12304:22:14:90:522:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  risk-adjusted  probability  of  devaluation  conditional  on  default  is  75%,  suggesting  a
5:169:12403:14:13:90:522:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hefty risk premium for this event.  Indeed, the model-implied risk premiums for exposure
5:170:12491:13:14:90:522:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the Twin Ds exceed the regular currency risk premiums by as much as 0.3% per week.
5:171:12576:14:13:90:522:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Thus, the default-contingent currency risk premium is significantly larger than the default
5:172:12667:13:14:90:522:228:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk premium, which is suggestive of the large economic importance of that risk.  All of this
5:173:12760:14:13:90:522:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evidence suggests that default-contingent devaluation, although not highly probable, occurs
5:174:12851:13:14:90:522:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:during the worst states of the economy when the marginal utility of investors is particularly
5:175:12944:14:37:90:114:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:high.

5:177:12967:29:13:90:522:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This study is related to two strands of the literature.  First, it is most closely related to the
5:178:13064:13:0:90:521:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:literature on the relation between sovereign credit and currency risks.Della-Corte, Sarno,

6:180:13239:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:credit risk correlates with currency depreciations and predicts currency risk premia.Carr
6:181:13328:14:13:90:521:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Wu(2007) propose a joint valuation framework for sovereign CDS and currency options
6:182:13415:13:14:90:521:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  an  empirical  application  to  Mexico  and  Brazil.Du  and  Schreger(2016)  study  the
6:183:13508:14:13:90:522:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determinants of local currency risk as a distinct component of foreign default risk in EM.
6:184:13598:13:14:90:522:623:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Buraschi, Sener, and Menguetuerk(2014) suggest that geographical funding frictions may
6:185:13684:14:13:90:522:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be responsible for persistent mispricing of EM bonds denominated in EUR and USD. While
6:186:13770:13:14:90:522:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:related, our work is conceptually different because of the aforementioned differences in the
6:187:13862:14:13:90:522:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment of credit events associated with domestic and foreign debt.  We exploit the entire
6:188:13954:13:14:90:522:569:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:term structure of CDS quanto spreads to pin down the time variation in the risk premia
6:189:14040:14:25:90:481:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:associated with expectations of exchange rate depreciation conditional on default.

6:192:14294:14:13:90:522:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sistent with nominal and real exchange rate depreciation upon an exogenous default trig-

6:197:14666:25:14:90:522:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In contemporaneous and independent work,Lando and Nielsen(2017);Monfort, Pegoraro,
6:198:14748:14:13:90:522:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Renne, and Roussellet(2017) develop models of sovereign quanto CDS spreads in the Eu-
6:199:14833:13:14:90:522:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rozone.  The former study is focused on the contribution of each of the normal and jump
6:200:14920:14:13:90:522:382:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risks to the shape of the quanto term structure.  The latter study uses quanto spreads in
6:201:15009:13:14:90:521:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a  modeling  application  of  the  Gamma-zero  distribution,  often  denoted  asARG0.   Both
6:202:15101:14:14:90:522:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:studies estimate their models of quanto spreads on a country-by-country basis, whereas we
6:203:15190:14:13:90:522:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:jointly model the exchange rate risk and quanto spreads for the entire term structure of six
6:204:15282:13:14:90:522:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:countries.  This distinction is important, because the dynamics of exchange rates in CDS
6:205:15370:14:13:90:522:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spreads ought to respect the common behavior of the EUR-USD exchange rate movements
6:206:15453:13:14:90:522:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in conjunction with the country-specific default risk.  In addition, using an identifying as-
6:207:15546:14:13:90:522:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sumption that exploits the common currency, we estimate both the true and risk-adjusted
6:208:15633:13:14:90:522:274:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:default intensities.  As a result, we can discuss the implications for time-varying risk premia
6:209:15728:14:13:90:522:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:associated with the default risk and the expected depreciation risk conditional on default.
6:210:15819:13:14:90:522:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Joint estimation is also necessary for identifying the propagation of shocks across countries,

6:212:15973:25:14:90:522:208:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Second, our study builds on the vast literature on no-arbitrage affine term structure mod-

6:216:16331:14:13:90:522:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CDS, the early affine term structure models focus on country-by-country estimations such
6:217:16419:13:14:90:521:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as Turkey, Brazil, Mexico (Pan and Singleton,2008), and Argentina (Zhang,2008), or on

7:227:17313:13:14:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  subordinate  CDS  to  identify  the  LGD.  Lastly,  the  most  recent  studies  exploit  the

7:230:17586:14:25:89:515:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:assume recovery of face value and that a jump in exchange rate is unrelated to the LGD.

7:248:19050:13:14:89:521:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reviews what such an event represents.  Given the focus on USD/EUR quantos of Eurozone
7:249:19136:14:13:89:521:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:countries, we limit the discussion to the legal details associated with European contracts.
7:250:19227:13:26:89:170:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:See AppendixA.

8:256:19669:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the quarterly or semi-annual frequency of the premium payment settlement, and focus on the
8:257:19759:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:annual amounts.  The second row shows a USD-denominated contract (short protection)

8:260:20009:24:14:90:522:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We highlight three implications of the rules that are particularly relevant for this paper.
8:261:20100:14:13:90:522:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:First, a credit event that affects all CDS contracts regardless of the currency of denomination
8:262:20195:13:14:90:522:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:could be triggered by a default pertaining to a subset of bonds, such as a sovereign defaulting
8:263:20290:14:13:90:522:571:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on domestic debt but not on bonds issued in other jurisdictions.  Therefore, a CDS quanto
8:264:20379:13:14:90:522:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spread would not reflect the risk of selective default. This is in contrast to EM bonds, studied
8:265:20475:14:13:90:522:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by Du and Schreger (2016), where differences between the credit spreads denominated in
8:266:20561:13:14:90:522:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:USD and local currency could reflect such a risk,  and to EM CDS contracts,  studied by
8:267:20648:14:14:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Mano (2013), for which a credit event is not triggered by default on domestic currency or
8:268:20737:14:24:90:186:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:domestic law bonds.
8:269:20756:24:14:90:522:479:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Second,  an obligation is deemed deliverable into the contract settlement regardless of its
8:270:20847:14:13:90:522:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:currency of denomination or that of the CDS contract.  This means that one and the same
8:271:20934:13:14:90:522:452:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bond could be delivered into the settlements of CDS contracts of different denominations.
8:272:21023:14:13:90:521:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Thus, recovery is free of any exchange rate consideration, a point also made byEhlers and
8:273:21112:13:14:90:521:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Schoenbucher(2004).  Compare this withMano(2013), who, in the context of EM bonds
8:274:21193:14:24:89:457:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:explicitly considers different currency denominations of the recovery amount.
8:275:21270:24:14:89:521:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As an extreme example, imagine a European sovereign that has 1% of all its debt issued
8:276:21356:14:13:89:521:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in EUR, and the rest issued in USD. Both EUR- and USD-denominated contracts would
8:277:21437:13:14:89:521:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be  triggered  in  the  case  of  selective  default  on  the  small  amount  of  outstanding  EUR-
8:278:21536:14:13:89:521:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:denominated debt.  Because one can deliver a bond of any denomination into a contract
8:279:21621:13:14:89:521:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of any denomination, the cash value of payments in case of a credit event could be viewed
8:280:21710:14:14:89:521:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as an identical fraction, denoted byL(LGD) in Figure1, of a contract’s notional amount.
8:281:21797:14:13:89:522:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We fixLto be a constant, in line with the literature on CDS pricing (Pan and Singleton,
8:282:21884:13:25:89:481:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2008).  This removes any uncertainty about payments in the respective currencies.
8:283:21965:25:13:89:521:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The only uncertainty that arises with a credit event is due to expressing these payments
8:284:22053:13:14:89:521:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the same currency.  For example, the EUR-denominated contract pays a certain amount
8:285:22139:14:13:89:521:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:ofL/S0, while the EUR value of the payment of the USD-denominated contract isL/Sτ,

8:287:22317:14:13:89:522:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:devaluation.  If the EUR devalues during the credit event,Sτis lower thanS0, and, as a
8:288:22403:13:14:89:521:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:result, the value of the payment on the EUR-denominated contract is lower than that on
8:289:22489:14:24:89:218:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the USD-denominated one.
8:290:22513:24:14:89:521:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Third,  outright  default  is  only  one  of  the  scenarios  that  may  trigger  a  credit  event.   A
8:291:22616:14:13:89:521:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:common  concern  among  observers  of  the  Eurozone  credit  market  is  that  a  CDS  payout
8:292:22710:13:14:89:521:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:would be triggered by a restructuring of a Eurozone member country’s liabilities through a
8:293:22800:14:13:89:521:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:redenomination of the principal or interest payments into the country’s pre-EUR currency.
8:294:22889:13:0:89:521:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:There are two CDS definitions, those of 2003 and 2014, which treat this event differently.
9:295:22980:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For contracts based on the 2003 definitions, redenomination does not trigger a credit event
9:296:23071:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as long as it involves the currencies of the G7 countries and AAA-rated OECD economies.
9:297:23158:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  newer  definitions  limit  these  currencies  to  the  lawful  currencies  of  Canada,  Japan,
9:298:23257:13:26:90:492:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the Eurozone.
9:299:23337:26:13:90:522:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:After  the  2014  definitions  were  introduced,  CDS  could  be  concurrently  traded  satisfying
9:300:23435:13:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:either definition.  We use data on the contracts guided by the 2003 definitions throughout
9:301:23525:14:13:90:522:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our full sample to ensure internal consistency.Kremens(2018) explores the differences in
9:302:23613:13:14:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:premiums for the two types of contracts.  Regardless of the definition used, some countries
9:303:23704:14:13:90:522:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:might trigger a credit event by redenomination.  Our framework automatically accounts for
9:304:23793:13:14:90:522:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  because  our  credit  factors  are  designed  to  capture  the  probability  of  a  credit  event
9:305:23896:14:41:90:221:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:without discerning its type.
9:306:23924:41:33:90:285:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.2    Relation to sovereign bonds
9:307:23958:33:13:90:522:469:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Historically,  Eurozone  sovereign  CDS  were  denominated  in  USD  only.   One  point  worth
9:308:24052:13:14:90:522:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:emphasizing is that EUR-denominated CDS contracts that were introduced in 2010 are not
9:309:24138:14:13:90:522:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:redundant securities.  One might think of cash flows as similar to those of a portfolio that
9:310:24230:13:14:90:521:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consists of a USD-denominated bond and a currency swap (e.g.,Du and Schreger,2016).
9:311:24313:14:13:90:522:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, such a strategy does not hedge the behavior of the FX rate conditional on default
9:312:24403:13:26:90:284:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:– the risk that is the focus of this paper.
9:313:24446:26:13:90:521:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To  see  this,  consider  the  third  and  fourth  rows  of  Figure1,  which  show  cash  flows  to  a
9:314:24548:13:14:90:522:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sovereign par bond and a currency swap of matching maturity.  The bond is USD denomi-
9:315:24633:14:14:90:522:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nated, but the issuer prefers a EUR exposure, hence the additional swap position.  The cash
9:316:24724:14:25:90:328:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:flows are presented per $1 of face/notional values.
9:317:24775:25:14:90:522:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:At time 0, the issuer sells the bond for $1 and swaps this amount for the equivalent value
9:318:24865:14:13:90:521:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in EUR,e1/S0.Prior to maturity, the issuer has to pay interest of $C0on a bond, which
9:319:24950:13:14:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it receives from the swap as interest on the USD value of the notional.  In exchange, the
9:320:25039:14:13:90:521:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:issuer has to pay interest ofeF0/S0on the EUR value of the swap, withF0denoting the
9:321:25122:13:26:90:322:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:currency swap rate that is determined at time 0.
9:322:25170:26:13:90:522:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:If there is no credit event, the last transaction takes place at maturity, where the issuer has
9:323:25265:13:14:90:522:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to repay $(1 +C0) on the bond and the EUR/USD notionals combined with the last interest
9:324:25352:14:13:90:522:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:payments that are exchanged in the swap transaction.  As a result, the combined position
9:325:25440:13:14:90:521:190:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:has a pure EUR exposure with pre-determined cash flows:e1/S0at inception,−eF0/S0
9:326:25520:14:13:89:522:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thereafter (including the day of maturity), and−e1/S0at maturity.  This is conceptually
9:327:25607:13:14:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:similar to cash flows on the EUR-denominated sovereign CDS if there is no credit event
9:328:25693:14:26:89:385:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(the difference is in the latter being an unfunded instrument).
9:329:25756:26:13:89:521:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:If there is a credit event, then the bond-swap combination faces uncertain cash flows between

10:331:25934:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the meantime, the swap does not terminate (assuming no counterparty risk) and continues
10:332:26021:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  exchange  of  cash  flows.   As  a  result,  the  values  of  the  combined  cash  flows  in  EUR

10:336:26301:33:13:90:522:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 1 allows us to take a first step toward thinking about quanto CDS spreads.  Adding
10:337:26390:13:14:90:522:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:up the two positions described in the first two rows (long EUR-denominated and short USD-
10:338:26479:14:13:90:522:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:denominated protection) gives an exposure to devaluation conditional on default, because
10:339:26567:13:14:90:522:536:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  only  uncertain  cash  flow  is  the  EUR  value  ofLin  the  USD  contract.   Specifically,
10:340:26664:14:14:90:522:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by  buying  the  EUR-denominated  protection  and  selling  the  USD-denominated  one,  we
10:341:26754:14:13:90:522:508:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:construct  a  position  that  benefits  if  there  is  no  EUR  devaluation  conditional  on  default.

10:343:26901:26:13:90:522:469:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Because CDS contracts have a fixed time to maturity, we observe premiums for new con-

10:346:27171:13:26:90:423:429:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:C$0−Ce0becomes the relevant premium for exposure to the Twin Ds.
10:347:27235:26:13:90:522:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To  streamline  the  analytical  interpretation  of  the  quanto  CDS  spread,  consider  a  hypo-
10:348:27333:13:14:90:522:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thetical contract that trades all points upfront, meaning that a protection buyer pays the

11:388:28855:26:13:90:522:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We work with weekly data to minimize noise due to the potential staleness of some of the

11:390:29033:14:14:90:522:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information on 5-year quanto spreads throughout the sample period for all countries except
11:391:29123:14:13:90:522:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Greece,  as  the  trading  of  its  sovereign  CDS  contract  halted  following  its  official  default
11:392:29226:13:14:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  2012.   In  addition,  we  retain  the  maturities  of  1,  3,  7,  10,  and  15  years  (we  omit  the
11:393:29333:14:13:90:522:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:available 30-year contracts because they are similar to the 15-year ones; in particular the
11:394:29424:13:14:90:522:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:term structures between 15 and 30 are flat).  Although the 5-year contract is the most liquid,
11:395:29518:14:13:90:522:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:liquidity across the term structure is less of a concern for sovereign CDS spreads than for
11:396:29609:13:14:90:522:397:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:corporate CDS spreads, as trading is more evenly spread across the maturity spectrum (Pan
11:397:29698:14:25:90:191:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Singleton, 2008).
11:398:29719:25:14:90:522:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although these sovereign CDS contracts trade in multiple currencies, there might be differ-
11:399:29810:14:13:90:522:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ences in liquidity given that an insurance payment in EUR would probably be less valuable
11:400:29899:13:14:90:522:331:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:if Germany defaulted.  Consistent with this view, USD-denominated contracts tend to be
11:401:29985:14:14:90:522:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more liquid, as documented in Table1, which reports the average number of dealers quoting
11:402:30074:14:13:90:521:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such contracts in either EUR or USD over time; that is, CDS depth (Qiu and Yu,2012).
11:403:30158:13:14:90:522:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The average difference between the number of USD and EUR dealers ranges between 0.60
11:404:30242:14:13:90:522:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  2.66.   EUR  CDS  contracts  are  quoted  by  2.73  to  6.30  dealers,  on  average,  which  is
11:405:30342:13:14:90:522:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economically meaningful given that the CDS market is largely concentrated among a hand-
11:406:30429:14:13:90:521:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ful of dealers (Giglio,2014;Siriwardane,2014).  In relative terms, the average number of
11:407:30517:13:14:90:522:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quoting dealers for the USD contracts exceeds that for the EUR by 1.  That suggests that
11:408:30605:14:25:90:410:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the difference in liquidity of the two types of contracts is not large.
11:409:30676:25:14:90:521:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Notional amounts outstanding, also reported in Table1, offer a sense of the cross-sectional
11:410:30767:14:13:90:522:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variation in the size of the market. Regardless of the currency of denomination, the notionals
11:411:30861:13:14:90:522:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are converted into USD and reported on the gross and net basis.  To facilitate comparison,
11:412:30951:14:14:90:522:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we express these numbers as a percentage of the respective quantities for Italy, which has the
11:413:31045:14:13:90:521:142:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:largest gross and net notionals (Augustin, Sokolovski, Subrahmanyam, and Tomio,2016).
11:414:31130:13:14:90:522:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The amounts for France, Germany, and Spain stand out as a fraction of Italy’s amounts,
11:415:31216:14:0:90:301:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:followed by Austria, Belgium, and Portugal.
12:416:31260:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To provide a first feel for the data, Figure 2A displays the time-series of one of the most liquid
12:417:31358:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  arguably  the  least  credit-risky  CDS  contracts,  namely  the  5-year  USD-denominated
12:418:31452:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contract for Germany.  We highlight important events to help frame the magnitudes of CDS
12:419:31540:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:premiums.  The premium for such a safe country is about 20 bps during the calmest periods,
12:420:31630:14:25:90:400:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:varies over time, and exceeds 100 bps during the sovereign crisis.
12:421:31696:25:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To  further  gauge  the  size  of  the  market  for  single-name  sovereign  CDS,  we  compare  the
12:422:31795:14:13:90:522:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gross notional amounts outstanding to the aggregate market size.Augustin(2014) reports
12:423:31881:13:14:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that in 2012,  single-name sovereign CDS accounted for approximately 11% of the overall
12:424:31968:14:13:90:522:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:market, which was then valued at $27 trillion in gross notional amounts outstanding.  The
12:425:32057:13:14:90:522:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:corporate CDS market accounted for about 89% of the market, with single- and multi-name
12:426:32144:14:13:90:522:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contracts amounting to $16 trillion and $11 trillion, respectively.  While the CDS market
12:427:32233:13:14:90:522:530:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has somewhat shrunk in recent years, statistics from the Bank for International Settlements
12:428:32324:14:14:90:522:516:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggest that sovereign CDS represented $1.715 trillion, about 18% of the entire market, in

12:432:32533:13:14:90:522:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amount of both cross-sectional and time-series variation in the spreads.  In the cross-section,
12:433:32628:14:14:90:522:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the average quanto spread ranges from 6 bps for Estonia to 90 bps for Greece, at the 5-year
12:434:32719:14:13:90:522:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:maturity.   The  average  quanto  slope,  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  10-year  and
12:435:32817:13:14:90:522:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1-year quanto spreads, ranges from -29 bps for Greece to 29 bps for France.  Overall, both

12:437:32994:25:14:90:522:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We limit the estimation of our model to data on six sovereigns because of parameter prolif-
12:438:33085:14:13:90:522:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:eration.  We choose the countries that exhibit the greatest market liquidity and the fewest

12:441:33355:13:14:90:521:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leads us to focus on Germany, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.  Figure3A plots
12:442:33444:14:13:90:522:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the average quanto term spreads of different maturities for these countries.  We also use a
12:443:33535:13:14:90:522:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:limited amount of data on Greece, as described later in this section.  We use data on the
12:444:33624:14:41:90:452:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:remaining countries to conduct an “out-of-sample” evaluation of our model.
12:445:33698:41:32:90:168:200:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:C:Exchange rate
12:446:33711:32:14:90:522:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  collect  the  time  series  of  the  USD/EUR  FX  rate  from  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of
12:447:33808:14:13:90:522:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:St.  Louis Economic Database (FRED) and match it with the quanto data, using weekly
12:448:33891:13:14:90:522:141:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exchange rates, sampled every Wednesday.  Figures2B and3B display the exchange rate
12:449:33974:14:13:90:522:127:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  (log)  depreciation  rate,  respectively.   A  broad  devaluation  of  the  EUR  is  evident  in
12:450:34075:13:0:90:140:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure2B.
13:451:34086:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure  3B  suggests  that  the  exchange  rate  movements  were  close  to  being  independent
13:452:34181:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and identically distributed (iid) during our sample period.  Motivated by that, Appendix
13:453:34269:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:B shows that the term structure of credit premia is flat if both the default intensity and
13:454:34359:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation rates are iid but correlated with each other.  This result establishes a useful
13:455:34451:14:25:90:410:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:benchmark for interpreting the evidence summarized in Figure 3A.
13:456:34515:25:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CDS premiums and exchange rates are interrelated and move together over time.  This is
13:457:34601:14:13:90:522:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:summarized by the cross-correlogram between the first principal component of changes in
13:458:34688:13:14:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:5-year CDS premiums and depreciation rates in Figure 2C. The Figure highlights that this
13:459:34776:14:25:90:486:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interaction is primarily contemporaneous, and not readily visible in leads and lags.
13:460:34860:25:14:90:522:545:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 2D stays with Germany to show an example of time-series variation in (5-year) quanto
13:461:34951:14:13:90:521:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CDS spreads.  As explained in Section2.3, the spreads reflect the interaction between the
13:462:35040:13:14:90:522:518:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Twin Ds and are informative about the covariance risk and the currency jump at default
13:463:35126:14:14:90:522:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk.  A model is needed to understand the interactions over different horizons and to extract
13:464:35220:14:40:90:212:490:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the quanto risk premium.
13:465:35244:40:33:90:164:450:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:C:Interest rates
13:466:35258:33:13:90:522:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To develop the model, we also need information on the term structure of U.S. interest rates.
13:467:35350:13:14:90:522:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Prior to the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008/09, it was common practice to use Libor
13:468:35440:14:13:90:522:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  swap  rates  as  the  closest  approximation  to  risk-free  lending  rates  in  the  interdealer
13:469:35542:13:14:90:521:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:market (Feldhutter and Lando,2008).  Since the GFC, practitioners have shifted toward
13:470:35627:14:14:90:522:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:full collateralization and started using OIS rates as better proxies of risk-free rates (Hull and
13:471:35724:14:13:90:522:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:White,2013).  This shift has implications for Libor-linked interest rate swaps (IRS) because
13:472:35816:13:14:90:522:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discounting  is  performed  using  the  OIS-implied  curves.   We  source  daily  information  on
13:473:35913:14:13:90:522:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:OIS and IRS rates for all available maturities from Bloomberg, focusing on OIS rates with
13:474:36002:13:14:90:522:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:maturities of 3, 6, 9, 12, 36, and 60 months and IRS rates with maturities of 7, 10, 15, and
13:475:36094:14:25:90:132:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:30 years.
13:476:36103:25:14:90:522:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  bootstrap  zero  coupon  rates  from  all  swap  rates.   We  transform  all  swap  rates  into
13:477:36202:14:13:90:522:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:par-bond yields, assuming a piece-wise constant forward curve, and then extract the zero-
13:478:36291:13:14:90:522:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coupon rates of the same maturities as the swap rates.  Thus, we obtain a zero-coupon yield
13:479:36382:14:13:90:522:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimated from OIS rates up to 5 years, and from IRS rates for maturities above 5 years.
13:480:36470:13:14:90:522:216:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To extend the OIS zero-curve for maturities beyond 5 years, we use the zero-coupon yield
13:481:36558:14:14:90:522:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bootstrapped from IRS rates, but adjusted daily by the differential between the IRS- and
13:482:36646:14:25:90:497:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:OIS-implied zero-coupon curves.  A figure in AppendixGdisplays the resulting rates.
13:483:36729:25:14:90:522:163:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Once  we  have  a  model  of  the  joint  behavior  of  interest  rates  and  exchange  rates,  it  has
13:484:36832:14:13:90:522:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implications for forward exchange rates.  To discipline our model, we use weekly Thomson
13:485:36920:13:14:90:522:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Reuters data on forward exchange rates obtained from Datastream.  We use the Wednesday
13:486:37006:14:13:90:522:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quotes for our analysis to match the Wednesday OIS rates and quanto spreads focusing on
13:487:37093:13:0:90:522:109:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the maturities of 1 week and 1 month.  Our analysis does not require the European interest
14:488:37185:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate values, hence we can avoid addressing the important analysis of CIP violations in Du,
14:489:37275:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Tepper,  and  Verdelhan(2017).   Covered  interest  parity  holds  in  our  model.   Therefore,
14:490:37370:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the inferred foreign interest rate could be viewed as an implicit foreign bank funding rate.
14:491:37462:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Such an interpretation is valid in the light of research focusing on various market frictions
14:492:37555:14:13:90:521:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leading to violations of CIP in terms of true Libor rates (e.g.,Borio, McCauley, McGuire,
14:493:37644:13:41:90:180:623:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Sushko,2016).
14:494:37661:41:33:90:164:582:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:C:Credit events
14:495:37674:33:13:90:522:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our last piece of evidence pertains to the true occurrence of credit events.  True default
14:496:37764:13:14:90:522:536:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information is insufficient for estimating conditional credit event probabilities because re-
14:497:37857:14:13:90:522:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alized  credit  events  are  rare.   This  issue  is  common  to  the  literature  on  credit-sensitive
14:498:37960:13:14:90:522:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instruments.   When  modeling  corporate  defaults,  it  is  possible  to  infer  something  about
14:499:38058:14:13:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:true conditional default probabilities by grouping companies by their credit rating, as done
14:500:38150:13:26:90:244:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:byDriessen(2005), for instance.
14:501:38181:26:13:90:522:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We are considering high quality sovereign names, so we have only the credit event in Greece
14:502:38272:13:14:90:522:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  our  sample.   Formal  defaults  are  often  avoided  because  of  bailouts,  as  was  witnessed
14:503:38372:14:13:90:522:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:multiple times during the sovereign debt crisis (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus).
14:504:38463:13:14:90:522:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:These bailouts result in large movements in credit spreads, although no formal credit event
14:505:38554:14:14:90:522:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:occurred.  Therefore, we associate credit events with extreme movements in quanto spreads
14:506:38643:14:13:90:522:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(see alsoBai, Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Helwege,2015).  Specifically, we deem a credit
14:507:38735:13:14:90:522:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:event to have occurred if a weekly (Wednesday to Wednesday) change in the 5-year quanto
14:508:38822:14:13:90:522:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spread  is  above  the  99th  percentile  of  the  country-specific  distribution  of  quanto  spread
14:509:38923:13:14:90:522:348:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes.1A figure in AppendixG displays the observed credit events identified in this way
14:510:39012:14:25:90:254:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the 16 countries in our sample.
14:511:39047:25:14:90:522:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although Greece experienced a formal credit event, it is difficult to use the full available
14:512:39139:14:13:90:522:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:series for pragmatic reasons (see alsoAit-Sahalia, Laeven, and Pelizzon,2014).  As a figure
14:513:39230:13:14:90:522:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  AppendixGshows,  the  Greek  CDS  premium  jumped  to  5,062  bps  on  September  13,
14:514:39319:14:13:90:522:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2011, long before the true declaration of the credit event on March 9, 2012.  It exceeded the
14:515:39412:13:14:90:522:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:10,000 bps threshold, which is equivalent to 100% of the insured face value, on February 15,
14:516:39504:14:14:90:522:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2012.  Furthermore, trading of Greece CDS spreads was halted between March 8, 2012 and
14:517:39590:14:13:90:522:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:June 10, 2013, so the time series exhibits a long gap in quoted premiums.  Assuming the
14:518:39677:13:14:90:522:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Markit-reported aggregation of quoted spreads was tradable, Greek CDS trading restarted
14:519:39764:14:13:90:522:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on June 10, 2013, at a level of 978 bps.  The corresponding quanto spreads displayed in the
14:520:39855:13:14:90:522:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same figure exhibit similar swings in magnitudes and gaps in the data.  These data problems
14:521:39946:14:13:90:522:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:create severe credit risk identification issues and make it difficult to study the joint behavior
14:522:40043:13:14:90:247:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of credit factors across countries.
14:523:40078:14:15:102:521:146:6:g_d0_f14:9:g_d0_f15:F:1One concern is that such a definition may bias downwards the coincidence of large drops in the EUR
14:524:40177:15:11:90:522:131:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:F:value and credit events.  Changing from quanto spreads to USD CDS premiums or introducing an identicial
14:525:40280:11:11:90:522:120:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:F:cut-off (two standard deviations of all CDS premiums changes across time and countries) does not materially
14:526:40387:11:0:90:399:109:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:F:affect estimated probabilities of the coincidence of these two types of events.
15:527:40468:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As a result, we designate September 7, 2011, as a credit event instead of the official one.
15:528:40559:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:After  that  day,  the  available  data  are  unusable.   This  period  is  too  short  to  identify  the
15:529:40664:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Greek default hazard rate throughout the full sample.  Therefore,  we also use some data
15:530:40752:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the period when the trading resumed in June 2013.  Out of concern that very large
15:531:40838:14:13:90:522:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:premiums  may  not  be  reflective  of  true  traded  prices,  we  use  only  those  premiums  that
15:532:40937:13:14:90:522:623:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are within 150% of the maximum of premiums with a corresponding maturity among the
15:533:41019:14:13:90:522:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:remaining GIIPS countries.  The omitted premiums are so large, that the estimation results
15:534:41109:13:46:90:377:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are not sensitive to the choice of the maximum cutoff point.
15:535:41169:46:36:90:190:550:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:3    The model
15:536:41183:36:13:90:522:514:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this section, we present a no-arbitrage model of the joint dynamics of U.S. interest rates,
15:537:41277:13:14:90:522:501:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:USD/EUR FX rate, forward FX rates, and CDS quanto spreads for Eurozone countries.  In
15:538:41362:14:14:90:522:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:broad strokes, the key part of the model is the connection between a devaluation of the FX
15:539:41452:14:13:90:522:473:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate and a sovereign credit event.  Mathematically, we model the arrival of a credit event
15:540:41542:13:14:90:522:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:via a Poisson process.  Credit hazard rates feature one common component that is linked
15:541:41629:14:13:90:522:446:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to Germany, and regional components.  Furthermore, we allow for default contagion effects.
15:542:41719:13:14:90:522:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To connect devaluation to credit risk, we make the identifying assumption that jumps in
15:543:41806:14:13:90:522:419:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the FX rate can take place only if one of the Eurozone sovereigns experiences a credit event.

17:625:45588:13:14:90:522:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is a function of all global factors and one of the regional factors.  We assume thatG= 1
17:626:45676:14:13:90:522:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:andK= 2 in our empirical work,  implying two factors per country (one global and one

17:629:45946:13:14:90:522:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extracts country-specific components from the quanto spreads.  The procedure implies that

17:631:46123:14:13:90:522:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the combination of the first two components across all countries implies that the first
17:632:46213:13:25:90:333:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:principal component explains 58% of the variation.
17:633:46263:25:14:90:522:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To gain intuition about how our model of contagion works, consider the Poisson arrival of

17:635:46453:13:14:89:521:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  affect  the  conditional  rate  in  the  subsequent  period.   Denote  the  realization  byP:
17:636:46550:14:25:89:185:212:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f6:C:P|dt∼Poisson(dt).
17:637:46567:25:14:89:522:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In our application to Eurozone sovereigns, we expectdtto be small, implying that most of
17:638:46655:14:13:89:521:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the realizations ofPwill be equal to zero (the probability of such an event ise−dt).  The

17:641:46917:25:13:89:521:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this respect, such a Poisson process can be viewed as an analytically tractable approx-
17:642:47007:13:0:89:521:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:imation to a Bernoulli distribution that is more appropriate for a credit event in a single
18:643:47100:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:country.  For reasons of parsimony, we use this process to count all contemporaneous events
18:644:47191:14:26:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across the countries in our sample.  Thus, a Poisson model is a better fit for our framework.
18:645:47284:26:13:90:521:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The next step in the contagion model is to determine how the value ofPaffects the subse-

18:647:47464:14:13:90:522:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a non-negative support.  Second, we would like to achieve analytical tractability for
18:648:47554:13:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:valuation purposes, so we choose a Gamma distribution whose shape parameter is controlled

23:885:58090:32:14:90:522:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We have articulated all of the modeling components that are needed for security valuation.
23:886:58180:14:13:90:522:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To estimate the model, we need the behavior of state variables under the true probability
23:887:58269:13:14:90:521:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of outcomes.  AppendixDdemonstrates that there exists a pricing kernel that supports a
23:888:58355:14:13:90:522:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:flexible change in the distribution of variables involved in the valuation of securities.  Most
23:889:58450:13:14:90:522:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameters could be different under the two probabilities.  One may recover the evolution of
23:890:58542:14:13:90:521:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:state variables under the objective probability by dropping the asterisks∗in the expressions
23:891:58634:13:26:90:157:348:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of Section3.5.
23:892:58648:26:14:90:522:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Given the focus on credit events,  we highlight how the prices of default risk work in our
23:893:58738:14:13:90:521:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model.  All of the variables that are related to credit events have true (hkt, λt) and risk-
23:894:58830:13:14:90:521:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:adjusted  (h∗kt, λ∗t)  versions  because  the  event  risk  premium  could  be  time  varying.   In
23:895:58929:14:13:90:522:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:particular,  the  true  and  risk-adjusted  counterparts  may  have  a  different  functional  form
23:896:59028:13:14:90:522:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and a different factor structure.  In addition, each of these variables may have different true
23:897:59123:14:13:90:522:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and risk-adjusted distributions that are related to the respective distributions of the factors
23:898:59218:13:26:90:168:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that drive them.
23:899:59234:26:13:90:521:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  risk-adjusted  and  true  distributions  ofh∗ktandλ∗tcan  be  identified  from  the  cross-
23:900:59330:13:14:90:519:202:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f8:B:section  and  time  series  of  quanto  spreads,  respectively.   The  true  event  frequencieshkt
23:901:59428:14:13:90:522:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:andλtcan be identified only from the realized credit events themselves – a challenge for
23:902:59516:13:14:90:522:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:financial assets of high credit quality.  As mentioned earlier, we circumvent this difficulty
23:903:59609:14:14:90:522:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by associating credit events with extreme movements in quanto spreads.  Even in this case,
23:904:59699:14:13:90:522:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:however,  the  empirical  problem  is  quite  challenging,  so  we  only  model  common  events
23:905:59794:13:14:90:522:134:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and assume that they are directed by the same factors as their risk-adjusted counterparts:

24:908:59960:33:14:90:522:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We jointly use data on the USD/EUR FX rate, forward FX rates, the term structure of OIS

24:911:60233:14:13:90:521:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model.  The model is estimated using Bayesian MCMC. See AppendixE. The outputs of
24:912:60314:13:14:90:522:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the procedure are the state variables and parameter estimates.  We outline the parameter
24:913:60402:14:25:90:222:590:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:restrictions that we impose.
24:914:60430:25:14:90:522:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We make the following identifying restrictions.  For the model of the OIS term structure, we

24:917:60686:14:13:90:522:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we impose the mean of the state variablesgtto be equal to 1 under the true probability
24:918:60772:13:14:90:522:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:to avoid scaling indeterminacy.  This implies restrictions on parametersci:ciνi= 1−φ>iι,
24:919:60860:14:14:89:522:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whereιis a vector of ones.  By the same logic, we setρ= 1 in the true dynamics of the
24:920:60945:14:25:89:182:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:contagion factordt.
24:921:60964:25:14:89:521:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Because of the large number of parameters, we also impose over-identification restrictions.
24:922:61055:14:13:89:521:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  allow  the  global  credit  factorw1tto  affect  regional  factors,  but  not  vice-versa.   This
24:923:61156:13:14:90:521:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:restriction affects elementsφi.  We assume the volatility factorvtto be autonomous under
24:924:61244:14:13:89:521:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both probabilities.  Both sets of restrictions translate into identical restrictions under the
24:925:61338:13:14:89:521:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk-adjusted probability because of the functional form of the risk prices for these factors.
24:926:61432:14:13:89:521:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Furthermore,  we  assume  that  the  contagion  factordtloads  only  onw1tunder  the  true

24:930:61576:33:13:90:521:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:A table in AppendixF displays the estimated parameters of the OIS term structure.  The
24:931:61662:13:14:90:522:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model is standard and the parameter values are in line with the literature.  It is difficult
24:932:61754:14:14:90:522:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to interpret the model because there are multiple equivalent rotations of the factors.  The
24:933:61845:14:13:90:521:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:key for this paper, as indicated in Table3, is that the pricing errors are reasonably small.
24:934:61937:13:14:90:522:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Therefore, we can use the model to discount cash flows using the risk-adjusted valuation
24:935:62025:14:25:90:129:193:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:method.
24:936:62032:25:14:90:522:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We estimate two versions of the credit model:  with and without contagion.  We present the
24:937:62122:14:13:90:522:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimated parameters in AppendixF. There are common traits to the parameter estimates
24:938:62207:13:14:90:521:141:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regardless  of  the  model.   The  factorswtexhibit  near  unit-root  dynamics  under  the  risk-
24:939:62304:14:13:90:522:127:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:adjusted probability, a common trait of affine models.  Under the true probability, only the
24:940:62396:13:0:90:296:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:global credit factorw1tis highly persistent.
25:941:62442:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Furthermore, the peripheral countries in our sample have a much larger weight on the global
25:942:62533:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:credit factor than the core countries.  France has a smaller loading on the core credit factor
25:943:62627:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than Belgium (Germany’s weight is zero by assumption).  Spain’s weight on the peripheral
25:944:62715:13:25:90:454:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factor is larger than that of Italy and Greece, and similar to that of Ireland.
25:945:62794:25:14:90:521:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The loss-given-default parameter,L, is estimated at 41% in the model without contagion,
25:946:62881:14:13:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a 90% confidence interval of 35% to 50%.  As a reference point, in CDS valuation, it is
25:947:62973:13:14:90:522:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:commonly assumed that this value is 60% for corporate and 75% for EM sovereign bonds.
25:948:63058:14:14:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The most comparable estimated numbers are provided inPan and Singleton(2008) at 23%
25:949:63141:14:13:90:522:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for Mexico and Turkey, and 83% for South Korea.  We guess that our estimate would have
25:950:63227:13:14:90:521:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:been lower for core countries, asLis affected by events in the periphery (according to the
25:951:63317:14:25:90:362:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Greek CDS settlement auction, the true loss was 78.5%).
25:952:63372:25:13:90:522:518:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We find that the expected depreciation rate does not load on credit factors under either
25:953:63460:13:14:90:522:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probability, and that the same goes for shocks.  The loading of the expected depreciation
25:954:63549:14:13:90:522:491:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate on the variance factor is positive under the true probability and negative under the
25:955:63638:13:14:90:522:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk-adjusted  one.   This  implies  that,  ignoring  jumps,  the  EUR  is  expected  to  appreci-
25:956:63736:14:25:90:344:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ate/depreciate under the corresponding probabilities.
25:957:63789:25:14:90:522:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The FX jump magnitude is just under 1% under the true probability.  This is consistent with
25:958:63880:14:13:90:521:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the visually mild observed movements in Figure3B. Under the risk-adjusted probability, it
25:959:63969:13:14:90:522:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is 14% implying a huge risk premium associated with currency devaluation upon a sovereign
25:960:64058:14:25:90:149:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:credit event.
25:961:64071:25:14:90:522:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  evaluate  whether  a  larger  model  with  contagion  is  supported  by  the  evidence.   The
25:962:64168:14:13:90:522:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameters  that  are  contagion-specific,δ∗kd,δd,andρ∗are  statistically  significant.   The
25:963:64261:13:14:90:522:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:question is whether the extra degrees of freedom associated with a larger model are justi-
25:964:64351:14:13:90:522:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fied from the statistical and economic perspectives.  While we find some credence for the
25:965:64440:13:14:90:522:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contagion mechanism in our sample, the improvement in the model’s fit does not justify the
25:966:64530:14:25:90:302:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:associated increase in statistical uncertainty.
25:967:64577:25:14:90:521:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Specifically,  a  table  in  AppendixFreports  the  distributions  of  the  likelihoods  of  both
25:968:64674:14:13:90:522:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models,  and  the  associated  BICs  (the  negative  of  the  likelihood  plus  the  penalty  for  the
25:969:64776:13:14:90:522:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:number of parameters).  Both statistics indicate that the difference between the two models
25:970:64867:14:13:90:521:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is insignificant.  Table3 reports various measures of pricing errors for the model without
25:971:64957:13:14:90:522:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contagion.  The same metrics for the model with contagion are similar and, therefore, are
25:972:65046:14:25:90:522:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not reported for brevity.  Thus, we discuss only the model without contagion in the sequel.
25:973:65137:25:14:90:522:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Continuing with Table3 we see that the overall fit is good, with the RMSE ranging from
25:974:65223:14:13:89:521:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2 to 12 basis points.  To visualize the fit, we plot the time series of the observed and fitted
25:975:65318:13:25:89:401:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spreads in Figure4.  The overall high quality of the fit is evident.
25:976:65386:25:14:89:521:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As a final and out-of-sample test of the model’s quality, we take the estimated factors and
25:977:65477:14:13:89:521:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:re-estimate only the country-specific parameters of the default intensities using data for the
25:978:65571:13:0:89:522:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:remaining 10 countries.  The resulting fit is displayed in Figure5.  The overall quality of the
26:979:65668:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fit remains high,  suggesting that our model is quite reasonable.  The selection procedure
26:980:65758:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the main sample implies that these countries represent less liquid markets.  Therefore,
26:981:65848:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fitting these quanto spreads perfectly is not required.  The observed spreads for Cyprus are
26:982:65940:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quite erratic, manifesting the illiquidity and riskiness of this sovereign, so the fit here is the
26:983:66038:14:38:90:119:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worst.

26:987:66183:14:14:90:522:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is that the means of these factors are set to 1.  This explains the similarity in scale.  The
26:988:66276:14:13:90:522:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time-series patterns are quite different.  All factors exhibit large movements in 2012, around

26:990:66469:14:13:90:522:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual  sovereigns,  the  creation  of  the  European  Financial  Stability  Facility,  and  the
26:991:66569:13:14:90:522:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:political instability in Greece.  The crisis reached its peak when Greece officially defaulted
26:992:66663:14:13:90:522:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  March  2012.   The  sharp  drop  in  the  factors  shortly  thereafter  is  associated  with  the
26:993:66764:13:14:90:522:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:famous speech by Mario Draghi in July 2012, vowing to do “whatever it takes” to save the
26:994:66852:14:23:90:356:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:EUR. All of the factors persistently decrease thereafter.
26:995:66909:23:14:90:522:406:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The peripheral factorw3t, associated with Italy, Ireland, and Spain, also exhibits substantial
26:996:67003:14:13:90:522:392:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variation prior to 2012 and, to a lesser degree, for the rest of the sample period.  The core
26:997:67096:13:14:90:521:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factorw2t,  which corresponds to Belgium and France,  starts to pick up shortly after the
26:998:67185:14:13:90:522:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:marked increase in the periphery factorw3t, but much earlier than the pronounced increase
26:999:67274:13:14:90:521:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the common factorw1t.  Interestingly,w1tpicks up again at the very end of the sample
26:1000:67361:14:38:90:123:338:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:period.

26:1002:67416:30:13:90:522:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Various combinations of these factors deliver risk-adjusted default intensities for the respec-

26:1004:67599:14:14:90:522:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variation  in  credit  factors  during  2012,  it  is  not  surprising  to  see  elevated  default  prob-
26:1005:67704:14:13:90:522:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:abilities  during  that  period,  irrespective  of  the  country.   The  largest  one-period  default
26:1006:67805:13:14:90:522:216:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probability is almost 2.5% (default probabilities are approximately equal to intensities for
26:1007:67897:14:13:90:522:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such small numbers).  Ireland, Italy, and Spain have clearly distinct patterns of intensities
26:1008:67990:13:14:90:522:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the post-2012 period, a manifestation of their exposure to the factorw3t.  The same three
26:1009:68082:14:13:90:522:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:countries exhibit some elevation at the end of 2016 – a result of their extensive exposure to
26:1010:68175:13:14:90:522:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the global factor, which also picks up.  Overall, Spain is the riskiest county.  Germany does
26:1011:68268:14:13:90:522:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not load on the regional components at all.  Hence, Germany has the lowest default risk,
26:1012:68356:13:14:90:522:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and its dynamic properties are distinct from those of other countries.  These differences in
26:1013:68448:14:13:90:522:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dynamics manifest themselves in the differences between the average quanto curves that we

27:1016:68606:33:14:90:522:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Table  4  summarizes  how  the  default  intensities  of  all  countries,  including  the  10  out-of-
27:1017:68708:14:13:90:522:644:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:samples ones, load on the factors.  The countries are sorted by their loadings on the global
27:1018:68800:13:14:90:521:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:credit factor,δ∗kw1.  Germany is roughly in the middle.  Spain has the largest exposure at
27:1019:68890:14:25:90:418:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:four times that of Germany, and Finland the smallest at 14−1times.
27:1020:68956:25:14:90:522:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Overall,  the  countries  exhibit  large  cross-sectional  variation  in  their  exposure  to  credit
27:1021:69057:14:13:90:522:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factors.  Among the core countries, Belgium and France have a sizable exposure to the core
27:1022:69147:13:14:90:522:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factor, while others have nearly zero exposure.  Finland appears to be the safest country
27:1023:69236:14:25:90:338:551:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with tiny exposures to both global and core factors.
27:1024:69288:25:14:90:522:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:On the peripheral side, the relatively recent additions to the Eurozone, such as Estonia and
27:1025:69380:14:13:90:522:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Slovakia, have a tiny exposure to region-specific risk, so they are largely indistinguishable
27:1026:69473:13:14:90:522:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from some core countries, including Germany itself.  The Southern European countries have
27:1027:69562:14:25:90:434:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a large regional component.  Spain and Greece stand out in this respect.
27:1028:69634:25:14:90:522:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Eurozone quanto spreads are driven by common variation in the exchange rate and mon-
27:1029:69718:14:14:90:522:446:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:etary policy.  Thus, cross-country differences in model-implied default intensities ought to
27:1030:69810:14:13:90:522:432:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be related to cross-country differences in fiscal health.  To test that conjecture, we collect
27:1031:69904:13:14:90:522:419:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information on quarterly debt-to-GDP and FX reserves-to-debt ratios and relate them to
27:1032:69990:14:13:90:522:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the model-implied hazard rates.  We source these data from the Bank for International Set-
27:1033:70080:13:14:90:522:392:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tlements and the International Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics database.
27:1034:70169:14:13:90:522:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The data span is from the start of our sample, that is, the third quarter of 2010, up to the
27:1035:70261:13:26:90:439:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:second quarter of 2015.  All data are measured in USD for comparability.
27:1036:70333:26:13:90:522:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  report  the  relation  between  these  fiscal  variables  and  model-implied  hazard  rates  in
27:1037:70432:13:14:90:522:326:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Table 5.  The relation between debt-to-GDP and hazard rates is positive and statistically
27:1038:70521:14:13:90:522:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant at the 1% level, with anR2of 13% for this univariate regression.  The coefficient
27:1039:70614:13:14:90:522:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of 0.20 implies that a one percentage point increase in a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio (+0.01)
27:1040:70707:14:14:90:522:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is on average associated with an 0.002 increase in intensity. This is economically meaningful.
27:1041:70801:14:13:90:522:271:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:If hazard rates are constant,  CDS premiums may be approximated byL·h∗t.  Given the
27:1042:70884:13:26:90:506:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimatedLof 41%, this implies an increase in CDS premiums of approximately 8 bps.
27:1043:70966:26:13:90:522:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For the specification in column (2), we add time fixed effects to further absorb any remaining
27:1044:71060:13:14:90:522:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:common variation in hazard rates.  Given the strong factor structure in CDS premiums in
27:1045:71147:14:13:90:522:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our model, this adjustment should absorb a significant amount of cross-sectional variation.
27:1046:71238:13:14:90:522:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:TheR2increases to 44%, and the regression coefficient is stable, suggesting a meaningful
27:1047:71326:14:13:90:522:178:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cross-sectional relation between the model-implied hazard rates and each country’s fiscal

27:1049:71422:26:13:90:522:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As an alternative measure of fiscal health, we use a country’s foreign exchange rate reserves
27:1050:71515:13:14:90:522:126:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to debt outstanding in columns (3) and (4).  The negative regression coefficient implies that
27:1051:71608:14:0:90:522:112:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:countries that have debt that is better collateralized by foreign exchange rate reserves have
28:1052:71703:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lower hazard rates.  The economic effect is smaller.  WithL= 0.41, the coefficient of−0.03
28:1053:71793:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implies a 1 bps lower CDS premium for each additional percentage point in FX reserves
28:1054:71878:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative to debt outstanding.  The coefficient is unaltered if we absorb additional common
28:1055:71968:13:26:90:329:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variation through time fixed effects in column (4).
28:1056:72019:26:13:90:522:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We examine the joint effect of both fiscal variables in columns (5) and (6).  Debt-to-GDP
28:1057:72108:13:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:appears to be the driving variable.  Its coefficient remains stable and significant at the 1%
28:1058:72201:14:40:90:114:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level.

28:1061:72326:14:13:90:522:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:do so for the overall credit risk.  Figure7B displays the aggregate true and risk-adjusted

28:1063:72508:14:13:90:522:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:default intensity is much smaller.  Visually, they track each other quite closely, suggesting
28:1064:72601:13:14:90:522:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a constant risk premium.  However, this is not the case.  To illustrate this, we characterize
28:1065:72694:14:13:90:522:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the corresponding risk premium, in line with the literature, viaλ∗t/λt,displayed in Figure
28:1066:72784:13:26:90:106:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:7C.

28:1084:74063:14:0:90:522:109:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leads  to  a  change  in  the  drift  of  the  depreciation  rate,  with  a  persistent  and  continuous
29:1085:74169:0:14:90:521:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation of the local currency.  Na, Schmitt-Groh ́e, Uribe, and Yue(2017), in contrast,
29:1086:74261:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:argue that the FX rate suffers a significant one-time drop upon default.  See our discussion
29:1087:74353:14:24:90:191:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:around Equation (8).

29:1089:74467:14:13:90:522:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate  implies  that  default  is  unlikely  to  have  a  long-term  effect  on  currencies.   Thus,  the
29:1090:74571:13:14:90:522:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimation results imply that changes in the FX rate are linked to credit risk only through
29:1091:74662:14:13:90:522:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:jumps.  The jump component is significant, implying an acute and short-term interaction

29:1094:74857:13:14:90:522:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:answer requires a more formal definition of devaluation.  We associate it with an extreme
29:1095:74946:14:13:90:522:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:movement in exchange rates, and rely on our model to measure the probability of such an
29:1096:75033:13:14:90:522:520:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:event.  Specifically, we define the EUR devaluation as a drop inStthat is larger than three
29:1097:75124:14:24:90:243:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditional standard deviations.
29:1098:75156:24:14:90:522:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The model implies that the true 1-week probability of devaluation conditional on default
29:1099:75244:14:13:90:522:468:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  4.64%.   The  risk-adjusted  probability  of  devaluation  conditional  on  default  is  76.60%,
29:1100:75344:13:14:90:522:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggesting a large risk premium for this event.  We will quantify this premium directly in
29:1101:75434:14:14:90:522:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the next section.  The true 1-year probability is 0.02%, which is smaller than the 1-week
29:1102:75523:14:13:90:522:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probability.  Thus, devaluation comes primarily through a sharp, short-term decline in the
29:1103:75613:13:14:90:522:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:EUR. This decline in probabilities with the horizon is consistent with a one-off impact of
29:1104:75703:14:13:90:522:400:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:default on the FX rate, as discussed above.  This number is also much smaller than those
29:1105:75791:13:14:90:522:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reported byNa, Schmitt-Groh ́e, Uribe, and Yue(2017) andReinhart(2002).  Part of this
29:1106:75876:14:13:90:522:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference may be explained by the sample (developed versus emerging economies), and by
29:1107:75963:13:14:90:522:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our primary use of market data, rather than realized defaults.  The corresponding 1-year
29:1108:76051:14:24:90:432:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk-adjusted probability of devaluation conditional on default is 0.85%.
29:1109:76124:24:14:90:522:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We also measure the sensitivity of the probability of devaluation to changes in the prob-
29:1110:76213:14:13:90:522:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ability of default, which we represent by the default intensity.  We can view the previous
29:1111:76303:13:14:90:522:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exercise  as  a  particular  case  in  which  the  default  intensity  is  equal  to  infinity.   Over  the
29:1112:76410:14:14:90:522:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1-week horizon, the true (risk-adjusted) devaluation probability increases by 0.04% (0.73%)
29:1113:76501:14:13:90:522:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for every 1% increase in the default intensity.  The small sensitivity of the true probability is
29:1114:76598:13:14:90:522:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a manifestation of the small jump size.  Thus, a large increase in the intensity is needed for
29:1115:76692:14:13:90:522:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the jump component to affect devaluation.  Figure7B shows that the largest movement in
29:1116:76778:13:14:90:522:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the true (risk-adjusted) default intensity was equal to 0.5% (6.7%), which occurred between
29:1117:76869:14:13:90:522:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:December 2011 and June 2012 during the Eurozone debt crisis.  This increase translates
29:1118:76955:13:14:90:522:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:into an increase of 0.02% (4.9%) in the true (risk-adjusted) probability of devaluation.  Over
29:1119:77049:14:13:90:522:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1 year, the devaluation sensitivities to default are 0% (under true probability) and 0.04%
29:1120:77139:13:14:90:522:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(risk-adjusted probability).  This decline is consistent with the aforementioned short-term
29:1121:77230:14:24:90:241:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect of default on devaluation.
29:1122:77263:24:14:90:522:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Overall, the probability of devaluation related to default is modest under the true proba-
29:1123:77353:14:13:90:522:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bility.  Yet, the risk-adjusted counterparts are rather high.  This suggests the occurrence of
29:1124:77447:13:0:90:522:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:currency devaluation during particularly bad states of the economy that tend to coincide
30:1125:77537:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a high marginal utility of the representative agent.  This interpretation is similar to the
30:1126:77633:14:14:90:521:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrium models ofAugustin and T ́edongap(2016) andChernov, Schmid, and Schneider
30:1127:77717:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2017), who characterize the large risk premia demanded by risk-sensitive investors for sell-
30:1128:77810:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing CDS protection on sovereigns in developed economies.  In the next section, we directly
30:1129:77900:14:39:90:447:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:measure the risk premiums associated with default-contingent devaluation.
30:1130:77973:39:31:90:173:597:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:C:Risk premiums
30:1131:77986:31:13:90:522:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We start with the case that ignores the timing of default, and compute both the risk-adjusted
30:1132:78079:13:14:90:522:553:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expectation of the depreciation rate,E∗t[ST/St], and its true counterpart,Et[ST/St].The
30:1133:78166:14:13:90:521:539:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:first row of Figure8 shows that the true expectations indicate expected EUR devaluation,
30:1134:78254:13:14:90:522:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the average term structure of such expectations is downward sloping (EUR is expected
30:1135:78342:14:13:90:522:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to devalue more at longer horizons).  The risk-adjusted expectation shows that the USD is
30:1136:78431:13:24:90:383:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expected to devalue, on average, at horizons of up to 3 years.
30:1137:78493:24:14:90:521:475:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To  understand  this  result,  consider  covered  interest  parity,  which  impliesE∗t[ST/St]  =
30:1138:78589:14:14:90:522:461:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:Ft,T/St=  exp[(T−t)(yt,T−̂yt,T)]  witĥyt,Tdenoting  the  EUR  benchmark  yield.   Thus,
30:1139:78677:14:13:90:522:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the expectation is positive wheneveryt,T>̂yt,T.The displayed relationship is thus pinned
30:1140:78765:13:24:90:416:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:down by the currency forward ratesFt,Tthat we used in estimation.
30:1141:78830:24:14:90:522:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:One   implication   is   that   we   observe   the   standard   currency   premium   relationship,
30:1142:78928:14:13:90:521:396:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:EtST/E∗tST,often expressed as the carry trade.  Borrowing in the high-interest rate USD,
30:1143:79016:13:14:90:522:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:converting to EUR, and then lending in this currency, leads, on average, to negative (log)
30:1144:79106:14:13:90:522:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:excess returns at short horizons.  At long horizons (log) excess returns are not significantly
30:1145:79200:13:14:90:522:356:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:different  from  zero,  consistent  with  the  evidence  inLustig,  Stathopoulos,  and  Verdelhan
30:1146:79297:14:24:90:123:342:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2016).
30:1147:79304:24:13:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The second row of Figure8 includes a condition on the timingτof any credit event rather
30:1148:79391:13:14:90:521:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than the one in a specific country.  In this case, the arrival rate is controlled byλt, and we
30:1149:79485:14:14:90:522:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can compute both the risk-adjusted expectation and its true counterpart.  Default risk has
30:1150:79575:14:13:90:522:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:almost no impact in the short-term, so the plot forT= 1 year is similar to that for the no-
30:1151:79666:13:14:90:521:264:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:default case (it is literally identical ifT= 1 week).  The level of risk-adjusted expectations
30:1152:79760:14:13:90:522:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:moves upwards with longer maturities in this case,  indicating the risk-adjusted expected
30:1153:79849:13:14:90:522:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:USD depreciation conditional on default.  This happens because early termination leads to
30:1154:79938:14:24:90:285:223:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a loss in the expected USD appreciation.
30:1155:79978:24:13:90:522:199:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In risk premium terms, we observe a drastic difference in relation to the no-default case.
30:1156:80068:13:14:90:522:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Carry returns to EUR are still negative in the short run, and continue to be so as the horizon
30:1157:80162:14:13:90:522:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expands.  That is a manifestation of the interaction with default risk.  No amount of interest
30:1158:80256:13:14:90:522:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:earned on a long-term debt instrument can compensate for currency losses experienced in
30:1159:80343:14:24:90:162:145:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:case of default.
30:1160:80359:24:13:90:522:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Indeed,   we  can  quantify  how  much  more  risk  premium  is  required  for  such  a  sce-
30:1161:80452:13:0:90:522:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nario.    Expressing  risk  premiums  in  logs,  (T−t)−1log[EtST/E∗tST]  (no  default)  and
31:1162:80545:0:14:90:521:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(T−t)−1log[EtSt∧T/E∗tSt∧T]  (default),  we  can  compute  the  difference  between  the  two.
31:1163:80638:14:14:89:521:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:It reflects the extra compensation one earns for the currency loss in case of default, com-
31:1164:80729:14:13:89:521:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pared  with  the  compensation  for  the  regular  currency  risk.   The  third  row  of  Figure8
31:1165:80826:13:26:90:473:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:displays these differences forT= 1 and 5 years, and the average term structure.
31:1166:80905:26:13:90:522:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:At short horizons this “excess risk premium” changes sign sporadically and stabilizes at zero
31:1167:80998:13:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after the sovereign debt crisis.  The average value is slightly positive and corresponds to a
31:1168:81091:14:13:90:522:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:negative extra premium for EUR depreciation. But, as can be seen from the third panel, that
31:1169:81182:13:14:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extra premium is not significantly different from zero.  The same average effects persist for
31:1170:81275:14:13:90:522:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:maturities of up to 4 years.2After that, the excess premium for EUR depreciation increases
31:1171:81365:13:14:90:522:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to 0.3% at the 15-year horizon and levels off at 0.5% per week at the 30-year horizon (not
31:1172:81455:14:13:90:522:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shown).  These numbers are large, and liquidity effects could be, in part, responsible for such
31:1173:81550:13:41:90:520:530:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a magnitude.  But even one half of these premiums would still be economically significant.
31:1174:81640:41:33:90:364:489:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:C:Expected devaluation and relative quanto spreads
31:1175:81688:33:13:90:521:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Several authors, such asDu and Schreger(2016) andMano(2013), use observed relative
31:1176:81770:13:14:89:521:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quanto  spreads,  in  the  context  of  EM,  to  measure  the  anticipated  currency  devaluation
31:1177:81867:14:13:89:521:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  case  of  a  credit  event.   As  we  show  in  Equation  (1),  the  relative  spread  consists  of
31:1178:81970:13:14:89:521:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two  components:  the  risk-adjusted  expected  depreciation  conditional  on  default  and  the
31:1179:82066:14:14:89:521:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interaction of default and FX jump.  The second term reflects the propensity of the EUR
31:1180:82153:14:25:89:328:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to depreciate when the default intensity increases.
31:1181:82204:25:14:89:521:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To facilitate the discussion, we switch to the ratio of the local and the foreign currency CDS

31:1200:82542:14:13:89:521:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:upon default,  is prone to be biased, as it may overstate the importance of the impact of
31:1201:82631:13:14:89:521:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sovereign  default  on  the  local  currency  depreciation.   Our  model  allows  us  to  gauge  the
31:1202:82731:14:13:89:521:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative importance of both terms, both across countries and over time.  We illustrate these
31:1203:82823:13:26:89:221:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decompositions in Figure9.
31:1204:82849:26:13:89:521:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As  a  start,  focus  on  the  last  column  that  depicts  the  time-averages  of  relative  quanto
31:1205:82949:13:14:89:521:190:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spreads across the term structure for the six countries that we use in the main estimation.
31:1206:83040:14:14:89:521:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The black-circled lines display the observed relative CDS spreads,Cet,T/C$t,T.  If one were
31:1207:83131:14:16:89:521:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to take the view that the spread reflects the risk-adjusted expectation of the depreciation
31:1208:83222:16:14:102:521:146:6:g_d0_f14:9:g_d0_f15:F:2At  first  blush,  this  result  appears  to  be  at  odds  with  the  large  differences  in  true  and  risk-adjusted
31:1209:83342:14:11:90:522:132:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:F:1-week probabilities of devaluation conditional on default that we reported in the previous section.  The risk
31:1210:83452:11:11:90:522:121:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:F:premiums reflect compensation for any adverse movement in EUR. In contrast, the probabilities reflect an
31:1211:83556:11:0:90:326:110:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:F:extreme event of at least a three-standard-deviation move.
32:1212:83616:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate only, then the Figure would tell us that, for 1-year contracts, the Euro is expected to
32:1213:83708:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depreciate on average by about 30% for Germany,  28% for France,  up to about 15% for
32:1214:83793:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Ireland.  For longer horizon contracts, the magnitude of the expected impact is increasing.
32:1215:83884:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For the 5-year maturity, for example, the expected drop in the local currency given default
32:1216:83975:14:25:90:291:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is as large as 44% in the case of Germany.
32:1217:84017:25:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The gray lines depict the model-implied default-contingent risk-adjusted expected depreci-

32:1219:84194:13:14:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expectation as the observed relative quanto spread is biased.  Generally, the model-based
32:1220:84283:14:13:89:521:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk-adjusted expectation is above the relative quanto spread implying a negativecov∗tterm
32:1221:84373:13:14:89:521:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the decomposition, on average.  This is intuitive as one would expect the event of default
32:1222:84466:14:13:89:521:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the value of the EUR to move in the opposite directions.  Quantitatively, the difference
32:1223:84558:13:14:89:521:530:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ranges  from  a  high  of  27%  for  Germany  to  a  low  of  10%  for  Ireland  at  short  horizons,
32:1224:84659:14:14:89:521:516:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and declines at longer horizons.  The decline suggests that market participants perceive the
32:1225:84751:14:25:89:416:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sensitivity of the FX rate to default risk to weaken in the long-term.
32:1226:84821:25:14:89:521:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The cross-country variation in thecov∗tterm suggests that the impact of a credit even in

32:1229:85105:14:13:89:522:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the first three columns of Figure9, convey more detail about this observation.  We focus
32:1230:85196:13:14:89:521:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the 5-year horizon in the second column.  The gap between the gray and black lines is
32:1231:85284:14:13:89:521:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increasing in the build-up of the European debt crisis in 2011 and 2012.  This suggests that
32:1232:85376:13:14:89:521:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the covariance risk became of greater importance during that period.  A sharp change of
32:1233:85463:14:13:89:521:382:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this pattern is visible in July 2012,  when the gap between the two plotted lines narrows
32:1234:85552:13:14:89:521:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significantly in particular for the peripheral countries (Ireland, Italy, and Spain), but not
32:1235:85645:14:14:89:521:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the core countries (Belgium, France, Germany).  This episode coincides with Draghi’s
32:1236:85733:14:25:89:360:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:speech, vowing to do whatever it takes to save the EUR.
32:1237:85788:25:14:89:521:316:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:One  interpretation  of  the  data  is  that  Draghi  was  to  some  extent  successful  in  changing
32:1238:85889:14:13:89:521:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  market’s  perception  about  the  interaction  of  FX  and  default  risks.   This  perception
32:1239:85988:13:14:89:521:289:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has nearly collapsed to zero for peripheral countries, but not so for core countries.  That
32:1240:86079:14:13:89:521:275:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference  highlights  the  systemic  role  of  the  core  countries  and  the  fear  of  the  impact
32:1241:86181:13:14:89:521:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of their defaults on the EUR currency,  irrespectively of how unlikely that event may be.
32:1242:86270:14:13:89:521:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Consequently, markets may still expect a sell-off of the EUR in the case of default.  Cross-
32:1243:86362:13:14:89:521:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:country  differences  over  time  consistently  suggest  that  Germany  is  expected  to  have  the
32:1244:86461:14:46:89:365:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:greatest impact on the exchange rate if it were to default.
32:1245:86520:46:37:89:190:175:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5    Conclusion
32:1246:86535:37:13:89:521:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Sovereign CDS quanto spreads offer a market perspective on the Twin Ds.  We study their
32:1247:86622:13:14:89:521:125:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interactions and the corresponding risk premiums from an asset pricing perspective.  To that
32:1248:86714:14:0:89:521:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:end, we propose an affine no-arbitrage model of the joint dynamics of the quanto spreads
33:1249:86804:0:14:90:522:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of 17 Eurozone countries and the USD/EUR exchange rate.  Controlling for exchange rate
33:1250:86890:14:14:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk,  credit  risk  has  a  parsimonious  three-factor  structure  (global,  core,  and  peripheral),
33:1251:86992:14:13:90:522:663:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:indicating a lot of common movement.  Cross-country differences in credit risk are related
33:1252:87082:13:14:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to a measure of debt, indicating the connection between cross-sectional variation in default
33:1253:87174:14:25:90:256:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:risk and variation in fiscal policies.
33:1254:87212:25:14:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  find  that  the  probability  of  devaluation  conditional  on  default  is  low.   But  the  risk
33:1255:87314:14:13:90:522:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:premium for this event is large, much larger than either the credit risk premium or the carry
33:1256:87407:13:14:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:trade return individually.  These results pinpoint the economic importance of the Twin Ds,
33:1257:87497:14:13:90:522:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as their occurrence coincides with the worst states of the economy when investors’ marginal
33:1258:87588:13:0:90:157:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:utility is high.

52:2126:111108:38:14:90:522:653:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:CDS contracts are controlled by three documents:  the Credit Derivatives Definitions
52:2127:111192:14:14:90:522:639:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:(“the Definitions”),  the ISDA Credit Derivatives Physical Settlement Matrix (“the
52:2128:111274:14:25:90:510:625:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Physical Settlement Matrix”), and the Confirmation Letter (“the Confirmation”).
52:2129:111353:25:14:90:522:600:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:The Physical Settlement Matrix is the most important document because the push for
52:2130:111435:14:14:90:522:586:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:standardization has created specific transaction types that are by convention applica-
52:2131:111521:14:14:90:522:572:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:ble to certain types of a sovereign reference entity, e.g., Standard Western European
52:2132:111606:14:14:90:522:558:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Sovereign  (SWES)  or  Standard  Emerging  European  Sovereign  (SEES)  single-name
52:2133:111689:14:14:90:522:544:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:contracts.  In total,  there are nine transaction types listed in the sovereign section
52:2134:111776:14:14:90:522:530:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:of the Physical Settlement Matrix that contain details about the main contractual
52:2135:111857:14:25:90:420:516:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:provisions for transactions in CDS referencing sovereign entities.
52:2136:111923:25:14:90:522:491:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Given the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of CDS contracts, parties are free to com-
52:2137:112005:14:14:90:522:477:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:bine features from different transaction types, which would be recognized in the Con-
52:2138:112090:14:14:90:522:463:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:firmation, i.e., the letter that designates the appropriate terms for a CDS contract.
52:2139:112175:14:14:90:522:449:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:The Confirmation,  which is mutually negotiated and drafted between two counter-
52:2140:112255:14:14:90:522:435:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:parties, can thereby amend legal clauses attributed to conventional contract charac-
52:2141:112339:14:14:90:522:421:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:teristics.   Hence,  there  may  be  slight  variations  from  standard  transaction  types  if
52:2142:112434:14:14:90:522:407:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:counterparties agree to alter the terms of conventional CDS contracts.  Such changes
52:2143:112518:14:14:90:522:393:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:introduce  legal  risk,  and  potentially  make  the  contracts  less  liquid,  given  the  cus-
52:2144:112614:14:25:90:337:379:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:tomization required for efficient central clearing.
52:2145:112665:25:14:90:522:354:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:The terms used in the documentation of most credit derivatives transactions are de-
52:2146:112748:14:14:90:522:340:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:fined in the Definitions.  On 22 September 2014,  ISDA introduced the 2014 Credit
52:2147:112829:14:14:90:522:326:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Derivatives Definitions, which update the 2003 Credit Derivatives Definitions.  We use
52:2148:112915:14:14:90:522:312:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:contracts governed by the 2003 Definitions to guarantee internal consistency through-
52:2149:113000:14:26:90:206:298:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:out our sample period.
52:2150:113022:26:14:90:522:272:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:It  is  important  to  distinguish  between  the  circumstances  under  which  a  CDS  pay-
52:2151:113113:14:13:90:522:258:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:out/credit  event  could  be  triggered,  and  the  restrictions  on  obligations  eligible  for
52:2152:113209:13:14:90:522:245:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:delivery in the settlement process upon the occurrence of a qualifying credit event.
52:2153:113293:14:14:90:522:231:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:The Physical Settlement matrix lays out the credit events that trigger CDS payment,
52:2154:113376:14:14:90:522:217:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:which follows the ruling by a determinations committee of the occurrence of a credit
52:2155:113460:14:14:90:522:203:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:event and a credit event auction.  SWES transaction types recognize three sovereign
52:2156:113543:14:14:90:522:189:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:credit events,  namely Failure to Pay,  Repudiation/Moratorium,  and Restructuring.
52:2157:113626:14:14:90:522:175:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:SEES contracts further list Obligation Acceleration as a valid event that could trigger
52:2158:113713:14:26:90:176:161:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:the CDS payout.
52:2159:113728:26:14:90:522:135:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:The most disputed among all credit events is the Restructuring credit event clause
52:2160:113810:14:13:90:522:121:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:related to a change to the reference obligation that is binding on all holders of the
52:2161:113895:13:0:90:522:108:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:obligation.  The most controversial among such changes is the redenomination of the
53:2162:113980:0:14:90:522:691:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:principal or interest payment into a new currency.  For the credit event to be triggered
53:2163:114068:14:14:90:522:677:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:under the 2014 Definitions, this new currency must be any currency other than the
53:2164:114149:14:14:90:522:663:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:lawful  currency  of  Canada,  Japan,  Switzerland,  the  United  Kingdom,  the  United
53:2165:114236:14:14:90:522:649:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:States of America, and the Euro (or any successor currency to any of the currencies
53:2166:114319:14:14:90:522:635:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:listed; in the case of the Euro, the new currency must replace the Euro in whole).  In
53:2167:114405:14:14:90:522:621:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:the 2003 Definitions, permitted currencies were defined as those of G7 countries and
53:2168:114489:14:26:90:244:607:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:AAA-rated OECD economies.
53:2169:114514:26:14:90:522:581:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Another important dimension to consider is the obligation category and the associated
53:2170:114599:14:14:90:522:567:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:obligation characteristics which may trigger a credit event.  For SWES contracts, the
53:2171:114684:14:14:90:522:553:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Obligation category is defined broadly as “borrowed money,” which includes deposits
53:2172:114767:14:14:90:522:539:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:and reimbursement obligations arising from a letter of credit or qualifying guarantees.
53:2173:114854:14:14:90:522:525:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Such contracts also feature no restrictions on the characteristics of obligations relevant
53:2174:114944:14:14:90:522:511:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:for the triggers of default payment. For SEESs, however, markets have agreed on more

53:2176:115114:14:14:90:522:483:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:allowed to be subordinated, denominated in domestic currency, issued domestically or
53:2177:115198:14:26:90:522:469:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:under domestic law, as indicated by the restrictions of the obligation characteristics.
53:2178:115285:26:13:90:522:443:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:The final non-trivial aspect relates to the deliverable obligation categories and the
53:2179:115370:13:14:90:522:430:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:associated characteristics.  While in the presence of Credit Events for SWESs, bonds
53:2180:115454:14:14:90:522:416:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:or loans are deliverable during the auction settlement process, SEES contracts allow
53:2181:115538:14:14:90:522:402:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:only for bonds to be delivered. Several restrictions apply to the deliverable obligations,
53:2182:115628:14:14:90:522:388:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:such that for SWESs they have to be denominated in a specified currency (i.e., the
53:2183:115710:14:14:90:522:374:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:Euro or the currencies of Canada,  Japan,  Switzerland,  the UK, or the USA), they
53:2184:115792:14:14:90:522:360:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:must be non-contingent, non-bearer and transferable, limited to a maximum maturity

53:2186:115956:14:14:90:522:332:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:exclude these restrictions on loans and the maximum deliverable maturity, but impose
53:2187:116040:14:14:90:522:318:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:the  additional  constraints  that  the  obligation  cannot  be  subordinated,  and  issued
