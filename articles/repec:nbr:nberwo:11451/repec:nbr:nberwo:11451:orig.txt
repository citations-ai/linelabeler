2:24:1007:53:28:72:539:571:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Micro level studies in developing countries suggest managerial skills play a key role in the adoption
2:25:1108:28:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of modern technologies. The human resources literature suggests that managerial skills are difficult
2:26:1208:28:27:72:540:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to codify and learn formally, but instead tend to be learned on the job. In this paper we present a
2:27:1307:27:28:72:540:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:model of the interactive process between on-the-job managerial skill acquisition and the adoption
2:28:1404:28:28:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  modern  technology.  The  environment  considered  is  one  where  all  learning  possibilities  are
2:29:1508:28:28:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:internalized  in  the  market,  and  where  managers  are  complementary  inputs  to  non-managerial
2:30:1608:28:28:72:539:404:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers. The paper illustrates why some countries may adopt modern technologies while others stay
2:31:1705:28:28:72:540:376:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:backwards. The paper also explains why managers may not want to migrate from rich countries to
2:32:1799:28:28:72:400:348:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:poor countries as would be needed to generate income convergence.

3:48:2158:0:31:72:201:701:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:1Introduction
3:49:2171:31:20:72:531:670:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:As reported in Easterly (2002), in 1979 Daewoo signed a collaborative agreement with Desh
3:50:2260:20:19:72:531:650:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Garment Ltd in Bangladesh. Daewoo agreed to bring 130 Bangladeshi workers to South Korea
3:51:2348:19:20:72:531:631:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:for training at a Daewoo plant in return for Desh paying commissions amounting to 8 percent
3:52:2439:20:20:72:531:611:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of future sales. At the time of the training there were a total of 40 workers producing garments
3:53:2535:20:20:72:530:591:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in Bangladesh, and Desh’sfirst year of operations produced $55,050 in sales on 43,000 shirts.
3:54:2628:20:20:72:531:571:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:By 1987 the industry’s output had grown to 2.3 million shirts.  During the 1980s, of the 130
3:55:2720:20:20:72:531:551:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Bangladeshi workers initially trained by Daewoo, 115 of them had left Desh to set up their own
3:56:2814:20:20:72:176:531:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:garment exportfirms.
3:57:2834:20:20:88:530:511:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:By working in the collaborative agreement with Desh, these workers had learned the man-
3:58:2921:20:20:72:530:491:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:agerial skills that were the necessary accompaniment to successfully implementing the superior
3:59:3015:20:20:72:531:471:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:South Korean technology. These workers transported the skills to their own companies and used
3:60:3108:20:20:72:531:451:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:them to implement the superior technology whose management they had learned on the job. In
3:61:3198:20:20:72:531:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the process, they too were part of the diffusion of the managerial know-how to their own workers,
3:62:3295:20:20:72:531:411:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:which in turn further facilitated spread of the technology. By 1985 there were over seven hun-
3:63:3389:20:19:72:531:391:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:dred Bangladeshi garment companies. While not knowing exactly how many start-ups were in
3:64:3477:19:20:72:530:372:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:turn spun-offfrom those founded by Desh workers, one must assume that it was large — by 1995
3:65:3569:20:20:72:449:352:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:Bangladesh was exporting $2 billion in garments (comprising 54% of exports).2
3:66:3646:20:20:88:530:332:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This process of on the job managerial skills acquisition may play a central role in under-
3:67:3736:20:20:71:531:312:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:standing both development successes and processes of technological diffusion. For example, Lall
3:68:3831:20:20:71:530:292:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(1999) describes the dramatic increases in the use of managers in the fast-growing East-Asian
3:69:3924:20:20:71:530:272:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:economies. She also describes the critical rolemanagers played in changing traditional human
3:70:4016:20:20:71:530:252:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:resource attitudes and policies towards the newer demands required in ‘mature’ economies. Ev-
3:71:4109:20:20:71:530:232:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:idence drawn from many LDCs also confirms that managerial skills are in short supply and
3:72:4197:20:20:71:530:212:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:represent a serious impediment to successful implementation of better technologies. Fafchamps
3:73:4290:20:20:71:530:192:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and Soderbom (2004), using matched employer-employee data for ten African countries, argue
3:74:4380:20:20:71:530:172:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that labor management deficiencies play a key role in explaining thefirm size wage correlation
3:75:4474:20:16:71:173:152:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and low productivity.
3:76:4495:16:14:84:530:136:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:2Thefirst detailed case study of Desh was undertaken by Rhee and Belot (1990).  Examples of technology
3:77:4597:14:11:71:530:122:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:diffusion via skilled worker and managerial mobility are commonplace in modern economies. Two examples from
3:78:4704:11:11:71:530:111:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:advanced sectors are Saxenian (1994), who documents diffusion in Silicon Valley’s IT clusters, and Feldman’s (2001)
3:79:4819:11:0:71:470:100:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:study offirm formation in biotechnology and communications industries in Capitol region clusters.
4:80:4917:0:20:88:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Rhee and Belot (1990), in addition to providing an early analysis of Bangladesh’s garments
4:81:5007:20:20:71:530:683:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:industry explosion, have documented the importance of managerial and technical skill transfer in
4:82:5103:20:20:71:530:663:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a number of successful case studies drawn from the developing world. An interesting case is the
4:83:5198:20:20:71:530:643:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:meteoric rise in Indonesian plywood exports through the early 80’s that started with two initial
4:84:5294:20:20:71:531:623:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f4:firms — Korindo and Kodeco. The take-offpoint was again inter-firm joint ventures — in the case
4:85:5389:20:20:71:530:603:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of Korindo with a Korean lumber exporter, and for Kodeco with one from Taiwan. Part of the
4:86:5479:20:20:71:530:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:knowledge transfer involved the direct relocation of managers from Korea and Taiwan, as real
4:87:5571:20:20:71:530:563:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:wage increases there had reduced their advantages in labor intensive plywood production. The
4:88:5663:20:20:71:531:543:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:on-the-job training diffusion process in turn lead to managerial transfer beyond the initialfirms.
4:89:5761:20:19:71:530:523:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In less than a decade Indonesia moved from being an importer of plywood lumber to accounting
4:90:5853:19:20:71:374:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:for almost 70% of the world’s export share — $2 Billion in 1976.
4:91:5917:20:20:88:531:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A similar process occurred in the case of Colombianflower exporting.  A single company,
4:92:6004:20:20:71:531:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Floramerica, undertook a study to determine the feasibility of exportingflowers to the US in 1969.
4:93:6102:20:20:71:531:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Prior to that time there were no commercialflower enterprises in the country. Within a year it had
4:94:6200:20:20:71:531:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:150 employees, and high rates of growth continued. The $100,000 initial investment grew into a
4:95:6294:20:20:71:530:404:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:company with $50 million in annual sales by 1986. In addition to Floramerica’s dramatic growth,
4:96:6389:20:20:71:531:384:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:theflower producing and marketing know-how diffused to others in the Colombian economy.
4:97:6476:20:20:71:530:364:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In less than two decades,flowers became Colombia’sfifth largest export, and in the early 90’s
4:98:6569:20:20:71:530:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Colombia was second only to the Netherlands in supplying cut-flowers to the world market. At
4:99:6661:20:20:71:531:324:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the period of study,flower production for export directly employed 70,000 people in Colombia,
4:100:6754:20:20:71:206:304:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Rhee and Belot (1990, p31).
4:101:6781:20:20:88:530:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The means by which the relevant skills are acquired in these examples — on the job — is
4:102:6868:20:19:71:530:264:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:consistent with evidence from the human resources literature.  The skills most important for
4:103:6960:19:20:71:530:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managing seem difficult to codify and learn through formal institutions. The management litera-
4:104:7055:20:20:71:530:225:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ture has found that most managerial learning takes place informally in the workplace — see Enos,
4:105:7151:20:20:71:530:205:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Kehrhahn, and Bell (2003) for a recent study, and the survey therein. For example, McCall, Lom-
4:106:7246:20:20:71:530:185:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:bardo, and Morrison (1988) found that 30 of 35 managerial job skills were learned informally, with
4:107:7344:20:20:71:531:165:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:relatively little gained from formal training procedures. The development of proficiency in a skill
4:108:7443:20:20:71:530:145:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:seems to depend critically on experience gained through informal learning, and from observing
4:109:7536:20:20:71:230:125:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:actual workplace leaders at work.
4:110:7569:20:0:88:530:105:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In light of these examples, several questions emerge. For example, how best should one model
5:111:7662:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a process which involves on-the-job learning asa precursor to entrepreneurial activity and new
5:112:7756:19:20:72:531:684:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f4:firm start-ups?  How does such a process of technological diffusion (where individuals having
5:113:7849:20:20:72:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:experienced the new technology become entrepreneurs orfirm managers) compare to alternate
5:114:7938:20:20:72:531:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:processes of diffusion which do not emphasize an initial step of on-the-job learning? How can the
5:115:8035:20:20:72:531:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:fragility of these examples — whereby a very small number of initially trained individuals appears

5:117:8226:20:20:72:531:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:imperfection? To what extent may such a process of skill acquisition and technology diffusion be
5:118:8322:20:20:72:379:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:an important component on the path to economic development?
5:119:8381:20:20:88:530:544:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In this paper we present a model of the interactive process between managerial skill acquisition
5:120:8477:20:20:72:531:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and the adoption of new technology. The objective of the paper is to examine whether the process
5:121:8573:20:20:72:531:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of managerial skill acquisition may be relevant for understanding certain difficulties, or barriers,
5:122:8673:20:20:72:531:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to economic development. We want to use the model to help isolate factors that may explain why
5:123:8767:20:20:72:531:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:certain countries may adopt a new technology, while others would stay backwards. There are
5:124:8857:20:20:72:531:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:two important aspects to our modelling strategy. First, we model the acquisition of (technology
5:125:8952:20:19:72:531:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:specific) managerial skill as resulting from on-the-job interaction with knowledgeable managers.
5:126:9048:19:20:71:531:405:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In particular, as an individual works in afirm and interacts with competent managers, he can
5:127:9140:20:20:71:530:385:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:gain the skills of a manager and potentially open his ownfirm. However, in contrast to much
5:128:9231:20:20:71:530:365:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of the literature on learning-by-doing, the skills obtained as a manager are not assumed to be a
5:129:9327:20:20:71:530:345:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:substitute to his previous skills, but instead aremodelled as a complement to such previous skills.
5:130:9426:20:20:71:530:325:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:That is, managerial skill is not modelled as being about getting better at what one previously did,
5:131:9525:20:20:71:530:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:but instead is modelled as learning how to organize non-managerial workers and thereby increase
5:132:9620:20:20:71:530:285:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:their productivity. As we shall show, this difference in the modelling of the learning-by-doing
5:133:9715:20:20:71:530:265:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:process has strong implications for the dynamics of managerial skill premia. Second, we assume
5:134:9809:20:20:71:530:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that all the learning activities are internalized by the market in the sense that that workers can
5:135:9907:20:20:71:531:225:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:accept lower wages to be hired infirms where they are likely to obtain managerial skills (as in
5:136:10002:20:20:71:531:205:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Becker (1975)). Hence, in our set up, there will be no market imperfections. This assumption is
5:137:10097:20:20:71:530:185:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:not chosen for its realism, but has been chosen toallow us to isolate implications of the process
5:138:10194:20:19:71:531:165:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of managerial skill acquisition that are independent of implications of market imperfections. As a
5:139:10292:19:20:71:530:146:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:result of this assumption, the market will generate a hedonic type equilibrium, where jobs bundle
5:140:10389:20:16:71:354:126:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:both wage payments and managerial learning possibilities.3
5:141:10447:16:15:84:534:110:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:3In ongoing work, we are exploring how the results here are modified and amplifiedinthepresenceofmarket
5:142:10550:15:0:72:400:95:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:imperfections such as in the presence of credit constraints, or thin market effects.
6:143:10635:0:19:88:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Our analysis of managerial skill acquisition gives rise to two main insights. On the one hand,
6:144:10729:19:20:71:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:we show that this process of acquisition shares manysimilarities with the process of technological
6:145:10827:20:20:71:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:innovation emphasized in the endogenous growthliterature, even though our environment is
6:146:10915:20:20:71:531:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:characterized by the absence of any market imperfections or non-convexities, and that different
6:147:11010:20:20:71:531:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technologies are freely available. For example,in our model, agents will purposely accumulate
6:148:11103:20:20:71:530:604:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managerial skill knowing full well that the returns to these skills will dissipate over time, and
6:149:11200:20:20:71:530:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:possibly go to zero. The reason why the price of managerial skill drops as the new technology
6:150:11293:20:20:71:530:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:is adopted is because knowledgeable managers are becoming more abundant.  Moreover, the
6:151:11380:20:20:71:530:544:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managerial wage premia may go to zero due to the fact that the learning process may continue
6:152:11472:20:20:71:530:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:even if skills are abundant. Hence, in such a case, the incentive to invest in managerial skill will
6:153:11572:20:20:71:530:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:be entirely driven by expected temporary rewards, which is akin to the incentive to innovate in
6:154:11667:20:20:71:531:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:aR&Dmodelwithfinite lived patents. As we discuss below, this has important implications for
6:155:11758:20:20:71:207:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:growth accounting exercises.
6:156:11786:20:20:88:530:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The second interestingfinding of the analysis is that the incentive for managers to migrate from
6:157:11882:20:19:71:530:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a more developed country (where managerial knowledge is more abundant) to a less developed
6:158:11972:19:20:71:530:405:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:country (where it is less abundant) is shown to be very weak and possibly non-existent. This
6:159:12064:20:20:71:530:385:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:observation has the potential to help understand the persistence of under-development since,
6:160:12156:20:20:71:530:365:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:contrary to most neo-classical models, it does not predict that the scarce factor will want to
6:161:12250:20:20:71:530:345:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:migrate from richer to poorer countries. The reason being that the wages of managers can be
6:162:12341:20:20:71:530:325:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:higher in the country where managers are more abundant, due to their teaching value, even
6:163:12430:20:20:71:395:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:though technological opportunities satisfy constant returns to scale.
6:164:12499:20:20:88:530:285:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:At afirst pass, it may appear that the literature on the sources of cross-country income
6:165:12587:20:20:71:531:265:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:differences (for example, Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 1997) rules out the type of managerial
6:166:12678:20:20:71:531:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:knowledge studied here as an important element indevelopment. In particular, this literature
6:167:12770:20:20:71:530:225:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f4:finds that differences across countries in the amount of human capital obtained on-the-job are
6:168:12864:20:20:71:530:205:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a very minor element in explaining cross-country differences in income. In this literature, the
6:169:12959:20:20:71:531:185:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:value of skills obtained on the job are proxied by the returns to experience, and these to do
6:170:13052:20:19:71:531:165:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:not seem to vary sufficiently across countries to be able to explain a large part of cross country
6:171:13150:19:20:71:530:146:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:variation in income. Since managerial skills should be a subset of on-the-job (experience driven)
6:172:13247:20:20:71:531:126:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:human capital, this a fortiori appears to rule out managerial skills (and the institutions that favor
6:173:13348:20:0:71:531:106:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managerial skill) as an important element driving cross-country differences in income. However,
7:174:13444:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:as we shall show, this reasoning isflawed in the case of managerial skills.  In particular, we
7:175:13538:19:20:72:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:will show why an arbitrarily large difference in income could be due to differences in available
7:176:13634:20:20:72:530:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managerial skill across countries with the same access to technology, while standard methods used
7:177:13731:20:20:72:531:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:for accounting for cross-country income differences would attribute all the difference to measured
7:178:13829:20:20:71:531:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:total factor productivity; thereby suggesting that the differences are due to different availability
7:179:13929:20:20:71:153:604:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:of technologies.4
7:180:13946:20:20:88:530:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This paper relates to both the literature on learning-by-doing and the literature on technology
7:181:14041:20:20:71:531:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:diffusion.  In particular, it relates to the learning by doing literature since managerial skills
7:182:14138:20:20:71:531:544:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:are assumed to be acquired on the job.5However, as mentioned above, the key differences
7:183:14225:20:20:71:530:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:between our paper and most of the learning-by-doing literature are that we do not model learning
7:184:14321:20:20:71:530:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:as inducing higher productivity in the same task, but instead model the learning process as
7:185:14412:20:20:71:531:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:allowing one to obtain skills that are used to organize non-managerial workers efficiently in a
7:186:14507:20:20:71:531:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:new technology.  Moreover, we emphasize the role of interaction with competent managers as
7:187:14597:20:20:71:530:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:central to the learning process, which may therefore be more appropriately called learning-while-
7:188:14694:20:19:71:531:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:doing instead of learning-by-doing. In relation to the literature on technological diffusion, the
7:189:14791:19:20:71:530:405:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:paper closest in spirit is that of Chari and Hopenhayn (1991). Their study analyzed rates of
7:190:14883:20:20:71:531:385:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technology diffusion in a model with continuous technology upgrading and vintage specificity of
7:191:14978:20:20:71:530:365:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skills in production. In a 2-period lived overlapping generations economy where the set of possible
7:192:15077:20:20:71:530:345:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technologies expands each period, they demonstrate the existence of a stationary distribution of
7:193:15173:20:20:71:531:325:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technologies in use (with constantly increasingaverage productivity) and constantly increasing
7:194:15267:20:20:71:530:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:wages.  Their analysis focused explicitly on stationary, or limiting distributions, of the set of
7:195:15364:20:20:71:530:285:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technologies in use. Instead, we characterize the dynamics of the process by which an economy
7:196:15457:20:20:71:530:265:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:transitions from the use of a technology where managerial skills are either not needed or already
7:197:15554:20:20:71:530:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:abundant, to a newer technology with higher productivity, where managerial skills are vital. Our
7:198:15650:20:16:71:530:225:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:analysis allows us to focus upon conditions which would lead a country to adopt (or not) a new
7:199:15744:16:15:84:530:209:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:4Growth theories that emphasize non-rivalrous technology (such as Arrow (1962a), Shell (1966), Grossman and
7:200:15851:15:11:72:531:194:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:Helpman (1991) and Aghion and Howitt(1992)) need to explain why such technologies do not diffuse rapidly to poor
7:201:15963:11:11:72:531:183:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:countries. There are many proposed explanation to this puzzle. For example, one such explanation is the presence
7:202:16075:11:11:72:531:172:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:of “barriers to adoption”, such as legal, institutional, socio-cultural or political factors, see Parente and Prescott
7:203:16193:11:11:72:531:161:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:(2002). Another class of explanations emphasizes difficulties in absorption of new technologies. These could be
7:204:16304:11:11:72:531:150:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:due to differences in skill levels, Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) which may interact with withinfirm contracting
7:205:16416:11:11:71:530:139:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:imperfections — Aghion, Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2004). This paper offers an alternative explanation based on the
7:206:16528:11:7:71:452:128:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:process of accumulation and diffusion of the managerial skills needed to use a new technology.
7:207:16622:7:15:84:531:121:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:5Important contributions to the learning-by-doing literature include Arrow (1962), Lucas (1993) , Stokey (1988)
7:208:16733:15:11:72:534:106:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:and Young (1991).  A survey of the large literature on human capital and technology diffusionisprovidedby

8:211:16943:19:20:88:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets upa model examining managerial skills acquisi-
8:212:17035:20:20:72:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:tion in a competitive economy. The steady state and transitional dynamics of such a process are
8:213:17130:20:20:72:531:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:explored, and it is shown that the on-the-job skills framework can account for arbitrarily large
8:214:17226:20:20:72:531:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:differences in income per capita across countries. Section 3 examines the consequences of this
8:215:17320:20:20:72:531:604:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:process for growth accounting. It is shown that these fully internalized on-the-job skills need not
8:216:17419:20:20:72:531:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:be detectable in cross-country growth accounting exercises, and if showing up at all, are extremely
8:217:17518:20:20:72:530:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:unlikely to reflect their true value. Thus our model is completely consistent with observed re-
8:218:17613:20:20:72:531:544:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:turns to experience varying little across countries. Section 4 explores the model’s implications
8:219:17709:20:20:72:531:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:for migration. In particular, this section shows why unskilled labor that moves from poor to rich
8:220:17806:20:20:72:531:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:countries may reap high returns, whereas similar incentives may not exist for the movement of
8:221:17899:20:34:72:319:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skilled labor to poor countries. Section 5 concludes.

8:240:18611:20:20:71:530:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and modern. In the modern production process there are two types of positions: management
8:241:18700:20:20:71:536:158:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:positions and unskilled worker position. The measure of skilled managers is denotedS,while
8:242:18790:20:20:72:531:138:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the measure of inskilled workers is denotedU. In the traditional technology, there is only one
8:243:18884:20:20:71:530:118:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:type of position which we call laborers and denote byL. In order to be a manager, an individual
8:244:18979:20:0:71:530:98:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:must possess managerial skill. In contrast, anyone can be hired as an unskilled worker in the
9:245:19073:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:modern technology or as a laborer in the traditional technology. The process of managerial skill

9:274:19698:20:20:71:530:391:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:being placed in positions requiring organizational skills, i.e., management, but when all such
9:275:19792:20:20:71:531:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:positions are occupied, extra workers with such skills are more usefully allocated to positions

9:299:20750:12:15:84:531:124:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:7In the Cobb-Douglas case, this arises whenM>M0whereM0=αα(1−α)1−α.In the traditional technology,
9:300:20846:15:11:72:531:109:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:we do not make a distinction between managers and unskilled workers.  This scenario can be interpreted as a

9:303:21030:7:11:395:531:98:82:g_d0_f18:82:g_d0_f4:,so that the distinction between
9:304:21062:11:0:72:300:87:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:managers and unskilled in this technology is immaterial.

10:306:21198:20:20:72:530:682:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:concave. The homogeneity of degree zero implies that the speed of learning in afirm depends
10:307:21289:20:20:72:530:662:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:only on the ratio of managers to workers. We will also employ the notationeΩ(S,U)to denote
10:308:21379:20:17:72:530:642:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the functionΩ(S,U)Uwhich is the instantaneous output of the skill production process.Clearly
10:309:21471:17:23:72:335:625:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f4:eΩ(S,U)is homogenous of degree one and also concave.

10:313:21791:19:30:71:439:543:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:remains skilled throughout their life - i.e., individual skills do not depreciate.
10:314:21873:30:27:72:285:513:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:2.1  The Decentralized Equilibrium
10:315:21907:27:20:72:531:486:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In the above setup, managerial skills acquisition is a by-product of production. However, this
10:316:22001:20:20:72:531:466:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:does not imply that there are externalities in this process since skills acquisition is excludable.
10:317:22100:20:19:72:531:446:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Individuals who do not work under skilled managers in the modern technology cannot acquire
10:318:22190:19:20:72:531:427:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managerial skills. This teaching aspect of managers allowsfirms with a high ratio of managers
10:319:22283:20:20:72:531:407:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to offer a low wage to unskilled workers knowing that the offer may still be attractive since an
10:320:22379:20:20:72:533:387:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:unskilled worker can learn managerial skills more quickly in such afirm.Insuchanenvironment,
10:321:22471:20:20:72:531:367:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:profit maximizingfirms will make employment decisions taking into account that their ratio of
10:322:22564:20:20:72:531:347:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managers to unskilled workers affects the unskilled wage it can offer. Hence, an employment offer
10:323:22661:20:20:72:530:327:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to an unskilled individual is actually a bundle that specifies a wage,wutand a (firm specific) speed
10:324:22761:20:20:71:531:307:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of learningΩt. Among bundles ofwuandΩ, an unskilled worker will accordingly choose the one
10:325:22851:20:20:71:531:287:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that maximizes his utility. Our objective will be to characterize the situation where bothfirms
10:326:22946:20:20:71:531:267:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and workers take the market tradeoffbetweenwuandΩas given when making their decisions,
10:327:23032:20:20:72:531:247:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:with the equilibrium requirement that demand equals supply at each chosen pair ofwuandΩ.
10:328:23120:20:20:71:530:227:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This type of competitive equilibrium is known as a hedonic competitiveequilibrium (see Rosen
10:329:23212:20:20:71:530:207:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(1974)). In our case, we want to analyze a dynamic hedonic equilibrium where there is a sequence
10:330:23308:20:19:71:530:187:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of tradeoffs betweenwuandΩ, one at each moment in time. For further reference, it will be
10:331:23397:19:17:71:514:168:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:useful to denote the market tradeoffbetweenwuandΩat timetby the functionG(·),with
10:332:23478:17:15:84:531:151:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:8An alternative assumption regarding managerial skills acquisition is that an unskilled individual’s learning rate
10:333:23592:15:11:72:531:136:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:is increasing in the number of "active" managers in thefirm, not the number of managers,S.This distinction arises
10:334:23705:11:11:72:531:125:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:because it will be seen that, in some configurations,firms do not employ all potential managers in managerial
10:335:23814:11:11:72:531:114:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:positions. However all of the paper’s results are preserved under this alternative formulation, so that we proceed
10:336:23928:11:0:72:296:103:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:with the slightly simpler formulation stated in the text.

11:338:24004:25:20:88:530:666:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A competitive hedonic equilibrium will therefore need to specify a sequence of managerial

11:362:25468:27:20:72:531:107:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Since consumers are risk neutral, it is easiest to analyze the household’s labor allocation problem

12:364:25665:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:determining optimal individual decisions within each cohort and then aggregating them up, the
12:365:25758:19:20:72:530:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:assumption of risk neutrality allows us tofirst aggregate the individual into the cohort and then
12:366:25855:20:20:71:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:derive the optimal decisions for the cohort. Thisequivalence is rather well known, so we omit the
12:367:25952:20:20:71:530:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:proof. The relevant cohort is still small, so they act as price takers in their allocation decisions
12:368:26052:20:20:71:530:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and the problem is best stated as one where members pool income so that each member has equal
12:369:26145:20:20:71:531:604:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:consumption.9The problem then amounts to allocating skilled and unskilled workers between
12:370:26234:20:20:71:530:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:production in both the traditional and modern technology at each instant in order to maximize
12:371:26327:20:20:71:530:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:per capita consumption. Cohortqtakes as given its stock of individuals with managerial skill at

12:373:26514:20:20:72:530:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:possible for these individuals to remain in the old technology receivingw, since this is never part
12:374:26613:20:20:71:510:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of an optimal program for the skilled, to save on notation, we do not denote this possibility.
12:375:26707:20:20:88:530:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The cohort’s unskilled workers can work in the new technology (where they probabilistically

19:607:34557:19:20:88:531:132:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:We analyze each configuration represented in Figures 6-9 seperately. Figure 6 depicts the
19:608:34646:20:20:71:531:112:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:phase diagram and transitional dynamics of the steady state corresponding to the situation where
19:609:34742:20:0:71:531:92:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:neither locus crossesλβ=1. Here the unique steady state of the system is the point A where tra-
20:610:34839:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ditional production stops entirely. An economy starting without skills in the modern technology
20:611:34934:19:20:72:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:will eventually develop a positive steady state skill level, and full modern production. In the
20:612:35029:20:20:72:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:example depicted in Figure 6, the unique steady state is characterized by a positive managerial
20:613:35124:20:20:72:531:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skill premium (since the steady state value ofλis positive). This is due to the fact that the
20:614:35217:20:0:72:226:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f8:vertical ̇SlineistotheleftofS

20:616:35247:7:20:229:531:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:. If instead the ̇S=0line were to the right ofS0, there would
20:617:35308:20:17:72:531:604:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:be no managerial skill premium in the steady state. This case is depicted by the dotted line for
20:618:35404:17:23:75:531:587:121:g_d0_f27:121:g_d0_f4: ̇S=0in thefigure, and it intersects with the ̇λ=0line at a point whereλis equal to zero. In
20:619:35496:23:20:72:531:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:this case managerial skills are accumulated to the point of abundance, with the returns to the
20:620:35590:20:20:72:530:544:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skill being fully dissipated in the resulting steadystate. Note that such dissipation of the returns
20:621:35690:20:20:72:531:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to knowledge arises even though there are no market imperfections, which contrasts with most
20:622:35782:20:36:72:463:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:models of knowledge creation and dissipation which rely on market imperfections.

20:632:35996:20:20:71:530:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:theλβ=1line. Here again, there is a unique steady state and it is reached independently of the
20:633:36090:20:20:71:530:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:economy’s starting position. Now, however, the economy’s steady state sees it remain fully mired
20:634:36186:20:19:71:531:107:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in the traditional technology. Though there is a positive managerial skill premium in the steady
20:635:36282:19:0:71:531:88:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:state (λ>0), no one has incentive to accumulate skills in the modern technology. An economy
21:636:36375:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:inheriting a positive skill level will see it eventually approach zero along the transition path since
21:637:36477:19:20:72:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the endogenous creation of new managers does not offset the exogenous cohort turnover rate. In
21:638:36571:20:20:71:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:such an economy, skill premia in the modern technology will be steadily rising as it approaches
21:639:36666:20:20:71:530:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the steady state. The economy is unable to sustain modern production becauseδis too high to
21:640:36757:20:20:71:530:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maintain a stock of skilled individuals from whom the unskilled can learn. Any such stock that is
21:641:36854:20:20:71:530:604:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:exogenously created, say through an explicit government training program, or through migration
21:642:36948:20:36:71:490:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:from abroad, will eventually be depleted causing the collapse of the modern technology.

21:653:37175:20:20:72:531:227:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:unique steady state of the system is at the point A where all individuals work in the modern
21:654:37267:20:20:72:531:207:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technology, and there remains a positive skillpremium.  Transitional dynamics are similar to
21:655:37359:20:20:72:531:187:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:those in Figure 6.Even an economy inheriting zero skills will eventually converge on a steady
21:656:37452:20:20:72:531:167:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:state with fully modernized production. This is also an economy with relatively highδas indicated
21:657:37549:20:20:72:531:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:by the location of thedSdt=0locus, however a distinction from the situation in Figure 7 would
21:658:37642:20:20:72:530:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:arise from the economy below having a lower value ofρ.Ifρis sufficiently low, as depicted below,

21:660:37825:19:0:72:531:88:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:regionβ=1.Intuitively, this is a case where the future is valued highly enough to favor sufficient
22:661:37925:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:investment in managerial skill acquisition to offset the relatively high depletion of skills. This
22:662:38023:19:20:72:530:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ensures a steady state where all unskilled workers are profitably placed into the new technology,
22:663:38120:20:37:72:324:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and a sufficiently large stock of skilled is maintained.

22:672:38213:40:20:88:531:327:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Finally, Figure 9 depicts the situation that occurs when only the ̇λ=0locus intersects the
22:673:38303:20:20:71:531:307:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f7:λβ=1line, or where if the ̇S=0locus also intersects it does so at a value ofSto the right of the

22:675:38495:20:20:71:530:267:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A, where skills are accumulated and the economy is fully modern, there exists an unstable steady
22:676:38591:20:20:71:530:247:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:state atS=0,the point labelled B. An economy starting at B would remain in the traditional
22:677:38681:20:20:71:530:227:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technology, but the introduction of an arbitrarily small number of skilled managers would lead
22:678:38775:20:20:71:530:207:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to production with the modern technology. Because management skills are accumulated through
22:679:38866:20:20:71:530:187:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:production, the number of managers would increase, and so too would modern production, until
22:680:38958:20:20:71:530:167:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:eventually all production is modern, and the point A is reached. Note that in thisfigure there is
22:681:39055:20:20:71:530:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a qualitatively different case depicted for the dashed ̇S=0line denoted ̇S=0(2).This occurs
22:682:39146:20:20:71:531:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:when the ̇S=0locusdoesnotintersecttheλβ=1line. Here the horizontal arm of the ̇S=0line
22:683:39232:20:19:72:531:107:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:does not exist, but a similar steady state to A, denoted C, would also ensue. In this later case,

23:697:39490:40:20:88:530:357:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In situations depicted in Figures 6 and 8 the economy converges to steady states which may or
23:698:39583:20:20:71:530:337:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:may not have skill premia but in which the traditional technology is completely shut down. Skills
23:699:39680:20:20:71:530:317:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:may or may not be in full abundance. For the situation in Figure 7, conversely, the traditional
23:700:39775:20:20:71:530:297:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technology remains in full use and no skills are accumulated, even though there is a positive
23:701:39868:20:20:71:530:277:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:premium associated with being skilled. Recall that this outcome (persistence of traditional pro-
23:702:39964:20:20:71:531:257:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:duction) occurs only if the ̇λ=0locus intersects theλβ=1locus. Finally, the situation in Figure
23:703:40059:20:20:71:531:237:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:9 implies hysteresis. Economies without skillwill not develop the modern technology, but even
23:704:40152:20:20:71:531:217:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:small amounts of skill will eventually lead to full diffusion. Such an economy would experience
23:705:40247:20:20:71:525:197:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rapid growth in light of even a small initiative that was able to introduce some skilled workers.
23:706:40344:20:20:88:530:177:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The ensuing situation for any particular economy depends critically on the relative locations
23:707:40437:20:19:71:530:157:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of the loci sketched above. Since these are determined by the values of exogenous parameters,
23:708:40530:19:20:71:530:138:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f4:δandρ,we can characterize the mapping between the values ofδandρand the equilibrium
23:709:40613:20:0:71:423:118:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:configurations. This is done in Proposition 1 and illustrated in Figure 10.
24:710:40690:0:19:88:536:703:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f7:Proposition 1:For a given productivity level in the modern technology,F,andagiven

24:712:40847:20:20:88:531:664:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:(a) For low values ofρandδ, called region A, the economy converges to a unique steady state
24:713:40938:20:20:72:343:644:121:g_d0_f7:65:g_d0_f4:with all production occurring in the modern technology.12
24:714:40995:20:20:88:531:624:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:b) For high values ofρandδ, called region B, the economy converges to a unique steady state
24:715:41086:20:20:71:358:604:121:g_d0_f7:65:g_d0_f4:with all production occurring inthe traditional technology.13
24:716:41147:20:20:88:535:584:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:c) For intermediate values ofρandδ, called region C, if the economy starts withS=0,it
24:717:41232:20:20:71:531:564:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:remains there with all production occurring in thetraditional technology. If however the economy
24:718:41328:20:20:71:531:544:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:starts withS>0, it converges to a steady state with allproduction occurring in the modern
24:719:41417:20:20:72:124:524:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:technology.
24:720:41428:20:20:88:530:504:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:Furthermore, there exists aδ∗,suchthatifδ<δ∗, then there is no managerial skill premium
24:721:41515:20:20:72:429:484:121:g_d0_f7:65:g_d0_f4:in a steady state where all production occurs with the modern technology.14
24:722:41590:20:20:88:530:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Figure 10 summarizes this proposition’s implications for possible steady state outcomes. Note
24:723:41683:20:19:71:530:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that Region A corresponds to the dynamics illustrated in Figures 6 and 8. Region B corresponds
24:724:41777:19:20:71:521:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to the dynamics illustrated in Figure 7 and region C corresponds to the dynamics of Figure 9.
24:725:41870:20:20:88:531:405:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In the lower left corner of Figure 10 (i.e. low values ofδandρ) lies the region ofδandρwhere
24:726:41962:20:20:72:531:385:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:an economy with an arbitrary level of initial skills (including zero) will fully transform to modern
24:727:42062:20:20:72:531:365:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:production. If in this caseδ<δ∗, there will be no managerial premium in the steady state. The
24:728:42155:20:20:72:531:345:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:disappearance of a managerial premium follows directly from the low labor turnover which ensures
24:729:42251:20:20:72:531:325:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:steady state skills are very high. For higher values ofδ, while staying in Region A, the modern
24:730:42346:20:20:72:531:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technology will always fully develop, but the higher values ofδwill allow the persistence of a skill
24:731:42446:20:20:72:530:285:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:premium in the steady state. For high values of bothδandρ, as in Region B, development of the
24:732:42539:20:20:72:531:265:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:modern technology is not sustainable. An economy inheriting some skilled managers, or receiving
24:733:42634:20:20:72:531:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in-migration of them, would utilize the technology, and would also train some further managers
24:734:42728:20:20:72:531:225:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in its use. However, the low rate of skill creation is not sufficient to offset the high labor turnover
24:735:42831:20:20:72:531:205:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and therefore such an economy will eventually see such skills vanish from the population as the
24:736:42926:20:20:72:531:185:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:economy reverts back to full use of traditional technology. The middle region, region C, exhibits
24:737:43023:20:16:72:531:165:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a knife edge type of hysteresis. The economy’s low valuation of the future (highρ), implies that
24:738:43119:16:15:80:531:149:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f7:12This region is defined by a critical value, denotedk∗,suchthatifρ+δ<k∗,all production eventually occurs
24:739:43224:15:7:71:188:134:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f4:using the modern technology.
24:740:43252:7:15:80:531:127:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f7:13This region is defined by a critical value ofδ,denotedδ∗∗such that forδ≥δ∗∗,there exists a corresponding
24:741:43358:15:11:71:531:112:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f4:value ofρ,denotedρ∗such  that, ifρ>ρ∗the economy converges to a unique steady state with all production
24:742:43461:11:7:72:230:101:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:occurring in the traditional technology.
24:743:43501:7:0:80:278:94:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:14In this case, the steady state value ofλis zero.
25:744:43553:0:19:72:530:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:without skills originally present, no unskilled worker wouldfind it worthwhile to incur currently
25:745:43650:19:20:71:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:low productivity in order to accumulate managerial skill. However, with even a small amount
25:746:43741:20:20:71:530:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:present, they will be used in production, and since skills in the population depreciate slowly since
25:747:43841:20:20:71:531:644:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f4:δis relative low, this will eventually lead to their diffusion through the population. Thefinal
25:748:43936:20:33:71:328:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:outcome is a full transition to the modern technology.

25:761:44057:39:20:88:530:288:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Though on the job skills will be accumulated in all economies, the model provides an interpre-
25:762:44151:20:20:71:531:268:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:tation of when these will lead to a take-offinto the new technology, and thus a growth miracle,
25:763:44246:20:20:71:531:248:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and when efforts at implementing new technologies will fail. Specifically, as illustrated in Figures
25:764:44346:20:20:71:530:228:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:6 and 8, even an economy without any managerial skills will devote resources to acquiring the
25:765:44439:20:20:71:531:208:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:new technology since bothδandρare sufficiently low. Starting atS=0, growth rates will be
25:766:44527:20:20:71:530:188:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:high, and returns to experience will be large at the start and eventually decline, perhaps to zero,
25:767:44626:20:20:71:530:168:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in the eventual steady state. The factor in common in both thefigures is a high valuation of the
25:768:44722:20:20:71:530:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:future. In extreme contrast, Figure 7 depicts an economy with both a relatively low valuation
25:769:44815:20:20:71:530:128:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of the future, and high turnover of individuals. Such an economy would also experience some
25:770:44906:20:20:71:530:108:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:growth were it to receive an infusion of skills from abroad. However, even a large injection of
25:771:45001:20:0:71:531:88:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skilled workers would not transform this economyto modern production, instead, it will converge
26:772:45098:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:back to the traditional technology, along a path which sees constantlydeclining output. The
26:773:45189:19:20:72:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:middling case is given in Figure 9. Such an economy will not converge to modern production
26:774:45279:20:20:72:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:without some exogenous influx of skilled workers. Any initiative which does this, though, will
26:775:45373:20:20:72:531:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:lead to rapid learning, diffusion, and sustained growth to the new steady state where there is a
26:776:45469:20:35:72:242:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:permanently higher level of income.
26:777:45504:35:30:72:352:589:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:3  Implications for Growth Accounting
26:778:45541:30:20:72:530:559:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A natural question to ask is whether the process of managerial skill acquisition we have presented
26:779:45639:20:20:71:530:539:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:could be an important component in development process in the sense of potentially explaining
26:780:45732:20:20:71:530:519:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a substantial fraction of cross-country differences in income. At afirst pass, the answer from the
26:781:45830:20:20:71:530:499:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:growth accounting literature appears to be a clear no. This literature (see for example Klenow and
26:782:45928:20:20:71:531:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Rodriguez-Clare (1997))finds that skills, whether acquired on-the-job or by schooling, account
26:783:46022:20:20:71:531:459:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:foronlyasmallfractionofincomedifferences across countries. In particular, in order to evaluate
26:784:46116:20:20:71:531:439:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the potential role of on-the-job skill acquisition, this literature uses estimates of the returns to
26:785:46216:20:20:71:530:419:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:job experience to calculate the share of income paid to on-the-job acquired skills. This share of
26:786:46313:20:20:71:531:399:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:income is found to be small and it is generally inferred that no story of on-the-job skill acquisition
26:787:46415:20:20:71:531:379:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:can have the potential to explain an important fraction of cross-country income differentials. In
26:788:46512:20:20:71:530:359:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:this section, we argue that such an inference would not follow if the data were generated by the
26:789:46608:20:19:71:531:339:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:type of managerial skill acquisition process presented here. In this discussion, we will examine
26:790:46704:19:20:71:530:320:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:what our model implies about standard growth accounting exercises, under the assumption that
26:791:46796:20:20:71:531:300:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:returns on-the-job are estimated using experience profiles. We will illustrate why standard growth
26:792:46894:20:20:71:531:280:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:accounting exercises would not properly assessthe role of on-the-job learning if the data were
26:793:46988:20:20:71:530:260:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:generated by our model.  Since the impact upon growth accounting depends upon whether a
26:794:47075:20:29:71:444:240:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:cross-section of countries or a time-series is considered, we explore both cases.

27:818:48003:35:20:72:531:535:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:is usually interpreted as the contribution of factors that have not been purposefully accumulated.
27:819:48101:20:20:72:531:515:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This is because it is assumed that the contribution of differences in skills learned on-the-job is
27:820:48199:20:20:71:531:495:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reflected in the returns to the experience.  In order to see how this may be misleading, now
27:821:48291:20:20:71:531:475:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:suppose that countriesiandjhave different values ofδandρ,and that the growth process is
27:822:48378:20:20:72:531:455:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:driven by on-the-job managerial skills acquisition as we have modelled it. Assume for now that
27:823:48472:20:20:72:530:435:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f4:δi≤δ∗. Furthermore, assume that countryihas a low value ofρso that it lies in Region A in
27:824:48561:20:20:71:466:415:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Figure 10, whereas countryjhas a high value ofδandρso that it lies in region B.
27:825:48640:20:20:88:531:395:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Now consider an accounting exercise aiming to explain level differences in income between
27:826:48729:20:20:71:531:375:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:countriesiandj, using observations drawn from the steady state. Income per-capita is higher in
27:827:48823:20:19:71:530:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:countryibecause it has more managerial skills, which have been accumulated through the use of
27:828:48916:19:20:71:531:336:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the new technology. However, returns to work experience estimated from micro data is precisely
27:829:49010:20:20:71:530:316:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:zero in countryi.  This is because managerial skills are abundant in the a steady state and
27:830:49101:20:20:71:531:296:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hence have a zero return. Consequently, all of the difference in income levels that was caused by
27:831:49198:20:20:71:531:276:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:differences in on-the-job learning will be picked up by the residual. This may lead researchers to
27:832:49296:20:20:71:531:256:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:incorrectly interpret the cause of the difference in income per capita betweeniandjas being due
27:833:49391:20:20:71:531:236:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to a disembodied factor, such as differences in technological opportunities, since it is attributed
27:834:49490:20:20:71:143:216:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to the residual.
27:835:49506:20:20:88:531:196:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Note that the same over-attribution of differences to the residual would also occur were country
27:836:49602:20:20:71:531:176:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f4:ito be located in the region A whereδi>δ∗.Here, experience differences would now be measured
27:837:49694:20:20:72:531:156:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to pick up some of the difference in output per worker, but this measured contribution need bear
27:838:49790:20:20:72:531:136:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:no relationship to the true contribution. In fact,the degree of understatement would be inversely
27:839:49887:20:0:72:182:116:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f8:related to the size ofδ.

28:841:49956:27:20:72:531:676:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The previous discussion illustrated why growth accounting exercises, when performed on a cross-
28:842:50051:20:20:72:531:656:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:section of countries, may greatly understate the role of on-the-job learning in explaining levels of
28:843:50151:20:20:72:531:636:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:income-per-worker. In this section we examine whether such an inference problem will also arise
28:844:50246:20:20:72:531:616:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:when growth accounting is performed using timeseries data for a given country. Thus consider
28:845:50338:20:20:71:530:596:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a single country that is experiencing growth in output per capita according to our process of

28:847:50529:20:23:71:435:556:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:country’s growth over time, one would perform the following decomposition:

28:861:50722:19:20:72:531:475:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:were directly measured, i.e. if the utilized data included information about the technology with
28:862:50818:20:20:72:531:455:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:which workers work, then this procedure would provide an accurate depiction of experience’s (or
28:863:50913:20:20:72:531:435:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managerial skills’) contribution to the growth in per capita output, ase ̇xpexpwould be positive while
28:864:51015:20:20:72:530:415:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the economy grows andαtwould be greater than zero. It is thus, conceptually at least, possible
28:865:51109:20:20:72:531:395:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to estimate the impact of all learning by doing on output per capita if the appropriate data were
28:866:51206:20:20:72:116:375:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:available.
28:867:51216:20:20:88:531:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:However, direct measures of on-the-job skills are generally not available. Instead skills learned
28:868:51313:20:20:72:531:335:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:through experience are usually proxied as a weighted average of the economy’s age structure, or
28:869:51408:20:20:72:531:315:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a weighted average of time in the work-force. In our example, economyiexperiences growth
28:870:51496:20:20:72:531:295:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in output per capita all the way through its transition due to an increase in the fraction of the
28:871:51593:20:20:72:531:275:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:population which has managerial skill. But the age, and hence measured experience, is unchanged
28:872:51688:20:20:72:531:255:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:through the transition. Thus proxying experience by the age structure or time in the labor force
28:873:51784:20:19:72:530:235:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:would, in data generated by our model, lead to thefinding thate ̇xpexp=0.The outcome is therefore
28:874:51881:19:20:72:531:216:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the same as in the cross-section: a growth accounting exercises performed on a time series will
28:875:51976:20:20:72:531:196:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:most likely attribute all of the on-the-job learning to the residual term, ̇AA.This again would
28:876:52071:20:20:72:530:176:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:lead to the erroneous attribution of countryi0sincome growth to an unexplained residual factor

29:879:52266:31:20:72:531:670:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Theories of cross-country growth differences that have attributed significant roles to embodied
29:880:52361:20:19:71:530:650:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skills generally imply migration incentives that are perverse in comparison with actual migration
29:881:52458:19:20:71:531:631:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f4:flows. This view is summarized in Romer’s (1995) critique on Mankiw’s (1995) emphasis on formal
29:882:52553:20:20:71:531:611:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:training in his explanation of cross-country differences.  This arises for standard neo-classical
29:883:52650:20:20:71:531:591:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reasons. Since the skills are relatively abundantin developed countries, returns to them should
29:884:52745:20:20:71:530:571:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:be low there, and there should thus be incentive for skilled individuals in developed countries to
29:885:52843:20:20:71:530:551:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:migrate to those undeveloped ones where managerial skills are scarce. In the present framework,
29:886:52938:20:20:71:530:531:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skills are embodied and fully rewarded, suggesting that a similar set of incentives should be in
29:887:53034:20:20:71:374:511:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:place. It turns out, however, that this is not generally the case.
29:888:53100:20:20:88:530:491:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Here we shall consider migration incentives between two countries with access to the same
29:889:53189:20:20:71:531:471:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:set of technologies, modern and traditional, but differing in one of three ways that will generate
29:890:53287:20:20:71:530:451:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:dramatic outcome differences. Thefirst two sources of difference are fundamentals: the discount
29:891:53382:20:20:71:530:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:factor,ρ;and the population turnover rate,δ.As we have seen previously, countries with higher
29:892:53475:20:20:71:530:411:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:values of each of these are more likely to converge to a steady state where the traditional tech-
29:893:53572:20:19:71:530:391:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:nology dominates. Conversely, countries with lower values of these variables are more likely to be
29:894:53670:19:20:71:531:372:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in a steady state where all production occurs using the modern technology. Thirdly we consider
29:895:53764:20:20:71:531:352:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:migration incentives implied by the hysteresis case illustrated in Figure 9 where fundamentals are
29:896:53862:20:20:71:114:332:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:identical.
29:897:53872:20:20:88:530:312:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:When considering incentives to migrate, we focus on instantaneous incentives.  If a wage
29:898:53960:20:20:71:530:292:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:payment is higher — for a given skill level — in country i versus country j, we will say that such
29:899:54058:20:20:71:530:272:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a worker has an incentive to migrate from country j to country i. Our primary focus is on the
29:900:54151:20:20:71:530:252:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:incentive for skilled managers to migrate from richer to poorer countries. We omit discussion of
29:901:54247:20:20:71:530:232:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the migration incentives for unskilled workers since they are quite standard in the model in the
29:902:54343:20:20:71:531:212:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:sense that there is never an incentive for an unskilled worker to migrate from a rich country to a
29:903:54441:20:29:71:135:192:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:poor country.

29:906:54595:20:20:72:531:116:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rates such thatρr<ρp.We choose values of the respectiveρso that the rich country is in Region
29:907:54688:20:0:71:531:96:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A in Figure 10, while the poor country is in Region B. Note that such a configuration is only

30:910:54895:20:20:71:530:663:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:occurs in the traditional technology, and that the rich country will be in a steady state where all
30:911:54994:20:20:71:530:643:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:production is in the modern technology. Also, in the rich country’s steady state there is ongoing
30:912:55091:20:20:71:530:623:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:training of individuals in managerial skills, whereas in the poor country’s steady state, managerial
30:913:55191:20:20:71:530:603:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skills are not being produced because no one is working with the modern technology. This does
30:914:55284:20:20:71:531:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:not mean that the managerial skills would not be valuable in the poor country. Specifically, if one
30:915:55383:20:20:71:530:563:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:skilled manager from the rich country, where skills are widespread, were to migrate to the poor
30:916:55478:20:19:71:530:543:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:country, he would be able to set up production and utilize the modern technology. Moreover,
30:917:55569:19:20:71:530:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the unskilled workers he employed would also acquire valuable managerial skills and therefore be
30:918:55665:20:20:71:530:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:willing to “pay” for these by working at a wage below the current wage with the old technology.
30:919:55760:20:20:71:530:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This would generate a positive return to managerial skill and would seem to suggest strong
30:920:55850:20:20:71:531:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:incentives for migration of skilled individuals from the rich country to the poor one. It turns out,
30:921:55950:20:20:71:530:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:however, that this is not the case since as Proposition 2 indicates, the managerial wage in the
30:922:56045:20:20:71:521:424:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:rich country is higher than the managerial wage that one would achieve in the poor country.15

30:925:56305:20:20:88:530:364:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The reason managers in the rich country do not want to migrate to the poor country is that
30:926:56395:20:20:71:531:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the wage they can achieve is higher in the rich country (i.e., lowρcountry). How can that be given
30:927:56493:20:20:71:531:324:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that managers are more abundant in the rich country? Recall that wage payments to a manager
30:928:56584:20:20:71:530:304:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:are made up of two components: the marginal product in production and the teaching value.

30:930:56763:19:20:72:531:265:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:accumulate managerial skills. This ensures a high teaching value of managers and since many
30:931:56854:20:16:72:531:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:more unskilled workers are willing to learn managerial skills, this guarantees overall managerial

31:946:57262:27:20:72:530:646:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Let us now consider the situation with two countries in steady state which differ only in terms of
31:947:57360:20:20:72:531:626:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f4:δ, but have the same value ofρ.Thefirst county is poor since it has a high value ofδ, denotedδp,
31:948:57456:20:20:72:531:606:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:which leads it to use only the traditional technology. This country has a parameter configuration
31:949:57553:20:20:72:531:586:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that places it in region B of Figure 10. The second country is rich due to a lower value ofδ,

31:953:57918:20:20:71:530:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:migrate from rich to poor countries, in Figure 11, we plot the wage of skilled workers as a function
31:954:58018:20:39:71:392:486:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ofδ. Recall that the wage of managers can be expressed as follows:
31:955:58084:39:27:227:530:447:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f4:ws(δ)=F1(Z,1) +λeΩ1(Z,1),(28)

31:957:58202:20:20:72:530:400:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:wages of managers change due to changes in bothZandλ. For the case whereδis in region
31:958:58287:20:20:72:535:380:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B, there are no skilled managers in the steady state, which may give the impression thatZ,and
31:959:58380:20:20:72:531:360:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hencews,arenotwelldefined. However, this is not the case since, as seen in Figure 7, there is a
31:960:58475:20:19:72:530:340:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:well defined steady state value forλ18and this value ofλpins down the relevant value ofZby

31:967:58754:15:11:71:531:240:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:of the ratio of managerial to production workers in sixOECD countries, all of which are below 25%. In contrast,
31:968:58865:11:11:71:530:229:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:the average supervision ratio in Sub-Saharan Africa is 41%. The explanation provided here would be that the lower
31:969:58978:11:11:71:530:218:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:steady state value of managerial skills (due to the higher rate of discount,ρ)in the Sub-Saharan economies implies
31:970:59092:11:7:72:493:207:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:that workers are less willing to pay the cost of being a low productivity worker required to obtain them.

32:998:60306:20:20:71:531:188:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:relationship betweenwsandδimplies that a manager in a developed/rich country does not

32:1000:60485:20:20:72:531:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:any given poor country, there exist a range ofδs(withδ<δm) such that, a country in this

32:1003:60762:20:0:72:531:88:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Proposition 3. Note however, that if theδof the rich country is sufficiently small, then a skilled

33:1021:62184:20:20:72:531:348:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:managers will see out-migration to the otherwise identical country which has not yet developed.
33:1022:62279:20:19:72:531:328:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Moreover, the introduction of a small number of skilled managers into the poor country will

33:1024:62447:20:20:72:531:289:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:level of output per capita as the rich country, with full use of the modern technology.  This
33:1025:62540:20:20:72:530:269:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:“seeding” of skilled individuals and the eventual mushrooming of these skills throughout the
33:1026:62632:20:20:72:531:249:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:sector, provides an interpretation of the Bangladeshi (garment) and Indonesian (lumber) examples
33:1027:62728:20:20:72:531:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in the introduction. In both cases, small numbers of skilled workers were transplanted into the
33:1028:62823:20:20:72:531:209:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:poor country — by training locals in the Bangladesi example, and by transplanting skilled Koreans
33:1029:62920:20:20:72:530:189:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in the Indonesian example. The diffusion of their skills through on the job learning to future
33:1030:63014:20:0:72:356:169:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:entrepreneurs then lead to rapid and large follow-on effects.
34:1031:63077:0:31:72:170:701:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:5  Discussion
34:1032:63090:31:20:72:531:670:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:We have maintained the assumption throughout of perfectly competitive labor markets which
34:1033:63179:20:19:72:531:650:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:can adequately coordinate the acquisition of on-the-job managerial skills. There are at least two
34:1034:63276:19:20:72:531:631:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reasons to doubt this in reality: labor may be liquidity constrained; andfirms may not be able
34:1035:63370:20:20:72:530:611:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to write binding long-term contracts with labor. In this section we briefly discuss these issues,
34:1036:63467:20:20:71:341:591:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:leaving to future research a more thorough examination.
34:1037:63522:20:20:88:530:571:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:As we saw, in transition, there are skill premia,λ>0.Unskilled labor have low marginal
34:1038:63608:20:20:71:530:551:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:products and accept low wages in order to learn the managerial skills and receive higher wages
34:1039:63702:20:20:71:530:531:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in future. However, especially at the start of this process, the net present value of such skills
34:1040:63799:20:20:71:530:511:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:is high. Thus competitive factor markets will price wages for the unskilled at low, and perhaps
34:1041:63894:20:20:71:530:491:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:negative levels. We have not constrained wages for the unskilled downwards, but in reality it
34:1042:63987:20:20:71:531:471:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:is extremely unlikely that, in developing countries, labor could pay for the future value of the
34:1043:64083:20:20:71:530:451:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:organizational skills that they acquire today, through low or negative wages. Individuals are likely
34:1044:64183:20:20:71:531:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to be constrained by present consumption needs, and to be unable tofinance present consumption
34:1045:64277:20:20:71:178:411:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:out of future earnings.
34:1046:64300:20:19:88:530:391:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This would be less of a problem if labor could write binding future employment contracts
34:1047:64388:19:20:71:531:372:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:with employers (or outsidefinanciers). With such contracts, labor could be paid a wage sufficient
34:1048:64485:20:20:71:530:352:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to maintain subsistence and above the market clearing wage while unskilled, and then, under
34:1049:64576:20:20:71:530:332:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:contract, be forced to repay this by working as managers at wages below market clearing when they
34:1050:64673:20:20:71:530:312:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:are ready to do so. The existence of such contracts would allow full mimicry of the competitive
34:1051:64768:20:20:71:530:292:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:allocation that we have analyzed above. However, it is extremely unlikely that such contracts
34:1052:64861:20:20:71:530:272:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:could work in reality. Firstly, in many countries, few courts would uphold the right of employers
34:1053:64958:20:20:71:530:252:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to restrict labor through contracts such as those above. Secondly, the discussion assumes away the
34:1054:65056:20:20:71:531:232:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:possibility of worker moral-hazard, which is likely to become particularly severe when workers are
34:1055:65154:20:20:71:531:212:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:being paid below market wages and would like to precipitate an employment termination. This
34:1056:65245:20:20:71:530:192:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:problem could again be solved by contracts which allowed labor mobility but enforced repayment
34:1057:65339:20:20:71:531:172:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to either thefirm orfinancier of the initial skills acquisition. However, even in developed countries,
34:1058:65441:20:20:71:290:152:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:suchfinancing schemes are far from complete.
34:1059:65485:20:20:88:531:132:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:If such on-the-job managerial skills acquisition does play a central role in productivity im-
34:1060:65578:20:19:71:530:112:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:provement, then it should be the case that countries that have experienced dramatic growth
34:1061:65668:19:0:71:530:93:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:should have exhibited institutions that, to some extent, were able to overcome these problems.
35:1062:65764:0:19:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In contrast, the lack of such institutions mayunderpin the problems of skilling and technology
35:1063:65858:19:20:71:351:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:acquisition that have been identified in many LDCs today.
35:1064:65915:20:20:88:531:664:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Institutions that come to mind are those that somehow link labor tofirms for long stretches
35:1065:66006:20:20:71:530:644:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of time and thus provide incentives forfirms to overcome workers’ liquidity constraints and
35:1066:66097:20:20:71:530:624:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:accumulate the necessary skills without worrying about future appropriability of returns. Or,
35:1067:66190:20:20:71:531:604:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:institutions that allow workers to overcome these problems on their own, and thus become skilled.
35:1068:66287:20:20:71:530:584:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:There is certainly evidence of such institutions in both Japan and South Korea which were
35:1069:66376:20:20:71:530:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:both characterized by labor markets with significant worker bonding.  There is also evidence
35:1070:66468:20:20:71:531:544:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of reduced labor mobility increasingfirms’ incentives to induce on-the-job skills acquisition in
35:1071:66564:20:20:71:530:524:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the developing past of industrialized countries, see for example Bessen (2003) and the case of
35:1072:66658:20:20:71:531:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:19th century Massachusetts cotton manufacturing. Singapore, in contrast, followed a different
35:1073:66751:20:20:71:530:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:approach which explicitly recognized the externality to such on the job training in a market
35:1074:66843:20:20:71:530:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:where worker mobility was assured.  The government there set up a Skill Development Fund
35:1075:66931:20:20:71:530:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:which collected a levy of one percent of payroll from employers to subsidize training of low paid
35:1076:67028:20:19:71:531:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:workers (Lall 1999, p. 36). Alternatively, Germany developed a ‘cooperative’ training system
35:1077:67120:19:20:71:530:405:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:which lead to practical training being coordinated between employer, employees and government.
35:1078:67214:20:20:71:530:385:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Apprentices took low wages, employers contributed to part of the costs, and government provided
35:1079:67309:20:20:71:531:365:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:some of the infrastructure, while union groups took an active role in discouraging worker poaching
35:1080:67407:20:20:71:530:345:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(Lall 1999, p.38). A detailed analysis of these country studies is beyond the scope of this paper,
35:1081:67505:20:34:71:460:325:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:but further examination of such cases is certainly motivated by thefindings here.
35:1082:67586:34:31:72:189:291:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:6Conclusion
35:1083:67597:31:20:72:530:260:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In this paper we have presented a model of managerial skill acquisition where unskilled individuals
35:1084:67696:20:20:72:530:240:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:invest to obtain skills by accepting employment infirms where managerial skills are present. This
35:1085:67793:20:20:72:530:220:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:process of skills acquisition is related to, but distinct from, a previously large literature on skills
35:1086:67896:20:20:72:531:200:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:acquisition through learning-by-doing. Learning-by-doing emphasizes increases in productivity
35:1087:67989:20:20:71:530:180:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:arising from repetition of tasks through time. Ourprocess of managerial skills acquisition involves
35:1088:68088:20:20:71:531:160:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:learning from working with a manager, and thus arises when undertaking distinct and comple-
35:1089:68179:20:20:72:530:140:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mentary tasks. This process may have potentiallyimportant implications for understanding why
35:1090:68271:20:20:71:531:120:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technologies may be so difficult to transplant across countries. Unlike the learning-by-doing liter-
35:1091:68371:20:0:71:530:100:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ature, and previous studies which have similarly emphasized the role of emodied skills (as opposed
36:1092:68471:0:20:72:531:703:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to disembodied knowledge), the process we posit here yields implications which we demonstrate
36:1093:68564:20:20:72:275:683:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to be consistent with the empirical record.
36:1094:68607:20:20:88:530:663:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Although this process of managerial skill acquisition is modelled in a manner that allows
36:1095:68696:20:20:72:530:643:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:knowledge to be entirely internalized by individuals, we have shown that it nevertheless leads to
36:1096:68793:20:20:72:531:623:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:outcomes that resemble those obtained in endogenous growth models with market imperfections.
36:1097:68885:20:20:72:531:603:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:For example, we show that in this setup, agents will purposefully accumulate managerial skill
36:1098:68978:20:20:72:531:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:knowing full well that the return to these skills will dissipate over time and, in the steady state,
36:1099:69078:20:20:72:531:563:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:possibly be equal to zero. We have shown how such a process could lead astray growth accounting
36:1100:69173:20:20:72:530:543:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:exercises since differences across countries in managerial skill would most likely be attributed to
36:1101:69272:20:19:71:531:523:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:differences in total factor productivity as opposed to being properly attributed to on-the-job
36:1102:69366:19:20:71:530:504:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:experience.  Finally, we have also shown how this model can explain why managers may not
36:1103:69454:20:20:71:530:484:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:migrate from rich countries, where they are abundant, to poor countries where there are scarce,
36:1104:69549:20:20:71:530:464:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:even though the underlying technology satisfies constant returns to scale. The explanation of this
36:1105:69647:20:20:72:531:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:latter effect is the presence of a teaching premium for managers in the rich country which will
36:1106:69742:20:20:72:286:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:generally be higher that in the poor country.
36:1107:69787:20:20:88:530:404:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:There are many possible extensions to this model. As previously discussed, it may be war-
36:1108:69876:20:20:72:531:384:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ranted to examine the properties of this type of on-the-job learning process in the absence of
36:1109:69970:20:20:72:531:364:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:perfect markets. This could help understand the institutional and policy features of less devel-
36:1110:70066:20:20:71:530:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:oped economies that are conducive (or inimical) to this process of skills acquisition when markets
36:1111:70164:20:20:71:531:324:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:do not fully reward it. An alternative type of market failure may arise when the modern sector is
36:1112:70261:20:20:71:530:304:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:subject to thick market externalites. In the presence of even minor externalities of this sort, the
36:1113:70360:20:20:71:531:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:process of managerial skill acquisition as modelled here could explain the emergence of a poverty
36:1114:70457:20:19:71:531:264:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:trap whereby a poor country does not invest in managerial skill acquisition simply because the
36:1115:70551:19:35:71:317:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:modern sector is small due to the lack of managers.
