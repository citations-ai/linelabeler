2:31:480:16:15:72:542:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This paper proposes a new measure of firm information asymmetry. The information asymmetry 
2:32:570:15:16:72:543:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure  is  based  on  causality  tests  relating  repurchase  information  to firm returns.  Our  results 
2:33:678:16:16:72:543:326:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicate that firms with greater information asymmetry show larger abnormal returns surrounding 
2:34:772:16:16:72:543:310:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the announcement of an  open market share repurchase. This new information asymmetry proxy 
2:35:863:16:16:72:543:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:remains a significant explanatory factor for announcement abnormal returns after controlling for 
2:36:960:16:16:72:542:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other conventional  information  asymmetry proxies, such  as firm  size,  number  of  analysts 
2:37:1054:16:16:72:542:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:following,  and  analyst  forecast  dispersion. Further, our  measure  of  information  asymmetry  is 
2:38:1156:16:16:72:485:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positively related to long-term abnormal returns at one, two, and three-year windows.

3:47:1382:25:28:108:543:683:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:While  the  market  response  to  open  market  repurchase  announcements is  on  average 
3:48:1471:28:27:72:543:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive,  the  market  responds  strongly  to  some announcements and  not  strongly  to others.1 We 
3:49:1570:27:28:72:543:628:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examine if the degree of firm information asymmetry helps to explain the market reaction to open 
3:50:1667:28:28:72:543:600:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market share repurchase announcements. Our measure of information asymmetry is unique in this 
3:51:1761:28:27:72:543:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:context  and  is  derived  from  time  series  regressions based  on  Granger  (1969)  and  Sims  (1972). 
3:52:1867:27:28:72:543:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:While other information asymmetry proxies in the literature capture some aspects of information 
3:53:1962:28:27:72:543:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry, ours is tailored specifically to the repurchase decision. Specifically, our information 
3:54:2061:27:28:72:543:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry proxy is based on dynamic causal relations between stock price performance of firms 
3:55:2154:28:28:72:542:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and the  announcement  of  share  repurchases  during  the  period  1990-2012.  Our  information 
3:56:2251:28:27:72:543:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry  proxy  helps  to  explain  announcement  returns  even  after  controlling  for  other 
3:57:2349:27:28:72:542:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conventional information asymmetry proxies, such as firm size, number of analysts following, and 
3:58:2446:28:37:72:243:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the dispersion of analyst forecasts.  
3:59:2482:37:28:108:542:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Market  reactions to  share  repurchases may  be  related  to  the  perceived  motivation and 
3:60:2576:28:28:72:543:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information of the repurchase. The literature provides evidence of the signaling hypothesis (Louis 
3:61:2671:28:27:72:543:286:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and White, 2007). According to the signaling hypothesis, the motivation for a stock repurchase is 
3:62:2769:27:28:72:542:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to signal undervaluation of a firm to investors. Dittmar (2000) argues that information asymmetry 
3:63:2867:28:27:72:543:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between managers and shareholders can induce firm undervaluation in the market, and that a stock 
3:64:2964:27:28:72:543:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase is the process of releasing information that is available only to managers to the market. 
3:65:3062:28:28:72:543:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Therefore, the information signaled is usually assumed to be firm undervaluation although other 
3:66:3157:28:36:72:543:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:motivations  for  repurchases  exist  (i.e., stock-based  compensation  plans,  reducing  excess  cash,

3:68:3319:8:15:72:542:104:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:1 Comment and Jarrell (1991), Chan et al. (2004), and Grullon and Michaely (2004), among others, document positive 
3:69:3433:15:0:72:324:89:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:abnormal returns following the announcement of repurchases.  
4:70:3494:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:etc.).2 The survey of managers by Brav et al. (2005) indicates that undervaluation is the primary 
4:71:3591:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reason  for repurchasing. However, the literature has not reached a  consensus on whether or not 
4:72:3687:28:27:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:managers  are  able  to  time  repurchases  correctly  to  take  advantage  of  periods  of  mispricing. 
4:73:3792:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ikenberry et al. (1995), Brockman and Chung (2001), Cook et al. (2004), and Peyer and Vermaelen 
4:74:3887:28:27:72:543:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2009) conclude that managers  are able to time the market while Dittmar and  Field (2013) find 
4:75:3983:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that frequent repurchasers, who account for the majority of repurchases, are unable and likely not 
4:76:4082:28:28:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attempting to time the market. Similarly, Jagannathan and Stephens (2003) show that infrequent 
4:77:4175:28:27:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchases  show  a  stronger  stock  price  reaction  at  announcement.  Yook  (2010) finds that 
4:78:4273:27:28:72:543:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase announcement abnormal returns are positively related to firm undervaluation and that 
4:79:4369:28:27:72:542:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:frequent repurchasing firms do not show positive long-term abnormal returns. Similarly, Babenko 
4:80:4464:27:28:72:542:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:et al. (2012) demonstrate that not all repurchases are credible signals of undervaluation. Further, 
4:81:4564:28:28:72:542:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dittmar and Field (2013) find that the market is not able to determine which repurchases signal 
4:82:4659:28:37:72:310:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:undervaluation at the time of the announcement.  
4:83:4706:37:28:108:543:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Regardless of whether or not the average repurchase indicates timing, it seems clear that 
4:84:4796:28:27:72:543:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:some repurchases are informed and others are uninformed. Thus, establishing which firms have 
4:85:4889:27:28:72:542:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relatively higher levels of information asymmetry in the repurchase decision allows us to identify 
4:86:4988:28:30:72:543:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  repurchases  send  credible  signals  and  which  do  not. Others  have examined  conventional

4:88:5146:8:15:72:541:219:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:2 The literature  shows several  reasons  for  corporate  managers  to  distribute  cash  through  share  repurchases.  For 
4:89:5267:15:12:72:541:204:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:example,  share  repurchases provide  corporate  managers  with  flexibility in terms of timing and the amount of cash 
4:90:5386:12:11:72:542:192:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:payouts (e.g., Grullon and Michaely, 2002), so many researchers hypothesize that firms use share repurchases to pay 
4:91:5502:11:12:72:547:181:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:out  temporary  cash  flows  (Guay  and  Harford,  2000;  Jagannathan  et  al.  2000;  Dittmar,  2000;  Lee  and  Rui,  2007).   
4:92:5631:12:11:72:542:169:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Some authors hypothesize that firms use share repurchases to distribute excess capital. This excess capital hypothesis 
4:93:5750:11:12:72:542:158:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:relates  to  the  free  cash  flow  hypothesis  of  Jensen  (1986)  in  that  excess  capital  gives  rise  to  agency  costs  of 
4:94:5880:12:11:72:542:146:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:overinvestments unless it is distributed to shareholders (e.g., Dittmar, 2000).  Some studies provide evidence that the 
4:95:5997:11:12:72:542:135:10:g_d0_f9:10:Times New Roman:F:presence of stock option programs influences firms’ decisions about share repurchases (Jolls, 1998; Fenn and Liang, 
4:96:6113:12:11:72:542:123:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:2001;  Kahle,  2002;  Jun,  Jung  and  Walkling,  2009);  that  firms  use  share  repurchases  to  defend  themselves  against 
4:97:6241:11:12:72:542:112:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:takeovers  (Denis,  1990;  Billett  and  Xue,  2007). Tax motives may  also  influence  decisions  to  repurchase  shares 
4:98:6363:12:11:72:542:100:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:because,  as  compared  to  dividends,  share  repurchases  provide  shareholders  with  tax  benefits  (Barclay  and  Smith, 
4:99:6489:11:0:72:99:89:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:1988). 
5:100:6496:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and general information asymmetry proxies such as firm size in examining the market response to 
5:101:6590:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:share  repurchases  (Chan  et  al.,  2004).  However,  we propose a  repurchase  specific  information 
5:102:6692:28:27:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry   proxy  in  order  to  better  understand  the  market   reaction  to  share   repurchase 
5:103:6793:27:38:72:155:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcements.  
5:104:6808:38:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  intuition  of  our  information  asymmetry  measure  is  straightforward.  If  a  given 
5:105:6901:27:28:72:542:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase  announcement  contains  predictive  information  about  future  stock  returns,  then  it 
5:106:7003:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:follows that the repurchase is likely based on information possessed by the manager and not the 
5:107:7098:28:27:72:542:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market. In short, firms with higher information asymmetry are more likely to show stronger stock 
5:108:7193:27:28:72:543:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market  returns  following  the  open market  repurchase.  Thus,  our  measure  of  information 
5:109:7288:28:27:72:542:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry is based on time series causality regressions for each repurchasing firm in the sample. 
5:110:7385:27:28:72:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Each repurchase announcement is categorized as either an informed or uninformed repurchase.  If 
5:111:7481:28:28:72:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lagged repurchase information predicts future (six month) returns, with a statistically significant 
5:112:7580:28:27:72:543:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:causal  relation,  that  repurchase  is  labeled as  informed.  Our  interpretation  of  this  is  that  these 
5:113:7691:27:28:72:542:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:informed repurchases are for firms where the level of information asymmetry is sufficiently high 
5:114:7786:28:37:72:440:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as to render the information of the announcement economically meaningful. 
5:115:7859:37:28:72:543:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Our results indicate that  the majority of repurchases are not informed. Regardless of the 
5:116:7949:28:27:72:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase  measure  used,  we  find  that approximately 7% of  all  repurchase announcements are 
5:117:8043:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:informed. Our use of the term “informed” in this case is to describe those firms for which the 
5:118:8137:28:28:72:543:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lagged  repurchase  variable  predicts  six  month  future  returns  in causality regressions. This  is 
5:119:8239:28:27:72:542:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consistent  with  Dittmar  and  Field (2013)  who  find  that  most  repurchases  are  by  frequent 
5:120:8339:27:0:72:416:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchasers and that such transactions are not at relatively low prices.  
6:121:8414:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Informed   repurchases result   in higher   announcement   returns   than   non-informed 
6:122:8502:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchases, which  indicates  that  the  market  generally  identifies  firms  with  greater  information 
6:123:8608:28:27:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry  at  the  time  of  the  repurchase  announcement.  The  difference  between  informed  and 
6:124:8710:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:uninformed abnormal returns is increased for small firms, but the difference is non-existent (i.e., 
6:125:8807:28:27:72:542:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:insignificant) for  large  firms.  Thus,  smaller  firms that are likely to have  higher  levels  of 
6:126:8907:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  asymmetry  may  be  further  bifurcated  based  on  our  more  precise  measure  of 
6:127:9004:28:28:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  asymmetry. Specifically,  the  size  of  the  firm  does  not  fully  explain  firm  level 
6:128:9107:28:27:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information asymmetry in the context of repurchases and our time series based measure offers an 
6:129:9203:27:28:72:543:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:alternative measure specific to this purpose. Our results hold when controlling for the size of the 
6:130:9303:28:27:72:543:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase, the frequency of repurchases for a firm, and other traditional proxies for information 
6:131:9400:27:28:72:543:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry including firm size, analysts following, and the dispersion of analyst forecasts. Finally, 
6:132:9501:28:28:72:542:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we find that firms that we identify as informed outperform the market and other repurchasers in 
6:133:9597:28:37:72:450:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:terms of long-term abnormal returns in the one, two, and three year windows.  
6:134:9674:37:28:72:543:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider the motivation for using the 
6:135:9763:28:27:72:542:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dynamic  causal  relation  between returns and  stock  repurchases as the proxy  for  information 
6:136:9859:27:28:72:543:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry in stock repurchases. In Section 3, we describe the data and methodology. In Section 
6:137:9954:28:38:72:386:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:4, we present the empirical evidence. In Section 5, we conclude.  
6:138:10018:38:37:72:306:219:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2. Information Asymmetry and Repurchases  
6:139:10058:37:28:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  literature  evaluating  the  ability  of  managers  to  time  repurchases  assumes  firm 
6:140:10152:28:27:72:543:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  asymmetry  that  requires  the  manager  to  signal  full  information  to  the  market. The 
6:141:10258:27:28:72:543:127:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market, which is aware of the information asymmetry, responds positively to the announcement 
6:142:10350:28:0:72:542:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of share repurchases. The explicit link between information asymmetry and the market response 
7:143:10445:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  share  repurchases  has received  less  attention. Chan  et  al.  (2004) find  that  small firms are 
7:144:10549:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:associated   with larger   announcement   abnormal   returns   relative   to   large   firms   upon   the 
7:145:10654:28:27:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement of  a repurchase program. However, they focus on firm size as a proxy for likely 
7:146:10747:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:misvaluation  as  opposed  to  information  asymmetry.  As  the  literature  has  used firm size 
7:147:10844:28:27:72:542:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Vermaelen, 1981; Corwin, 2003; Zhang, 2006) as a proxy for information asymmetry, it may be 
7:148:10934:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inferred  that  firms  with  greater  information  asymmetry show a  relatively  larger  announcement 
7:149:11035:28:28:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:return. However, firm size is not a direct measure of whether or not the repurchasing firm truly 
7:150:11132:28:37:72:452:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:possessed information not contained in the price at the time of the repurchase.  
7:151:11212:37:28:108:543:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Similarly, the literature has used the dispersion of analyst forecasts (Babenko et al., 2012; 
7:152:11304:28:27:72:542:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Krishnaswami and Subramaniam, 1999; Diether et al., 2002) and the number of analysts following 
7:153:11398:27:28:72:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the firm (Chang et al., 2000; Hong et al., 2000; Bushman et al., 2004; Zhang, 2006; Babenko et 
7:154:11492:28:28:72:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:al., 2012) as proxies for information asymmetry. These measures are also not a direct measure of 
7:155:11586:28:27:72:543:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whether or not a given repurchase contains information not possessed by the market. The preferred 
7:156:11684:27:28:72:542:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:way to identify truly informed repurchases is by examining the return performance of repurchasing 
7:157:11782:28:37:72:274:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms – which is the focus of this paper.    
7:158:11824:37:28:108:542:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There can be some concerns about using stock returns following repurchases to establish 
7:159:11911:28:27:72:542:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  asymmetry  or  to  identify  which  repurchases are truly  informed.  For  instance,  it  is 
7:160:12016:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:possible that the positive performance used to establish information asymmetry is due to factors 
7:161:12112:28:28:72:542:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not  signaled  by  the  repurchase,  in  which  case  using the performance  would  yield  a potentially 
7:162:12217:28:27:72:542:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:biased identification  of  an informed  repurchase.  Similarly,  it  is  plausible  that  a  firm  correctly 
7:163:12324:27:28:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:signals undervaluation via a repurchase announcement, but the market does not correct the price 
7:164:12419:28:0:72:543:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in time for our measure to capture the correction. In short, our measure may commit both Type I 
8:165:12516:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Type  II  errors in  establishing  informed  repurchases. However,  given  that  our  information 
8:166:12618:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry proxy is based on a statistical test from causality regressions, the results are unlikely 
8:167:12718:28:27:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to be systematically biased. In order to alleviate this concern, we relate our information asymmetry 
8:168:12817:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure to long-term abnormal returns, in addition to short-term abnormal returns, which capture 
8:169:12913:28:37:72:512:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:post announcement performance and control for systemic factors which may drive returns.  
8:170:13000:37:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: There  may  be  other  problems  with  our  approach. It  may  be  argued  that  if  markets  are 
8:171:13098:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:efficient,  then  announcement  abnormal  returns  should  correctly  signal  which  repurchases  are 
8:172:13200:28:27:72:542:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:informed. However, the literature has established a post-repurchase announcement drift that would 
8:173:13298:27:28:72:542:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:suggest  that  using  the  announcement  abnormal  returns may  be a  poor  proxy  for  information 
8:174:13397:28:27:72:543:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry  (Ikenberry  et  al.,  1995; Grullon  and  Michaely,  2004; Chan  et  al.  2004).  Chan  et  al. 
8:175:13502:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:C:(2004) note that “the evidence, however, indicates that the initial market reaction is not a good 
8:176:13600:28:28:72:542:395:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:predictor  of  long-term abnormal performance.” This statement is related to their results which 
8:177:13697:28:27:72:542:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:suggest that the initial market reaction is not only incomplete, but actually unrelated to subsequent 
8:178:13799:27:28:72:543:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:return performance. Overall, the literature suggests that the market does not, on average, price the 
8:179:13900:28:38:72:503:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information of repurchase announcements immediately at the time of the announcement.  
8:180:13984:38:37:72:204:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:3. Data and Methodology 
8:181:14007:37:28:72:542:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Data  on  open  market  share  repurchases  is  from  SDC  Platinum.  We  collect data  on  all 
8:182:14103:28:27:72:543:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announced  share  repurchases  from  1980-2012.  For  each  repurchase,  we  identify  the  date  of  the 
8:183:14209:27:28:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement and the size of the announced repurchase. Following Grullon and Michaely (2004) 
8:184:14302:28:27:72:542:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Babenko et al. (2012), we do not exclude financial firms from our sample. We construct two 
8:185:14396:27:28:72:542:127:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measures of repurchases. The first is a simple indicator which is equal to one if there is a repurchase 
8:186:14499:28:0:72:543:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announced in a given month and is zero otherwise. The second, which is consistent with Babenko 
9:187:14595:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:et al. (2012), is the dollar value of the repurchase divided by the market value of the firm. Using 
9:188:14693:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the dollar value of the repurchase rather than the  number of shares is due  to data availability in 
9:189:14793:28:27:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:SDC Platinum. Specifically, the dollar value of the repurchase is nearly always reported (roughly 
9:190:14891:27:38:72:528:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:90% reporting) while the number of shares sought is rarely reported (less than 25% reporting). 
9:191:14985:38:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: We then link the sample of repurchasing firms to CRSP in order to obtain firm stock return 
9:192:15076:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and market capitalization data. We obtain return data over the period from 1980-2012. Event study 
9:193:15173:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are calculated following Babenko et al. (2012). Specifically, 
9:194:15269:28:27:72:543:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we use a market model approach with an estimation window of (-252 to -44) and a three-day event 
9:195:15365:27:28:72:542:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:window of (-1 to +1) to construct CAR. CAR is the difference between the observed return and 
9:196:15458:28:37:72:289:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:predicted return based on the market model.  
9:197:15501:37:28:108:543:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Our  repurchase  sample  is  linked  to Fama  and  French  (1993) factors  for  our  long-term 
9:198:15595:28:27:72:543:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abnormal return calculation. Post-repurchase  announcement  long-term  abnormal  returns  are 
9:199:15689:27:28:72:543:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:calculated following Peyer and Vermaelen (2009) by using the Fama-French (1993) three-factor 
9:200:15781:28:28:72:543:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model. We form equally-weighted calendar time portfolios for firms repurchasing in the past 12, 
9:201:15877:28:27:72:542:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:24, or 36 months depending on the horizon of interest. We then run the following regression for 
9:202:15973:27:40:72:241:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the time series of portfolio returns: 
9:203:16010:40:39:72:542:235:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:B:            (푅푖,푡−푅푓,푡)= 훼푗+푏푗(푅푚,푡−푅푓,푡)+푐푗푆푀퐵푡+푑푗퐻푀퐿푡+휀푖,푡,                                   (1) 
9:204:16096:39:29:72:542:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where 푅푖,푡 is the monthly return of firm i in calendar month t. 푅푓,푡 and 푅푚,푡 are the risk-free rate 
9:205:16193:29:28:72:543:167:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(one-month  T-Bill)  and  the  return  on  the market  (equally  weighted  CRSP  return  index) for 
9:206:16292:28:0:72:542:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:calendar  month t,  respectively. 푆푀퐵푡 and 퐻푀퐿푡 are  the  return  on  the  size  and  book-to-market 
10:207:16392:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:factors  in  calendar  month t,  respectively. Portfolios  are  formed  for  the  full  sample  as  well  as 
10:208:16501:28:37:72:399:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:numerous bifurcations based on information asymmetry proxies.   
10:209:16563:37:28:108:542:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In Table 1 we report summary statistics for the size of the repurchase (repurchase dollar 
10:210:16653:28:28:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:value  divided  by  firm  market  value),  the  value  of  the  repurchase  (in  millions  of dollars), the 
10:211:16759:28:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement CAR, the number of analysts following the firm close to the time of the repurchase 
10:212:16855:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement, and the dispersion of analyst forecasts close to the time of the announcement. We 
10:213:16950:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:document that the average repurchase announcement is for 8.59% of total firm market value,  has 
10:214:17045:28:27:72:543:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a  value  of  $168.38  million  and  an  announcement  CAR  of  2.77%.  We  note that  we  are  able  to 
10:215:17150:27:28:72:540:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:calculate  announcement  abnormal  returns  for  8,859 repurchase  announcements over  the  1990-
10:216:17245:28:27:72:542:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2012 period.  We  compare  this  to  other  studies  and  find  that  our  sample  is  consistent  with  prior 
10:217:17355:27:28:72:542:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:work. For instance, Babenko et al. (2012) find 5,827 announcements over the period 1993-2008. 
10:218:17449:28:28:72:542:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Over this same period, we find a very similar number of deals (6,128) despite the fact that we do 
10:219:17547:28:27:72:543:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not  explicitly  follow  their  filtering  criteria.  Differences  between  sample  size  in  Babenko  et  al. 
10:220:17658:27:28:72:543:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2012) and our paper are due to our paper including more years, both before and after the period 
10:221:17755:28:37:72:208:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examined in Babenko et al.  
10:222:17781:37:28:108:542:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We find mean and median event (event days -1 to +1) cumulative abnormal returns in Table 
10:223:17870:28:27:72:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1 of 2.77% and 1.78%, respectively, which are both statistically significant at the 1% level. The 
10:224:17968:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement CAR in Table 1 is consistent with Grullon and Michaely (2004) who find mean and 
10:225:18059:28:28:72:542:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:median CAR over the same three day window (-1 to +1) of 2.71% and 1.82%, respectively, over 
10:226:18147:28:27:72:542:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the 1980 to 1997 period. The number of analysts is available for 6,518 repurchase announcements 
10:227:18243:27:28:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and the dispersion of analyst forecasts is available for 5,600 repurchase announcements (compared 
10:228:18341:28:0:72:543:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to 8,859 repurchases for which we can calculate CAR). We later use the median number of analysts 
11:229:18440:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(five)  and  analyst  dispersion  (4%)  to  bifurcate  our  sample  into  low  and  high  information 
11:230:18542:28:38:72:382:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry groups for long-term abnormal returns calculations.

11:232:18625:37:28:72:543:606:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In the appendix, we discuss potential information asymmetry between inside managers and 
11:233:18713:28:27:72:542:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outside investors and how to test this information asymmetry by applying Sims’ (1972) two-sided 
11:234:18809:27:28:72:543:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regression based causality test. By using this test and considering different degrees of information 
11:235:18910:28:28:72:543:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry, we can tell whether inside managers indeed have information advantages over outside 
11:236:19004:28:37:72:121:495:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investors. 
11:237:19014:37:28:72:542:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Based on the discussions in the appendix (see Proposition 1, equations (A.11) and (A.12)), 
11:238:19104:28:27:72:542:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Granger  causality in  (A.11),  which  is  based  on the  two-sided  regression by Sims  (1972, 
11:239:19203:27:28:72:542:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Theorem  2), can  be  tested  based  on  the usual  (equivalent)  one-sided  Granger-causality  tests in 
11:240:19306:28:28:72:543:375:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:(A.12).  Therefore, we investigate the relationship between monthly returns and manager’s share 
11:241:19402:28:27:72:543:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase announcements using the following  regression, where the inclusion of lagged values 
11:242:19493:27:27:72:507:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of market returns helps us to control for potential feedback in share repurchase decisions:  
11:243:19583:27:39:72:539:293:11:g_d0_f10:11:Times New Roman:F:                              푅푡=훾+∑훼푗푅푡−푗+∑푏푗푅퐸푃푡−푗푚푗=1푚푗=1+휂푡,                                                               (2) 
11:244:19682:39:28:72:543:254:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where 푅푡 is  the  monthly  return  for  a  given  firm  in  month  t  from  CRSP. 푅퐸푃푡 is  the  repurchase 
11:245:19787:28:27:72:542:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variable for a given firm in month t which is measured either as an indicator or as a percent of the 
11:246:19888:27:28:72:543:199:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firm to be repurchased. Specifically, REP is an indicator equal to one if the current month contains 
11:247:19989:28:27:72:543:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a repurchase and is zero otherwise. REP% is the percent of the firm to be repurchased in a given 
11:248:20086:27:28:72:543:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:month and is equal to the dollar value of the repurchase divided by the market value of the firm in 
11:249:20186:28:0:72:149:116:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a given month.  
12:250:20203:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: To make inferences about potential information asymmetry, we analyze the characteristics 
12:251:20292:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  the  coefficients. Since  this  causality  test  can  be  interpreted  as  being  based  on  information 
12:252:20401:28:27:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry as discussed above (or as in the appendix), we interpret a finding of a causal relation 
12:253:20498:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  share  repurchase  to  market  return  as  evidence  of  share  repurchase  decisions based  on 
12:254:20600:28:27:72:543:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information asymmetry. Based on the discussions in the appendix, we test whether the individual 
12:255:20696:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficients  of  lagged repurchases are  zero  to  see  whether  share  repurchases  Granger-cause 
12:256:20795:28:38:72:441:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:returns.  Share repurchase, REP, is said to Granger-cause return if we reject: 
12:257:20873:38:28:77:222:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: H0: 푏푗= 0, for all j in (2). 
12:258:20899:28:28:72:543:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  other  words, the share  repurchase,  REP, Granger-causes returns if  lagged REP can  predict 
12:259:20995:28:30:72:543:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:current returns, controlling for past returns. If the null H0: 푏푗= 0, for all j in (2) is rejected, we find 
12:260:21101:30:27:72:543:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence of market timing using the share repurchase, REP. This specification also allows us to 
12:261:21197:27:28:72:543:392:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:test the net (cumulative) effect of lagged share repurchase on market returns. Specifically, we test: 
12:262:21297:28:14:72:75:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
12:263:21297:14:43:77:208:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: H0 : ∑푏푗푚푗=1= 0 in (2), 
12:264:21318:43:28:72:542:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which allows  us  to  test  for  the  sign  of  the  causal  relation. If  we  find  the net  effect  (sum  of 
12:265:21428:28:30:72:543:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficients, ∑푏푗푚푗=1)  is  significantly positive,  the  sign  of  the  causation  is  consistent  with  the 
12:266:21537:30:27:72:543:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expectation that managers increase share repurchases in anticipation of an increase in stock return 
12:267:21634:27:28:72:177:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(i.e., market timing).  
12:268:21657:28:28:108:540:194:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As  discussed  above,  our  measure  of  information  asymmetry  is originally based  on  two-
12:269:21751:28:27:72:543:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sided causality regression (i.e., equation (A.11) in the appendix) developed by Sims (1972). Our 
12:270:21847:27:28:72:542:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time-series model acknowledges information asymmetry between potentially informed managers 
12:271:21938:28:0:72:543:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  other  uninformed  investors.  In  this  situation,  repurchase  announcements  may  contain 
13:272:22038:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  about  future  stock  returns.  Our  model  ultimately  tests  the  predictive power  of 
13:273:22139:28:37:72:425:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase announcements, which we equate to information asymmetry.  
13:274:22206:37:28:108:542:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The causality regression in (2) is conducted for each firm in the sample and as such, 8,859 
13:275:22298:28:28:72:542:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(7,781)  individual  regressions  are  run  using  REP  (REP%) over  the  full  time  series  of  available 
13:276:22405:28:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:returns. An F-test of the significance of the lagged repurchase terms is conducted and the p-value 
13:277:22504:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of this test is used to determine the predictive power of repurchase announcements. If the p-value 
13:278:22603:28:28:72:542:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for an individual regression is less than 0.05, we conclude that the repurchase announcement is 
13:279:22698:28:27:72:543:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:predictive  of  future  returns.  The predictive  power based  on  the p-value is  then  interpreted  as  a 
13:280:22805:27:38:72:250:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure of information asymmetry.  
13:281:22839:38:27:108:543:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Informed  repurchases indicate  the presence of information  asymmetry at  the  time  of  the 
13:282:22931:27:28:72:542:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase  announcement. This  approach  differs  from  other  information  asymmetry  measures 
13:283:23027:28:27:72:543:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such  as firm size and  those  based  on  analysts (e.g.,  number  of  analysts  following,  and  analyst 
13:284:23131:27:28:72:542:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:forecast dispersion). While a priori information asymmetry proxies have the advantage of yielding 
13:285:23228:28:28:72:542:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:predictions and possibly tradable results, they are limited in the sense that they capture relatively 
13:286:23330:28:27:72:543:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crude elements of information asymmetry. For example, a small firm may indeed have a relatively 
13:287:23423:27:28:72:542:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:high degree of information asymmetry, but that fact does not speak to the relative valuation of that 
13:288:23524:28:27:72:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firm.  Thus, all  repurchases  by  small  firms  are not necessarily  true  signals  of  undervaluation  or 
13:289:23632:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other relevant inside information that would alleviate information asymmetry issues. In fact, the 
13:290:23728:28:28:72:543:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:credibility of repurchase announcements has received considerable scrutiny in the literature.3 Our 
13:291:23826:28:27:72:543:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure has the advantage of providing a more specific measure of information asymmetry that is 
13:292:23920:27:36:72:542:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:related to repurchase   announcements. Specifically,   we   determine   which   share   repurchase 
13:293:24018:36:9:72:218:101:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
13:294:24076:9:0:72:236:92:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:3 See for example Babenko et al. (2012). 
14:295:24117:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcements are ultimately  predictive of  positive  future  return  performance and  thus  are  the 
14:296:24219:28:38:72:408:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:most likely cases of relatively high levels of information asymmetry.  
14:297:24288:38:37:72:124:643:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:4. Results 
14:298:24298:37:28:72:543:606:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In  order  to  establish  which  repurchase  announcements  involve  firms  with  a  relatively 
14:299:24394:28:27:72:542:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:higher level of information asymmetry, we use firm-by-firm causality regressions of returns and 
14:300:24488:27:28:72:543:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchases as discussed in Section 3. A summary of the results from these regressions is provided 
14:301:24587:28:38:72:129:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in Table 2.  
14:302:24599:38:27:72:543:485:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In Panel A of Table 2, we regress current period returns on six month lagged returns and 
14:303:24687:27:28:72:542:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:six month lagged REP (i.e., m = 6 in equation (2)), which is an indicator equal to one if the month 
14:304:24785:28:27:72:543:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contained a repurchase announcement and is zero otherwise. There were 8,883 firms repurchasing 
14:305:24879:27:28:72:540:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:during the 1990-2012 period for which we were able to conduct this test. The mean and median p-
14:306:24973:28:28:72:543:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:values for the effect of the coefficients on the lagged repurchase terms on current returns are 0.62 
14:307:25071:28:27:72:542:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  0.71,  respectively.  Thus,  the  mean  and  median  repurchase  announcement  is  relatively 
14:308:25170:27:28:72:543:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:uninformed.  In  fact,  only 798 out  of  8,883 repurchase  announcements are  found  to  have  a 
14:309:25265:28:27:72:542:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistically significant (at a minimum of the 5% level) predictive ability for lagged repurchases on 
14:310:25366:27:28:72:542:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:current returns. Similarly, Dittmar and Field (2013) find that the majority of repurchases are not 
14:311:25465:28:38:72:236:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:able to time firm undervaluation.  
14:312:25499:38:37:255:359:199:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:[Insert Table 2 Here] 
14:313:25520:37:28:72:542:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In Panel B of Table 2, we use REP% as the repurchase variable of interest. REP% is the 
14:314:25606:28:27:72:543:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dollar  amount  of  the  announced  repurchase  program  divided  by  the  market  value  of  the  firm. 
14:315:25711:27:0:72:543:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:REP%  is  commonly  used  in  the  literature  and  may  better  capture  the  relative  size  of  the 
15:316:25816:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase.4 This in  turn may  provide  more specific indications  of  the information  contained  in 
15:317:25918:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the repurchase announcement. Specifically, one would expect that firms repurchasing a relatively 
15:318:26015:28:37:72:533:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:larger proportion of themselves have relatively more information about the value of their firms. 
15:319:26111:37:28:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The results in Panel B of Table 2 indicate similar predictive ability of repurchases for future 
15:320:26207:28:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:returns to the  results  in  Panel  A  of  Table  2.  The  mean  and  median  p-values are 0.64 and  0.76, 
15:321:26311:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respectively.  Additionally, 679 of  the  7,779 firms  examined  in  Panel  B  of Table  2  are  found  to 
15:322:26416:28:28:72:542:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have a significant effect of lagged repurchases on current returns.5 The results of Panel B verify 
15:323:26514:28:37:72:268:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that most repurchases are not informed.  
15:324:26554:37:28:72:542:468:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: While Table 2 establishes a measure of firm-level information asymmetry for repurchase 
15:325:26641:28:27:72:543:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcements, it does not address the market reaction at the time of the announcement. To the 
15:326:26735:27:28:72:543:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extent that efficient markets correctly identify repurchase announcements with the most credible 
15:327:26832:28:28:72:543:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:signals (i.e., those involving firms with the highest levels of information asymmetry), we would 
15:328:26928:28:37:72:549:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expect that our information asymmetry measure and abnormal returns would be positively related.   
15:329:27024:37:28:108:543:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We examine event CARs for repurchasing firms based on levels of information asymmetry 
15:330:27110:28:27:72:542:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  Table  3.  Each  repurchasing  firm  is  grouped into  either  the  informed  or  uninformed  category 
15:331:27217:27:28:72:543:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:based on the p-value from firm-level regressions in Table 2. The informed group contains all firms 
15:332:27316:28:28:72:542:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with p-values less than 0.05 from the causality regressions. Panel A of Table 3 presents the results 
15:333:27415:28:27:72:542:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  tests of  differences  in  mean  CAR  for  repurchasing  firms  based  on whether  or  not  the 
15:334:27514:27:28:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchasing firm is classified as informed. We find, regardless of which definition of repurchase 
15:335:27613:28:30:72:542:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we use, abnormal returns are higher for informed firms than for uninformed firms. The difference 
15:336:27710:30:9:72:218:124:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
15:337:27768:9:11:72:236:115:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:4 See for example Babenko et al. (2012). 
15:338:27807:11:15:72:542:104:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:5 The difference in sample size between Panel A and Panel B of Table 2 is due to the availability of the dollar value 
15:339:27923:15:0:72:178:89:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:of repurchases from SDC. 
16:340:27949:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in CAR for the event window is 0.57% and 1.02% for REP and REP%, respectively. Thus, firms 
16:341:28040:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  greater  information  asymmetry show higher  announcement  returns. This  suggests  that  the 
16:342:28139:28:27:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market correctly identifies such firms at the time of the announcement. We compare our results to 
16:343:28236:27:28:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:those  of  Dittmar  and  Field  (2013)  who examine  repurchase  announcement  returns  based  on 
16:344:28334:28:27:72:543:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information asymmetry as measured by analyst following and dispersion measures. They find that 
16:345:28429:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms with greater information asymmetry are more likely to repurchase at relatively low prices, 
16:346:28525:28:38:72:500:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which may explain the relatively more positive market reaction to such announcements.  
16:347:28611:38:37:273:377:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:[Insert Table 3 Here] 
16:348:28632:37:28:108:542:468:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  Panel  B  of  Table  3, we  conduct  the  same  analysis  except  that we now  focus only  on 
16:349:28729:28:27:72:542:440:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:B:“small” firms, which we define as firms with below median market value for the sample.6 Firm 
16:350:28820:27:28:72:542:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size has been used frequently as a proxy for information asymmetry in the literature previously 
16:351:28915:28:27:72:542:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Vermaelen,  1981; Corwin,  2003; Zhang,  2006).  If firm size completely  captures  elements  of 
16:352:29011:27:28:72:542:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information asymmetry related to repurchases, then splitting on firm size alone may be enough to 
16:353:29108:28:28:72:543:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identify informed repurchases. However, if further splitting the sample based on our information 
16:354:29205:28:27:72:542:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry measure yields  a significant  difference  in  announcement  returns  between  the  two 
16:355:29302:27:28:72:543:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:groups, then it suggests  that  our  proxy  captures  information  asymmetry  which  is  particularly 
16:356:29402:28:27:72:542:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:related to repurchases. We find that the result of Panel A of Table 3 is even stronger in Panel B. 
16:357:29501:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Specifically, the announcement return is 1.21% and 1.42% higher for informed repurchases using 
16:358:29595:28:91:72:543:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:REP and REP%, respectively, in the sample using only relatively smaller firms, which are between 
16:359:29689:91:9:72:218:101:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
16:360:29747:9:0:72:336:92:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:6 The median market capitalization in our sample is $224 million. 
17:361:29813:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:roughly 40% and 100% larger than the difference in CAR in Panel A. This finding suggests that 
17:362:29906:28:37:72:480:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firm size may not completely capture information asymmetry related to repurchases. 
17:363:29988:37:28:108:542:644:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:A:In Panel C of Table 3, we focus only on “large” firms, those with above median market 
17:364:30073:28:28:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:value for our sample. As hypothesized in Panel B, it may be that firm size captures the relevant 
17:365:30170:28:27:72:542:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:portions of information asymmetry related to repurchases. However, it may also be true that firm 
17:366:30267:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size fails to completely capture information asymmetry in this context. The results in Panel C of 
17:367:30365:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Table 3 indicate no significant difference between announcement returns based on our informed 
17:368:30458:28:27:72:542:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicator for large firms, regardless of the repurchase measure used. Thus, at least amongst larger 
17:369:30558:27:28:72:543:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms, our information asymmetry proxy does not contribute additional understanding relative to a 
17:370:30654:28:37:72:201:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:simple firm size measure.  
17:371:30680:37:28:108:542:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Overall, this result is perhaps not surprising. To the extent that information amongst larger 
17:372:30774:28:27:72:543:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms is relatively more homogenous than the dispersion for smaller firms, our results in Panels B 
17:373:30873:27:28:72:542:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  C  are  expected. It  is  also  possible  that  larger  firms  are  relatively  more  likely  to  undertake 
17:374:30986:28:28:72:543:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchases for reasons other than undervaluation or other information signaling. This is consistent 
17:375:31087:28:27:72:543:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the fact that announcement returns are substantially lower (i.e., far less than half) across the 
17:376:31189:27:28:72:542:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:board  for  larger  firms  relative  to  smaller  firms. The  larger  announcement  returns  for  smaller 
17:377:31294:28:27:72:542:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchasing  firms  is  consistent  with  Chan  et  al.  (2004). Thus,  the  market  in  general  is  less 
17:378:31401:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:optimistic  about  the  large  firm  repurchase  announcement, which  may  be  due  to  less new 
17:379:31497:28:28:72:542:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  being  generated  by  such  an  announcement. Still,  our causality regression  approach 
17:380:31597:28:27:72:543:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicates that roughly 8% of large firm repurchases (using REP%) are informed and the market 
17:381:31688:27:0:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:does  not  capture  this  at  the  time  of  the  announcement. The  literature  frequently  uses measures 
18:382:31795:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:based on analysts as proxies for information asymmetry. We do not focus on these proxies in Table 
18:383:31892:28:37:72:425:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:3, but control for them explicitly in the regressions to follow in Table 4.   
18:384:31968:37:28:108:542:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Table  4  presents  regressions similar  in  spirit  to  the  analysis  in  Table  3.  Specifically,  we 
18:385:32073:28:28:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:present  regression  results  which  use event  CARs  as  the  dependent  variable.  The  explanatory 
18:386:32174:28:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables include informed indicators, REP and REP%. The Informed (REP) or Informed (REP%) 
18:387:32261:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicates  if  the  informed  indicator  is  based  on  a  repurchase  indicator  or  the  relative  size  of  the 
18:388:32376:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase.  REP  is  an  indicator  equal  to  one  if  the  current  month  contains  a  repurchase 
18:389:32478:28:27:72:542:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement and is equal to zero otherwise. REP% is the percent of the firm to be repurchased 
18:390:32573:27:28:72:543:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in a given month and is equal to the dollar value of the repurchase divided by the market value of 
18:391:32672:28:27:72:543:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the firm in a given month. We control for the size of the repurchase (REP%), firm size (Size), the 
18:392:32768:27:28:72:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:number of analysts following, and the dispersion of analyst forecasts. In short, we test the relation 
18:393:32869:28:28:72:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between our information asymmetry proxy and announcement abnormal returns after controlling 
18:394:32961:28:37:72:332:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for other traditional information asymmetry proxies.   
18:395:33014:37:38:273:377:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:[Insert Table 4 Here] 
18:396:33035:38:27:108:542:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Consistent with the difference in means tests in Table 3, the results in Table 4 indicate that 
18:397:33130:27:28:72:542:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  informed indicator  is  positively  related  to  CAR  in all  12  specifications (significant  at  a 
18:398:33234:28:28:72:543:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:minimum  of  the  10%  level),  regardless  of  the  definition  of  informed (i.e., Informed (REP)  or 
18:399:33337:28:27:72:543:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Informed (REP%)) or  the  control  variables  included.  We  find  that repurchase  size (REP%) is 
18:400:33432:27:28:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positively related to announcement CARs (significant at the 1% level in all specifications in which 
18:401:33532:28:27:72:543:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it is included). Firm size (Size) is negatively related to announcement CARs (at the 1% level in all 
18:402:33631:27:28:72:542:127:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specifications  in  which  it  is  included). Consistent  with  Table  3,  this  suggests  that  smaller  firms 
18:403:33743:28:0:72:543:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:show, on average, a higher announcement CAR than larger firms. However, the inclusion of firm 
19:404:33838:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size (Size) does not mute the significance of our information asymmetry  proxy. The number of 
19:405:33931:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysts  is  negatively  related  to  announcement  CARs  (at  a  minimum  of  5%  level  in  all 
19:406:34030:28:27:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specifications in which it is included). Thus, consistent with other information asymmetry proxies, 
19:407:34130:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we find that firms with lower information asymmetry (i.e., higher number of analysts following) 
19:408:34226:28:27:72:543:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:show lower announcement CARs. Finally, we find that the coefficient on analyst dispersion is not 
19:409:34323:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistically significant. In specifications (11) and (12), we include repurchase size (REP%) and all 
19:410:34423:28:28:72:542:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information asymmetry proxies (firm size (Size), number of analysts and analyst dispersion) and 
19:411:34517:28:27:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:our  measure  of  informed  repurchases  remains  significant  at  the  5%  level.  The  economic 
19:412:34615:27:28:72:542:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interpretation  in  specifications  (11)  and  (12)  indicates  that  informed  repurchases show a  0.76% 
19:413:34720:28:27:72:543:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and 0.94% higher CAR, respectively, after controlling for other information asymmetry proxies. 
19:414:34815:27:28:72:543:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Thus, it does not appear that traditional information asymmetry proxies subsume our repurchase 
19:415:34910:28:38:72:280:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specific information asymmetry measure.   
19:416:34950:38:27:108:542:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In   addition   to   the size   of   the   repurchase program,   the   frequency   of   repurchase 
19:417:35048:27:28:72:542:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcements may also drive the results documented to this point. This is based on Jagannathan 
19:418:35143:28:27:72:543:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Stephens  (2003)  and Dittmar and  Field  (2013), who  note  that  the  motivations  of  frequent 
19:419:35245:27:28:72:542:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchasers  may  differ  from  less  frequent  repurchasers.  Specifically, Dittmar  and  Field  (2013) 
19:420:35351:28:28:72:543:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:find that firms who repurchase at a higher frequency are not motivated by undervaluation and do 
19:421:35446:28:27:72:543:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not purchase at relatively low prices. In their analysis of information asymmetry, Dittmar and Field 
19:422:35546:27:0:72:543:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2013) find  that  firms  with  greater  information  asymmetry  are  better  able  to  purchase  at  lower 
20:423:35656:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices. This suggests that firms that repurchase less frequently are relatively better informed.7 We 
20:424:35755:28:37:72:188:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:confirm this in Table 5. 
20:425:35779:37:28:108:543:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In Table 5 we find the CAR drops as the number of repurchase announcements increases. 
20:426:35865:28:28:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For instance, the mean CAR for a firm with only one repurchase announcement in the sample is 
20:427:35958:28:27:72:542:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:3.24% compared to a CAR of 1.58% for firms repurchasing four times in the sample period. Thus, 
20:428:36053:27:38:72:453:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms that announce repurchases more often have less informative repurchases. 
20:429:36129:38:38:273:377:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:[Insert Table 5 Here] 
20:430:36150:38:27:108:542:485:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In Table 6 we run regressions in which announcement CAR is the dependent variable, and 
20:431:36236:27:28:72:543:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase  informed  status  (Informed  (REP)  or  Informed  (REP%)),  repurchase  size  (REP%), 
20:432:36334:28:27:72:542:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase  frequency, and traditional  measures of  firm  information asymmetry (i.e.,  firm  size 
20:433:36431:27:28:72:543:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Size), the number of analysts following, and the dispersion of analyst forecasts) are explanatory 
20:434:36528:28:28:72:543:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables. Consistent with Table 5, we find that the frequency of repurchase is negatively related 
20:435:36627:28:27:72:543:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to announcement  CARs in  specifications  (1)  and  (2). However,  the  inclusion  of  firm  size,  the 
20:436:36729:27:28:72:543:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:number of analysts and the dispersion of analyst forecasts eliminates the significance of repurchase 
20:437:36830:28:27:72:543:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:frequency.  Finally,  including  the  frequency  of  repurchase (and  including  other  information 
20:438:36928:27:28:72:542:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry  proxies) does  not  change  the  relation  between  our  informed  indicator  and  CARs. 
20:439:37027:28:28:72:543:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Specifically, consistent  with  Tables  3  and  4,  the  informed  indicator  is  positively  related  to 
20:440:37133:28:27:72:543:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:announcement  CARs even  after  we  control  for  repurchase  frequency  and  other  traditional 
20:441:37229:27:70:72:232:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information asymmetry proxies.

20:443:37317:8:15:72:529:104:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:7 We note that the frequency of repurchasing in Dittmar and Field (2013) is based on actual repurchases while our 
20:444:37430:15:0:72:354:89:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:measure of repurchase frequency is based on announced repurchases.  
21:445:37499:0:38:273:377:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:[Insert Table 6 Here] 
21:446:37520:38:27:108:542:671:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The analysis to this point has focused on the relation between our information asymmetry 
21:447:37609:27:28:72:540:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:proxy and announcement abnormal returns. In Table 7, we extend this approach to examine long-
21:448:37702:28:28:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:term abnormal returns.8 This analysis is included to address the potential for factors other than the 
21:449:37802:28:27:72:543:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase announcement to drive future performance. For instance, it could be that repurchases 
21:450:37898:27:28:72:543:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  more  likely  during  certain periods  which  are  likely  to  be  associated  with relatively  more 
21:451:38002:28:28:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive future return performance. The use of long-term abnormal returns controls for systemic 
21:452:38098:28:27:72:542:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:factors related to returns.  Long-term abnormal returns are calculated using the Fama and French 
21:453:38193:27:28:72:542:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1993)  three  factors (see  equation  (1)).  We  form  equally  weighted  monthly  calendar-time 
21:454:38290:28:27:72:542:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:portfolios for the full sample and also for bifurcated samples based on information asymmetry. We 
21:455:38388:27:28:72:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:report the average monthly abnormal returns and the t-statistic for the event horizons of months 
21:456:38485:28:37:72:440:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(+1, +12), (+1, +24), and (+1, +36) following Peyer and Vermaelen (2009).  
21:457:38559:37:28:108:543:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We find that for all firms in the sample, the monthly average abnormal returns for the one, 
21:458:38650:28:28:72:543:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:two and three year event horizons are positive and statistically significant. The average monthly 
21:459:38747:28:27:72:543:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abnormal  return  is  0.34%,  0.27%,  and  0.25%,  respectively,  for  the  one,  two  and  three-year 
21:460:38850:27:28:72:542:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:windows. This is consistent with the literature documenting a post repurchase drift anomaly. Next, 
21:461:38949:28:27:72:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we  form  portfolios  based  only  on  firms  in  our  sample  identified  as  informed  based  on  the 
21:462:39053:27:28:72:543:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regressions in Table 2. We find that the average monthly abnormal returns for informed firms are 
21:463:39148:28:9:72:218:192:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
21:464:39206:9:15:72:542:183:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:8 Vermaelen (1981) suggests that under the signaling hypothesis, stock repurchase is a measure to transfer the value 
21:465:39321:15:11:72:542:168:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:of information that only the  management possesses to current stockholders of the firm, and Vermaelen (1981) also 
21:466:39435:11:12:72:542:157:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:provides  evidence  that  abnormal  stock  returns  remain  positive  in  the  long-term.   Chan,  Ikenberry,  Lee,  and  Wang 
21:467:39562:12:11:72:542:145:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:(2010)  argue  that  earnings  quality  can  be  an  indicator  of  false  signaling  in  stock  repurchases,  because  managers 
21:468:39691:11:11:72:542:134:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:sometimes use stock repurchases to manipulate their performance by increasing stock prices. These authors find that 
21:469:39807:11:12:72:542:123:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:firms  with  low  earnings  quality  are  more  likely  to  carry  out  stock  repurchases,  but  the  stock  performance  of  these 
21:470:39940:12:22:72:202:111:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:firms declines in the long-term.  
21:471:39973:22:0:72:74:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F: 
22:472:39975:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1.65%, 0.84%, and 0.63%, respectively, for the one, two and three-year windows – all of which 
22:473:40068:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are significant at the 1% level. Thus, the economic magnitude of the long-term abnormal returns 
22:474:40164:28:27:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is between two and four times greater for the sample of informed repurchases compared to the full 
22:475:40261:27:28:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sample.  Results  are  qualitatively  identical  regardless  of  the  definition  of  informed  repurchases. 
22:476:40370:28:27:72:542:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:These results are perhaps not surprising given that informed repurchases are identified based on 
22:477:40467:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regressions of six month lagged repurchases on future returns. Nonetheless, our  results indicate 
22:478:40565:28:28:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that informed repurchases continue to outperform the market and other uninformed repurchases 
22:479:40658:28:37:72:353:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:up to three years following the repurchase announcement. 
22:480:40714:37:28:108:542:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We repeat the portfolio formation process based on median levels of firm size, number of 
22:481:40803:28:27:72:543:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysts  following, and  analyst  dispersion.  In  each  case,  we  create  two  groups.  One  group  with 
22:482:40910:27:28:72:543:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:high information asymmetry, the other group with low information asymmetry. Only the firm size 
22:483:41005:28:28:72:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bifurcation yields monthly abnormal returns that are greater for the high information asymmetry 
22:484:41101:28:27:72:543:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:group while both analyst variables (i.e., number of analysts following and analyst dispersion) yield 
22:485:41200:27:28:72:542:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  opposite  result  (although  economically  similar).  We  find  that  small  firms show average 
22:486:41301:28:27:72:540:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:monthly abnormal returns of 0.50%, 0.38%, and 0.33%, respectively, for the one, two, and three-
22:487:41396:27:28:72:542:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:year  windows.  While  these  abnormal  returns  are  greater  than  that  of  the full-sample,  they  are 
22:488:41503:28:28:72:543:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between  half  and  one-third  the  size  of  the  abnormal  returns of our  measure  of  informed 
22:489:41602:28:27:72:542:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchases. These  findings  show  that  our  measure  of  information  asymmetry  is  more  strongly 
22:490:41704:27:28:72:543:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:related  to  long-term  abnormal  returns  compared  with  other  traditional  information  asymmetry 
22:491:41806:28:37:72:116:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:proxies.  
22:492:41815:37:0:273:377:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:[Insert Table 7 Here] 
23:493:41838:0:28:108:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Our proposed proxy for information asymmetry is based on causality tests. This proxy may 
23:494:41927:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:be related to other conventional information asymmetry proxies after controlling for repurchase 
23:495:42022:28:27:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size and repurchase frequency. Identifying which, if any, variables are related to our information 
23:496:42119:27:28:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry proxy is potentially useful for two reasons. First, we may identify variables that could 
23:497:42218:28:27:72:542:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:be  used  to  help  predict  informed  repurchases  a  priori.  Second,  examining  the  extent  that  our 
23:498:42325:27:28:72:543:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  asymmetry  measure  is  related  to  other  factors  may  help  establish  the  relative 
23:499:42427:28:38:72:209:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:uniqueness of our measure.  
23:500:42454:38:27:108:542:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  Table 8,  we  examine  the  relation  between  whether  or  not  a  repurchase  is  informed 
23:501:42551:27:28:72:542:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(dependent variable: Informed (REP) or Informed (REP%)) and other variable such as  repurchase 
23:502:42643:28:27:72:542:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size  (REP%), repurchase  frequency, firm size (Size), the  number  of  analysts  following,  and  the 
23:503:42744:27:28:72:542:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dispersion  of  analyst  forecasts.   While  our  informed  indicator  uses  a  measure  of  information 
23:504:42849:28:28:72:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry based on causality tests, the analysis in Table 8 may suggest characteristics of informed 
23:505:42946:28:37:72:260:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchases that are available a priori.  
23:506:42987:37:28:108:542:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The results in Table 8 indicate that repurchase size (REP%) and repurchase frequency are 
23:507:43074:28:27:72:542:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not  related  to  informed  repurchases  when  controlling  for  information  asymmetry  proxies (see 
23:508:43175:27:28:72:543:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:columns (5) and (6)). When using an indicator of a repurchase in a given month, rather than the 
23:509:43271:28:27:72:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relative  size  of  the  repurchase, none  of  the  variables  considered are related  to  the  informed 
23:510:43374:27:28:72:542:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicator (see columns (1) and (3)). However, when the informed indicator is based on the relative 
23:511:43472:28:28:72:543:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size of the repurchase (Informed (REP%)), we find that larger firms (greater analyst dispersion) 
23:512:43567:28:27:72:543:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  negatively  (positively) related to  informed  repurchases (see  column  (6)).  Thus, when  the 
23:513:43665:27:28:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:informed indicator is based on the relative size of the repurchase (Informed (REP%)), firm size 
23:514:43760:28:0:72:542:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and analyst dispersion play a complementary role to this measure of information asymmetry. Both 
24:515:43856:0:28:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firm size and  analyst dispersion are  available at the time of the  repurchase announcement.  This 
24:516:43956:28:28:72:543:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:may  allow  investors  to  correctly  identify  informed  repurchases.  However,  given  the  abnormal 
24:517:44059:28:27:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:return analysis performed above, it does not appear as though the market fully responds to truly 
24:518:44156:27:38:72:187:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:informed repurchases.

24:520:44198:38:37:72:144:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:5. Conclusion 
24:521:44211:37:28:72:543:513:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: While the initial average response to the announcement of an open market share repurchase 
24:522:44301:28:27:72:543:485:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is positive, it is less clear which announcements are true signals of positive future performance. 
24:523:44400:27:28:72:542:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The signals from an open market repurchase announcement may be more credible in the case of 
24:524:44491:28:27:72:543:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms with relatively high levels of information asymmetry. In such a case, the announcement of 
24:525:44587:27:28:72:543:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  repurchase  program  may  bring  the  level  of  information  possessed  by  the  managers  and  the 
24:526:44693:28:38:72:215:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shareholders closer together.  
24:527:44723:38:27:72:542:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: We propose a repurchase specific measure of information asymmetry that is based on time 
24:528:44810:27:28:72:542:310:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:series causality tests due to Granger (1969) and Sims (1972). The resulting information asymmetry 
24:529:44907:28:27:72:543:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure is based on the assumption that if repurchase information predicts future returns, then that 
24:530:45007:27:28:72:542:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repurchase  is  informed. When  we  relate  our  measure  of  information  asymmetry  to  abnormal 
24:531:45105:28:28:72:543:227:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:returns  following  the  announcement  of  open  market  share  repurchases,  we  find  that  they  are 
24:532:45209:28:27:72:543:199:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positively related. Thus, firms with relatively higher levels of information asymmetry are found to 
24:533:45309:27:28:72:543:172:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:be  relatively  more  informed  repurchasers. This  result holds  when  controlling  for  traditional 
24:534:45410:28:27:72:543:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  asymmetry  proxies  such  as  firm  size,  number  of  analysts  following,  and  analyst 
24:535:45513:27:0:72:543:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dispersion.  Thus,  our  information  asymmetry  measure  captures  information  not  contained  in 
25:536:45614:0:28:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:traditional information asymmetry proxies. Finally, we document that our measure of information 
25:537:45710:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetry  is  positively  related  to  long-term  abnormal  returns  for  one,  two,  and  three-year

29:651:51499:22:26:72:522:686:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Empirical model of a test of asymmetric information based on causality tests (Sims test) 
29:652:51587:26:16:90:543:660:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  this  appendix,  we  provide  a simple,  parsimonious  time-series  model  in  which  there  is 
29:653:51687:16:16:72:543:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:potential information asymmetry between informed inside managers and outside investors so that 
29:654:51782:16:15:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:C:we can draw inferences about the market’s reactions to share repurchase announcements. In such 
29:655:51877:15:16:72:542:613:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a case, share repurchase decisions by inside managers may contain (or convey) new information 
29:656:51971:16:16:72:542:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:about  future  stock  returns. In  fact,  some  share  repurchase  decisions  may  be  information  events 
29:657:52077:16:16:72:543:581:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(i.e., forward-looking), while others may be non-information events (i.e., backward-looking) with 
29:658:52175:16:16:72:542:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respect to stock returns. The share repurchase decision will be related to future stock returns when 
29:659:52276:16:16:72:543:549:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it is an informative event under information asymmetry. The idea is that although informed inside 
29:660:52374:16:16:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:managers and uninformed outside investors observe the same financial variables such as current 
29:661:52469:16:16:72:542:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and past stock returns and fundamentals, uninformed outside investors may not fully recover all 
29:662:52565:16:15:72:542:501:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  information  which  informed  inside  managers  use  in  share  repurchase.9 Our  model  is  useful 
29:663:52669:15:16:72:543:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because it provides a regression model that tests the predictive power of share repurchase under 
29:664:52766:16:26:72:235:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:potential information asymmetry. 
29:665:52798:26:16:99:542:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Here,  we  utilize  a  theorem  in  time-series  econometrics,  which  states  that  any  time-series 
29:666:52900:16:16:72:543:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:process has both invertible and non-invertible representations [see Fuller (1976, P. 64-66, Theorem 
29:667:53000:16:16:72:542:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2.6.4)].  Although  stock  returns  may  follow  a  general  ARMA  (autoregressive  moving  average) 
29:668:53101:16:16:72:543:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:process,  for  expositional  simplicity  we  assume  that  uninformed  outside  investors,  observing 
29:669:53203:16:11:72:542:380:12:Times New Roman:8:Times New Roman:B:current and past stock returns, infer a first-order moving average, MA(1), process of the returns:

29:671:53303:31:22:72:532:338:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                 Rt = (1 –  L) ut,         < 1.0 ,                           (A.1) 
29:672:53381:22:17:72:543:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where Rt is the stock return at time t, L is the lag (or backshift) operator (i.e., Ln Rt = Rt-n), and ut 
29:673:53485:17:27:72:546:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is white noise with var(ut) = u2. The autocovariance functions (ACFs) for this return process are:  
29:674:53585:27:25:108:215:272:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:var(Rt) = (1 + 2) u2,

29:679:53744:9:15:72:541:139:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:9 We can capture this intuition in a time-series concept of the non-invertibility of the moving average representation
