2:35:2001:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:This  paper  documents  facts  about  the  state  corporate  tax  structure  |  tax  rates,  base  rules,  and 
2:36:2112:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:credits | and investigates its consequences for state tax revenue and economic activity. We present 
2:37:2211:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:three  main findings.  First,  tax  base  rules  and  credits  explain  more  of  the  variation  in  state 
2:38:2318:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:corporate  tax  revenues than  tax  rates  do.  Second,  although  states  typically  do  not  offset  tax  rate 
2:39:2430:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:changes  with  base  and  credit changes,  the  effects  of  tax  rate  changes  on  tax  revenue  and 
2:40:2532:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:economic  activity  depend  on  the  breadth of  the  base.  Third,  as  states  have  narrowed  their  tax 
2:41:2639:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:A:bases,  the  relationship  between  tax  rates  and  tax revenues  has  diminished.  Overall,  changes  in 
2:42:2745:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:A:state tax bases have made the state corporate tax system more favorable for corporations and are 
2:43:2841:14:42:72:430:462:12:Times:12:Times:A:reducing the extent to which tax rate increases raise corporate tax revenue.

3:59:3217:0:18:63:542:724:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:How states tax businesses has received renewed interest in both academic and policy circles.  Recent work on
3:60:3325:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:state corporate tax rates has investigated their impacts on income growth, employment, and business location.1
3:61:3435:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:However, state policymakers compete to attract businesses not only by changing tax rates, but also by changing
3:62:3545:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the tax base to enhance several investment incentives, loss provisions, and enforcement mechanisms.2There
3:63:3650:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is  a  lack  of  basic  facts  about  the  state  corporate  tax  structure,  its  evolution  over  recent  years,  and  how  it
3:64:3778:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:impacts tax revenue and economic activity.  This paper describes the state corporate tax structure, documents
3:65:3887:18:18:63:542:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:how it has changed over time, and investigates the consequences of these changes for state tax collections and
3:66:3997:18:18:63:141:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:economic activity.
3:67:4015:18:18:78:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Our analysis proceeds in four steps.  We first describe recent trends in state corporate tax structure.3While
3:68:4124:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:average state corporate tax rates have remained relatively stable, state corporate tax revenues as a share of
3:69:4233:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:economic  activity  have  declined  substantially.   Some  of  this  decline  is  due  to  other  factors  (e.g.,  the  rise  of
3:70:4361:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:pass-throughs (Cooper et al., 2016) and corporate losses (Auerbach and Poterba, 1987)),  but we show that
3:71:4466:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax base and credit changes have substantial impacts on state corporate tax collections.  Tax base and credit
3:72:4575:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes are much more frequent than tax rate changes.  Contrary to the view that state tax rate changes are
3:73:4682:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:often accompanied by offsetting changes in the tax base, we find that the vast majority of tax base changes
3:74:4789:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:are not associated with tax rate changes.  Some provisions, such as R&D credits, investment tax credits, and
3:75:4897:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:loss carryforward rules, have become more favorable for corporations while others (e.g., throwback rules and
3:76:5005:18:18:63:273:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:combined reporting) have lead to broader bases.
3:77:5052:18:18:78:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Second, we estimate the importance of each of these tax base rules for state corporate tax collections from
3:78:5159:18:18:63:542:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:1980 and 2010.  We perform analysis of variance decompositions every five years and document the importance
3:79:5266:18:18:63:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of tax base rules, relative to tax rates, in explaining the variation in corporate tax revenue across states and
3:80:5378:18:18:63:542:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:over time.  Overall, tax base components account for the majority of the explained variation in tax revenues.
3:81:5487:18:18:63:542:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This result remains relatively stable throughout most of our sample, with only a slight increase in the fraction
3:82:5599:18:18:63:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:explained by tax rates in 2010.  The importance of different tax base components in explaining tax revenues has
3:83:5710:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:evolved over our sample.  In particular, sales apportionment weights and loss carryback provisions have waned
3:84:5819:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in  importance,  while  franchise  taxes,  different  depreciation  rules,  and  interactions  with  federal  tax  policies,
3:85:5943:18:17:63:542:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:such as adopting the federal tax base or allowing for the deductibility of federal taxes,  have increased their
3:86:6054:17:18:63:183:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:share of explained variance.
3:87:6082:18:18:78:542:222:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Third, we analyze how tax base provisions affect the relationship between state tax rates and two outcomes:
3:88:6189:18:18:63:542:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:state corporate tax revenue and state GDP. This analysis has two parts.  We first explore the degree to which
3:89:6298:18:18:63:542:186:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f4:B:controlling for these tax base provisionsaffects the relationship between tax rates and revenue and GDP. We
3:90:6405:18:15:63:542:168:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:find that, while tax base controls explain a large portion of the variation in revenues, the relationships between
3:91:6519:15:12:77:526:153:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:1Recent papers includeHeider and Ljungqvist(2015),Giroud and Rauh(2015),Su ́arez Serrato and Zidar(2016),Fajgel-
3:92:6631:12:7:63:335:141:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:baum et al.(2015),Ohrn(2016), andLjungqvist and Smolyansky(2014).
3:93:6696:7:12:77:514:134:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:2These tax base rules are important determinants of measures of state business climate indexes (e.g.,Tax Foundation
3:94:6811:12:10:63:528:122:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:(2016)).ALEC(2014) reports that 14 states changed taxes in 2014 with many of the changes affecting both tax rates as well
3:95:6932:10:9:63:81:112:8:g_d0_f8:6:g_d0_f7:F:as tax base determinants.3
3:96:6958:9:10:81:536:103:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:A:The fifteen determinants of the corporate income tax structure that we analyze include tax credits, such as the investment
3:97:7080:10:9:63:542:93:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:tax credit and the R&D tax credit.  For simplicity, we refer to these credits as determinants of the tax base, along with our other
3:98:7211:9:0:63:133:84:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:tax base measures.
4:99:7230:0:18:63:542:724:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax rates and our outcomes of interest are not fundamentally affected by controlling for these tax base measures.
4:100:7343:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This result may be due to the lack of a temporal coincidence between changes to tax rates and determinants
4:101:7449:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of the tax base.  However, even if tax base and rate changes do not occur at the same time, the tax base can
4:102:7557:18:18:63:237:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:influence the effects of tax rate changes.
4:103:7599:18:18:78:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We then explore the extent to whichinteractions between the tax base and tax ratesinduce heterogeneous
4:104:7701:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effects  of  state  corporate  tax  rate  changes.   Intuitively,  when  the  tax  base  is  narrow,  a  tax  rate  increase
4:105:7825:18:18:63:542:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:mechanically raises less revenue since taxable income is a smaller portion of overall income.  In addition, tax
4:106:7936:18:18:63:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes have smaller incentive effects, so the behavioral responses to tax rate increases are likely attenuated.
4:107:8048:18:18:63:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Empirically, we first confirm that states with narrower tax bases collect less revenue from marginal increases
4:108:8158:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in tax rates.  The main finding is about tax-base-driven heterogeneity in the time series.  While some states
4:109:8267:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have broadened the base (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Illinois), we observe narrower tax bases on average over the last
4:110:8379:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:thirty years.  These trends in state tax bases over time have made the state corporate tax system more generous
4:111:8490:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:towards corporations, and are reducing the extent to which increases in tax rates raise corporate tax revenue.
4:112:8600:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:In addition, we find that including interactions between the state tax base and state tax rates also increases
4:113:8710:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE) of state corporate tax rate changes on state corporate tax
4:114:8819:18:18:63:103:455:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:revenue.4
4:115:8828:18:18:78:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We conclude by investigating the implications of these results for revenue-maximizing-state-tax rates and
4:116:8933:18:18:63:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for the claim that state corporate tax rate cuts pay for themselves.5We estimate a regression in which tax rates
4:117:9045:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have linear (β0) and quadratic (δ0) effects on tax revenue.  The revenue-maximizing-state-corporate-tax rate
4:118:9153:18:18:63:542:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:equals the ratio of these effects:β0−2δ0.  The estimate of the quadratic effect (ˆδ0), which measures decreasing
4:119:9265:18:18:63:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:returns  from  tax  rate  increases,  is  not  substantially  larger  than  the  linear  effect  (ˆβ0).   Our  point  estimates
4:120:9392:18:18:63:542:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:imply that the tax rate that maximizes state corporate tax revenue is close to 30 percent.  InSu ́arez Serrato
4:121:9502:18:18:63:542:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and Zidar(2016), we note that state corporate taxes may have fiscal externalities and may affect tax revenue
4:122:9610:18:18:63:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:from sales and personal income taxes.  Even when we allow for this externality by considering total state tax
4:123:9719:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:revenue instead of only corporate tax revenue, our estimates imply a total-state-tax-revenue-maximizing rate
4:124:9827:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of close to 10%.  Since the estimated revenue-maximizing rate is greater than the majority of state corporate
4:125:9936:18:17:63:394:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax rates, we reject the hypothesis that tax cuts tend to pay for themselves.
4:126:10013:17:18:78:542:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This paper contributes to three literatures.  First, relative to recent work on the effects of changes in state
4:127:10124:18:18:63:542:222:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:business tax rates on economic activity (Heider and Ljungqvist(2015),Giroud and Rauh(2015),Su ́arez Serrato
4:128:10231:18:18:63:543:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and Zidar(2016),Fajgelbaum et al.(2015),Ohrn(2016), andLjungqvist and Smolyansky(2014)), we explore
4:129:10330:18:18:63:542:186:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:how the relationships between tax rates and revenues and economic activity depend on the structure of the
4:130:10435:18:18:63:542:168:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:corporate tax system.  A contribution of this paper is the collection and description of a comprehensive set of
4:131:10546:18:15:63:542:150:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:variables that describe the structure of the corporate tax system across all U.S. states since 1980, which we
4:132:10655:15:12:77:535:135:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:4As is well known (Wooldridge,2005;Gibbons, Su ́arez Serrato and Urbancic,2014), in the presence of heterogeneous treat-
4:133:10775:12:10:63:541:123:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:ment effects, regressions that control for the drivers of heterogeneity estimate a weighted-average of the heterogeneous treatment
4:134:10905:10:9:63:539:113:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:effects that may not be a consistent estimate of the average treatment effect.  In this context, the source of heterogeneous effects
4:135:11037:9:7:63:326:104:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:is the tax base.  We discuss treatment effect heterogeneity in Section5.
4:136:11109:7:12:77:528:97:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:5See, for instance, claims by Sam Brownback (Mclean,2017), Thom Tillis (The News & Observer Editorial Board,2017),
4:137:11223:12:10:63:524:85:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:and Mitt Romney (Romney, 2010) for the cases of Kansas, North Carolina, and Massachusetts, respectively, and Rand Paul
4:138:11341:10:0:63:263:75:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:(Kessler,2015) for a similar claim at the federal level.
5:139:11398:0:18:63:542:724:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:hope will aid future researchers in this literature.  In a contemporaneous contribution, Bartik (2017) simulates
5:140:11510:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the tax consequences of locating a new plant in 32 states and 45 industries that cover roughly 90 percent of
5:141:11618:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:U.S.  economic  activity  since  1990.   These  simulations  are  highly  detailed  and  capture  complex  interactions
5:142:11737:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:between  several  rules.   We  view  this  paper  as  highly  complementary  to  ours,  which  takes  a  reduced-form
5:143:11854:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:empirical  approach.   Specifically,  we  do  not  conduct  similar  simulations  at  the  plant  level,  but  do  variance
5:144:11977:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:decompositions of observed state corporate tax revenue as a share of state GDP to understand the quantitative
5:145:12086:18:18:63:542:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:importance of different base provisions for state tax revenue.  Bartik (2017) also documents several facts about
5:146:12198:18:18:63:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes in incentives and finds that business incentives are large,  vary substantially across states,  and have
5:147:12310:18:18:63:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:become increasingly generous.  Consistent with these results, we document substantial variation across states
5:148:12419:18:18:63:445:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and a general narrowing of the base on average in the full panel of 50 states since 1980.
5:149:12508:18:18:78:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Second, this paper is also related to a set of papers that explore whether the tax base affects the relationship
5:150:12620:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:between  corporate  tax  rates  and  corporate  income  tax  revenues.   In  particular,Clausing(2007),Devereux
5:151:12731:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(2007),  andKawano  and  Slemrod(2015)  study  this  relationship  across  29  OECD  member  countries,  and
5:152:12839:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Dahlby  and  Ferede(2012)  perform  a  similar  analysis  across  Canadian  provinces.   We  followKawano  and
5:153:12949:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Slemrod(2015) by collecting a comprehensive set of variables that describe the breadth of the tax base and by
5:154:13058:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:controlling for this tax base vector in our estimations.  In contrast toKawano and Slemrod(2015), who focus
5:155:13165:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:on the international corporate tax structure, we find that state tax rate changes are not often offset by base
5:156:13275:18:18:63:147:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and credit changes.
5:157:13294:18:18:78:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, we find that the relationship between state tax rates and economic activity depends on the structure
5:158:13403:18:18:63:542:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of the tax base.  This point is related to work byKopczuk(2005),  who finds that the elasticity of reported
5:159:13510:18:18:63:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:taxable income for individuals depends on the availability of deductions.  In our setting, this dependence on the
5:160:13623:18:18:63:542:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax base is important for revenue forecasts and assessments of the incidence and efficiency of state corporate
5:161:13733:18:18:63:102:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:taxation.
5:162:13742:18:18:78:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The paper is organized as follows.  Section1 describes the dataset of tax base determinants, and Section2
5:163:13847:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:describes trends in the structure of the state corporate tax system.  Section3 performs the variance decompo-
5:164:13956:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sition analysis, and Section4 explores the effects of controlling for tax base determinants on various outcomes
5:165:14067:18:17:63:542:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of economic interest.  Section5 explores tax-base-driven treatment effect heterogeneity across states and over
5:166:14177:17:18:63:543:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:time, Section6 analyzes the revenue-maximizing-tax rate, and Section7 concludes with a discussion of policy

5:169:14345:28:18:63:542:152:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We  use  fifteen  measures  of  the  corporate  tax  base  for  the  main  analysis  in  the  paper.   Details  on  each  of

6:177:15166:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:an indicator for whether the R&D tax credit applies to an incremental base that is a moving average of past
6:178:15273:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:expenditures, an indicator for whether the R&D tax credit applies to an incremental base that is fixed on a level
6:179:15386:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of past expenditures, the number of years for loss carryback, number of years for loss carryforward, an indicator
6:180:15499:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for franchise taxes, an indicator for federal income tax deductibility, an indicator for federal income tax base as

6:183:15836:18:18:63:165:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:apportionment weights.
6:184:15858:18:18:78:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Most of the variables are indicators of whether a state allows a particular policy.  Throwback and combined
6:185:15965:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reporting rules come fromBernthal et al.(2012) and describe whether a state requires a unitary business to
6:186:16071:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:submit combined reporting and, in the case of throwback rules, whether a state eliminates “nowhere income”
6:187:16177:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that would be untaxed by either the state with the corporation’s nexus or the state in which the relevant sales
6:188:16288:17:18:63:139:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:were being made.
6:189:16304:18:18:78:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Data on state investment tax credits and R&D tax credits come fromChirinko and Wilson(2008),  and
6:190:16401:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Wilson(2009)  provides  the  rate  of  each  of  these  credits.   For  the  R&D  credit,  we  use  the  statutory  credit
6:191:16523:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rate adjusted for recapture and type of credit.  States vary in how they implement R&D tax credits.  States
6:192:16630:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:determine whether the R&D tax credit applies to all qualified expenditures, or whether the base is incremental
6:193:16740:18:18:63:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:based on previous expenditures.  In addition, the basis of previous expenditures may be fixed in time or may
6:194:16848:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:be a moving average of recent activity.  We control for two indicators for whether the base is incremental and
6:195:16958:18:18:63:354:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:fixed, or whether it is incremental and based on a moving average.
6:196:17024:18:18:78:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Loss rules specify the number of years that a corporation may carry back net operating loss prior to the
6:197:17128:18:18:63:542:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:loss as well as the number of years a corporation may carry forward any excess loss following the loss year.  The
6:198:17241:18:18:63:542:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation indicators describe whether a state conforms to federal depreciation rules and adopts federal bonus
6:199:17353:18:18:63:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation  policies  that  accelerate  investment  incentives  (seeZwick  and  Mahon(2017)  for  policy  details).
6:200:17470:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Finally, we use apportionment weights for payroll, property, and sales that were digitized fromCSG Book of
6:201:17576:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the State(1976-2011).  These weights determine the share of national profits of multi-state firms that is taxable
6:202:17689:18:17:63:527:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in a given state (see section IV.B ofSu ́arez Serrato and Zidar(2016) for policy details on apportionment).
6:203:17796:17:18:78:542:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In addition to our data on tax base measures,  we use a few other data sources in the analysis.  We use

6:207:18161:18:18:78:542:168:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Table1 provides summary statistics of our main base measures.  In the pooled sample from 1980 to 2010,
6:208:18263:18:18:63:542:150:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:roughly  half  of  the  states  had  throwback  rules  and  franchise  taxes.   Most  used  federal  income  as  the  state
6:209:18386:18:18:63:542:132:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax  base  and  followed  accelerated  depreciation  schedules  (although  some  states  stopped  allowing  for  bonus
6:210:18504:18:15:63:542:114:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:depreciation for budgetary reasons).  Roughly a quarter of states in the pooled sample used combined reporting

7:216:19019:28:18:63:543:654:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The structure of state corporate taxation varies widely across states and over time.  Figure1 shows that the
7:217:19127:18:18:63:542:636:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:statutory corporate income tax rate varies between 0 and 12%.  Five states (Nevada,  South Dakota,  Texas,
7:218:19233:18:18:63:542:618:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Washington,  and  Wyoming)  currently  have  no  taxes  on  corporate  income.   As  of  2012,  another  five  states
7:219:19350:18:18:63:542:600:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) had tax rates above 9%.  Figure1 shows that over the
7:220:19456:18:18:63:542:582:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:past few decades,  very modest increases in the state corporate tax rate distribution across states have been
7:221:19565:18:18:63:542:564:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:accompanied by substantial declines in state corporate tax revenue as a share of economic activity.  Panel A of
7:222:19676:18:18:63:542:546:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Figure2 shows this pattern directly – average state corporate tax rates are quite stable, but the average state

7:224:19895:17:18:63:542:511:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shift away from the traditional corporate form (Cooper et al.(2016)), losses and other factors (Auerbach and
7:225:20003:18:18:63:443:493:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:Poterba(1987)), part of this decline is due to changes in the state corporate tax base.9
7:226:20091:18:18:78:542:475:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Table2 describes the number of changes to each of our tax base measures.  This table shows that there
7:227:20192:18:18:63:542:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:are more changes categorized as tax base narrowing than broadening, which suggests that an aggregate trend
7:228:20298:18:18:63:543:439:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:towards narrower bases is partly responsible for the patterns in Figures1–2.  Of these changes, the increase
7:229:20406:18:18:63:542:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in the number of years allowed for carrying losses forward and the increased reliance on sales as a factor for
7:230:20516:18:18:63:372:403:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:apportionment are the most frequently reformed measures in our data.
7:231:20584:18:18:78:542:385:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Table3 compares changes in the tax base with changes in the tax rate.  As the resurgent literature studying
7:232:20691:18:18:63:542:367:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the effects of state corporate taxes on economic activity has noted, there have been a considerable number of
7:233:20800:18:18:63:542:349:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes to states’ tax rates.  This table shows that states have decreased rates in 70 occasions, while increasing
7:234:20914:18:18:63:542:331:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rates 103 times, for a total of 173 changes.  However, this considerable policy activity pales in comparison to
7:235:21025:18:18:63:542:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes to the states’ tax bases.  Table3 shows that states have adopted changes that narrow the tax base in
7:236:21133:18:18:63:440:295:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:283 occasions, while increasing the base 163 times, for a total of 446 tax base changes.
7:237:21221:18:18:78:542:277:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:A widespread belief among economists and policy analysts is that increases in tax rates have relatively small
7:238:21330:18:17:63:542:259:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effects on firms’ tax obligations, since legislatures often change tax rates and tax bases simultaneously.10In
7:239:21440:17:18:63:542:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:particular, if tax increases are accompanied by the narrowing of tax bases, firms’ effective tax rates will be less
7:240:21555:18:18:63:542:224:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:susceptible to changes in the statutory rate.  Panel B of Figure2 shows for each year the number of states that
7:241:21666:18:18:63:542:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:change their corporate tax rates and base provisions.  Most points fall below the red 45 degree line, illustrating
7:242:21780:18:15:63:534:188:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:that in almost all years in which states change their tax base, most of them do not change their tax rates.11
7:243:21889:15:12:77:541:173:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:F:8Panel B in Table1 provides summary statistics for the cross section of states in 2010 and shows that roughly half the states
7:244:22014:12:10:63:527:161:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:had combined reporting in 2010.  Appendix TableA1provides summary stats of the additionalBartik(2017) controls for the
7:245:22132:10:9:63:81:151:8:g_d0_f8:6:g_d0_f7:F:subset of states and years for which these data are available.9
7:246:22195:9:10:81:534:142:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:A:Ideally, one could decompose the importance of these different channels as inAuerbach and Poterba(1987).  However, the
7:247:22313:10:9:63:538:132:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:necessary state level inputs for this exercise are not publicly available.  SeeBartik(2017) for a detailed industry-state level anal-
7:248:22446:9:7:63:216:123:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:ysis of business tax incentives since 1990.
7:249:22489:7:12:73:539:116:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:F:10This belief is supported by cross-country studies, as inDevereux and Sørensen(2006) andKawano and Slemrod(2015).  At
7:250:22607:12:10:63:535:104:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:the subnational level, however, other authors have noted cases where the tax base is set at the federal level, while the tax rates
7:251:22737:10:9:63:80:94:8:g_d0_f8:6:g_d0_f7:F:are set at the sub-national level (Fuest, Peichl and Siegloch,2018).11
7:252:22807:9:10:81:523:85:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:A:Appendix FigureA1shows that this finding is also consistent in recent years and states that coincide with the analysis
7:253:22925:10:0:63:154:75:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:sample inBartik(2017).
8:254:22948:0:18:78:542:724:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Table 3provides additional evidence that state tax rates and tax bases are not typically temporally related,
8:255:23056:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by  showing  the  number  of  times  that  states  changed  rates  and  tax  bases.   This  table  shows  that  in  most
8:256:23176:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:occasions  (43  out  of  70)  when  states  lowered  tax  rates,  these  changes  were  not  accompanied  by  a  tax  base
8:257:23298:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:change.  Similarly, when states increased tax rates, there were relatively few occasions when states also changed
8:258:23411:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the  tax  base  (only  9  out  of  103).   Conversely,  Table3  also  finds  that  when  states  changed  tax  bases,  these
8:259:23535:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes were very seldom accompanied by changes in the tax rates (23 out of 283 for base-narrowing changes,
8:260:23642:18:18:63:280:616:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:and 22 out of 163 for base-broadening changes).12
8:261:23691:18:18:78:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Table4 formalizes this point by presenting probit estimates of the likelihood of a coincidence in base and
8:262:23797:18:18:63:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rate changes.  The first panel estimates the probability of a change in tax base as a function of a rate change.
8:263:23909:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This panel shows that changes in tax rates are not predictive of changes in tax bases, and that this pattern is
8:264:24020:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:robust to splitting the dependent variable into base-narrowing and broadening events.  Panel B estimates the
8:265:24128:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:converse relation using changes in tax bases to predict changes in tax rates.  In particular, when we estimate
8:266:24238:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the  likelihood  of  a  tax  increase,  we  observe  that  there  is  no  statistical  relation  with  a  state  also  narrowing
8:267:24366:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the tax base.  We only find a modest correlation between the likelihood of a tax change and a broadening of
8:268:24473:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the base.  The third column shows this result is driven by tax decreases and base broadenings.  However, it is
8:269:24583:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sensitive to a few number of observations.13These results contrast with those ofKawano and Slemrod(2015),
8:270:24688:18:18:63:532:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:who estimate similar models for OECD countries and find statistically significant relations in all categories.
8:271:24798:18:18:78:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We now describe  trends in  specific  tax base  and  credit provisions.   Figure3 shows  how  tax  credits,  loss
8:272:24911:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rules, other base provisions and apportionment weights have evolved over time.  Panel A of Figure3 shows that
8:273:25020:18:18:63:542:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax credits, especially R&D credits, have become much more generous.  Panel B shows that loss carryforward
8:274:25126:18:18:63:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:provisions have become more favorable, and loss carryback provisions have remained relatively stable.  Figure
8:275:25235:18:18:63:542:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:4 shows how the distributions of many of these provisions have tended to become more generous over the past
8:276:25342:18:18:63:542:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:few decades.  In 1980, research and development credits were rare.  Beginning in 1990, some states introduced
8:277:25451:18:18:63:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:credits, but the vast majority of these were small – below 5%.  R&D tax credits have become more common in
8:278:25557:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the twenty-first century.  Many states have increased the size of the credit; as of 2010, a large share of states
8:279:25670:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:offer credits even more generous than the most generous provisions in 1990.  However, the generosity of these
8:280:25779:18:17:63:542:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:credits has been reduced by adoption of rules that limit R&D tax credits to incremental expenditures.  The data
8:281:25890:17:18:63:542:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reveal similar patterns for the investment tax credit and loss carryforward provisions, which have on aggregate
8:282:26001:18:18:63:291:222:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:changed with the result of narrowing the tax base.14
8:283:26053:18:18:78:542:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Panel C of Figure3 shows that states have continued to narrow their base by increasing the apportionment
8:284:26157:18:18:63:542:186:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:weight on sales, and decreasing the weights on property and payroll.  In 1980, the majority of states placed
8:285:26265:18:18:63:542:168:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:less than half of the apportionment weight on sales.  This share declined steadily until 2010, leaving only 12
8:286:26375:18:18:63:542:150:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:states with sales apportionment shares below 50%.  Figure4 depicts this shift and the implications for the sales
8:287:26487:18:18:63:542:132:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:apportioned corporate tax rate, which is the product of the statutory corporate tax rate and the sales weight.
8:288:26597:18:15:63:542:114:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Given the secular decline in payroll and property weights, it is not surprising that the range of this distribution
8:289:26712:15:9:73:539:99:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:F:12Appendix TableA3provides more detail by describing the co-movement of tax rates and each individual tax base measure.
8:290:26831:9:13:73:522:90:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:13In particular, the adoption of throwback rules in 2007 by a small number of states is responsible for this result.  In Ap-
8:291:26955:13:9:63:80:77:8:g_d0_f8:6:g_d0_f7:F:pendix TableA4we show that this result is not robust to ignoring these changes.14
8:292:27036:9:0:81:487:68:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:A:Appendix FiguresA5–A19provide additional detail behind changes in individual tax base measures by state.
9:293:27141:0:18:63:542:724:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is more compressed than the distribution of sales-apportioned corporate rate.  However, it is striking that the
9:294:27252:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:distribution of the sales-apportioned corporate rate is skewed to the right and has, if anything, become more
9:295:27361:18:18:63:526:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:dispersed in recent years by increasing the density of states with higher sales-apportioned corporate rates.
9:296:27469:18:18:78:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In contrast, other dimensions of the tax base have expanded over the past few decades.  Panel D of Figure
9:297:27574:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:3 shows an increasing number of states have adopted the federal definition of the state tax base for state tax
9:298:27684:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:purposes.  This policy choice limits the extent to which state lawmakers can tinker with the tax base, but also
9:299:27795:18:18:63:542:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:puts states at risk of changes in federal policy that may have adverse effects on state tax revenues.  The panel
9:300:27907:18:18:63:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:also shows a slight increase in the number of states adopting throwback rules that limit the ability of companies
9:301:28020:18:18:63:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to have “nowhere income” under state apportionment rules, especially in later years.  Similarly, many states
9:302:28128:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:adopted combined reporting rules that strengthen the reporting requirements for unitary businesses.  This panel
9:303:28239:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:also shows that states have moved away from allowing federal income taxes to be deducted from state taxation.
9:304:28348:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The most notable change is the reduction in the number of states adopting bonus depreciation in the early
9:305:28453:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:2000s, which is likely due in part to the substantial fiscal cost of these provisions in a period of reduced tax
9:306:28565:18:18:63:162:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:revenues (Ohrn, 2016).

9:308:28705:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:conventional wisdom, we do not find evidence of a temporal concomitance in tax rate and tax base changes.15
9:309:28812:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:While  some  aspects  of  the  tax  base  have  become  more  generous  for  corporations  (e.g.,  loss  carryforward
9:310:28929:18:18:63:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f6:B:provisions  and  R&D  and  investment  tax  credits),  changes  in  other  rules  have  broadened  the  tax  base  (e.g.
9:311:29049:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:throwback and combined reporting rules).  The following section explores the degree to which these changes to
9:312:29158:18:42:63:329:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:states’ corporate tax systems explain changes in tax revenue.

9:315:29383:18:18:63:542:295:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:analysis by taking a first-order approximation of state corporate tax revenueR(τ,X) =τ×B(τ,X),  which

10:414:33882:7:12:73:534:92:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:18We present further results of this variance decomposition in TableA7.  For example, when we control for an interaction of
10:415:34005:12:0:63:434:80:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:throwback rules and apportionment weights, the explanatory power of the throwback rule increases.

11:417:34212:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:negative correlate is an indicator for having a franchise tax, which is more common among southern states and
11:418:34321:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sometimes substitutes for having any corporate tax system at all (e.g., Texas).19Most of the base and credit
11:419:34429:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:provisions listed are positively related to revenue as a share of GDP, except for federal income tax deductiblitly,
11:420:34544:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:loss provisions, and depreciation provisions, which are associated with less corporate tax revenue as a share of
11:421:34656:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GDP. Overall, tax base and credit rules account for the majority of the explained variation in corporate tax

11:423:34791:18:18:78:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Figure  6  shows  that  the  explanatory  power  of  base  and  credit  rules  has  evolved  over  time.   Specifically,

11:426:35134:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:C. The upper left panel shows that the state tax policy parameters explain roughly half of the variation in state

11:428:35359:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:variance is accounted for by state corporate tax base rules.  Sales apportionment weights and loss provisions
11:429:35468:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:were quite important in the first half of the sample period.  More recently, however, federal provisions (such as
11:430:35581:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:adopting the federal tax base and federal bonus depreciation or allowing for the deductibility of federal taxes)
11:431:35693:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have grown in importance.  Additionally, franchise taxes and loss carryforward provisions have also increased

12:459:37369:18:18:63:378:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:share of state GDP, log state corporate tax revenue, and log state GDP.
12:460:37440:18:18:78:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We fit specifications of this type on our state panel data using data from 1980 to 2010.  We also consider
12:461:37546:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:specifications that control for the leads and lags of key components of the tax base.  Specifically, we control
12:462:37657:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for  leads  and  lags  of  the  six  most  important  tax  base  controls  in  terms  of  variance  shares  of  corporate  tax

12:467:38161:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that exceed 0.5 percentage point cuts in the rate tend to reduce state corporate tax revenue as a share of state
12:468:38273:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GDP by roughly 6 percentage points cumulatively over a 5 year period.  Panels B and C show the importance
12:469:38378:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of the numerator and denominator separately.  Despite modestly higher economic activity, corporate tax cuts
12:470:38485:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:decrease state tax revenue by roughly 10%.  The increases in state GDP are imprecise and not statistically
12:471:38591:18:18:63:542:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:different than zero, though the point estimate is roughly 2%.  Controlling for the tax base does not alter these
12:472:38703:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:general patterns.  Panels D, E, and F show that tax increases have symmetric impacts, though pre-trends are
12:473:38810:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a bit more noticeable prior to state corporate tax increases.  Specifically, the event studies in D and E show
12:474:38920:18:18:63:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that tax revenues were also higher preceding the tax increase events by roughly a similar magnitude, so it is
12:475:39029:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:not clear that corporate tax revenues actually increase following tax increases.  We view these event studies as
12:476:39141:18:18:63:542:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:describing the typical evolution of outcomes before and after tax changes.  Since these tax changes potentially
12:477:39252:18:18:63:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:include some endogenous changes that are intended to address current (or expected) economic conditions, these
12:478:39361:18:18:63:542:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:impacts are descriptive and not causal.21Overall,  these point estimates of the effect of state corporate tax
12:479:39470:18:18:63:542:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes are imprecise, but the key finding for our purposes is that they do not depend strongly on base controls

12:485:39869:12:10:63:533:189:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:changes in Appendix FigureA23.  The threshold of 0.5 percentage points includes roughly half the state corporate tax changes
12:486:39993:10:9:63:531:179:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:(see Appendix FigureA24for a histogram).  A corporate tax cut that exceeds 0.5 percentage points amounts to roughly a one
12:487:40114:9:10:63:529:170:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:percentage point cut in state corporate tax rate on average.  On average, a corporate tax increase that exceeds 0.5 percentage
12:488:40240:10:9:63:537:160:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:points corresponds to a 1.5 percentage point increase in the state corporate tax rate.  Controlling for leads and lags of the other
12:489:40371:9:10:63:535:151:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:tax base controls (in addition to the ones in our baseline specification) results in similar but slightly noisier estimates as shown

13:496:41092:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:corporate tax rate by 1 percentage point leads to an increase in corporate tax revenues relative to GDP of
13:497:41198:18:18:63:541:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f10:B:1.8 basis points.  Relative to the average value ofRstof 35 basis points,  a 1 percentage point increase inτ
13:498:41306:18:18:63:249:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:represents a (1.8/35=) 5% increase inRst.
13:499:41347:18:18:78:542:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Column (2) of Table5 shows that including controls for the tax base does not affect this estimate, which
13:500:41451:18:18:63:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reinforces  the  results  from  the  event  studies  in  Figure7.   However,  including  these  controls  increases  the
13:501:41571:18:18:63:543:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:precision of the estimate.  As we discussed in Section3,  these controls have large explanatory power on the
13:502:41679:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:revenue-to-GDP ratio.  The coefficients on the tax base controls have a similar interpretation as those in Figure
13:503:41792:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:5.   For  instance,  some  controls  that  narrow  the  base  —  including  the  R&D  tax  credit,  the  investment  tax
13:504:41912:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:credit, and an indicator for allowing the deductibility of federal income taxes — have negative effects onRst.
13:505:42022:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Conversely,  controls that correspond to broader bases,  such as throwback rules or incremental tax bases for
13:506:42131:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:R&D tax credits, have positive effects onRst.  Having a franchise tax also negatively impactsRst, as states
13:507:42238:18:32:63:411:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:with a franchise tax often use it as an alternative to a tax on corporate income.

13:519:43012:25:17:63:542:270:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Taxes  may  affect  the  revenue-to-GDP  ratio  by  increasing  revenues  or  by  decreasing  GDP.  We  estimate  the
13:520:43129:17:18:63:542:253:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effects on the numerator and denominator separately. To facilitate comparisons across states and across time, we
13:521:43241:18:18:63:542:235:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:present estimates of the effects on log state corporate tax revenue and on log state GDP. For these specifications
13:522:43355:18:18:63:542:217:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:we report the effect of the log keep rate,i.e., ln(1−τ).23Columns (3) and (5) of Table5 show that an increase
13:523:43464:18:18:63:542:199:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in the log keep rate reduces revenue and increases GDP. Columns (4) and (6) further show that controlling
13:524:43569:18:18:63:542:181:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for the tax base does not have large effects on these estimates.  However, some tax base controls affect these
13:525:43679:18:18:63:542:163:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes even when the effect onRstis not statistically significant.  For instance, states with a franchise tax
13:526:43790:18:15:63:542:145:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:and states that allow for the deductibility of federal income taxes have both lower revenues and lower GDP.24
13:527:43899:15:12:73:535:130:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:22In these estimations we weight observations by the mean GDP in the state over our sample, and the standard errors allow
13:528:44020:12:10:63:537:118:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:for arbitrary correlation between observations from a given state.  We scale the revenue-to-GDP variable so that coefficients can
13:529:44149:10:9:63:80:108:8:g_d0_f8:6:g_d0_f7:F:be interpreted in terms of basis points.23
13:530:44191:9:9:81:525:99:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:A:We use ln(1−τ) because these expressions are in log form and the keep rate formulation avoids taking logs of zeros for
13:531:44309:9:7:63:210:90:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:states that have no state corporate tax.
13:532:44349:7:12:73:527:83:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:24It may also be the case that tax base controls have dynamic effects on these outcomes.  A full discussion of the effects of

14:535:44644:28:18:63:542:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This section relaxes the assumption of homogeneous treatment effects ofτ.  We show that tax base interactions
14:536:44753:18:18:63:542:678:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:with the tax rate can lead to heterogeneous effects across time and states, and that omitting these interactions
14:537:44865:18:18:63:466:660:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:leads to biased estimates of the average treatment effect of state corporate tax rate changes.
14:538:44959:18:18:78:542:642:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Changes  in  state  corporate  tax  rates  may  have  differential  effects  on  tax  revenue  and  economic  activity
14:539:45077:18:18:63:542:624:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:depending on the breadth of the tax base.  Intuitively, a tax increase should raise less revenue whenever the
14:540:45186:18:18:63:542:606:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax base is relatively narrow.  This intuition holds (1) for mechanical effects, since narrow bases by definition
14:541:45299:18:18:63:542:588:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax a smaller share of profits; (2) for reporting responses, since firms in states with narrow bases may respond
14:542:45411:18:18:63:542:570:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by adopting new deduction strategies; and (3) for behavioral responses, since firms are likely to respond less to
14:543:45524:18:17:63:542:552:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a tax increase whenever the tax affects a smaller share of their profits.25As a hypothetical example, suppose
14:544:45633:17:18:63:542:535:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that California and New York both increase their state corporate tax rates, but suppose further that California

14:546:45853:18:18:63:542:499:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:face a smaller increase in their effective tax liability as firms in New York, since the tax base in California is
14:547:45967:18:18:63:542:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:narrower.  Any behavioral response by firms that depends on current rates, such as investment, employment,
14:548:46073:18:18:63:542:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:or relocation, will therefore be more muted in California than in New York.  While this example only mentions
14:549:46182:18:18:63:542:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:loss carryforward provisions, the treatment of other aspects of the tax base, such as depreciation allowances or
14:550:46294:18:35:63:475:427:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:investment tax credits, may also modulate the degree to which tax changes affect tax revenue.
14:551:46387:35:24:63:223:392:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:C:5.1    Econometric Intuition
14:552:46415:24:18:63:542:368:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:When the effect of a state corporate tax rate change depends on the tax base, estimates that do not account for
14:553:46526:18:18:63:542:350:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax-base-driven heterogeneity can lead to bias in average treatment effects.  The intuition for this bias follows
14:554:46639:18:18:63:542:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:directly from the Omitted Variable Bias (OVB) formula.  For simplicity, consider the case in which there are
14:555:46747:18:18:63:542:314:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:two types of states with narrow and broad bases, and that the effects of tax changes depend on the tax base.
14:556:46855:18:33:63:161:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The long regression is:
14:557:46878:33:33:146:459:263:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:?:Rst=α+β1τst+β2τst×I{Narrow Base}st+δI{Narrow Base}st+ust.
14:558:46935:33:18:63:542:230:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:If we assume that the effect of a tax rate change in broad-base states (β1) is greater than in narrow-base states
14:559:47048:18:18:63:542:212:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(β1+β2), we might worry that a short regression that omits the interaction termτst×I{Narrow Base}stwill
14:560:47151:18:18:63:542:194:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:yield a biased estimate of the average effect across states,  i.e.,β1+β2Pr(Narrow Base).  The OVB formula
14:561:47256:18:32:63:312:176:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:shows that the short regression estimate will be biased:26

14:568:47541:10:7:63:451:109:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:for R&D tax credits, which led to tax increases in future years by limiting the value of R&D tax credits.
14:569:47646:7:13:73:540:102:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:F:25Indeed, our derivation above implies that the marginal effect of taxes will depend on the base through both mechanical and
14:570:47770:13:7:63:274:89:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:behavioral effects of taxes:dRdτ=B(τ,X) +τ×dB(τ,X)dτ.

15:572:47900:0:18:63:542:724:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The sign and magnitude of the bias is governed by two forces:  (1) heterogeneous effects due to the tax base
15:573:48008:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:interactions  (i.e.,β2≷0)  and  (2)  the  covariance  between  the  interaction  term  andτ.   First,  the  sign  and
15:574:48125:18:18:63:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude of the effect of tax base provisionβ2depends on the base rule.  For base-narrowing provisions, we
15:575:48232:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:expectβ2<0.  Second, the termβ2is scaled by the covariance between the tax rate and the interaction.  In
15:576:48336:18:18:63:543:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:contrast to the average treatment effect, which scalesβ2by the fraction of the population with a narrow base,
15:577:48445:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the short regression scalesβ2by a different term.27In the case of indicator variables, this scaling term is the
15:578:48556:18:18:63:384:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:conditional variance of the state corporate tax rate in narrow-base states.
15:579:48631:18:18:78:543:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Ifβ2<0  and  narrow-base  states  change  taxes  more  frequently  (i.e.,Var(τst|Narrow Base)>Var(τst)),
15:580:48735:18:18:63:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:then omitting the interaction term will result in a downwardly-biased estimate of the average effect of taxes
15:581:48844:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:on revenues.  The general case with 15 interactions is slightly more complex, but the potential biases from not
15:582:48955:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:including interactions have a similar intuition.  This type of bias is well known in the econometrics literature
15:583:49067:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g.,Wooldridge(2005)),  and  has  been  shown  to  be  empirically  important  across  several  fields  of  applied

15:595:49888:18:18:63:542:305:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:results of Table5,  we find that including interaction terms leads to a larger average effect of the corporate

15:597:50107:17:18:63:542:270:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is 50% larger, which is strong evidence that tax-base interactions matter and that the OLS estimator is not a

16:622:51186:18:18:63:542:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:measure that captures the variation across 15 bases in a single index.  Second, the statistical significance of the

16:624:51408:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:it is hard to evaluate the joint statistical importance of these interactions from individual coefficients, the joint
16:625:51525:18:18:63:519:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:interaction term collapses the covariance structure and allows for a simple univariate statistical analysis.
16:626:51633:18:18:78:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Column  (2)  in  Table6  reports  the  coefficient  on  the  joint  interactions.   The  joint  interaction  term  is

16:628:51873:18:18:63:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:important.  For instance, a 1 percentage point tax increase in a state with a joint interaction term that is two

16:630:52087:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:state with a joint interaction term that is two standard deviations below the mean would not see an increase

16:633:52315:17:18:63:543:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for the tax base does not have large effects on our estimates ofβ0.  While an increase in ln(1−τ) both reduces
16:634:52425:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:revenue  and  increases  GDP,  we  find  that  the  effects  on  revenue  are  a  larger  driver  of  the  net  effect  on  the

16:636:52657:18:18:63:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:subject to statistically significant joint interactions between ln(1−τ) and the tax base.  For the case of log-
16:637:52768:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:revenue, we find that the mean effect is much larger in Column (4) than in Column (3), while the mean effect

16:644:53495:18:18:63:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:figure shows that the heterogeneous effects for the revenue-to-GDP ratio are driven mostly by the R&D tax
16:645:53600:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:credit, the presence of a franchise tax, the allowance for federal accelerated depreciation, and the deduction of
16:646:53713:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:federal taxes.  Of these four policies, the franchise tax and the allowance for federal depreciation drive variation
16:647:53829:18:17:63:542:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:through heterogeneous effects on corporate revenue, while the allowance for the deductibility of federal taxes

16:650:54156:18:18:63:543:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:would only increaseRstby (2.4 + 0.7×0 =) 2.4 basis points.  Panel B splits this decomposition by five-year
16:651:54262:18:18:63:542:186:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:intervals, and shows that the importance of the franchise tax and the deductibility of federal taxes has waned
16:652:54372:18:18:63:542:168:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:over time, while the importance of the allowance for federal accelerated depreciation and the R&D tax credit
16:653:54480:18:18:63:218:150:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:has grown in importance over time.
16:654:54514:18:9:63:80:132:8:g_d0_f8:6:g_d0_f7:F:without the standardization of the joint interaction term, we would obtain a coefficient of one on this variable.29
16:655:54629:9:10:81:534:123:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:A:These results are robust to including lagged values of the the tax rate, the tax base, and the joint interactions.  TableA10
16:656:54753:10:9:63:535:113:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:shows that controlling for 1-5 lags of any of these variables does not affect the total cumulative mean effect of tax rates on rev-

16:658:54932:7:12:73:523:97:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:30We expect interaction terms to have a positive coefficient whenever they rules broaden the base.  Conversely, we expect
16:659:55053:12:0:63:509:85:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:negative coefficients for rules that narrow the base.  In AppendixA.2, we list these predictions for each interaction term.

17:661:55259:25:18:63:542:699:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We now evaluate howβY( ̃xst) varies across states and over time due to changes in the state corporate tax base

17:663:55483:18:17:63:542:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:1980 and 2000 diminished the effect of taxes on revenue.  Consistent with the descriptive evidence in favor of
17:664:55593:17:18:63:543:646:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:narrowing tax bases in Section2, this figure shows that tax cuts lead to smaller reductions in 2000 than 1980.
17:665:55703:18:18:63:542:628:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This  figure  also  shows  that  this  pattern is  slightly reversed  during  the  2000’s.   Two  trends that  we  observe

17:667:55935:18:18:63:542:592:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:businesses, and of throwback rules, which limit the extent to which firms can have “nowhere income” under
17:668:56040:18:18:63:180:574:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the apportionment system.
17:669:56065:18:18:78:542:556:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Figure9  shows  how  the  state  average  has  evolved,  but  masks  considerable  heterogeneity  across  states.
17:670:56178:18:18:63:542:538:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Figure10plots the estimated total effectβY( ̃xst) for four selected states during our sample period.  Delaware,
17:671:56289:18:18:63:542:520:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for example, narrowed its tax base, which is reflected by a decrease in the effect of a tax change on revenue
17:672:56398:18:18:63:542:502:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:over time.  This pattern is due to changes to the Delaware corporate tax base in the late 1990’s that led to
17:673:56506:18:18:63:542:484:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:an  increase  in  the  number  of  years  allowed  for  loss  carryforward,  and  by  the  adoption  of  a  generous  R&D
17:674:56627:18:18:63:542:466:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax credit.  In contrast,  Michigan broadened its tax base by disallowing both the MACRS depreciation rule
17:675:56733:18:18:63:542:448:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and federal accelerated and bonus depreciation rules.  In addition, the adoption of throwback and combined
17:676:56839:18:18:63:542:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reporting  rules  in  the  late  2000’s  further  broadened  the  tax  base.   As  a  result,  the  second  panel  in  Figure
17:677:56964:18:18:63:542:412:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:10shows  that  revenue  became  more  responsive  to  changes  in  tax  rates  in  the  later  years  of  our  sample  for
17:678:57086:18:17:63:542:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Michigan.  Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are examples of states whose experience mirrors the reversal pattern
17:679:57195:17:18:63:542:377:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:observed on average across states.  Pennsylvania narrowed its tax base in the 1990’s by increasing the number
17:680:57304:18:18:63:542:359:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of years allowed for loss carryforward, as well as introducing R&D and investment tax credits.  In the 2000’s, it
17:681:57417:18:18:63:542:341:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reversed this trend by reducing the investment tax credit and introducing throwback and combined reporting
17:682:57523:18:18:63:542:323:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rules.  In Rhode Island,  the narrowing of the base was due to the introduction of R&D and investment tax
17:683:57628:18:42:63:432:305:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f5:B:credits, and the reversal was due to the disallowance of federal bonus depreciation.31

17:690:58206:9:10:63:535:163:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:consistent with the trends in Figure9, as the map in 2005 has more states with effects closer to zero.  However, this average ef-
17:691:58335:10:9:63:533:153:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:fect masks considerable heterogeneity in experiences across states.  In addition to Michigan, other mid-western states including
17:692:58463:9:10:63:535:144:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:Wisconsin, Ohio, and Illinois saw a broadening of the tax base between 1985 and 2000.  In contrast, several other states includ-

18:706:59336:18:18:63:542:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effects reduces the precision of the estimate forβ0.  The interpretation of a positive value forδ0is that these
18:707:59447:18:17:63:542:523:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:regressions do not detect decreasing returns of increasing taxes, which may be due to the relatively low tax
18:708:59555:17:18:63:542:506:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rates  observed  in  the  data.   Since  the  implied  relationship  between  tax  rates  and  corporate  tax  revenues  is
18:709:59678:18:18:63:469:488:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:convex, we cannot identify a revenue-maximizing-tax rate using these estimates ofβ0andδ0.
18:710:59767:18:18:78:542:470:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:As in the previous section,  we are interested in the possibility that the responsiveness to taxes,  and the

18:712:59982:18:18:63:542:434:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:allowing the linear and quadratic effects of taxes to depend on the Base Indexstdefined in Section 4.2.1.  This

19:751:63336:18:18:63:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:show strong patterns of decreasing returns from increasing taxes.  At the current levels of corporate tax rates,
19:752:63448:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:we can rule out the hypothesis that, for states with corporate tax rates below 10%, cutting corporate tax rates
19:753:63559:18:42:63:247:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:has tended to raise corporate tax revenue.
19:754:63601:42:28:63:320:341:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:C:7    Discussion of Policy Implications
19:755:63639:28:18:63:542:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This paper has established several facts detailing how state tax rates,  base rules,  and credits determine the
19:756:63750:18:18:63:542:295:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:structure  of  the  state  corporate  tax  system.   We  find  that  changes  to  tax  base  rules  and  credits  are  more
19:757:63873:18:18:63:542:277:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:common than changes in tax rates,  and that changes in tax base rules are not enacted to temporally offset
19:758:63979:18:17:63:542:259:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:changes to tax rates.  Further, we show that changes in tax base rules and credits play a more important role
19:759:64088:17:18:63:542:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in explaining patterns in the revenue-to-GDP ratio across states than do changes in tax rates.  We document
19:760:64195:18:18:63:542:224:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:trends in individual tax base rules over time and provide evidence that, while some states have broadened their
19:761:64306:18:18:63:542:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tax bases by adopting combined reporting and throwback rules in recent years, most other measures of the tax
19:762:64414:18:18:63:542:188:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:base point toward a narrowing of the tax base.  We analyze the role that tax base rules play in the estimation
19:763:64524:18:18:63:542:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of the effects of tax rates on tax revenues and economic activity, and find that controlling for these rules does
19:764:64637:18:18:63:542:152:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:not affect the estimated effects.  Instead, we show that accounting for heterogeneous effects of tax changes that
19:765:64750:18:15:63:542:134:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:depend on the structure of the corporate tax system is important both to obtain consistent estimates of the
19:766:64857:15:12:73:533:119:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:34For many observations we do not find any evidence of decreasing returns,i.e.,δ1+δ2×Base Indexst>0, which results
19:767:64971:12:10:63:533:107:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:in a value ofτ∗(Base Indexst) of 100%.  This result should not be interpreted as literally suggesting that revenue will be maxi-
19:768:65099:10:9:63:541:97:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:mized with a tax rate of 100%.  Rather, this result suggests that the low values ofτin the data fail to identify a value ofδ0that
19:769:65228:9:7:63:259:88:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:implies strong decreasing returns to increasing taxes.
19:770:65282:7:12:73:527:81:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:35These results are robust to controlling for state personal income taxes and sales taxes, as shown in Appendix TableA12
19:771:65402:12:0:63:162:69:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:and Appendix FigureA49.

20:773:65538:18:18:63:201:706:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:different corporate tax systems.
20:774:65570:18:18:78:542:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:These findings have important implications for policy.  First, while changes in tax rates receive public and
20:775:65678:18:18:63:542:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:media  attention,  changes  in  state  tax  bases  may  have  larger  effects  on  revenue  and  may  also  modulate  the
20:776:65799:18:18:63:542:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effects of state corporate tax rates on revenue and economic activity.  For this reason, the public debate should
20:777:65912:18:18:63:542:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:place relatively more attention to policy changes that affect the structure of state corporate taxation, and not
20:778:66024:18:18:63:183:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:only the statutory tax rate.
20:779:66052:18:18:78:542:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Second, given the large effects of the structure of the tax base on corporate tax revenue, state policymakers
20:780:66161:18:18:63:542:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:should be careful to use these policies to accomplish particular goals.  States that are able to attract businesses
20:781:66276:18:18:63:542:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for  non-tax  reasons  may  prefer  to  have  a  lower  tax  rate  and  a  broader  base  by,  for  instance,  adopting  the
20:782:66400:18:18:63:542:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:federal income tax base as their own.  States wishing to increase investment may depart from this strategy by
20:783:66509:18:17:63:542:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:using tax credits or generous depreciation allowances to encourage investment, but they may see substantial
20:784:66616:17:18:63:542:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:declines in revenue.  Finally, states wishing to attract or retain innovative businesses may craft a treatment of
20:785:66729:18:18:63:542:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:loss carryforward provisions that is very favorable to new businesses.  Policymakers would likely benefit from
20:786:66839:18:18:63:344:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:further research outlining the relative success of these strategies.
20:787:66907:18:18:78:542:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Third, as states structure the taxation of corporate income for their particular needs and objectives, state
20:788:67015:18:18:63:542:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:policymakers should bear in mind that changes to the structure of state corporate taxation will influence the
20:789:67124:18:18:63:542:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:distortionary costs of increasing the state corporate tax rate.  In particular, we find that when states narrow
20:790:67235:18:18:63:542:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the tax base, they also diminish the relation between tax rates and corporate tax revenue.  By making it harder
20:791:67346:18:18:63:542:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to raise tax revenue from corporations, it is also likely that state policymakers will be forced to raise revenue
20:792:67459:18:18:63:542:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:from other sources including sales taxes, property taxes, or personal income taxes, or to reduce spending on
20:793:67567:18:18:63:121:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:public goods.
20:794:67580:18:18:78:542:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Future work can explore the degree to which tax base determinants affect the incidence of the state corporate
20:795:67689:18:18:63:542:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:income tax by extending the framework in Su ́arez Serrato and Zidar(2016) to allow for deductions that may
20:796:67795:18:18:63:542:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:affect the response of firms to tax rate changes.  Intuitively, a narrower tax base lowers the benefits of a tax
20:797:67907:18:18:63:542:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:cut to business owners as they only pay taxes on a smaller fraction of profits.  As there is a smaller benefit
20:798:68017:18:17:63:542:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:from the tax cut, firms are less likely to enter a particular location, which will also mute the effect of the tax
20:799:68131:17:18:63:542:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:cut on employment, wages, and costs of living.  Whether the decrease in firm entry is larger than the decrease
20:800:68241:18:18:63:542:222:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in the real wage and employment will determine the extent to which the incidence of a state income tax cut is
20:801:68350:18:18:63:542:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:borne by workers, landowners, or firm owners.  Overall, many exciting questions on the incidence and efficiency
20:802:68461:18:0:63:386:186:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:consequences of reforms to the state corporate tax structure remain open.

35:1098:90857:12:12:63:542:486:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:rate.  A change that represents a narrowing of the base is counted in the−1 column, while a year that represents a broadening of

35:1103:91495:12:12:63:542:426:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:off corresponds to a narrowing of the base, while it being turned on corresponds to a narrowing.  For instance, if a state adopts
35:1104:91624:12:12:63:542:414:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:MACRS depreciation, then we say that the tax base has narrowed.  For throwback rules, combined reporting, moving average base

35:1106:91879:11:12:63:542:391:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:a narrowing of the base, while it being turned on corresponds to a broadening.  For instance, if a state adopts combined reporting,
35:1107:92010:12:12:63:542:379:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:then we say that the tax base has broadened.  If that state gets rid of combined reporting, then the tax base has narrowed.  See

42:1386:106271:18:12:63:542:253:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The effective R&D tax credit rate is a combination of 3 factors:  the statutory R&D tax credit rate, the base
42:1387:106380:12:12:63:542:241:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:level definition, and the recapture policy (Wilson,2005).  States vary in the definition of the applicable base
42:1388:106491:12:22:63:495:229:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for R&D tax credits.  As pointed out inWilson(2009), such definitions fall into 3 major categories:
42:1389:106590:22:20:75:403:207:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:1.Non-incremental credit:  all R&D expenditures are eligible for credit.

44:1427:109314:19:11:63:542:681:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Neighbor states are states that share a border of any length. There exist 109 unique state border pairs, including

44:1434:109967:19:12:63:542:575:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We use state-level demographic and economic characteristics to construct a measure of state similarity.  For

44:1449:111317:12:12:78:542:373:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:A  key  difference  between  identifying  border  and  similar  states  is  that  state  similarity  is  not  necessarily
44:1450:111438:12:12:63:542:361:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reciprocal.  In other words, Maine may be similar to Vermont in yeart, but Vermont is not necessarily similar
44:1451:111547:12:12:63:105:349:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to Maine.
44:1452:111556:12:12:78:542:337:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:One  shortcoming  of  this  method  is  that  it  does  not  identify  similar  matches  for  all  states  in  all  years.
44:1453:111678:12:12:63:542:325:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Only 25 states have a “similar” state for every sample year; the other 25 are missing matches in some or all
44:1454:111786:12:12:63:542:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sample years.  The reason is that some states are too economically different from the rest of the nation.  For
44:1455:111896:12:11:63:542:301:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:example, California has no matches because it is exactly identified by its population, and the probability that
44:1456:112007:11:12:63:542:290:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:any other state is California is infinitely close to 0.37Appendix TableA14lists all states in our sample and

44:1465:112827:15:13:73:521:157:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:36We estimate the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic for each logistic regression, and fail to reject the null that the indicator of

44:1468:113099:7:12:73:535:128:6:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:A:37We explored using OLS to avoid these issues when estimatingProb(j=i)jt, but this approach can yield predicted proba-
