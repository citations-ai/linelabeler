2:23:881:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Questions about current and prior religion adherence from the International Social Survey Program
2:24:978:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:and the World Values Survey allow us to calculate country-level religious-conversion rates for 40
2:25:1075:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:countries.  These conversion rates apply to religion adherence classified into eight major types.  In
2:26:1176:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:a theoretical model based on rational individual choice, the frequency of religious conversion depends
2:27:1278:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:on factors that influence the cost of switching and the cost of having the "wrong" religion.  Empirical
2:28:1381:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:findings for a panel of countries accord with several hypotheses:  religious-conversion rates are positively
2:29:1489:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:related to religious pluralism, gauged by adherence shares; negatively related to government restrictions
2:30:1594:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:on religious conversion; positively related to levels of education; and negatively related to a history
2:31:1697:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:of Communism.  Conversion rates are not much related to per capita GDP, the presence of state religion,
2:32:1800:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:and the extent of religiosity.   Effects from the type of religion adherence are minor, except for a negative
2:33:1909:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:effect from Muslim adherence.  The empirical results are robust to alternative specifications of the
2:34:2009:14:42:72:347:434:12:Times:12:Times:religion groupings used to construct the conversion rates.

3:47:2272:0:27:90:519:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Some countries, such as the United States, Australia, South Korea, and many sub-
3:48:2352:27:28:90:505:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Saharan African countries currently have a great diversity of religion adherence.  (See 
3:49:2440:28:27:90:517:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Barrett, Kurian, and Johnson [2001] for religion adherence data.)  Others, such as Spain, 
3:50:2530:27:28:90:500:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Italy, the Scandinavian countries, and many majority Muslim countries have a heavy 
3:51:2613:28:28:89:512:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concentration within a single type.  These concentrations are particularly striking if one 
3:52:2704:28:27:89:505:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ignores persons with no religion and considers only major religion categories (such as 
3:53:2791:27:28:89:504:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counting Muslim as one type).  Aside from the within-country patterns, the data show 
3:54:2876:28:27:89:511:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wide differences internationally.  Countries differ greatly in their adherence rates to the 
3:55:2968:27:28:89:199:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major world religions. 
3:56:2991:28:28:89:502:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In the long run, the frequency distributions of religion types within and across 
3:57:3072:28:27:89:519:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries reflect religious-conversion rates, along with cross-religion patterns of fertility, 
3:58:3167:27:28:89:520:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mortality, and migration.  This study focuses on the conversion part of this relationship.   
3:59:3260:28:27:89:507:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Historically, religious conversion often resulted involuntarily from conquest or 
3:60:3341:27:28:89:517:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:changing preferences of rulers who restricted personal religion choices.  For example, in 
3:61:3431:28:27:89:519:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:central Europe, the rights of individuals to choose their own religion expanded greatly in 
3:62:3522:27:28:89:523:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1648, when the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years’ War.  In contrast, in modern 
3:63:3610:28:28:89:498:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:times, decisions to convert can usually be analyzed as an individual’s decision about 
3:64:3696:28:27:89:514:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:whether and when to switch.  Conversion restrictions and other policies of governments 
3:65:3783:27:28:89:524:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and organized religions still apply in some countries, and these constraints affect personal 
3:66:3876:28:27:89:497:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:choices.  However, the most important influences on the conversion decision are the 
3:67:3960:27:28:89:490:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:benefits and costs as perceived by individuals.  Therefore, we use a rational-choice 
3:68:4045:28:28:89:522:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:framework at the individual level to make predictions about the determinants of religious-
3:69:4135:28:0:89:269:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion rates at the country level. 
4:70:4175:0:27:90:480:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Empirical investigations of the determinants of religious conversion have 
4:71:4249:27:28:90:511:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:typically focused on persons within a single country, often the United States (Stark and 
4:72:4338:28:27:89:502:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Glock [1968], Roof and McKinney [1987], Greeley [1989], Sandomirsky and Wilson 
4:73:4417:27:28:90:507:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:[1990], Sherkat and Wilson [1995], Sherkat [2001], and Loveland [2003]).  Breen and 
4:74:4501:28:28:90:511:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Hayes (1996) considered the United Kingdom, and Need and de Graaf (1996) analyzed 
4:75:4583:28:27:90:490:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the Netherlands.  These studies are useful for assessing effects on the propensity to 
4:76:4669:27:28:90:506:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:convert from variables such as age, gender, and race.  However, given the context of a 
4:77:4756:28:27:90:521:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:single country over a relatively short time period, these analyses cannot assess the effects 
4:78:4849:27:28:90:504:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of country-wide policies and characteristics, such as regulation of the religion market, 
4:79:4938:28:28:89:524:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:political regimes such as Communism, and the extent of religious pluralism at the country 
4:80:5028:28:27:89:516:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level.  Our panel of 40 countries allows us to examine in detail the effects of these kinds 
4:81:5120:27:28:89:237:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of policies and characteristics. 
4:82:5153:28:27:89:488:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Section I discusses our procedures for using international survey data from 
4:83:5229:27:28:89:505:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:International Social Survey Program (ISSP 1991 and 1998) and World Values Survey 
4:84:5310:28:27:89:490:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(WVS 2001) to estimate country averages of religious-conversion rates.  Section II 
4:85:5393:27:28:89:524:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constructs a theoretical framework based on individual choice to consider determinants of 
4:86:5483:28:28:89:518:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:country-level religious-conversion rates.  Section III describes the setup of our empirical 
4:87:5575:28:27:89:467:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:analysis.  Section IV presents our empirical findings.  Section V has summary 
4:88:5653:27:28:89:156:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observations.

5:94:5712:27:28:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The present analysis assesses the determinants of religious conversion across a 
5:95:5792:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:broad sample of countries.1  We use the waves on religion from the International Social 
5:96:5880:27:28:90:516:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Survey Program (ISSP) for 1991 and 1998 and the World Values Survey (WVS) around 
5:97:5961:28:28:90:502:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2001 to measure and analyze religious-conversion rates in 40 countries.  Our analysis 
5:98:6047:28:27:90:437:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:focuses on country averages of conversion rates from the three surveys. 
5:99:6119:27:28:90:523:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The underlying sample sizes for the two ISSP waves were typically between 1000 
5:100:6198:28:27:90:516:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and 2000 persons per country, though larger samples applied in a few cases.  The dating 
5:101:6286:27:28:90:496:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the field work for the ISSP 1991 survey was in 1990 or 1991, except for 1993 for 
5:102:6370:28:28:90:505:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Australia.  The ISSP 1998 survey applied mostly to 1996 or 1997, except for 1995 for 
5:103:6455:28:27:90:505:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Slovenia and 1998 for Switzerland.  The ISSP provides good background information 
5:104:6537:27:28:90:496:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:about the nature of the randomized sampling procedures used in the various country 
5:105:6620:28:27:90:508:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:surveys.  The WVS 2001 wave was similar to the ISSP in sample sizes, but samples of 
5:106:6704:27:28:89:513:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fewer than 1000 persons were collected in a few cases.  The dating of the WVS surveys 
5:107:6790:28:27:90:517:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:was between 1999 and 2002.  The nature of the randomized sampling procedures for the 
5:108:6875:27:28:90:325:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:WVS is less well documented than for the ISSP. 
5:109:6922:28:28:90:486:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Iannaccone (2003) used the ISSP data to assess long-term trends in church 
5:110:6996:28:27:90:504:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attendance for 32 countries.  He constructed these trends from retrospective questions 
5:111:7083:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concerning attendance rates for respondents and their parents when the respondents were 
5:112:7171:28:41:90:519:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aged 11 or 12.  Because the respondents were surveyed around 1991 and 1998 at various 
5:113:7257:41:7:90:237:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
5:114:7305:7:16:90:507:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:1 One previous cross-country analysis of religious conversion is Duke, Johnson, and Duke (1993).  This 
5:115:7408:16:12:89:487:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:study uses time series on religion adherence from Barrett (1982) to construct estimates of religious-
5:116:7509:12:11:89:515:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:conversion rates.  The problem is that changes in the stock of adherents over time within a country reflect 
5:117:7617:11:12:89:510:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:demographic factors (births, deaths, and international migration by religion type), as well as net changes 
5:118:7724:12:11:90:519:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:due to religious conversion.  It is not possible to use these data to get accurate estimates of gross flows due 
5:119:7836:11:0:90:187:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:to religious conversion. 
6:120:7862:0:27:90:518:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ages 16 and over, the retrospective questions provided information on church attendance 
6:121:7950:27:28:90:230:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for varying dates in the past. 
6:122:7981:28:27:90:502:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Inspired by the Iannaccone approach, we use different retrospective questions 
6:123:8059:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from ISSP 1991 and 1998 and WVS 2001 to calculate religious-conversion rates.  We use 
6:124:8145:28:28:90:517:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the questions that ask about a person’s current and former religion adherence.  The ISSP 
6:125:8234:28:27:90:508:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:asks straightforwardly about a person’s form of religion adherence currently and when 
6:126:8320:27:28:90:477:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:being raised.  The lists include an array of religion types as well as no religion.   
6:127:8406:28:27:90:488:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The WVS questions are less well designed.  People are first asked a yes-no 
6:128:8481:27:28:90:510:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:question about whether they belong currently to a religious denomination.  We use this 
6:129:8568:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:question to determine the people who currently have no religion.  Then the respondents 
6:130:8655:28:27:90:495:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are asked a separate question where they are supposed to select the current religious 
6:131:8741:27:28:90:494:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:denomination, if any, from a list of types.  A minor problem is that the total number 
6:132:8827:28:27:90:487:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:designating a religion type in the second question does not quite correspond to the 
6:133:8911:27:28:90:477:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:number saying that they belong to a religious denomination in the first question. 
6:134:8993:28:27:90:521:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: A more serious deficiency concerns former denomination.  Persons who currently 
6:135:9072:27:28:90:488:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have no religious denomination were asked whether they were ever a member of a 
6:136:9151:28:28:90:517:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious denomination.  These answers allow us to match people who currently have no 
6:137:9237:28:27:90:497:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion with their former status.  Persons who currently are a member of a religious 
6:138:9323:27:28:90:478:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:denomination were asked whether they were ever a member of another religious 
6:139:9400:28:27:90:520:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:denomination.  This question allows us to match up the current and former denomination 
6:140:9487:27:28:90:507:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for people who have two different denominations.  The difficulty is that we cannot tell 
6:141:9575:28:28:90:512:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:whether persons who say “no” in the second case were previously in the same religious 
6:142:9661:28:0:90:324:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:denomination or had no religious denomination. 
7:143:9709:0:27:90:520:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In any event, the ISSP and WVS information allows us to compute the number of 
7:144:9787:27:28:90:524:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:persons whose current and former religious affiliations differ, if we consider persons with 
7:145:9879:28:27:90:501:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:some religious adherence at both dates.  Note that we observe only the religion at the 
7:146:9966:27:28:90:506:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time of the survey and the former time.  Thus, from ISSP, differences between current 
7:147:10052:28:28:89:499:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and childhood religion imply that at least one religious conversion occurred between 
7:148:10137:28:27:90:511:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:childhood and the current age.  For WVS, a person who indicated ever having a former 
7:149:10222:27:28:90:516:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion must have had at least one religious conversion at some point before the current 
7:150:10312:28:27:90:375:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:age.  We cannot detect multiple conversions in these data.2 
7:151:10371:27:28:90:485:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In addition to calculating religion changes, we computed flows from some 
7:152:10444:28:28:90:513:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion to none and no religion to some, subject to the difficulties already noted for the 
7:153:10536:28:27:90:521:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:WVS information.  However, these data pertain to overall religiousness and, therefore, to 
7:154:10626:27:28:90:522:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measures of religiosity considered in McCleary and Barro (2006) and other cross-country 
7:155:10714:28:27:90:512:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:studies.  Our present empirical investigation relates not to changes in overall religiosity 
7:156:10806:27:28:90:478:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:but rather to shifts of affiliation among persons professing some kind of religion 
7:157:10889:28:27:90:145:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adherence. 
7:158:10900:27:28:90:501:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We focus on movements across major religion groups, rather than less drastic 
7:159:10977:28:28:90:485:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:switches of denomination within a major type, such as between forms of mainline 
7:160:11057:28:27:90:517:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Protestantism.  To get a consistent sample from our three data sources (the two waves of 
7:161:11146:27:28:90:500:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the ISSP and the one wave of the WVS), we had to aggregate the underlying religion 
7:162:11229:28:27:90:487:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:types to an eight-way classification:  Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Hindu, Eastern 
7:163:11313:27:37:90:435:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Religion (including Buddhist), Jewish, Orthodox, and Other Religion.   
7:164:11384:37:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
7:165:11432:7:16:90:513:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:2 For the United States, the General Social Survey (GSS) religion module for 1988 asked questions about 
7:166:11536:16:12:89:514:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:multiple religious conversions.  Among persons with at least one change (by the time of the survey), 67% 
7:167:11641:12:11:89:523:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:indicated one change, 25% two, and 8% three or more.  These changes include movements into or out of no 
7:168:11745:11:0:89:371:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:religion, as well as shifts within a major group, such as Protestantism. 
8:169:11819:0:27:90:487:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The main difficulty in implementing the eight-way breakdown of religions 
8:170:11892:27:28:90:518:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consistently involves the Other Religion category.  Depending on the level of detail used 
8:171:11982:28:27:90:515:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in each survey, “Other Religion” includes different sets of residual groups.  A particular 
8:172:12073:27:28:90:500:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concern is that, in some of the underlying data, Other Christian includes independent 
8:173:12159:28:28:90:523:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Christian churches, which are likely to be largely evangelical, whereas in other data, most 
8:174:12251:28:27:90:503:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:independent Christian churches are subsumed in the Protestant category.  Since many 
8:175:12335:27:28:90:483:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion transitions in recent years involve movements into independent Christian 
8:176:12417:28:27:90:497:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:churches (from Protestant as well as other religions), this distinction is important for 
8:177:12506:27:28:90:500:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:obtaining consistent estimates of conversion rates across data sets.  We address these 
8:178:12593:28:28:90:498:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concerns by constructing alternative measures of conversion rates based on different 
8:179:12678:28:27:90:505:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:groupings of the underlying religion types.  We also consider a seven-way breakdown 
8:180:12762:27:28:90:523:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that excludes the Other Religion category entirely in the computation of conversions.  We 
8:181:12852:28:27:90:431:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:find that our main results are robust to these alternative classifications. 
8:182:12928:27:28:90:501:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The ISSP and WVS surveys indicate the current age of the respondent, where 
8:183:13003:28:27:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:persons aged 16 and over were included in the surveys.  Therefore, if the current religious 
8:184:13095:27:28:90:509:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:affiliation differs from the former affiliation, we know that a person currently of age A 
8:185:13185:28:28:90:507:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:had a religious conversion sometime before age A.  However, we do not know exactly 
8:186:13268:28:27:90:233:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:when the transition occurred. 
8:187:13298:27:28:90:496:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Previous research and data provide some information on when in a life cycle 
8:188:13374:28:27:90:505:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious conversion typically takes place.  Iannaccone (1990, pp. 301-302) finds that, 
8:189:13462:27:28:89:526:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among converts to Catholicism in the United States, about 85% converted before age 30.3  
8:190:13551:28:20:90:524:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The General Social Survey (GSS) religion module for 1988 indicates that, among persons 
8:191:13638:20:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
8:192:13686:8:16:90:492:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:3One difficulty is that the surveys include persons of various ages—converts who were young when 
8:193:13783:16:11:90:516:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:surveyed could not possibly have converted when old.  In addition, the conversions include shifts from no 
8:194:13889:11:0:90:134:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:religion.    
9:195:13903:0:27:90:512:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with at least one religion change, the breakdown of ages for a person’s first change was 
9:196:13992:27:28:90:513:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:76% before age 30, 15% between 30 and 39, and 9% at 40 or over.4  Need and de Graaf 
9:197:14076:28:27:90:511:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1996, p. 93) find for the Netherlands that most people who leave the church act before 
9:198:14164:27:28:90:506:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:age 30.  However, this evidence applies to apostasy, not to conversion among types of 
9:199:14250:28:28:90:133:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion. 
9:200:14260:28:27:90:516:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The concentration of religious conversions at ages less than 30 is consistent with 
9:201:14343:27:28:90:514:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:an important role for inter-marriage in the conversion process, as emphasized by Lehrer 
9:202:14431:28:27:90:511:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1998) and Sherkat (2004).  According to the GSS 1988 religion module for the United 
9:203:14516:27:28:90:486:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:States, the reasons given for a person’s first religion change break down into 37% 
9:204:14599:28:28:90:513:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mentioning marriage or family, 25% indicating friends or location, 18% citing issues of 
9:205:14687:28:27:90:522:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:theology, and 19% giving other reasons.  Thus, inter-marriage is likely to be an important 
9:206:14778:27:28:90:470:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:but not overriding element in religious conversion at least in the United States. 
9:207:14860:28:27:90:514:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To accord with the observed patterns by age, we focus our empirical analysis on 
9:208:14940:27:28:90:498:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious-conversion rates applicable to persons aged 30 and over at the time of each 
9:209:15026:28:27:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:survey.  Thus, we concentrate on estimates of completed lifetime conversion rates; that is, 
9:210:15118:27:28:90:497:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates that apply over the typical person’s lifetime.  However, our results are not very 
9:211:15206:28:28:90:490:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different if we look instead at the broader group of persons aged 16 and over at the 
9:212:15291:28:27:90:168:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sampling dates. 
9:213:15307:27:28:90:514:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The total number of persons, T, surveyed in a given wave break down into those 
9:214:15386:28:27:90:491:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:who, at an earlier time, adhered to various types of religions, R1, R2, ..., and those 
9:215:15473:27:28:90:522:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:expressing no religion adherence, N.  For illustrative purposes, suppose that there are just 
9:216:15566:28:20:90:235:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:two types of religions, so that 
9:217:15598:20:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
9:218:15646:8:16:90:500:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:4These data have the same issue of age sampling as that described in n. 3.  Also, these GSS transitions 
9:219:15750:16:11:90:473:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:include movements into or out of no religion, as well as switches within a major group, such as 
9:220:15846:11:0:90:155:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Protestantism.   
10:221:15864:0:27:90:322:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: (1)   T = R1 + R2 + N. 
10:222:15885:27:28:90:503:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In comparing with current (survey-date) adherence, denoted by asterisks, nine 
10:223:15963:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:transitions are possible:  R1→R1*, R1→R2*, R1→N*, R2→R2*, R2→R1*, R2→N*, 
10:224:16036:27:28:89:513:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:N→N*, N→R1*, and N→R2*.  We view religious conversion as comprising R1→R2* 
10:225:16111:28:28:89:518:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and R2→R1*.  We look at the total of these two changes and do not distinguish between 
10:226:16197:28:27:89:486:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:them.  The tables that we construct provide information on apostasy, R1→N* and 
10:227:16276:27:28:89:517:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:R2→N*, and religious rebirth, N→R1* and N→R2*, but we do not study these types of 
10:228:16358:28:27:89:266:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:transitions in our statistical analysis. 
10:229:16399:27:28:89:488:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:            Let            ΔR be the sum of the two types of religious conversions, R1→R2* and 
10:230:16494:28:28:89:505:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:R2→R1*.  Then the religious-conversion rate is the ratio of ΔR to the total number of 
10:231:16580:28:27:89:373:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:persons who began with some religion adherence, R1+R2: 
10:232:16635:27:28:89:404:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:            (2)                        religious-conversion            rate            =            ΔR/(R1 + R2). 
10:233:16749:28:27:89:490:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In our analysis we use Eq. (2) to measure religious-conversion rates.  However, we 
10:234:16832:27:28:89:456:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consider the eight categories of religion mentioned before, rather than two.5 
10:235:16909:28:27:90:518:322:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1: Tables 1 and 2 describe the sample.  The statistics pertain to respondents aged 30 
10:236:16992:27:28:90:509:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and over for the countries in which the questions were asked that allow computation of 
10:237:17079:28:28:90:514:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious-conversion rates.  Table 1 has the breakdown of current religion adherence for 
10:238:17168:28:15:90:510:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the three survey waves into the eight religion types and no religion.  The ISSP samples 
10:239:17256:15:8:90:237:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
10:240:17304:8:16:90:500:216:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:5 We can implement Eq. (2) directly with the information given in the two ISSP waves.  For the WVS 
10:241:17403:16:11:90:506:200:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:wave, the wording of the questions allows us to determine the number of religion switchers, ΔR, but, as 
10:242:17507:11:12:90:518:189:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:noted before, not the breakdown of the total population between some and no religion at the earlier times.  
10:243:17615:12:11:90:518:177:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:To estimate how the sample, T, breaks down into religiously adhering, R1+R2, and not adhering, N, at the 
10:244:17720:11:12:90:511:166:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:earlier times, we need to know the fraction of the population with no religion adherence, N/T, during the 
10:245:17826:12:11:90:517:154:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:various prior years.  We estimated the N/T values by using population non-religion fractions from Barrett, 
10:246:17933:11:12:90:496:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Kurian, and Johnson (2001) for 2000 and 1970.  First, we related the Barrett values for 2000 to those 
10:247:18035:12:11:90:512:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:observed for the current survey date from the 2001 WVS.  The correlation was high (0.75), but the WVS 
10:248:18137:11:12:90:520:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:values for N/T were systematically higher than the Barrett values, by 0.12 on average.  We therefore added 
10:249:18244:12:11:90:518:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:0.12 to the Barrett N/T data for 1970 to estimate the WVS non-religion fraction for the earlier dates.  With 
10:250:18353:11:12:90:502:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:these estimates, we can compute religious-conversion rates for WVS data from Eq. (2).  Since the N/T 
10:251:18454:12:11:90:499:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:values are much less than one, alternative estimates for these ratios tend not to have a large impact on 
10:252:18559:11:0:90:247:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:computed religious-convergence rates. 
11:253:18598:0:27:90:514:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are dominated by Christians—Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox—but the 1998 survey 
11:254:18681:27:28:90:523:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:has substantial Jewish representation. The WVS sample has relatively more Orthodox but 
11:255:18768:28:27:89:502:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:still has little representation among Muslim, Hindu, and Eastern Religion.  The Other 
11:256:18854:27:28:89:517:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Religion category is around 3% of the adhering population for all three surveys.  The no-
11:257:18943:28:28:89:510:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion percentages are high, ranging from 21% for ISSP 1998 to 30% for WVS 2001. 
11:258:19026:28:27:89:510:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 2 shows matrices of religion transitions for respondents aged 30 and over 
11:259:19106:27:28:89:486:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for the aggregate of countries included in each survey.  Each row corresponds to a 
11:260:19189:28:27:89:499:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:particular former religion, as shown in the left-most column.  The next nine columns 
11:261:19274:27:28:89:512:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correspond to eight current religions or to no current religion.  As an example, for ISSP 
11:262:19364:28:28:89:513:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1998, among the 13,620 persons who had Catholic as their former religion (while being 
11:263:19450:28:27:90:515:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:raised), 11,663 were still Catholic at the time of the survey, 264 were Protestant, 2 were 
11:264:19541:27:28:90:507:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Muslim, 1 was Hindu, 9 had Eastern Religion (including Buddhist), 10 were Jewish, 2 
11:265:19625:28:27:89:489:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:were Orthodox, 143 were in Other Religion, and 1526 had no religion adherence.   
11:266:19706:27:28:90:495:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 2 also includes analogous information for ISSP 1991 and WVS 2001.  
11:267:19779:28:27:90:516:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However, as already noted (n.5), the wording of the WVS questions makes it difficult to 
11:268:19867:27:28:90:487:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fill-in all of the cells in the WVS religion-transition matrix.  The notes to the table 
11:269:19955:28:28:89:500:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:describe our procedures for estimating the numbers that cannot be computed directly 
11:270:20039:28:27:90:214:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from the survey answers. 
11:271:20064:27:28:90:523:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Our cross-country analysis focuses on the country-wide religious-conversion rates 
11:272:20146:28:27:89:492:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shown by country and survey wave for persons aged 30 and over in columns 1-3 of 
11:273:20226:27:28:89:519:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Table 3.  Among the 40 countries covered, 13 are in ISSP 1991, 29 in ISSP 1998, and 22 
11:274:20313:28:28:89:487:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in WVS 2001.  The conversion rates shown correspond to the structure of religion 
11:275:20394:28:0:89:373:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:categories indicated by the transition matrices in Table 2.   
12:276:20458:0:27:90:510:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Because of the ambiguities mentioned before in the categories “Protestant” and 
12:277:20537:27:28:90:515:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“Other Religion,” we also computed religious-conversion rates in two alternative ways.  
12:278:20625:28:27:90:483:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The first alternative re-labels any Christian groups contained in the other-religion 
12:279:20710:27:28:90:502:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:category as Protestant.  For example, for the WVS survey for Sweden, the alternative 
12:280:20795:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:procedure classifies “Free Church/non-conformist/Evangelical” as Protestant, rather than 
12:281:20884:28:27:90:516:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Other Religion.  This change eliminates most of the conversions recorded for Sweden in 
12:282:20971:27:28:90:520:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the WVS 2001 survey—the religious-conversion rate falls from 0.076, shown in Table 3, 
12:283:21057:28:27:90:518:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:column 3, to 0.016.  The principal other changes from the alternative method are for two 
12:284:21146:27:28:90:510:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cases in ISSP 1998:  for Norway, the conversion rate falls from 0.031 to 0.002, and for 
12:285:21234:28:28:90:324:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:New Zealand, the rate falls from 0.145 to 0.096. 
12:286:21283:28:27:90:501:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The second alternative excludes the Other Religion category entirely, thereby 
12:287:21361:27:28:90:486:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:labeling as religious conversions only transitions that involve the remaining seven 
12:288:21445:28:27:90:515:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion types.  That is, we excluded transitions that had Other Religion as the former or 
12:289:21536:27:28:90:514:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:current affiliation.  (In this alternative classification, we retained the Protestant category 
12:290:21631:28:27:90:513:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as defined in the original specification.)  This second approach likely goes much too far 
12:291:21721:27:28:90:494:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in limiting changes recorded as conversions.  As can be seen from Table 2, the total 
12:292:21806:28:28:90:491:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:number of conversions falls from 1788 to 854—that is, 52% of the conversions are 
12:293:21887:28:27:90:502:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:eliminated.  In terms of conversion rates, the mean falls from 0.045 to 0.024 for ISSP 
12:294:21974:27:28:90:488:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1991, from 0.050 to 0.024 for ISSP 1998, and from 0.023 to 0.009 for WVS 2001. 
12:295:22053:28:27:90:473:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Despite the large changes in levels of conversion rates, the patterns of religious 
12:296:22136:27:28:90:497:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion across countries remain similar—the correlation of the log of the revised 
12:297:22221:28:28:90:510:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion rates (with Other Religion excluded) with the original ones is 0.93 for ISSP 
12:298:22309:28:0:90:339:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1991, 0.71 for ISSP 1998, and 0.62 for WVS 2001. 
13:299:22360:0:27:90:511:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: For the data in Table 3, the correlations of the logs of religious-conversion rates 
13:300:22444:27:28:90:506:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among countries sampled more than once are 0.81 between ISSP 1991 and ISSP 1998 
13:301:22524:28:27:90:523:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(12 countries) and 0.63 between ISSP 1998 and WVS 2001 (also 12 countries).  For ISSP 
13:302:22610:27:28:90:523:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1991 and WVS 2001, the correlation is 0.96, but only 5 countries appear in both surveys.  
13:303:22700:28:28:90:516:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We have concerns about the reliability of the WVS information on religious conversion, 
13:304:22787:28:27:90:524:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:partly because of shortcomings in the questions related to religion adherence (see n. 5 and 
13:305:22879:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:notes to Table 2) and, more generally, because of ambiguities in the sampling procedures 
13:306:22968:28:27:90:212:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employed by the WVS.   
13:307:22991:27:28:90:488:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: For the 12 countries represented in ISSP 1998 and WVS 2001, the average 
13:308:23063:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion rates are 0.034 from ISSP 1998 and 0.022 from WVS 2001, with respective 
13:309:23146:28:27:90:483:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:standard deviations of 0.033 and 0.022.  Since we view the ISSP surveys as more 
13:310:23226:27:28:90:492:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:accurate, we think that the WVS 2001 data systematically understate the extent and 
13:311:23309:28:27:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variability of conversion rates.  Despite the problems with the WVS data, we are reluctant 
13:312:23400:27:28:90:512:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to drop these observations, because we think they provide incremental information.  To 
13:313:23487:28:27:90:484:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:retain all the data while addressing concerns about varying data quality across the 
13:314:23571:27:28:90:511:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:surveys, we allow in the regression analysis for differences in intercepts and error-term 
13:315:23661:28:28:90:378:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variances for observations from the different survey waves. 
13:316:23721:28:27:90:498:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The average religious-conversion rates, shown in Table 3, are 0.045 for ISSP 
13:317:23798:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1991 (N=13), 0.050 for ISSP 1998 (N=29), and 0.023 for WVS 2001 (N=22).  There is a 
13:318:23882:28:27:90:495:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substantial range of conversion rates across countries, as indicated by the respective 
13:319:23969:27:28:90:523:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:standard deviations of 0.033, 0.050, and 0.019. The countries with conversion rates above 
13:320:24059:28:28:90:511:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:10% are Canada (17% in ISSP 1998), the United States (16% in ISSP 1998 and 12% in 
13:321:24141:28:0:90:508:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ISSP 1991), New Zealand (14% in ISSP 1998), and Chile (13% in ISSP 1998).  Those 
14:322:24224:0:27:90:512:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with conversion rates below 1% are Finland (0.2% in WVS), Romania (0.2% in WVS), 
14:323:24305:27:28:90:499:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Slovenia (0.3% in WVS, 0.6% in ISSP 1991, 0.7% in ISSP 1998), Bulgaria (0.2% in 
14:324:24385:28:27:89:524:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:WVS and 0.4% in ISSP 1998), Spain (0.4% in ISSP 1998 and 0.6% in WVS), Italy (0.5%

14:328:24625:27:28:89:233:543:144:Times:144:Times:II.  Theoretical Framework 
14:329:24652:28:27:89:518:515:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1: This section works out a simple theoretical model to provide a framework for the 
14:330:24733:27:28:89:487:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:subsequent empirical analysis.  We focus on hypotheses about the determinants of 
14:331:24814:28:28:89:315:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious-conversion rates at the country level. 
14:332:24863:28:27:89:511:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Suppose that m religion types exist in a country.  If the religions can be ordered 
14:333:24946:27:28:89:495:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by a single characteristic, such as strictness, we can array the types zi along a line at 
14:334:25036:28:27:90:495:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:positions z1, ..., zm, where one of these types can represent no religion.  Differences 
14:335:25124:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between religion types are then represented by horizontal distances.  Alternatively, the 
14:336:25213:28:27:90:473:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:types could be arranged around a circle.  In this case, the arc-distances measure 
14:337:25295:27:28:90:491:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:differences between religions, but there is no sense in which any particular religion 
14:338:25381:28:28:90:488:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:exhibits the lowest or highest amount of something like strictness.  (We could also 
14:339:25465:28:27:90:317:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:generalize to multiple religion characteristics.) 
14:340:25515:27:28:90:520:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Individual j is “born” (corresponding, perhaps, to the end of dependent childhood 
14:341:25597:28:27:90:518:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:at age 16) with religion adherence of type xj.  This type corresponds to one of the zi.  Let 
14:342:25690:27:28:90:489:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(xj)* represent person j’s ideal type of religion at a point in time.  Because religion 
14:343:25778:28:28:90:520:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:preferences are shaped by family and neighborhood upbringing, xj will typically be close 
14:344:25867:28:0:90:527:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to (xj)* at the time of “birth.”  However, religion preferences, (xj)*, can change over time.  
15:345:25964:0:27:90:518:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We assume that they evolve randomly, following a process with positive variance but no 
15:346:26051:27:28:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:systematic trend.  The variance of the random process is important for determining the 
15:347:26138:28:27:90:509:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:frequency of religious conversion, but we assume in applications of the model that this 
15:348:26226:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variance is the same across time and place.  Given this variance, the optimally determined 
15:349:26317:28:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:frequency of religion switching will depend on two factors:  the cost of switching and the 
15:350:26408:28:27:90:521:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cost of having xj deviate from (xj)*.  A higher switching cost results in a lower frequency 
15:351:26500:27:28:90:479:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of conversion, whereas a larger cost of deviation results in a higher frequency of 
15:352:26583:28:27:90:149:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion. 
15:353:26595:27:28:90:516:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In the simplest setting, the cost of changing religion for person j is the lump-sum 
15:354:26679:28:28:90:463:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:amount γj, independently of which religion pairs enter into the change.  More 
15:355:26757:28:27:90:501:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:realistically, this cost would depend on which pair of religions applies.  For example, 
15:356:26845:27:28:89:522:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:switches to neighboring religions will typically be less costly than movements to faraway 
15:357:26935:28:27:90:489:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religions.  Moreover, some religions may have higher or lower costs of entering or 
15:358:27018:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:leaving.  In any case, the cost γj depends on individual and country-wide variables.  At 
15:359:27107:28:27:90:521:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the individual level, one determinant of γj is education.  More educated people likely find 
15:360:27199:27:28:90:521:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:it easier to change religions because they are better at learning and adjusting to new ways 
15:361:27291:28:28:90:498:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of thinking.  The better educated likely also have more information about alternative 
15:362:27377:28:27:90:490:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religions and more contact with people of other religions.  At the country level, the 
15:363:27463:27:28:90:487:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:switching cost depends on government regulations; for example, legal or religious 
15:364:27545:28:27:89:466:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:restrictions on conversion raise γj for all persons j within the affected country. 
15:365:27628:27:28:90:523:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The cost of having xj deviate from (xj)* depends on the location of other available 
15:366:27712:28:28:90:504:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religions.  For example, if xj is a given distance from (xj)*, the benefit from switching 
15:367:27802:28:0:90:517:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:will be greater the closer an alternative religion, one of the zi, to (xj)*.  The suitability of 
16:368:27901:0:27:90:504:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:alternative religions to the preferences of the typical individual tends to be greater the 
16:369:27992:27:28:89:515:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher the density of the available religions in a country.  The idea, as in Gruber (2005), 
16:370:28084:28:27:89:513:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is that the greater the concentration of the nearby population in a particular religion, the 
16:371:28177:27:28:89:477:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:smaller the costs for each member to participate in that religion.  Thus, the more 
16:372:28260:28:28:89:491:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pluralistic a country’s religion market, the higher the typical benefit from making a 
16:373:28346:28:27:89:499:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:switch—or, equivalently, the higher the cost of allowing one’s current religion, xj, to 
16:374:28434:27:28:89:182:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deviate from (xj)*. 
16:375:28454:28:27:90:523:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The available religions in a country need not be fixed over time.  For example, the 
16:376:28538:27:28:90:504:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rise of Evangelicalism in many places made it less costly for persons to belong to that 
16:377:28626:28:28:90:524:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:faith.  In the model, we could represent this change by introducing at some point in time a 
16:378:28718:28:27:90:498:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shift to a more pluralistic religion market.  This kind of change would induce a large 
16:379:28805:27:28:90:487:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:amount of religious conversion as a temporary response to the market innovation.  
16:380:28887:28:27:90:493:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Formally, we would predict that religious conversion would depend not only on the 
16:381:28969:27:28:89:515:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:current level of religious pluralism (a steady-state effect) but also on past changes in the 
16:382:29062:28:27:90:207:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:extent of this pluralism. 
16:383:29088:27:28:90:507:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The cost of deviation from one’s ideal religion type depends on how important 
16:384:29166:28:28:90:519:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:formal religion is overall.  That is, for given locations of available religions, the cost of a 
16:385:29262:28:27:90:520:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deviation of xj from (xj)* will be greater the more important formal religion is to people.  
16:386:29355:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:For example, our sample of 40 countries includes 14 that were formerly Communist (but 
16:387:29441:28:27:90:515:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:none that were Communist at the time of the surveys).  Communist governments sought 
16:388:29525:27:28:90:491:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to diminish the overall value attached to religious participation and beliefs (see, for 
16:389:29613:28:28:90:502:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example, Froese and Pfaff [2001]).  To the extent that this political influence remains 
16:390:29701:28:0:89:519:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effective after the demise of Communism, the value of religion would be smaller and the 
17:391:29791:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cost of deviations of xj from (xj)* would be lower.  In contrast, education has been argued 
17:392:29883:27:28:90:488:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to raise the benefits of religion through its networking role (Sacerdote and Glaeser 
17:393:29968:28:27:90:523:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:[2001]).  This effect implies that more education would raise the cost of a given deviation 
17:394:30060:27:28:90:174:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of xj from (xj)*.   
17:395:30080:28:28:89:501:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The secularization hypothesis argues that higher per capita income, which we 
17:396:30157:28:27:89:487:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gauge at the country level by real per capita GDP, lowers the demand for religion, 
17:397:30240:27:28:90:508:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measured by participation in formal services and religious beliefs.  (See McCleary and 
17:398:30327:28:27:90:475:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Barro [2006] for an overview and cross-country empirical evidence.)  From this 
17:399:30406:27:28:89:503:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:perspective, higher per capita income would reduce the cost of a given deviation of xj 
17:400:30492:28:28:90:492:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from (xj)*.  However, although the evidence suggests that higher per capita income 
17:401:30575:28:27:90:493:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lowers religious participation and beliefs, an increase in per capita income need not 
17:402:30661:27:28:90:507:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reduce amounts spent per person on religion, and this spending variable is the relevant 
17:403:30749:28:27:90:508:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure of the value placed on formal religion.  Therefore, the predicted impact of per 
17:404:30837:27:28:90:447:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:capita GDP on the cost of a given deviation of xj from (xj)* is ambiguous. 
17:405:30912:28:27:90:456:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Our theoretical framework is analogous to (S,s) models of inventory 
17:406:30980:27:28:90:499:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:accumulation, as applied previously in many contexts.  An individual who optimizes 
17:407:31063:28:28:90:507:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion choices would allow (xj)* to evolve to some extent away from xj.  However, a 
17:408:31149:28:27:89:520:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sufficient deviation—that is, the attainment of a critical gap—triggers the payment of the 
17:409:31240:27:28:89:515:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lump-sum adjustment cost, γj, and the choice of a new religion, xj, that is closer than the 
17:410:31332:28:27:89:504:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:former one to the current (xj)*.  The frequency of these changes in a country’s overall 
17:411:31420:27:28:90:488:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population will be greater the lower the typical γj and the higher the typical cost of 
17:412:31507:28:28:90:520:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deviations of xj from (xj)*.  In our empirical analysis, we gauge the frequency of religion 
17:413:31599:28:0:90:512:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change by the fraction of the adhering population that undergoes a religious conversion 
18:414:31689:0:27:90:505:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by age 30.  Given the previous discussion, the model predicts that this conversion rate 
18:415:31777:27:29:90:177:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:will be higher if:6 
18:416:31796:29:28:111:373:652:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:• a country has a higher level of religious pluralism, 
18:417:31850:28:29:111:423:624:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:• a country shifted recently toward greater religious pluralism, 
18:418:31914:29:28:111:425:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:• a country lacks religious and legal restrictions on conversion, 
18:419:31979:28:28:111:330:567:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:• a country lacks a history of Communism, 
18:420:32020:28:28:111:384:539:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:• a country has higher average educational attainment. 
18:421:32074:28:28:90:522:511:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Higher per capita GDP has an ambiguous effect on the frequency of religious conversion. 
18:422:32162:28:27:90:492:483:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We can augment the basic model to allow for inter-marriage.  Marriage to a 
18:423:32237:27:28:90:516:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:partner of a different religion tends to generate a jump in ideal religion type, (xj)*, at the 
18:424:32332:28:27:90:499:428:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time of marriage.  That is, a spouse’s strong incentive to match the partner’s religion 
18:425:32420:27:28:90:491:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:generates a lot of religious conversion around the time of inter-marriage.  A deeper 
18:426:32505:28:28:90:496:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:analysis would treat inter-marriage as endogenous, along the lines of Lehrer (1998), 
18:427:32590:28:27:90:513:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:taking account of the costs of having different religions and of making shifts in religion 
18:428:32681:27:28:90:501:318:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adherence.  For present purposes, an important point is that the incorporation of inter-
18:429:32769:28:27:90:493:290:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:marriage leaves intact the predictions worked out before for the determinants of the 
18:430:32854:27:28:90:258:263:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:frequency of religious conversion. 
18:431:32889:28:28:90:93:235:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
18:432:32889:28:41:90:93:207:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
18:433:32889:41:7:90:237:166:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
18:434:32937:7:16:90:523:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:6 An increase in the variance of the religion-preference shock raises the frequency of conversion for a given 
18:435:33047:16:12:90:502:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:setting of the critical gap.  However, a higher variance also motivates people to increase the size of the 
18:436:33154:12:11:90:522:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:critical gap.  This last response reduces the frequency of conversion.  Typically, this second effect will only 
18:437:33266:11:12:90:521:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:partially offset the first effect; that is, a higher variance of preferences results, on net, in a higher frequency 
18:438:33382:12:11:90:523:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:of conversion.  For a derivation in an analogous context (the frequency of price change when these changes 
18:439:33489:11:12:90:484:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:entail lump-sum adjustment costs), see Barro (1972, Eq. [22]).  This finding would add additional 
18:440:33587:12:11:90:510:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:hypotheses to our list if we could identify variables that influence the variance of the religion-preference 
18:441:33696:11:0:90:342:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:shock.  However, we have not made progress in this direction. 
19:442:33760:0:27:90:278:708:144:Times:144:Times:III.  Setup of the Empirical Analysis 
19:443:33798:27:28:90:523:681:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1: We use a regression system with three equations.  The dependent variables are the 
19:444:33880:28:27:89:523:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:logs of religious-conversion rates computed from ISSP 1991, ISSP 1998, and WVS 2001, 
19:445:33965:27:28:89:519:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as shown in Table 3.7  Estimates are by the seemingly-unrelated technique, which allows 
19:446:34053:28:28:90:505:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the error variances to differ for the three samples and for the residuals to be correlated 
19:447:34144:28:27:90:489:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:across survey waves for a given country.  Each equation also has its own intercept, 
19:448:34228:27:28:90:512:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:thereby allowing for differences across surveys in measured levels of conversion rates.  
19:449:34317:28:27:90:493:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Aside from the different intercepts, the coefficients of the explanatory variables are 
19:450:34404:27:28:90:368:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constrained to be the same across the three survey waves. 
19:451:34462:28:28:90:484:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 4 shows means and standard deviations for the variables used in the 
19:452:34536:28:27:90:510:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression systems.  The first three columns apply to the regression samples, which are 
19:453:34624:27:28:90:517:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dictated mainly by the availability of the religious-conversion data.  For comparison, the 
19:454:34715:28:27:90:494:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:last three columns give means and standard deviations for much broader samples of 
19:455:34797:27:28:90:501:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries.  All means apply to unweighted samples; that is, each country receives the 
19:456:34883:28:27:90:365:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:same weight irrespective of population, GDP, and so on. 
19:457:34939:27:28:90:498:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The independent variables correspond to the hypotheses from the framework 
19:458:35013:28:28:90:510:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:described before.  The religious-pluralism variable is based on a breakdown of religion 
19:459:35101:28:27:90:515:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adherence for 1970 from Barrett, Kurian, and Johnson (2001); henceforth, referred to as 
19:460:35189:27:69:90:516:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Barrett.  We use an eight-way breakdown of religion types, corresponding to the one we 
19:461:35276:69:7:90:237:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
19:462:35324:7:16:90:518:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:7 The log form appropriately restricts the conversion rate to non-negative values.  (No zero values occur in 
19:463:35433:16:12:89:489:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:our main sample but do arise in several cases when we exclude Other Religion in the calculation of 
19:464:35532:12:11:89:518:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:conversion rates.  For the regressions with this alternative religious-conversion rate, we used the log of the 
19:465:35643:11:12:89:513:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:conversion rate plus 0.001.)  We could use a logistic form, log[x/(1-x)], where x is the conversion rate, to 
19:466:35752:12:11:89:515:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:restrict the conversion rate not to exceed one.  However, since all observed values of x are much less than 
19:467:35860:11:0:89:397:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:one, the logistic form is nearly the same as the simpler log form that we use. 
20:468:35941:0:27:90:515:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:used for the ISSP and WVS surveys.8   Barrett also provides information on the fraction 
20:469:36029:27:28:90:321:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the population having no religion adherence. 
20:470:36077:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The form of the pluralism variable is suggested by a religion-matching model, 
20:471:36155:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specifically a model of marriage between persons with differing religions.  The variable 
20:472:36244:28:28:90:484:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected person with some religion 
20:473:36326:28:27:90:512:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adherence will, in a random encounter, meet a person with some, but differing, religion 
20:474:36414:27:28:90:515:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adherence.  The first concept that we employ is one minus the usual Herfindahl index of 
20:475:36502:28:27:90:520:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion shares among persons with some religion adherence.  This Herfindahl measure—
20:476:36587:27:28:90:502:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the sum of the squares of the religion-adherence shares—is appropriate if we think of 
20:477:36673:28:28:90:496:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:persons with some religion randomly encountering other persons with some, but not 
20:478:36755:28:27:90:238:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:necessarily the same, religion. 
20:479:36787:27:28:90:512:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We also consider an alternative pluralism measure that takes account of persons 
20:480:36867:28:27:90:517:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with no religion.  This measure applies if people with some religion randomly encounter 
20:481:36955:27:28:90:490:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other persons with some religion (either the same or different) or no religion.  This 
20:482:37041:28:27:90:508:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure depends partly on the composition of the adhering population across religions 
20:483:37127:27:28:90:494:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and partly on the fraction of persons with no religion.  Given the distribution across 
20:484:37214:28:28:90:511:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion types, the second variable is smaller than the first if the share of the population 
20:485:37307:28:27:90:228:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with no religion is positive.9 
20:486:37337:27:28:90:497:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: If we take account of assortative mating—persons of the same religion being 
20:487:37413:28:18:90:507:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more likely to match with each other—the probability of a religion mismatch could be 
20:488:37498:18:7:89:237:166:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
20:489:37546:7:16:90:498:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:8 Some previous uses of the Barrett adherence data, such as McCleary and Barro (2006), included the 
20:490:37646:16:12:89:498:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:category “other Christian,” which combines the Barrett categories of independent Christian churches, 
20:491:37747:12:11:89:516:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:unaffiliated Christians, and “marginal Christians.”  To approximate the ISSP-WVS eight-way scheme, we 
20:492:37849:11:7:89:451:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:merged this other Christian category with Protestant and Anglican in the Barrett numbers. 
20:493:37939:7:16:90:510:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:9 Let H be the Herfindahl index of religion concentration among persons with some religion adherence—
20:494:38040:16:12:90:506:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:that is, the sum of the squares of the religion population shares in the adhering population.  Let n be the 
20:495:38148:12:11:90:521:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:ratio of persons with no religion to the total adhering population.  Then the alternative pluralism variable is 
20:496:38260:11:0:90:312:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:given by (1-H)/(1+n), which is declining with H and n. 
21:497:38317:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substantially smaller than the number given by either of the religious-pluralism variables.  
21:498:38410:27:28:90:510:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However, the mismatch probability would still tend to be increasing with the pluralism 
21:499:38497:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variables that we use.  The religious-conversion rate would, in turn, be increasing in the 
21:500:38588:27:28:90:511:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mismatch probability and, hence, with the pluralism variables.  Although we motivated 
21:501:38674:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this linkage from inter-marriage, we would get the same result for other reasons.  That is, 
21:502:38766:28:27:90:510:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aside from marriage considerations, a greater variety of religions available in a country 
21:503:38856:27:28:90:495:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would raise the rate of religious conversion—by making it less costly for persons to 
21:504:38941:28:27:90:238:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:switch to alternative religions. 
21:505:38974:27:28:90:480:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The theory suggests that religious conversion depends on past changes in 
21:506:39047:28:28:90:498:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious pluralism, as well as the current level of pluralism.  Based on the data from 
21:507:39135:28:27:90:514:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Barrett, Kurian, and Johnson (2001), we calculated the pluralism values for 1900, 1970, 
21:508:39223:27:28:90:523:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and 2000.  Unfortunately, we lack information between 1900 and 1970.  We can compute 
21:509:39308:28:27:90:481:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the change in pluralism between 1900 and 1970 but this change likely gives little 
21:510:39390:27:28:90:500:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:information about the dynamics of pluralism that matter for our religious-conversion 
21:511:39475:28:27:90:515:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:data—which pertain to conversions not too much prior to the survey dates around 1991, 
21:512:39561:27:28:90:481:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1998, and 2001.  We can also compute from the Barrett data changes in religious 
21:513:39641:28:28:90:519:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pluralism between 1970 and 2000 (or between 1970 and 1990), but these changes cannot 
21:514:39726:28:27:90:520:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be satisfactorily regarded as exogenous with respect to the religious-conversion rates that 
21:515:39818:27:28:90:513:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:we calculated.  Therefore, at this stage, we are not optimistic about our ability to isolate 
21:516:39911:28:27:90:484:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects from past changes in religious pluralism on the observed conversion rates. 
21:517:39994:27:28:90:521:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The dummy variable for legal restrictions on religious conversion comes from the 
21:518:40075:28:28:90:519:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Religion & State Data Set compiled by Fox and Sandler (2008).  We use the information 
21:519:40161:28:0:90:502:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for 1990, the first year of their data, or for the earliest date available.  Since their data 
22:520:40257:0:27:90:512:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:show strong persistence over time in these kinds of legal restrictions, the precise date is 
22:521:40349:27:28:90:154:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not critical.   
22:522:40365:28:27:90:524:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Fox and Sandler provide four relevant indicators for legal restrictions that relate to 
22:523:40452:27:28:90:508:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious conversion:  those applying to conversion into minority religions, conversion 
22:524:40540:28:28:89:524:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:out of the majority religion, proselytizing, and inter-faith marriage.  However, none of the 
22:525:40633:28:27:89:504:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:40 countries in our religious-conversion sample have legal restrictions of the first two 
22:526:40722:27:28:89:500:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:types.  These direct restrictions on conversion tend to exist in predominantly Muslim 
22:527:40808:28:27:89:487:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries.10  Although the WVS 2001 wave contains many predominantly Muslim 
22:528:40884:27:28:90:510:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries, the questions that allow calculation of the religious-conversion rate were not 
22:529:40974:28:28:90:524:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:asked in any of these countries.  We think this omission applies because residents of these 
22:530:41066:28:27:89:514:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries would likely view a question about having a different religion earlier in life as 
22:531:41158:27:28:89:520:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:insulting, especially when it pertains to an activity that is unlawful, as well as sinful.  For 
22:532:41254:28:27:89:499:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the present analysis, we define our restrictions variable as a dummy that takes on the 
22:533:41341:27:28:89:466:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:value one if the country had in place in 1990 (or a nearby date) restrictions on 
22:534:41422:28:27:89:399:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proselytizing or inter-faith marriage.  (See Table 3 for the data.) 
22:535:41490:27:28:89:519:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Real per capita GDP in 1990 is the value in 2000 U.S. dollars from version 6.2 of

22:541:41997:25:8:89:237:132:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
22:542:42045:8:16:90:523:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:10 Among 39 countries with Muslim adherence of at least 50%, 25 have conversion restrictions either out of

22:544:42240:7:11:90:461:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:11 For Bulgaria and Lithuania, 1990 data were unavailable, and we used the values for 1995. 
22:545:42332:11:16:90:510:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:12 For Croatia, we used the 1990 value for the former Yugoslavia.  For Belarus and Ukraine, we used the 
22:546:42436:16:0:90:431:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:1990 value for Russia (which we took as representative of the former Soviet Union). 
23:547:42522:0:27:90:514:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Barro and McCleary (2005).  The regulation variable, an extension of Chaves and Cann 
23:548:42607:27:28:90:513:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1992), was based on whether the government appointed or approved religious leaders.  
23:549:42693:28:27:90:519:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The results in McCleary and Barro (2006) showed that religious participation and beliefs 
23:550:42782:27:28:90:508:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:were deterred by current and former Communism, encouraged by the presence of state 
23:551:42865:28:28:90:508:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion (interpreted as a subsidy effect), and discouraged by government regulation of 
23:552:42953:28:27:90:187:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the religion market. 
23:553:42974:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Data on monthly attendance at formal religious services, holding various religious 
23:554:43057:28:27:90:523:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:beliefs, and self-classifying as a religious person come from the survey information given 
23:555:43148:27:28:90:516:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in various waves of the WVS, ISSP, and the Gallup Millennium Survey.  These data are 
23:556:43233:28:28:90:518:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:discussed in McCleary and Barro (2006).  We use here the values from the 1990 WVS if 
23:557:43318:28:27:90:504:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these are available.  Then we fill in, as available, numbers (adjusted for differences in 
23:558:43408:27:28:90:498:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:average levels across surveys) from WVS 1981, ISSP 1991, WVS 1995, ISSP 1998, 
23:559:43486:28:27:90:209:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Gallup, and WVS 2001. 
23:560:43508:27:28:90:514:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 4 makes clear some of the selection issues related to the availability of the 
23:561:43592:28:27:90:500:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious-conversion data.  The regression sample for religious conversion comprises 
23:562:43677:27:28:90:485:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries that are substantially richer and more educated than the broad sample of 
23:563:43760:28:28:90:521:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries.  The regression sample is over-weighted toward former Communist countries.  
23:564:43847:28:27:90:478:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In terms of religion adherence, the regression sample is slanted toward Catholic, 
23:565:43929:27:28:90:492:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Protestant, Orthodox, and Jewish, and away from Muslim, Hindu, Eastern Religion 
23:566:44009:28:27:90:474:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(including Buddhist), and Other Religion.  The regression sample also has over-
23:567:44088:27:28:90:295:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:representation of persons with no religion.

24:571:44158:27:28:90:487:681:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1: Table 5, column 1 shows a baseline regression system for logs of religious-
24:572:44233:28:27:90:507:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion rates from the three survey waves.  Each of the three equations includes its 
24:573:44321:27:28:90:521:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:own intercept.  However, the estimated intercepts turn out not to differ significantly from 
24:574:44413:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:each other (p-value = 0.24).  The last two lines of the table show the fits of each equation, 
24:575:44507:28:27:90:497:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gauged by R-squared values and standard errors of estimation.  The fits for the ISSP 
24:576:44592:27:28:90:502:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:waves are similar, with R-squared values in excess of 0.7.  That for the WVS wave is 
24:577:44677:28:27:90:512:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:only 0.24; we think, again, because of the relatively poor quality of the data.  Similarly, 
24:578:44769:27:28:90:474:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the standard error for the WVS equation is much higher than those for the ISSP 
24:579:44848:28:28:90:142:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:equations. 
24:580:44859:28:27:90:522:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: As expected, the religious-pluralism variable for 1970 (calculated from adherence 
24:581:44941:27:28:90:511:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shares among the adhering population) has a significantly positive impact on the log of 
24:582:45029:28:27:90:476:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the conversion rate; the coefficient in Table 5, column 1 is 2.9 (s.e. = 0.5).  This 
24:583:45114:27:28:90:488:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:coefficient means that a one-standard-deviation increase in the religious-pluralism 
24:584:45198:28:27:90:521:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variable (by 0.19 in Table 4) raises the estimated log of the religious-convergence rate by 
24:585:45290:27:28:90:522:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.55.  That is, at the sample mean conversion rate of 0.050 (for ISSP 1998), the estimated 
24:586:45381:28:28:89:511:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:convergence rate would rise by about 70% to 0.087.  Looking at Table 3, column 4, we 
24:587:45466:28:27:90:523:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:see that low degrees of religious pluralism can explain why religious-conversion rates are 
24:588:45557:27:28:90:495:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:particularly low in Spain, Finland, Italy, Poland, and Slovenia.  In contrast, the high 
24:589:45645:28:27:90:499:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:values of the pluralism variable in Canada and the United States help to explain high 
24:590:45731:27:28:90:174:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion rates. 
24:591:45749:28:28:90:517:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: If we add the change in the religious-pluralism variable from 1900 to 1970 to the 
24:592:45831:28:0:90:524:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression system, this new variable has an estimated coefficient near zero.  We think this 
25:593:45925:0:27:90:522:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:result applies because the measured change in pluralism is too far in the past to matter for 
25:594:46018:27:28:90:518:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:our measured religious-conversion rates.  Thus, at present, our results pertain to the long-
25:595:46110:28:27:89:523:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:term relation between the structure of religion adherence and religious-convergence rates, 
25:596:46201:27:28:90:353:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not to effects from changes in the adherence structure. 
25:597:46257:28:28:90:475:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: As expected, legal restrictions that deter religious conversion (involving 
25:598:46332:28:27:90:511:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proselytizing and inter-faith marriage) have a significantly negative effect on the log of 
25:599:46423:27:28:90:505:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the conversion rate, with a coefficient in Table 5, column 1 of -0.84 (s.e. = 0.21).  The 
25:600:46513:28:27:90:509:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimated coefficient implies that the implementation of a legal restriction (moving the 
25:601:46602:27:28:90:488:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dummy variable from zero to one) reduces the estimated conversion rate by nearly 
25:602:46683:28:28:90:516:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:60%—from 0.05 to 0.02 at the sample mean for ISSP 1998.  The conversion restrictions 
25:603:46768:28:27:90:511:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that we recorded apply to 25% of the regression sample (see Tables 3 and 4).  As noted 
25:604:46855:27:28:90:503:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:before, the sample includes no predominantly Muslim countries, many of which have 
25:605:46937:28:27:90:291:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:legal restrictions on religious conversion. 
25:606:46981:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Religious conversion is significantly negatively related to former Communism, 
25:607:47059:28:27:90:514:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with a coefficient in Table 5, column 1 of -1.52 (s.e. = 0.20).  Thus, the estimated effect 
25:608:47151:27:28:90:523:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is even larger in magnitude than that from conversion restrictions.  The regression sample 
25:609:47242:28:28:90:476:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:has 35% of the observations as former Communist (Table 4).  Previous findings 
25:610:47320:28:27:90:483:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(McCleary and Barro [2006]) indicated that the influence of past Communism on 
25:611:47398:27:28:90:498:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious participation and belief decayed over time but continued to be significantly 
25:612:47485:28:27:90:513:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:negative after 10-15 years.  (See also Inglehart and Baker [2000].)  Our interpretation is 
25:613:47576:27:28:90:490:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that past Communism has a depressing influence on the value attached currently to 
25:614:47658:28:0:90:477:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:formal religion and, thereby, diminishes the propensity for religious conversion. 
26:615:47742:0:27:90:491:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The log of per capita GDP in 1990 has a negative but small and statistically 
26:616:47819:27:28:90:511:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:insignificant effect on religious-conversion rates.  The estimated coefficient in Table 5, 
26:617:47910:28:27:90:495:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:column 1 is -0.09 (s.e. = 0.19).  This result accords with the ambiguous effect noted 
26:618:47996:27:28:90:519:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:before for the effect of higher per capita income on the value attached to formal religion. 
26:619:48088:28:28:90:486:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In contrast, the variable for average years of school attainment of the adult 
26:620:48166:28:27:89:523:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population in 1990 has a significantly positive effect on religious-conversion rates, with a 
26:621:48259:27:28:90:516:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:coefficient of 0.21 (s.e. = 0.05).13  This coefficient implies that a one-standard-deviation 
26:622:48352:28:27:90:505:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase in educational attainment (by 1.6 years in the regression sample, see Table 4) 
26:623:48440:27:28:90:499:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:raises the estimated religious-conversion rate by about 40% (from 0.05 to 0.07 at the 
26:624:48526:28:28:90:480:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sample mean for ISSP 1998).  Our interpretation of the education effect from the 
26:625:48607:28:27:90:489:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:perspective of the theoretical framework is that more education reduces the cost of 
26:626:48691:27:28:90:501:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious conversion and raises the benefit from formal religion—thereby, raising the 
26:627:48777:28:27:90:272:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:propensity to convert on both counts. 
26:628:48815:27:28:90:494:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Although per capita GDP and education are highly positively correlated, the 
26:629:48891:28:27:89:509:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results show that the sample has sufficient independent movement in these variables to 
26:630:48978:27:28:90:485:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:distinguish the effects.  The estimated positive impact of education on a country’s 
26:631:49062:28:28:90:468:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religious-conversion rate accords with Loveland (2003, Table 2), who found a 
26:632:49139:28:27:90:493:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significantly positive effect from years of education on the probability of switching 
26:633:49225:27:28:90:507:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religions in U.S. data from the 1988 GSS religion module.  As a related matter, Lehrer 
26:634:49312:28:27:89:477:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1998, p. 255) and Sherkat (2004, p. 618) report positive effects of education on 
26:635:49394:27:37:90:389:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individual probabilities of inter-marriage in the United States. 
26:636:49459:37:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
26:637:49507:7:16:90:520:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:13 If we break down total years of schooling into primary, secondary, and higher, the estimated coefficients 
26:638:49616:16:12:90:522:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:in the system for religious-conversion rates are 0.19 (s.e. = 0.08) on primary, 0.23 (0.12) on secondary, and 
26:639:49726:12:11:90:509:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:0.28 (0.39) on higher.  These results accord with the hypothesis that only total years of schooling matter 
26:640:49833:11:0:90:160:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:(p-value = 0.92). 
27:641:49853:0:27:90:511:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The results are not very different if we use the alternative definition of religious 
27:642:49938:27:28:90:478:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pluralism—the one discussed before that brings in an effect from the no-religion 
27:643:50019:28:27:90:515:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population.  These results are in Table 6, column 1.  The pattern of coefficient estimates 
27:644:50110:27:28:90:491:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is similar to that in Table 5, column 1, but the fits are somewhat poorer.  We focus, 
27:645:50196:28:28:90:445:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:henceforth, on the findings with the initial form of the pluralism variable. 
27:646:50273:28:27:90:523:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 5, column 2 adds to the regression system two dummy variables concerning 
27:647:50352:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:institutional aspects of religion—the presence of a state religion in 1970 and the presence 
27:648:50444:28:27:90:484:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of government regulation of religion in the 1970s.  Although these variables were 
27:649:50526:27:28:89:518:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:important in an earlier study for explaining religious participation and beliefs (McCleary 
27:650:50617:28:28:90:521:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Barro [2006]), the two variables are individually and jointly statistically insignificant 
27:651:50711:28:27:90:517:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the system for religious conversion (p-value = 0.20 for joint significance).  This result 
27:652:50804:27:28:90:506:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:makes sense because the system already includes a more directly relevant institutional 
27:653:50891:28:27:90:400:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure, the presence of legal restrictions related to conversion. 
27:654:50958:27:28:90:519:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We next added measures of religious participation and beliefs (applying typically 
27:655:51040:28:27:90:506:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:around 1990).  Conceptually, the effects of these variables on religious conversion are 
27:656:51128:27:28:90:476:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ambiguous.  Greater participation and belief signify that formal religion is more 
27:657:51210:28:28:90:504:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:important to a person, thereby suggesting a higher frequency of religious conversion.  
27:658:51297:28:27:90:501:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However, greater participation and belief also indicate a higher degree of satisfaction 
27:659:51385:27:28:90:488:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with and attachment to a person’s incumbent religion and, thereby, predict a lower 
27:660:51468:28:27:90:477:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:frequency of religious conversion.  In any event, the estimated coefficients were 
27:661:51550:27:28:90:516:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:insignificant when we used the extent of monthly or more attendance at formal religious 
27:662:51638:28:28:90:519:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:services along with the extent of belief in hell, heaven, or an after-life, or whether people 
27:663:51732:28:0:90:524:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:viewed themselves as religious.  (Some of these variables were statistically significant for 
28:664:51827:0:27:90:509:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:explaining economic growth in Barro and McCleary [2003].)  A representative finding 
28:665:51911:27:28:89:524:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:appears in Table 5, column 3, which includes monthly attendance along with the extent of 
28:666:52000:28:27:90:471:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religiousness.  The p-value for joint significance of these two variables is 0.70. 
28:667:52083:27:28:89:502:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We also consider whether religious-conversion rates bear some relation to the 
28:668:52161:28:28:89:523:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:composition of religion adherence (in 1970).  Effects might arise here if religions differed 
28:669:52254:28:27:89:516:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by costs of joining or leaving or if religions differed by the degree of attachment of their 
28:670:52347:27:28:89:483:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:members.  Among the religion categories shown in Table 4, the only one that has 
28:671:52427:28:27:89:480:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant explanatory power for religious-conversion rates is the fraction of the 
28:672:52511:27:28:89:519:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adhering population Muslim.  Table 5, column 4 shows a marginally significant negative 
28:673:52598:28:28:89:514:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect from the Muslim adherence share.  The inclusion of this variable has little impact 
28:674:52688:28:27:89:497:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on the other results, except that the coefficient on the conversion-restriction variable 
28:675:52777:27:28:89:362:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:becomes smaller in magnitude (but remains significant). 
28:676:52833:28:27:89:497:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 6, columns 2 and 3, assesses the robustness of the results to alternative 
28:677:52913:27:28:89:493:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:definitions of religious conversion.  As noted before, we use alternative approaches 
28:678:52998:28:27:89:496:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concerning the treatments of the categories “Protestant” and “Other Religion” in the 
28:679:53083:27:28:89:301:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:computation of religious-conversion rates.   
28:680:53128:28:28:89:523:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 6, column 2 corresponds to the first alternative definition, in which all other 
28:681:53214:28:27:89:491:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Christian types are classified as Protestant, rather than Other Religion.  The overall 
28:682:53301:27:28:89:503:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pattern of coefficient estimates is similar to that in the original specification (Table 5, 
28:683:53393:28:27:89:505:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:column 1).  The main change is the reduction in the coefficient for school attainment.  
28:684:53481:27:28:89:475:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The fits are also notably poorer than those in the initial specification.  Thus, our 
28:685:53566:28:28:89:495:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:preference is for the original specification, but the main inferences are robust to this 
28:686:53655:28:0:89:264:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:alternative definition of conversion. 
29:687:53695:0:27:90:482:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 6, column 3 corresponds to the second alternative definition, which 
29:688:53769:27:28:90:488:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:eliminates all conversions associated with “Other Religion.”  As noted before, this 
29:689:53853:28:27:89:512:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:alternative roughly halves the religious-conversion rates, but the estimated rates remain 
29:690:53943:27:28:89:515:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substantially correlated with the original values.  The regression coefficients show more 
29:691:54033:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:differences from the original form (Table 5, column 1), but religious pluralism and school 
29:692:54124:28:27:89:523:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attainment remain significantly positive and Communism remains significantly negative.  
29:693:54212:27:28:89:499:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Two differences are that the conversion-restrictions variable is no longer statistically 
29:694:54301:28:27:89:514:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant, whereas the log of per capita GDP becomes significantly negative at the 5% 
29:695:54389:27:28:89:504:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level.  The fits of the equations—particularly for the ISSP waves—are notably poorer 
29:696:54474:28:28:89:506:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:than those for the original specification.  Thus, we prefer the original specification but 
29:697:54565:28:27:89:519:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:nevertheless find it informative that the overall pattern of empirical estimates is robust to 
29:698:54659:27:28:89:361:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this drastic change in definition of religious conversion.

29:701:54743:28:27:89:522:322:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1: We used retrospective questions about religion adherence from three international 
29:702:54825:27:28:89:523:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:survey waves to construct country averages of religious-conversion rates.  Our concept of 
29:703:54915:28:28:89:489:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion considers only shifts across major religion types, using a breakdown of 
29:704:54998:28:27:90:508:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religions into eight broad groups.  The conversion rates for the population aged 30 and 
29:705:55086:27:28:89:497:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:over vary substantially across countries, ranging from near zero for Spain, Italy, and 
29:706:55173:28:27:89:511:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:many former Communist countries in Eastern Europe to over 10% in the United States, 
29:707:55257:27:28:89:500:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Canada, Chile, and New Zealand.  Although our analysis focuses on switches among 
29:708:55338:28:28:89:508:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:types of religions, the data also cover movements from religion to no religion and vice 
29:709:55426:28:0:89:120:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:versa. 
30:710:55435:0:27:90:512:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In a theoretical model, the frequency of religious conversion depends on factors 
30:711:55516:27:28:90:510:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that influence the cost of switching and the cost of having the “wrong” religion.  These 
30:712:55605:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:theoretical concepts suggested explanatory variables to use in our empirical analysis of 
30:713:55694:27:28:90:490:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:country-level religious-conversion rates.  We report several empirical findings that 
30:714:55779:28:28:90:511:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:accord with the underlying theory:  the religious-conversion rate is positively related to 
30:715:55870:28:27:90:482:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the extent of religious pluralism, gauged by the composition of adherence shares; 
30:716:55952:27:28:90:517:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:negatively related to government restrictions that inhibit religious conversion; positively 
30:717:56044:28:27:90:517:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:related to levels of education; and negatively related to a history of Communism.  Given 
30:718:56133:27:28:90:512:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these variables, conversion rates were not much related to per capita GDP, the presence 
30:719:56221:28:28:90:522:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of state religion, and the extent of religiosity.  The composition of religion adherence was 
30:720:56314:28:27:90:523:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mostly unimportant, except for a small negative effect from the Muslim adherence share.  
30:721:56403:27:28:90:513:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The empirical results were robust to alternative specifications of the religious-pluralism 
30:722:56494:28:27:90:513:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variable and to changes in the religion groupings used to construct the conversion rates. 
30:723:56584:27:28:90:484:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In planning extensions of this research, we start with our view of religious 
30:724:56661:28:27:90:499:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion as one dimension of the fluidity of the religion market.  Opportunities for 
30:725:56748:27:28:90:513:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conversion affect the degree of religious pluralism and the extent of competition among 
30:726:56836:28:28:90:514:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:religion providers.  Through these channels, religious-conversion rates should influence 
30:727:56925:28:27:90:518:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:levels of religiosity, along the lines analyzed in McCleary and Barro (2006).  In carrying 
30:728:57016:27:28:90:523:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:out this extension, we will also use our data on switches between religion and no religion, 
30:729:57108:28:28:90:444:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as well as the movements between religions that we studied in this paper.

38:910:76270:13:12:90:512:633:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:where H is the sum of squares of religion-adherence shares among persons who adhere to some 
38:911:76362:12:13:90:520:621:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:religion.  This pluralism variable corresponds to the probability that a person meets a person with

38:914:76647:14:13:90:524:581:144:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:where 1-H is the pluralism variable from column 4 and n is the ratio of persons with no religion
