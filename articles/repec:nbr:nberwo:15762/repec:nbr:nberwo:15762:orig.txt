3:54:2935:0:30:72:208:721:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:55:2950:30:18:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This paper investigates the macroeconomic implications of downward nominal wage rigidi-
3:56:3037:18:18:72:526:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ties in a low inflation environment via a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model
3:57:3123:18:18:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where forward-looking agents optimally set their wages under the downward constraint.
3:58:3208:18:18:72:526:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A closed-form solution for the long-run Phillips curve is derived. The inflation-output
3:59:3295:18:18:72:526:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gap trade-off is virtually vertical at high inflation and flattens at low inflation, implying
3:60:3388:18:18:72:526:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:progressively larger output costs of reducing inflation. Macroeconomic volatility (among
3:61:3476:18:18:72:526:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other factors) shifts the curve outwards, generating output and employment costs, and
3:62:3561:18:18:72:526:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggesting the need for stabilization policies. The trade-off declines with the degree of
3:63:3650:18:18:72:292:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage flexibility but remains non-negligible.
3:64:3694:18:18:89:525:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The conventional view argues against the presence of a long-run trade-off and in favor
3:65:3780:18:17:72:526:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of price stability: the attempt to take advantage of the short-run trade-off would only
3:66:3867:17:18:72:526:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generate costly inflation in the long run, so that price stability should be the objective of
3:67:3960:18:18:72:525:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central banks.1Recent monetary models exhibit a long-run relationship between inflation
3:68:4047:18:18:72:526:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and real activity, mainly due to symmetric nominal rigidities and asynchronized time-
3:69:4132:18:18:72:526:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependent price-setting behavior in an intertemporal setup (see among others Goodfriend
3:70:4219:18:18:72:525:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and King, 1997, and Woodford, 2003).2Nonetheless, this literature indicates that the
3:71:4303:18:18:72:526:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimal long-run inflation rate should be close to zero and unemployment at the natural
3:72:4390:18:18:72:525:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate.3However, virtually no central bank adopts a policy of zero-inflation, and the two
3:73:4477:18:18:72:526:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:traditional reasons relate to the zero nominal interest bound and the presence of downward
3:74:4567:18:18:72:164:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nominal rigidities.
3:75:4586:18:18:89:525:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This paper emphasizes the role of the downward nominal rigidities, quite a novel fea-
3:76:4671:18:18:72:525:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ture in the aforementioned literature.4The traditional view suggests that a lower bound
3:77:4758:18:18:72:526:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on wages and prices keeps them from falling and induces a drift: a negative demand
3:78:4840:18:18:72:526:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shock would just reduce inflation if inflation remains positive, but would reduce output
3:79:4928:18:17:72:526:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and employment if prices needed to fall. Price stability could be achieved only at sub-
3:80:5015:17:18:72:526:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stantial costs in terms of output and employment, thus entailing significant benefits from
3:81:5105:18:18:72:526:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“greasing” the labor market via inflation. An extensive discussion is offered by Akerlof et
3:82:5196:18:16:85:525:207:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:1After the seminal contributions of Phillips (1958) and Samuelson and Solow (1960), various authors
3:83:5295:16:12:72:526:191:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:have cast serious doubts on the validity of the Phillips curve (Friedman, 1968, and Lucas, 1973). The
3:84:5396:12:8:72:369:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:empirical controversy has yet to settled down (see Ball et al., 1988).
3:85:5466:8:16:85:525:171:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:2State-dependent pricing (Golosov and Lucas, 2007) would weaken the long-run relationship, as price
3:86:5565:16:8:72:526:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rigidities would no longer be binding at high inflation. For a recent critical survey see Blanchard (2008).
3:87:5672:8:16:85:525:147:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:3Because inflation would induce firms to set a high markup to protect future profits, and would create
3:88:5774:16:12:72:526:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:costly price dispersion (see Khan, King and Wolman, 2003, and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2004). See
3:89:5871:12:8:72:311:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Wyplosz (2001) for an empirical analysis on this topic.
3:90:5926:8:15:85:525:111:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:4Since Keynes, numerous authors (for example, Tobin, 1972, and Akerlof, 2007) stressed their impor-
3:91:6025:15:0:72:397:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tance for the existence of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
4:92:6100:0:18:72:526:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:al. (1996), who derive a trade-off between unemployment and inflation via a static model
4:93:6188:18:18:72:231:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with downward wage rigidities.
4:94:6218:18:18:89:525:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is now a strong body of microeconometric evidence indicating the presence of
4:95:6300:18:18:72:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:downward wage rigidities across a wide spectrum of countries, often even at low inflation.5
4:96:6391:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Recent studies, some based on cross-country evidence, find that downward wage rigidities
4:97:6479:18:18:72:526:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have a negative impact on employment (Dickens et al., 2008, and Messina et al., 2008,
4:98:6564:18:18:72:526:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Knoppik and Beissinger, 2003). Indeed, while Card and Hyslop (1997) find only a weak
4:99:6648:18:18:72:526:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence in favor of a “grease” effect of inflation for the U.S., Loboguerrero and Panizza
4:100:6738:18:18:72:526:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2006) find that the “grease” effect of inflation is more relevant in countries with highly
4:101:6829:18:18:72:526:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regulated labor markets, in line with the fact that wage rigidities are stronger in countries
4:102:6922:18:18:72:526:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with heavier labor market distortions (Holden, 2004, and Dickens et al., 2007).  The
4:103:7006:18:18:72:526:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect of downward rigidities is potentially a contributor to recent U.S. labor market
4:104:7092:18:18:72:526:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:developments: annual growth rate in private industry total compensation declined only
4:105:7177:18:17:72:526:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from about 3% in the first quarter of 2008 to about 1.5% in the last quarter of 2009, while
4:106:7268:17:18:72:406:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unemployment rose from about 5% to 10% over the same period.
4:107:7328:18:18:89:525:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we introduce downward wage rigidities in an otherwise dynamic stochas-
4:108:7413:18:18:72:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tic general equilibrium model with forward-looking optimizing agents that enjoy consump-
4:109:7501:18:18:72:526:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion of goods and experience disutility from labor when working for profit-maximizing
4:110:7586:18:18:72:526:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms. Labor markets are characterized by monopolistic competition, goods markets are
4:111:7671:18:18:72:526:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:perfectly competitive, and goods prices are fully flexible. The economy is subject to both
4:112:7761:18:18:72:526:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:idiosyncratic sectorial shocks and aggregate shocks (to productivity and nominal spend-
4:113:7848:18:18:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ing), which generate the need for both intratemporal (as in the traditional discussion of
4:114:7937:18:18:72:526:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the Phillips curve) and intertemporal price adjustments. Extensions to the benchmark
4:115:8021:18:18:72:526:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model relax and endogenize the downward rigidity constraint, in part to address concerns
4:116:8109:18:18:72:525:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about the empirical relevance of wage rigidities at low inflation.6Indeed, even if we allow
4:117:8200:18:18:72:526:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the degree of downward rigidities to vary across agents, or with inflation and macroeco-
4:118:8288:18:18:72:526:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nomic volatility, or following large shocks, the inflation-output trade-off remains sizable
4:119:8379:18:17:72:305:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for reasonable parametrizations of the model.
4:120:8424:17:18:89:525:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The most important novelties of our contribution are the derivation of a closed-form

4:124:8806:12:12:72:526:161:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:even lead to a substantial underestimation of the extent of downward wage rigidity. Several explanations
4:125:8910:12:12:72:526:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:have been put forward for the existence of such rigidities, such as fairness, social norms, and labor market
4:126:9018:12:8:72:350:137:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:institutions (see, for example, Bewley, 1999, and Holden, 2004).

4:128:9181:16:12:72:526:113:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tured that downward wage rigidities may vanish in a low inflation environment. However, recent evidence
4:129:9284:12:12:72:526:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:shows that even at lor inflation such rigidities are binding (Agell and Lundborg, 2003, for Sweden; Fehr

5:134:9723:18:18:71:525:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:low inflation, a result which suggests that the flattening of the Phillips curve observed in
5:135:9815:18:18:71:525:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:several industrial countries in recent years may not need to be ascribed to globalization
5:136:9904:18:18:71:525:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(see IMF, 2006; Borio and Filardo, 2006), but may simply be due to the decline in inflation.
5:137:9996:18:18:71:525:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The results also suggest that the possible end of the Great Moderation coupled with low
5:138:10083:18:18:71:525:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inflation–if not deflation–may inflict a compounded negative effect on the economy, which
5:139:10172:18:18:71:525:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would substantially reduce output and employment unless offset by more wage flexibility,
5:140:10260:18:18:71:383:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stronger stabilization policies, or higher productivity growth.
5:141:10323:18:18:89:525:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The policy implications are quite different from those offered by standard monetary
5:142:10406:18:18:72:526:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:models. First, the optimal inflation may not be zero (as recently argued) or negative (as
5:143:10495:18:18:72:526:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggested by Friedman, 1968). Moderate inflation may help ”grease” intratemporal and
5:144:10579:18:17:72:526:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intertemporal relative price adjustments, especially in countries with substantial macroe-
5:145:10669:17:18:72:526:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conomic volatility. Second, not every country should target the same inflation rate, but
5:146:10757:18:18:72:526:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those experiencing larger volatility may find it desirable to target a higher inflation rate.
5:147:10850:18:18:72:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, as the degree of volatility changes persistently over time, the inflation target may
5:148:10941:18:18:72:526:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:need to be adjusted. Fourth, policymakers can improve the output-inflation trade-off via
5:149:11029:18:18:72:526:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stabilization policies aimed at reducing macroeconomic volatility, thus lowering the output
5:150:11120:18:18:72:526:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and employment costs of maintaining low inflation or of reducing it. This result contrasts
5:151:11210:18:18:72:526:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the view that the gains from stabilization policies are negligible (as in Lucas 1987,
5:152:11300:18:18:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2003). Simulations based on the model presented in this paper indicate that an advanced
5:153:11387:18:18:72:526:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economy enjoying a low macroeconomic volatility (say 2%) and low inflation (say 2%)
5:154:11470:18:18:72:525:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:might face a long run output gap of minus 1.2%. The end of the Great Moderation (say
5:155:11554:18:18:72:501:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bringing macroeconomic volatility to 5%) might widen this estimate to minus 1.6%.

5:157:11718:18:18:72:526:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tributions.  Elsby (2009) offers a partial equilibrium model where downward nominal
5:158:11801:18:17:72:526:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rigidities arise from negative effects of wage cuts on firm’s productivity, and highlights
5:159:11891:17:18:72:526:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the endogenous tendency for upward rigidity of wages in a dynamic model.  Kim and

5:167:12434:15:0:72:526:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:offers a framework that endogenizes downward price rigidities. Our model also shares similarities with

6:171:12795:18:45:72:217:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Section 7 draws conclusions.
6:172:12823:45:30:72:192:622:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:2  The model
6:173:12835:30:18:72:526:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The closed-economy model is populated by a continuum of infinitely lived households and
6:174:12922:18:18:72:526:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sectors (both in a [0,1] interval). Each household derives utility from the consumption of a
6:175:13014:18:18:72:526:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:continuum of goods and disutility from supplying a continuum of varieties of labor, which
6:176:13103:18:18:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are specific to the households and to the sector in which they are employed. The model
6:177:13189:18:18:72:526:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assumes the presence of downward nominal rigidities: wages are chosen by optimizing
6:178:13272:18:18:72:526:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households under the constraint that they cannot fall (this assumption will be relaxed in
6:179:13361:18:18:72:526:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Section 6). In each sector, firms operate in a competitive market to produce one of the
6:180:13448:18:18:72:526:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:continuum of consumption goods. The economy is subject to two aggregate shocks: a
6:181:13529:18:18:72:525:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:productivity and a nominal spending shock. The productivity shock is denoted byAt,

6:190:14053:18:18:89:525:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The economy is also subject to a continuum of idiosyncratic preference shocks that
6:191:14135:18:18:72:526:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affect directly the disutility of supplying the varieties of labor among the different sec-

11:441:23174:18:16:81:525:112:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:12The downward-rigidity constraint is purely exogenous in this model and could be rationalized by

13:508:26258:18:18:72:525:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium wage. Indeed, when the downward-rigidity constraint is binding,actualwages
13:509:26344:18:18:72:526:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are higher than desired wages and are likely to be higher (and employment lower) than

13:516:26924:18:18:71:524:162:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:as it is more likely that even small shocks would push wages to hit the lower bound;16
13:517:27010:18:16:81:525:144:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:15This result is consistent with the theoretical argument and empirical evidence offered by Elsby (2009).

13:521:27332:15:0:72:525:93:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:inflexibility is going to be binding, so thatci(·) gets close to 1 and the flexible-wage level of employment

14:540:28819:18:18:72:526:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the output gap as the difference between output under downward wage rigidity and output

14:542:28997:18:37:72:312:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employment levels. In logs terms we can write:

15:615:31026:12:15:81:525:119:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:19Whenθ≤0, the probability distribution collapses to zero everywhere, with a spike of one at zero

16:648:31974:17:18:72:526:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unique, but depends on the mean inflation rate. There are two components (influenced
16:649:32058:18:18:72:525:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by the parameters of the modelη, ρandσ2(i)) which explain the long-run Phillips curve
16:650:32143:18:18:72:526:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and act on opposite directions.  The first integral on the right hand side captures the
16:651:32230:18:18:72:526:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forward looking reaction of wage setters to the presence of downward wage rigidities,
16:652:32315:18:18:72:526:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which induces them to set a wage lower than the flexible one when adjusting their wage
16:653:32401:18:18:72:525:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(as captured byci(·)≤1), and hence generates a positive output gap. Such a gap would
16:654:32485:18:18:72:525:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be larger the lower isci(·). The second integral depends on the variance-to-mean ratio
16:655:32571:18:18:72:526:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and captures the cost of downward wage rigidities in the presence of a need for relative
16:656:32659:18:18:72:526:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price adjustments, which is the standard argument supporting the presence of a Phillips

16:658:32754:18:22:89:525:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The resulting output gap is always non-positive in the long run (i.e.E(y∞−yf∞)≤0),
16:659:32836:22:12:72:526:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(Phillips, 1958), this paper defines it as the trade off between the output gap and wage inflation. The
16:660:32939:12:12:72:526:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:output gap has indeed been widely used in modern macro models as a measure of slack. Benigno and
16:661:33035:12:8:72:478:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Ricci (2008) present the equivalent formulation in terms of unemployment-inflation trade-off.
16:662:33128:8:16:81:525:140:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:21Note that our dynamic framework introduces not only the need for intratemporal price adjustments,
16:663:33227:16:13:72:525:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:due toσ2ξ(i), as in Akerlof et al. (1996), but also the need for intertemporal price adjustment, arising
16:664:33331:13:0:71:109:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:fromσ2y.
17:665:33341:0:18:72:525:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because the second component dominates, since−lnci(·)≤σ2(i)/(2E[πw∞]).22Also, the
17:666:33422:18:18:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:output gap is larger when the volatility is higher and when the mean of inflation is low,
17:667:33511:18:18:72:526:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because the downward wage constraint is more likely to be binding and more costly in
17:668:33595:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terms of lower employment. Indeed, when the mean wage inflation rate becomes very high,
17:669:33682:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the average output gap converges to 0, as the two components of the gap get close to zero:
17:670:33772:18:18:72:525:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:ci(·) becomes close to 1,and the costs of downward rigidities become small. Hence, for
17:671:33858:18:18:72:526:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high inflation rates, the Phillips curve is almost vertical, and there is virtually no long-
17:672:33950:18:18:72:526:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:run trade-off between inflation and output gap. When instead wage inflation is low, a
17:673:34035:18:18:72:526:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trade-off emerges (the Phillips curve is flatter) and depends heavily on the volatility of
17:674:34125:18:18:72:525:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the economy. If there is no uncertainty,σ2(i) = 0 andci(·) = 1,then the long-run output
17:675:34212:18:18:72:526:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gap is zero. In the stochastic case, the higher the variance of nominal-spending growth
17:676:34299:18:18:72:525:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and of the idiosyncratic shocks (σ2(i)), the more a fall in the inflation rate would worsen
17:677:34390:18:18:72:524:505:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:the average output gap (generating a more negative gap), and flatten the Phillips curve.23
17:678:34480:18:17:72:526:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These patterns are evident in Figure 2, which plots the long run Phillips curve for different
17:679:34573:17:18:72:172:470:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:levels of volatility.24
17:680:34596:18:18:89:525:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As an illustrative example, the model would suggest (on the basis of the parametriza-
17:681:34681:18:18:72:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion underlying Figure 2) that a country that is subject to low macroeconomic volatility
17:682:34769:18:18:72:526:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(say a standard deviation of nominal GDP growth equal to 2%) may experience a wors-
17:683:34852:18:18:72:526:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ening of the output gap equal to 0.4% of flexible-wage GDP when average wage inflation
17:684:34938:18:18:72:526:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:declines from 6 to 3 percent and equal to 4.6% when inflation goes from 4 to 1 percent
17:685:35024:18:18:72:526:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(see Table 1). However, a country with a significant macroeconomic volatility (say 10
17:686:35109:18:18:72:481:344:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:percent) may face much larger costs (about -1.2% and of -11.8% respectively).25
17:687:35188:18:18:89:525:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our model therefore suggests that a reduction in the macroeconomic volatility as a
17:688:35270:18:18:72:526:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consequence of better stabilization policies can have important first-order effects, unlike
17:689:35361:18:18:72:526:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the arguments of Lucas (1987, 2003), and substantially improve the output gap, especially
17:690:35450:18:18:72:526:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at low inflation (as shown in Table 2).  At a wage inflation rate of 2%, reducing the
17:691:35535:18:17:72:526:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic volatility from 5% to 0% improves the output gap by about 0.5%. The
17:692:35616:17:16:81:525:237:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:22Benigno and Ricci (2008) show that in the short run the Phillips curve may also imply a positive
17:693:35714:16:8:72:223:221:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(rather than negative) output gap.
17:694:35748:8:16:81:525:213:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:23In Lucas (1973) higher volatility reduces the information content of relative price dispersion. Intro-
17:695:35852:16:8:72:359:197:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ducing such an effect would steepens the short-run Phillips curve.
17:696:35918:8:16:81:524:189:7:g_d0_f5:7:g_d0_f17:24The standard deviation of the idiosyncratic shocks is set at 10% for all sectors, such that (for aσy
17:697:36020:16:12:72:525:173:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the order of 5% to 10%) the overallσ2(i) would roughly imply the standard deviation of annualized
17:698:36120:12:12:72:526:161:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:changes in wages observed in microstudies (Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk, 2009; Card and Hyslop,
17:699:36219:12:8:72:281:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:1997). The other parameters are as in Figure 1.
17:700:36266:8:16:81:525:141:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:25In reality, macroeconomic volatility of nominal GDP growth is likely to decline as inflation comes
17:701:36366:16:12:72:526:125:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:down, which would imply a steeper Phillips curve. However, the decline should be less than proportional
17:702:36469:12:12:72:526:113:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(mainly because of the real GDP component; see Benigno and Ricci, 2008, for simple supporting evidence),
17:703:36573:12:12:72:526:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:so that even at zero inflation volatility would persist. Moreover, the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks is
17:704:36681:12:0:72:407:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:likely to be affected even less than the aggregate one when inflation declines.

18:734:37466:18:17:71:525:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:volatility.  When wage inflation is very low or the variance of the shocks is high, the
18:735:37553:17:18:71:525:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability that wages remain rigid even upward is close to one. The probability declines
18:736:37642:18:18:71:525:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when inflation increases (in line with the evidence of Card and Hyslop, 1997, that the
18:737:37728:18:18:71:525:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fraction of wages subject to rigidities is higher when inflation is low), and it declines faster
18:738:37824:18:18:71:275:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when macroeconomic volatility is lower.
18:739:37863:18:18:89:525:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, a long run trade-off between volatility of inflation and volatility of output gap
18:740:37952:18:18:72:526:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emerges, for given distributions of the idiosyncratic shocks. Indeed, at low inflation there
18:741:38044:18:18:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is more adjustment via employment and less via wages, while the opposite emerges at
18:742:38127:18:18:72:526:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high inflation. Trade-offs of this nature have been generally assumed in monetary policy

19:769:39475:45:30:72:460:183:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:6  Relaxing the downward rigidity constraint
19:770:39519:30:18:72:526:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The benchmark model presented in the previous sections encompasses nominal wage rigidi-
19:771:39606:18:18:72:526:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ties as a constraint which is homogenous across agents and is independent of the level
19:772:39692:18:18:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of inflation, the degree of macroeconomic volatility, or the presence of large shocks. The
19:773:39782:18:0:72:526:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reality is more nuanced, and this section explores various ways in which to relax this
20:774:39870:0:18:72:526:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assumption. First, we consider the case in which the threshold for wage changes at which
20:775:39958:18:18:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:downward wage rigidities become binding may be negative (rather than zero) and may
20:776:40040:18:18:72:526:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:depend on inflation and volatility. This corresponds to the idea that when agents expect
20:777:40128:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the constraint to be more relevant, they could adjust their behavior and set wages more
20:778:40215:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flexibly. Second, we allow for some heterogeneity, by considering the case in which only
20:779:40303:18:18:72:526:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some agents are subject to the constraint. Finally, we offer a setup in which wage rigidities
20:780:40396:18:39:72:347:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may not be binding when high-variance shocks occur.
20:781:40447:39:25:72:405:574:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6.1  Varying the degree of downward rigidities
20:782:40493:25:18:72:526:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The main criticism of an approach that includes downward wage rigidities is that this
20:783:40578:18:18:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inflexibility should disappear as the inflation rate declines toward zero (see the comments
20:784:40669:18:18:72:526:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to Akerlof et al., 1996, and Ball and Mankiw, 1994). As we discussed in the introduction,
20:785:40758:18:18:72:526:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is now more evidence that downward wage rigidities persist even during low inflation
20:786:40848:18:18:72:526:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:periods. Nonetheless, it is valuable to explore the implications of a link between the degree
20:787:40941:18:33:72:499:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of downward rigidities and inflation, by replacing the assumptiondwt(j, i)≥0 with
20:788:41022:33:33:216:525:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:dwt(j, i)≥−κ(θ, σ2(i))wt(j, i)dt(24)
20:789:41058:33:17:72:526:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which nests the previous model. Nominal wages are now allowed to fall, but the percentage
20:790:41147:17:18:72:525:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decline cannot exceedκ(θ, σ2(i)), whereκ(θ, σ2(i)) is a decreasing function of the mean
20:791:41234:18:18:72:525:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of nominal-spending growth,θ(so that at lower inflation, wages can fall more), and also
20:792:41321:18:18:72:526:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an increasing function of the variance of the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks,σ2(i)
20:793:41407:18:18:72:525:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(with higher variance wages can fall more).27The solution of the model is similar to the
20:794:41495:18:18:72:525:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:previous case except that nowθshould be replaced byλ(θ, σ2(i))≡θ+κ(θ, σ2(i)).28In
20:795:41576:18:37:72:313:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particular, the long-run Phillips curve becomes

20:805:41703:35:18:72:525:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:since it is still true thatE[πw∞] =θ. Obviously the way in which the rigidities endogenously
20:806:41795:18:18:72:525:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decline (i.e. the functional form ofκ(θ, σ2(i))) is crucial in shaping the Phillips curve. For
20:807:41889:18:18:72:525:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:example if the percentage decline could not exceed a fixed amountκ1(henceκ(·)=κ1), then
20:808:41976:18:18:72:525:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the Phillips curve would simply shift down byκ1(when compared to the one presented in
20:809:42061:18:18:72:525:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 2). Under more general assumptions forκ(θ, σ2(i)), the effect of inflation would be

21:850:43635:19:16:81:525:174:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:29Obviously, ifκ(θ, σ2(i)) were to be very large for any theta, then the Phillips curve would become
21:851:43735:16:12:72:526:158:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:virtually vertical. However, as discussed extensively in the introduction, there is substantial evidence
21:852:43839:12:8:72:330:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that downward wage rigidities persist even at low inflation.
21:853:43899:8:16:81:525:138:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:30We setκ1andκ2such thatκ1σ(i) = 1% at annual rates andκ2σ(i) = 0.1 under the assumption
21:854:43987:16:12:72:525:122:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f6:σy= 5% (for comparability, the sameκ1andκ2are maintained whenσy= 10%). Other parameters
21:855:44074:12:11:72:526:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:as in Figure 2. Note that the various Phillips curves associated with different levels of volatilities would
21:856:44182:11:0:72:470:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:now cross, as a change in volatility not only shifts the curve outwards, but also steepens it.

22:885:44811:26:18:72:526:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This subsection allows for some heterogeneity in the way the rigidity affects agents, in line
22:886:44904:18:18:72:526:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with recent findings of Barattieri, Basu and Gottschalk (2009) suggesting the presence of
22:887:44993:18:18:72:526:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity across occupations. To preserve simplicity, we make the assumption that a
22:888:45080:18:18:72:525:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fraction of wage setters, of type i and measureα(0≤α≤1), is constrained by downward
22:889:45163:18:18:72:525:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rigidities while the remaining fraction 1−αcan set wages flexibly. It can be easily shown
22:890:45252:18:35:72:342:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the long-run Phillips curve in this case becomes

22:901:45455:18:0:72:526:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:across the sectors which are affected by downward-wage rigidities. The presence of some
23:902:45544:0:18:72:526:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flexible wages generates a more vertical Phillips curve (see Figure 4 for various degrees of
23:903:45636:18:18:72:525:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage flexibility in the case of moderate volatility,σy= 5%). Still the costs are significant
23:904:45728:18:18:72:525:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:even whenαis small. For example, whenαis just 0.2, meaning that 20% of firms are
23:905:45808:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constrained by downward wage rigidities, then lowering inflation from 5% to 2% still
23:906:45892:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produce costs equal to 0.3% which are obviously smaller than the 1.4% found in the
23:907:45974:18:18:72:525:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benchmark case, but not negligible.  The two boundary values forαnest the models

23:910:46154:39:26:72:388:556:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6.3  Adjustment under high-variance shocks
23:911:46196:26:18:72:526:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This subsection extends the benchmark model to the case in which high-variance shocks
23:912:46281:18:17:72:526:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:warrant a wage adjustment, by introducing two additional features. First, we assume,
23:913:46365:17:18:72:526:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on top of the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, the presence of additional idiosyncratic
23:914:46455:18:18:72:526:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shocks that hit the individual wages less frequently but with large variations.  When
23:915:46540:18:18:72:526:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages are affected by such high-variance idiosyncratic shocks, wage setters can adjust
23:916:46626:18:18:72:526:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their wages either upward or downward in an optimal way. When instead agents do not
23:917:46709:18:18:72:526:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:face these infrequent idiosyncratic shocks, they are subject to the usual downward wage
23:918:46796:18:18:72:175:405:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:rigidity constraint.31
23:919:46818:18:18:89:525:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, we introduce the probability of switching between the low and the high prob-
23:920:46902:18:18:72:526:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ability regime, which captures the frequency of occurrence of high-variance shocks. This
23:921:46990:18:18:72:526:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is indeed an important parameter in order to study the relevance of the real effects of
23:922:47077:18:18:72:525:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:monetary policy.32If the large shocks were occurring very frequently, then wages would
23:923:47163:18:18:72:526:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjust often and the Phillips curve would be quite vertical. With infrequent large shocks,
23:924:47253:18:18:72:526:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages would be more subject to the downward wage rigidity constraint and the Phillips
23:925:47338:18:18:72:526:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:curve would be flatter, as in the benchmark model. We will discuss below how micro-data
23:926:47425:18:17:72:526:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence on the frequency of wage adjustment and on the wage distribution can help to
23:927:47510:17:18:72:267:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discriminate between these two views.
23:928:47547:18:19:89:525:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To model such probability of switching, we add a process{st}that follows a two-state
23:929:47631:19:15:81:525:207:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:31The idea that wages can adjust in a state-contingent way following high-variance shocks is borrowed
23:930:47732:15:12:72:526:192:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:from the menu-cost literature on firms’ pricing (see in particular Gertler and Lehay, 2008, and Golosov
23:931:47835:12:12:72:526:180:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and Lucas, 2007). To preserve simplicity, we approximate the implications of an Ss model by introducing
23:932:47938:12:12:72:526:168:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a regime-switching model for the idiosyncratic shocks between a low and a high volatility regime. The
23:933:48039:12:12:72:526:156:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:approximation is accurate to the extent to which an Ss model would trigger an adjustment for most of
23:934:48139:12:9:72:517:144:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the shocks of the high-volatility regime, which is more likely when the variance of such shocks is high.
23:935:48243:9:15:81:525:135:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:32In the Golosov and Lucas (2007) model, large shocks are very frequent so the real effects of monetary
23:936:48346:15:12:72:526:120:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:policy are small. On the contrary, Gertler and Lehay (2008) shows that with infrequent idiosyncratic
23:937:48446:12:12:72:526:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:shocks is still possible to characterize the response of the economy to aggregate shocks through a Phillips
23:938:48553:12:0:72:98:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:curve.
24:939:48561:0:18:72:526:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Markov chain taking values 1 and 2. These two states are associated, respectively, with
24:940:48648:18:18:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the benchmark situation of downward wage rigidities and with the case in which wages
24:941:48732:18:18:72:525:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can freely adjust. We assume that the process{st}has matrix of transition probabilities

24:951:49125:18:18:72:525:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assume that the idiosyncratic shockξt(i) is now given by two multiplicative components,
24:952:49212:18:18:72:525:517:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:ξt(i) =ξv,t(i)εt(i) whereξv,t(i),as in the benchmark model, exhibits its logarithmic
24:953:49296:18:33:72:420:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distributed as a Brownian motion with zero drift and varianceσ2ξ(i)

24:955:49388:33:32:72:478:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:while the additional term is given by the shockεt(i) whose log is distributed as

24:957:49494:33:33:72:102:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where
24:958:49499:33:21:251:343:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:σε(i, s=  1) = 0

24:960:49530:33:18:72:525:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:dBv,t(i) might be correlated withdBξ,t(i),and both are standard Brownian motion with
24:961:49614:18:17:72:526:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:zero mean and unitary variance. In state 1, the time-variation of the shockεtis zero so
24:962:49701:17:18:72:526:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that it does not move; in state 2, instead, its variation follows a Brownian motion with
24:963:49789:18:18:72:145:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:varianceσ2ε(i).
24:964:49804:18:18:89:525:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In light of these two additions to the model, wage setters still maximize the objective
24:965:49891:18:18:72:526:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:function (14) but now they take into account the possibility of freely adjusting wages when
24:966:49982:18:18:72:526:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state 2 occurs, while in state 1 they continue to face the downward rigidity constraint;

24:968:50161:18:18:72:526:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requires that the derivative of the value function with respect to wages in state 2 is equal

24:970:50344:18:0:81:300:102:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:33It is assumed that 0≤λdt≤1 and 0≤φdt≤1.

25:972:50474:18:18:72:525:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state 1, instead,Vw(wt(j, i), Wt(i), ̃Yt(i), s= 1)·dwt(j, i) = 0 anddwt(j, i)≥0 as in the
25:973:50563:18:18:72:425:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benchmark case since the downward wage rigidity constraint applies.
25:974:50630:18:18:89:525:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In state 1, the value function follows the following functional equation (see the Ap-

25:980:50777:26:18:72:526:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:under the appropriate boundary conditions, where we have defined the derivative of the
25:981:50863:18:18:72:525:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value function with respect to wages asv1(·)≡Vw(Wt(i), Wt(i), ̃Yt(i), s= 1). By inspec-
25:982:50950:18:18:72:526:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion, this is similar to the functional equation characterizing the benchmark model and
25:983:51037:18:18:72:526:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is associated with the same boundary conditions. The only difference is in the discount
25:984:51124:18:18:72:525:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:factor which is now higher and given by (λ+ρ) because workers internalize the probability
25:985:51213:18:18:72:525:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of switching to the flexible-wage regime.35It follows that in state 1, wages are set at the
25:986:51304:18:0:72:258:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:levelWt(i) =c(θ, σ2(i), η, λ+ρ)·μ

25:989:51388:17:18:72:525:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:represents the realization ofεt(i) at timet1,witht1< t, which is the last time beforet
25:990:51474:18:18:72:526:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at which state 2 occurred. In other words, desired wages are again proportional to the
25:991:51560:18:18:72:525:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flexible wages, but with a higher proportional factor: the same functionci(·) now depends
25:992:51649:18:18:72:253:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on a higher discount factor (λ+ρ).
25:993:51683:18:18:89:525:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In state 2, instead, wages can be freely adjusted so that the derivative of the value
25:994:51768:18:18:72:525:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:function with respect to wages is set to zero,v2(·) = 0, and the optimality condition in
25:995:51856:18:18:72:185:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this state simplifies to
25:996:51880:18:26:240:525:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:πw(·)dt+φv1(·)dt= 0,(27)
25:997:51904:26:18:72:525:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as it is shown in the appendix.36However, this does not correspond to the optimality
25:998:51988:18:18:72:526:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:condition under fully flexible wages since in state 2 wage setters take into account the
25:999:52076:18:18:72:526:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability of reverting to state 1, given byφdt. In the appendix, we show that wages in
25:1000:52164:18:18:71:525:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state 2 are set proportionally to the level that would prevail in the permanently flexible-
25:1001:52255:18:0:71:315:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:wage case (Wft(i)) and such thatWt(i) =  ̃ci(·)μ

25:1004:52348:18:17:89:525:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The results are quite intuitive.  In state 1, i.e.  when the downward rigidities are
25:1005:52432:17:18:72:526:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:binding, the desired wage is closer to the flexible-wage case than in the benchmark case
25:1006:52520:18:18:72:526:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of Section 4, because agents internalize the positive probability of a readjustment when
25:1007:52608:18:16:81:525:183:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:34These are standard optimality conditions associated with problems of switching regimes.  (See

25:1010:52856:8:13:81:523:147:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:35The value function in state 2 does not enter into (26) because wages can freely adjust in that state.
25:1011:52959:13:15:81:525:134:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:36Notice that the composite state variable ̃Yt(i) is continuous when switching from state 2 to state 1,
25:1012:53062:15:9:72:221:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:but jumps from state 1 to state 2.
25:1013:53096:9:15:81:525:110:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:37We further note that the model of this section nests the benchmark model under the assumption that
25:1014:53196:15:0:72:388:95:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f6:λdt= 0 and the flexible-wage model under the assumption thatφdt= 0.

26:1045:54026:18:18:72:525:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:πw(·)≥0); hence they will set wages below the flexible-wage level, but above the case in

26:1051:54466:18:18:72:525:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:low. For example,λdt= 0.1 would imply that wages become flexible during one quarter

27:1088:55912:18:18:72:525:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quarterly basis, andη= 2.5. The fraction of zero wage changes implied by the model over
27:1089:55999:18:18:72:526:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the four horizons considered  is 16.5%, 8.6%, 4.9%, and 3.8%, respectively, which is in
27:1090:56086:18:18:72:526:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:line with the evidence presented by Card and Hyslop. Moreover, the fraction of negative
27:1091:56173:18:18:72:526:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage changes on a year horizon is equal to 11% (or less than 3% on a quarterly basis), so
27:1092:56262:18:18:72:526:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that our model is consistent with some wage decreases. To get these results, we calibrate
27:1093:56351:18:18:72:128:147:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:λdt= 0.06.
27:1094:56361:18:18:89:525:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Figure 6, we allowλdtto vary in the (0.00,0.12) interval, i.e. a range surrounding
27:1095:56446:18:0:72:526:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the value calibrated above, in order to study the implications of this model for the shape
28:1096:56538:0:18:72:525:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the long-run Phillips curve.38When the probability of switching to state 2 increases,
28:1097:56626:18:18:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages are on average more flexible: the Phillips curve moves inward and becomes more
28:1098:56710:18:18:72:525:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vertical. In the case ofλdt= 0.06 , reducing inflation from 5% to 2% would increase
28:1099:56793:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the output gap by about 0.3 percent of GDP, about 1 percentage point less than in the
28:1100:56878:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benchmark case, but still by a sizable amount. For countries or during period where the
28:1101:56965:18:18:72:525:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high variance shocks are more (less) frequent, henceλdtis higher (lower), the trade-off
28:1102:57052:18:45:72:395:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would be better (worse) and the costs would be lower (higher).
28:1103:57114:45:30:72:201:568:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:7  Conclusions
28:1104:57128:30:18:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This paper offers a theoretical foundation for the long-run Phillips curve, by introducing
28:1105:57218:18:18:72:526:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:downward nominal wage rigidities in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model
28:1106:57300:18:18:72:526:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with forward-looking agents and flexible-goods prices. Downward nominal rigidities (the
28:1107:57387:18:18:72:526:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:main difference with respect to current monetary models) have been advocated for a long
28:1108:57474:18:18:72:526:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time as a justification for the Phillips curve, and have recently received theoretical and
28:1109:57564:18:18:72:349:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:empirical support (see discussion in the introduction).
28:1110:57619:18:18:89:525:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The model generates a closed-form solution uncovering a highly non-linear relationship
28:1111:57705:18:17:72:526:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the long-run trade-off between average wage inflation and output gap: the trade-off
28:1112:57792:17:18:72:526:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is virtually inexistent at high inflation rates, while it becomes relevant in a low inflation
28:1113:57885:18:18:72:526:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:environment. The relation shifts with several factors, and in particular with the degree
28:1114:57973:18:18:72:525:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of macroeconomic volatility.39In a country with significant macroeconomic stability, the
28:1115:58061:18:18:72:526:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Phillips curve is virtually vertical also at low inflation. However, a country with moder-
28:1116:58151:18:18:72:526:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ate to high volatility may face a substantial costs in terms of output and employment if
28:1117:58239:18:18:72:526:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attempting to reach price stability. Higher productivity growth would tend to make the
28:1118:58325:18:18:72:526:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Phillips curve more vertical, as it would feed into higher nominal spending growth. The
28:1119:58412:18:18:72:526:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Phillips curve would also steepen if the degree of wage rigidities declines. Indeed, the
28:1120:58500:18:18:72:526:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benchmark model is extended to allow for the possibility that downward wage rigidities
28:1121:58586:18:18:72:526:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may be heterogenous across agents, and may be endogenous to inflation, macro-volatility,
28:1122:58674:18:18:72:526:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or to the occurrence of large shocks. Nonetheless, for reasonable parameter values, down-
28:1123:58763:18:18:72:526:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ward rigidities continue to generate a non-negligible long run trade off between inflation
28:1124:58853:18:17:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the output gap. Further work would be necessary to achieve a deeper understanding
28:1125:58938:17:16:81:526:162:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:38In particular we assume thatσy= 5% andσξ= 10% at annual rates whereasσε(i, s= 2) = 65% at
28:1126:59029:16:12:72:526:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:annual rates. Note that the latter assumption does not affect the shape of the long-run Phillips curve.
28:1127:59132:12:12:72:525:134:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We also assume thatφdt= 1 meaning that that state 2 is not persistent at all and once a high-variance
28:1128:59233:12:8:72:358:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f16:shock occurs then the state switches back immediately to state 1.
28:1129:59298:8:16:81:525:114:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:39With respect to the other parameters of the model, the Phillips curve would flatten when labor
28:1130:59394:16:12:72:526:98:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:elasticity is lower and agents heavily discount the future; and it would shift outward if labor and goods
28:1131:59499:12:0:72:199:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:market competition weakens.
29:1132:59528:0:18:72:526:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the labor market and of the wage setting behavior, which is crucial to assess the extent
29:1133:59619:18:18:72:326:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the implications of downward wage rigidities.
29:1134:59668:18:18:89:525:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Several important implications arise. First, the optimal inflation rate may not be zero,
29:1135:59756:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but positive, as inflation helps achieving the intratemporal and intertemporal relative price
29:1136:59849:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustments, especially in countries with substantial macroeconomic volatility. Second,
29:1137:59936:18:18:72:526:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the ideal inflation rate would differ across countries (and in particular it would be higher
29:1138:60028:18:18:72:526:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in countries with larger macroeconomic volatility), and may change over time. Third,
29:1139:60112:18:18:72:526:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stabilization policies, can play a crucial role, as they can improve the inflation-output
29:1140:60201:18:18:72:118:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trade-off.
29:1141:60211:18:18:89:525:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Additional theoretical implication arise.  First, the overall degree of wage rigidity
29:1142:60296:18:18:72:526:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is endogenously stronger at low inflation rates and disappears at high inflation rates,
29:1143:60383:18:18:72:526:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unlike in time-dependent models of price rigidities where prices remain sticky even in a
29:1144:60471:18:18:72:526:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high-inflation environment. This arises from the endogenous tendency for upward wage
29:1145:60555:18:17:72:526:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rigidities (as in Elsby, 2009), resulting from forward looking agents anticipating the effect
29:1146:60648:17:18:72:526:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of downward rigidities on their future employment opportunities. Second, this endogenous
29:1147:60736:18:18:72:526:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage rigidity introduces a trade-off also between the volatility of the output gap and the
29:1148:60826:18:18:72:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:volatility of inflation, as at low inflation adjustments occurs mainly via changes in output
29:1149:60918:18:18:72:526:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and at high inflation via change in wages. Third, the Phillips curve may arise not only
29:1150:61005:18:18:72:526:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from the need for intratemporal relative price adjustment across sectors in the presence of
29:1151:61096:18:18:72:526:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:downward rigidities (as in the traditional view), but also from the need for intertemporal
29:1152:61186:18:18:72:526:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative price adjustment, which opens the way for the important role of macroeconomic
29:1153:61272:18:18:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stabilization policies discussed above. Fourth, nominal shocks can have high persistent
29:1154:61359:18:18:72:526:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real effects, suggesting that introducing downward wage inflexibility in menu-cost model
29:1155:61447:18:18:72:526:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: ́a la Golosov and Lucas (2007) would likely change their conclusion that nominal shocks
29:1156:61535:18:18:72:526:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have only transient effects on real activity at any level of inflation.  Fifth, prolonged
29:1157:61624:18:18:72:526:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:periods of low inflation or deflation may prove very costly in terms of output and possibly
29:1158:61715:18:18:72:526:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employment, a result which is consistent with the Japanese experience according to Yasui
29:1159:61803:18:17:72:183:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Takenaka (2005).
29:1160:61823:17:18:89:525:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Regarding the empirical implications, the long run output gap with respect to the
29:1161:61904:18:18:72:526:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flexible-wage output is not zero in our model, but depends on the extent of inflation and
29:1162:61993:18:18:72:526:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:volatility of the economy. This implies that standard empirical methods deriving an esti-
29:1163:62082:18:18:72:526:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mate of the output gap as a deviation from filtering series may be misleading, as such a
29:1164:62170:18:18:72:526:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measure would, by construction, average out to about zero in the long run. Indeed, in our
29:1165:62259:18:18:72:526:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model, the long run output gap should simply be a mirror image of the unemployment
29:1166:62341:18:18:72:526:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate above the frictionless unemployment rate. Moreover, empirical studies of the Phillips
29:1167:62431:18:0:72:526:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:curve might prove inaccurate unless they properly account for macroeconomic volatility,
30:1168:62520:0:18:72:526:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:especially in a low inflation environment. For example, the “Great Moderation” experi-
30:1169:62606:18:18:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enced by the U.S. until recently may have significantly steepened the Phillips curve over
30:1170:62695:18:18:72:526:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the past two decades, thus potentially strengthening the case for the conventional view
30:1171:62782:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of a vertical long-run curve in this country.  However, this does not need to apply to
30:1172:62868:18:18:72:526:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:periods where volatility becomes persistently higher or to countries with generally higher
30:1173:62958:18:0:72:208:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic instability.
