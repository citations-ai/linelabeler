2:24:1038:31:24:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A  large  portion  of  the  variation  in  wages  and  wage  growth  rates  among  individuals  is  due  to
2:25:1145:24:24:71:539:575:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:"unobserved" heterogeneity, and the source of individual heterogeneity is typically attributed to data
2:26:1247:24:24:71:539:551:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:limitations and/or the unobservability of certain productivity related factors. In this paper we develop
2:27:1351:24:24:71:539:527:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a  test  that  discriminates  between  two  inherently  unobservable  sources  of  heterogeneity  (both  of
2:28:1458:24:24:71:539:503:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which can clearly account for the variation in wages and wage growth rates): learning ability and
2:29:1555:24:24:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:workers'  inter-temporal  preferences  (discounting).  We  apply  this  test  to  the  large  observed

2:31:1757:24:31:71:245:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:supports the discounting hypothesis.

3:46:2033:0:34:72:208:671:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:47:2048:34:21:72:540:637:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Despite several decades of research in labor economics and dramatic improvements in data
3:48:2136:21:22:72:540:616:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:collection, a substantial fraction of individual distributions of wage levels and wage growth
3:49:2229:22:22:72:540:594:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:rates still remains unexplained. As a consequence, the study of unobserved sources of indi-
3:50:2320:22:22:72:540:572:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:vidual heterogeneity is important not only for the well-known purpose of correctly estimating
3:51:2413:22:21:72:539:550:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage effects of key observed factors such as schooling, but also for our understanding and
3:52:2503:21:22:72:405:529:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:assessment of some of these less tractable determinants of wages.
3:53:2568:22:21:89:539:507:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The obvious and most commonly cited source of heterogeneity appeals to differences
3:54:2650:21:22:72:540:486:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in individual productivity. Although information on productivity related characteristics is
3:55:2741:22:22:72:540:464:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:widespread — from intelligence test scores to detailed schooling information — various other
3:56:2833:22:21:72:540:442:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:dimensions of productivity and learning ability, including drive, motivation, discipline, fo-
3:57:2926:21:22:72:540:421:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:cus, charisma and communication skills among others, are inherently unobservable to the
3:58:3013:22:22:72:540:399:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:econometrician. A second source of heterogeneity is related to preferences. For example, dif-
3:59:3106:22:22:71:540:377:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:ferences in the relative valuation of earnings with other on-the-job and off-the-job amenities
3:60:3200:22:21:72:539:355:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:are likely to affect occupational and job choices, and thus give rise to earnings differen-
3:61:3291:21:22:72:540:334:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:tials. While this type of heterogeneity has been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g.
3:62:3385:22:21:72:539:312:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Rosen 1972), another important source of preference related heterogeneity — i.e., differences
3:63:3478:21:22:72:401:291:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in individual time preference — has received much less attention.
3:64:3543:22:22:89:539:269:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The crux of the issue is that unobserved variations in either learning ability or time
3:65:3629:22:22:72:540:247:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:preference can account for the unexplained variation in wage levels and wage growth rates.
3:66:3719:22:21:72:540:225:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:So the question is whether the source of the unexplained variation in wage dynamics is due
3:67:3809:21:22:72:540:204:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:to unobserved learning ability or time preference. The objective of this paper is to present a
3:68:3903:22:22:72:540:182:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:simple theory of wage dynamics and derive a discrimating test to empirical assess the relative
3:69:3997:22:21:72:540:160:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:importance of these two potential sources of unobserved heterogeneity in wage determination
3:70:4088:21:22:72:165:139:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:over the life cycle.
3:71:4108:22:0:89:544:117:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The discriminating test we propose consists of a two-part strategy. Thefirstpartisto
4:72:4193:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f6:145:g_d0_f4:find a variable that is highly correlated with wage levels and especially with wage growth
4:73:4283:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:rates (net of other observable effects), but where this observed correlation is not causal.
4:74:4374:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Such a correlation raises the possibility that this candidate variable is a likely proxy for
4:75:4466:21:22:72:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:some unobserved factor such as learning abilityor time preference that is directly related to
4:76:4559:22:22:71:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage dynamics. The second part of the strategy is to design a discriminating test to address
4:77:4651:22:21:71:522:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:whether this candidate variable is indeed a proxy for learning ability or time preference.
4:78:4741:21:22:89:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Our candidate variable is whether people smoke or not. Smoking is highly (negatively)
4:79:4826:22:22:71:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:correlated with wages and wage growth.  Smokers earn less than non-smokers and have
4:80:4909:22:21:71:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:substantially lower wage growth rates.  While it is possible that some of the differences
4:81:4998:21:22:71:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:between smokers and non-smokers are due to direct effects (e.g., health), it is more likely
4:82:5089:22:22:72:539:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:that these differences are due to other variables that are jointly correlated with smoking and
4:83:5183:22:21:72:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage growth. Indeed, the estimated difference in wage growth rates across smokers and non-
4:84:5273:21:22:72:540:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers is reduced substantially after including a rich set of variables such as schooling and
4:85:5367:22:22:72:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:test scores. However, the net differences in wage growth rates still remain large and highly
4:86:5459:22:21:72:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:significant.1We contend that time preference and learning ability are two likely sources of
4:87:5550:21:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:unobserved heterogeneity that could account for the net gap in wage growth rates across
4:88:5637:22:22:71:205:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers and non-smokers.
4:89:5661:22:21:89:539:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Thefirst explanation is that individuals differ in their rates of time preference, and those
4:90:5753:21:22:71:540:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:who discount the future more heavily will clearly weigh their current wages (first wage)
4:91:5841:22:22:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:relative to their future wages (wage growth) more heavily than those who discount the
4:92:5926:22:18:71:540:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:future less.2Since discount rates are likely to affect all forms of investments, individuals
4:93:6018:18:15:85:539:219:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1Smokers in the U.S. earn substantially less than non-smokers. For example, Levine et. al. (1997), using
4:94:6122:15:12:72:540:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY),find that smokers earn 11% and 17% less than non-
4:95:6221:12:12:72:540:192:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:smokers in 1984 and 1991, respectively. After controlling for a host of individual and family characteristics,
4:96:6331:12:12:72:539:180:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:this wage gap reduces to 4.2% and 6.9%.  Using the same NLSY data, wefind that the major source
4:97:6426:12:12:72:539:168:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of this wage gap is the dramatic differences in wage growth rates between smokers and non-smokers. In
4:98:6527:12:12:72:540:156:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:another study (Munasinghe and Sicherman, 2003) we report that over a period of about ten years non-
4:99:6626:12:12:72:540:144:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:smokers experience, on average, wage growth rates that are about 60% greater than those of non-smokers.
4:100:6729:12:12:72:540:132:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Controlling for an extraordinary rich set of controls, the differences are reduced substantially, to around 20%,
4:101:6841:12:8:72:213:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:but remain large and significant.
4:102:6874:8:0:85:540:112:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:2Since individual discount rates are defined in terms of current versus future consumption and not in
5:103:6976:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:with high discount rates will be less likely to make other investments, including investing
5:104:7067:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in their health.  Hence the discounting hypothesis is that individuals with high discount
5:105:7156:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:rateswillbemorelikelytosmokeandmorelikelytohaveflatter wage profiles.3The second
5:106:7236:21:22:71:539:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:explanation is that individuals differ in their learning ability, and that more efficient (able)
5:107:7332:22:22:71:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:learners are likely to invest more in schooling as well as in other forms of human capital,
5:108:7423:22:21:71:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:including job training.  As a consequence, efficient learners will have a higherfirst wage
5:109:7513:21:22:71:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and a steeper wage profile. If efficient learners are also less likely to smoke because their
5:110:7606:22:22:71:540:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:higher learning ability leads them to better understand the negative effects of smoking then
5:111:7698:22:21:71:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:it is possible that this unobserved dimension of learning ability could be the culprit behind
5:112:7791:21:22:71:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the observed negative correlation between smoking and wage growth rates. In sum, both
5:113:7876:22:22:71:539:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:hypotheses lead to the same prediction, namely, a negative correlation between smoking and
5:114:7966:22:21:71:167:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage growth rates.
5:115:7984:21:22:89:539:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The discriminating test we propose in this paper is based on theoretical implications of
5:116:8072:22:22:71:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:time preference versus learning ability on the trade-offbetween thefirst wage and subse-
5:117:8160:22:21:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:quent wage increases, two key parameters that describe individual careers. In particular,
5:118:8249:21:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:we show that the correlation between thefirst period wage and wage growth rate across
5:119:8334:22:22:71:539:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers and non-smokers differ markedly under the two alternative hypotheses.  To pre-
5:120:8420:22:21:71:540:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:view our modeling results: First, holding learning ability constant, thefirst period wage
5:121:8509:21:22:71:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and wage growth rate are negatively correlated because individual discount rates are unob-
5:122:8599:22:21:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:served. More importantly, however, if smoking is correlated with individual discount rates
5:123:8689:21:12:72:540:238:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:terms of current versus future incomes, we implicitly assume that workers face borrowing constraints against
5:124:8797:12:12:72:540:226:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:returns on investments in human capital. It should be noted, however, that even if the capital market is
5:125:8901:12:12:72:540:214:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:perfect, the returns on an investment in schooling, for example, depend on hours of work if schooling raises
5:126:9009:12:12:72:540:202:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:market productivity by a larger percentage than it raises non-market productivity. Individuals who are more
5:127:9116:12:12:72:540:190:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:future-oriented desire relatively more leisure at older ages. Therefore, they work more at younger ages and
5:128:9223:12:9:72:540:178:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:have a higher discounted marginal benefit on a given investment than persons who are more present oriented.
5:129:9330:9:15:85:539:169:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:3The idea that smoking is a proxy for discount rates is extensively documented in the economics literature
5:130:9436:15:12:72:539:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(Fuchs, 1982). Empirical studiesfind correlations between smoking and various other behaviors related to
5:131:9540:12:12:72:539:142:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:future outcomes, including health status, educational attainment, earnings levels, use of seat belts, physical
5:132:9650:12:12:72:539:130:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:exercise, and brushing andflossing teeth (Hersch and Viscusi 1990;Hersch 1996; Levine et. al. 1997; Hersch
5:133:9756:12:0:71:210:118:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:2000; Viscusi and Hersch 2001).
6:134:9788:0:22:72:539:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:then this negative trade-offbetween thefirst period wage and wage growth rate is larger
6:135:9875:22:22:71:539:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:among smokers than among non-smokers. Second, if non-smokers are simply more efficient
6:136:9961:22:21:71:539:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:learners and the distribution of discount rates is similar across smokers and non-smokers,
6:137:10051:21:22:71:539:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:then the observed negative trade-offwill typically be smaller among smokers than among
6:138:10137:22:22:71:540:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:non-smokers. As a consequence, the discounting and learning hypotheses predict a different
6:139:10227:22:21:71:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:sign on the interaction term between smoking and thefirst wage in a wage growth equation.
6:140:10316:21:22:89:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:In our model of career choice individuals face a trade-offbetween thefirst wage and
6:141:10399:22:22:71:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage growth rate as depicted in Figure 1.  The technology of on-the-job human capital
6:142:10484:22:21:71:540:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:production is based on the following considerations.  Increase in training time and effort
6:143:10574:21:22:71:540:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:(and the corresponding reductions infirst period wages) increases future productivity and
6:144:10663:22:22:71:539:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:thus future wages. However, thefixity of the human body and initial level of human capital
6:145:10753:22:21:71:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:would clearly imply that this increase occurs at a diminishing rate. Hence, all else constant,
6:146:10847:21:22:71:540:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the production possibility frontier, or more specifically, the constraint function between the
6:147:10941:22:22:71:539:389:145:g_d0_f6:145:g_d0_f4:first period wage and wage growth rate will be concave to the origin. Thus the negative
6:148:11028:22:21:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:slope of this constraint will decrease in absolute value — i.e. a decreasing marginal rate of
6:149:11121:21:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:transformation — as more and more resources are diverted from current wages to training
6:150:11208:22:22:71:539:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:that enhances future wages (and thus the wage growth rate). We use this relatively simple
6:151:11297:22:21:71:540:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:two-period model of career choice to study the ramifications of the discounting and learning
6:152:11389:21:22:71:130:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:hypotheses.
6:153:11400:22:22:89:539:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Under the discounting hypothesis, the key assumption of the model that generates the
6:154:11484:22:21:71:540:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:negative interaction effect between smoking andfirst-period wages is diminishing returns to
6:155:11575:21:22:71:539:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:training or learning — i.e. the fact, as mentioned above, that the constraint function between
6:156:11669:22:22:71:544:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:thefirstperiodwageandwagegrowthrateisconcavetotheorigin. Notethatforagiven
6:157:11743:22:21:71:539:172:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:production constraint, the optimal choice point on this constraint will be determined by an
6:158:11834:21:22:71:540:151:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:individual’s time preference. Put differently, heterogeneity of time preference will simply
6:159:11925:22:22:71:539:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:trace this non-linear production constraint. Thefirst model implication is of course that
6:160:12014:22:0:71:540:107:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:holding initial human capital constant, thefirst period wage will be negatively correlated
7:161:12105:0:22:72:539:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:with the wage growth rate. Moreover, low discount workers will locate in theflatter region
7:162:12195:22:22:71:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of the constraint where the ratio of second period wage increase tofirst period wages are
7:163:12284:22:21:71:539:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:relatively high, and high discount workers will locate in the steeper region of the constraint
7:164:12378:21:22:71:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:where the ratio of second period wage growth tofirst period wages is relatively lower. If
7:165:12467:22:22:71:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers have relatively higher discount rates than non-smokers then the observed negative
7:166:12556:22:21:71:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:correlation betweenfirst period wages and second period wage increases will be larger among
7:167:12647:21:22:71:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers than among non-smokers (holding initial level of human capital constant). These
7:168:12734:22:22:71:299:519:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:details are graphically depicted in Figure 2.4
7:169:12780:22:21:89:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:On the other hand, if the source of unobserved heterogeneity is differences in learning abil-
7:170:12873:21:22:72:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:ity then workers with different learning abilities will locate on different production possibility
7:171:12971:22:22:72:540:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:frontiers. Since we assume that all workers start their careers with the same level of human
7:172:13063:22:21:72:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:capital, the production frontier of the more able workers will be higher — the samefirst period
7:173:13158:21:22:72:539:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage intercept but a higher second period wageincrease intercept — and thus steeper than
7:174:13246:22:22:72:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the production frontier of their less able counterparts. Therefore, if non-smokers are more
7:175:13337:22:21:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:able learners than their smoker counterparts then the observed negative correlation between
7:176:13428:21:22:72:539:346:145:g_d0_f6:145:g_d0_f4:firstperiodwagesandsecondperiodwageincreases will be larger among non-smokers. The
7:177:13510:22:22:72:539:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:key point is that the implications for the observed trade-offbetween thefirst wage and wage
7:178:13601:22:21:72:538:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:growth across smokers and non-smokers are reversed under the two alternative hypotheses.
7:179:13689:21:22:89:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:In the empirical section of the paper we test whether the negative relationship between the
7:180:13780:22:22:72:539:259:145:g_d0_f6:145:g_d0_f4:first wage and wage growth rate is stronger among smokers or non-smokers. Our empirical
7:181:13867:22:21:72:540:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:strategy is tofirst delineate for each individual the two key variables: the wage at the time
7:182:13960:21:22:72:540:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of full time entry into the labor market (first wage) and subsequent wage increases over the
7:183:14052:22:22:72:540:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:working career (wage growth rate). The latter variable is based on a coefficient estimate of
7:184:14144:22:21:72:540:172:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:time in labor market by running a wage regression for each individual in our data sample.
7:185:14233:21:22:72:540:151:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:We then implement wage growth regression models that include thefirst wage, smoking,
7:186:14317:22:18:72:539:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and an interaction offirst wage and smoking as the three key explanatory variables. The
7:187:14404:18:0:85:440:111:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:4The specific parameters in Figure 2 pertain to the modeling details in Section 2.
8:188:14487:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:sign on this interaction term constitutes a discriminating test. To anticipate our empirical
8:189:14579:22:22:72:545:649:145:g_d0_f6:145:g_d0_f4:findings: The estimated coefficient of the interaction between smoking andfirstwageis
8:190:14664:22:21:72:539:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:negative and highly significant. Thisfinding is robust across various model specifications,
8:191:14755:21:22:72:322:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and lends support to the discounting hypothesis.
8:192:14803:22:22:89:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Before proceeding to the details of the paper an important caveat needs to be addressed.
8:193:14891:22:21:72:540:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Our empirical test raises the question of whether we have properly identified smoking as a
8:194:14981:21:22:72:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:proxy for individual discount rates. Since each individual in our sample contributes to only
8:195:15073:22:22:72:540:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:one observation in our regression framework, the negative coefficient of the interaction term
8:196:15166:22:21:72:544:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is based on a cross section of observations. The observed correlation betweenfirstwageand
8:197:15255:21:22:72:540:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage growth across smokers and non-smokers could in principle be due to other sources of
8:198:15343:22:22:72:539:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:heterogeneity since we do not trace the same individual making choices aboutfirst wage and
8:199:15433:22:21:72:540:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage growth at different points in time. However, given that each individual represents a
8:200:15522:21:22:72:539:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:single career, this identification problem is not simply a data issue, but rather arises from
8:201:15615:22:22:72:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:a conceptual consideration that each individual represents one overall career observation.
8:202:15705:22:21:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Although we acknowledge that our discriminating test is not conclusive in the sense that the
8:203:15797:21:22:72:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:trade-offbetweenfirst wages and wage growth is estimated via a cross section of individuals,
8:204:15889:22:22:72:539:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:we hope that it is at least afirst step towards getting insight into the intractable issue of
8:205:15982:22:21:72:488:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:what type of unobserved heterogeneity might be at the root of wage differentials.
8:206:16063:21:22:89:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. The next section presents a model of
8:207:16150:22:22:72:540:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage dynamics and derives the discriminating test to address whether the observed corre-
8:208:16238:22:21:72:540:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:lations between smoking and wage growth is due to time preference or learning ability. In
8:209:16327:21:22:72:540:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Section 3 we present the empirical analysis. We begin with a description of the NLSY data
8:210:16416:22:22:72:539:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and an outline of the estimation framework. We then present thefindings from the wage
8:211:16501:22:21:72:540:172:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:growth regressions and show that the estimated coefficient of the interaction between smok-

8:213:16675:22:0:72:288:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Section 4 concludes with a brief summary.
9:214:16717:0:34:72:347:671:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:2  A Theory of Wage Dynamics
9:215:16745:34:21:72:540:637:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Non-smokers have substantially higher wage growth rates compared to their smoker coun-
9:216:16831:21:22:72:540:616:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:terparts. Since it can be argued that smoking is a possible correlate of either individual
9:217:16921:22:22:72:540:594:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:discount rates or low learning ability and because both the discount rate and learning ability
9:218:17015:22:22:72:540:572:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:are unobserved determinants of wage growth, the observed disparity in wage growth rates
9:219:17102:22:21:72:540:550:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:across non-smokers and smokers as mentioned earlier in the introduction is consistent with
9:220:17192:21:22:71:539:529:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:two alternative hypotheses: smoking is a proxy for discount rates or smoking is a proxy
9:221:17279:22:21:71:539:507:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:for learning ability. To resolve this identification problem, we present a two period inter-
9:222:17371:21:22:71:539:486:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:temporal model of wage dynamics where wages are determined by the interaction of the
9:223:17455:22:22:71:544:464:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:individual discount rate and learning ability. Onthebasisofthismodel,wederiveadis-
9:224:17537:22:21:71:539:442:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:criminating test to address whether smoking is a proxy for discounting or learning ability.
9:225:17628:21:22:71:544:421:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The model follows the logic of Rosen (1974). In thefirst(investment)periodworkerscan
9:226:17712:22:22:71:540:399:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:sacrifice current wages in order to enhance their productivity (and thus wages) in the sec-
9:227:17803:22:22:71:539:377:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:ond (post investment) period. With a few additional assumptions, individual preferences
9:228:17890:22:21:71:539:355:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:(i.e. the discount rate) will then determine the optimal combination of current and future

12:332:22526:30:21:72:539:563:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:First consider the correlation betweenWand∆Wwhenβ(time preference) is unobserved,

12:335:22777:22:21:72:540:498:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:a regression ofWon∆Wwill imply a negative correlation between wage growth andfirst
12:336:22859:21:22:72:540:477:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:period wages.11The question is whether this negative relationship is likely to differ across
12:337:22951:22:22:72:540:455:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers and non-smokers if smoking is a proxy for individual discount rates. From Figure 2
12:338:23041:22:21:72:540:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the answer is obvious: the slope of the production possibility frontier where smokers locate
12:339:23133:21:22:72:539:412:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is relatively steeper. Thus the negative trade-offbetweenfirst period wages and wage growth
12:340:23224:22:22:72:540:390:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is larger for smokers than non-smokers. A slightly more formal argument is presented below.
12:341:23315:22:21:89:539:368:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Suppose under the discounting hypothesis that smoking is a “limited” proxy for individual

12:349:24035:12:12:71:539:224:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ability workers, respectively. That is, we have assumed a constantαacross all workers. If however low
12:350:24136:12:12:72:540:212:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:discount workers (or high ability workers) have made greater pre-market investments then it is likely that
12:351:24242:12:12:72:540:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:these workers may indeed have relatively higher stocksof unobserved skills (since our regression analysis
12:352:24347:12:12:72:539:188:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:controls for various observed human capital characteristics).  Hence if unobservable dimensions ofαare
12:353:24449:12:11:72:540:176:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:higher for low discount and high ability workers then it is indeed possible that they will on average also
12:354:24555:11:9:72:362:165:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:experience higher levels offirst period wages as we see in the data.

12:356:24721:15:12:72:539:141:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:wage growth regression is somewhat artificial in the context of this model. Note that bothWand∆Ware

12:358:24920:12:12:72:539:117:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:it is obvious thatWis an ideal proxy forβ. Thus the inclusion ofWin an wage growth regression could be
12:359:25022:12:0:72:326:105:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:interpreted precisely as a proxy variable for unobservedβ.
13:360:25082:0:22:72:539:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:constant. For illustrative purposes suppose thatβis uniformly distributed, i.e.,β∈[0,1].
13:361:25170:22:22:71:539:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:From the definition ofSit implies thatβS∈[0,β∗]andβNS∈[β∗,1],whereβ∗=λ/k.
13:362:25243:22:21:72:539:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:That is, smokers will have lowerβs and non-smokers will have higherβs, respectively. Since

13:364:25412:22:22:72:540:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:region and top-left region, respectively, of the possibility frontier given by (1). Given the
13:365:25505:22:21:72:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:concavity of (1) the negative relationship betweenWand∆Wwill be lower in absolute terms
13:366:25592:21:22:72:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:for a sample of non-smokers relative to a sample of smokers. Hence, under the hypothesis
13:367:25680:22:22:72:540:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:that smoking is a proxy for discounting, the observed negative trade-offbetweenfirst period
13:368:25771:22:21:72:540:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wages and future wage increases will be relatively less for non-smokers. See the illustrative
13:369:25864:21:22:72:540:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:thick solid and dashed lines in Figure 2 that identify the simple correlation betweenWand

13:371:25997:22:21:89:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Now consider the case where smoking is a proxy for learning ability holding the distrib-

13:373:26176:22:22:71:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is to isolate any possible effect of learning ability on the observed trade-offbetweenfirst
13:374:26267:22:21:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:period wages and wage growth. Given that the overall slope of the production possibility
13:375:26355:21:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:frontier is steeper for the high learning ability workers than it is for the low ability workers,

13:377:26539:22:21:71:539:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:workers. However, given our linear utility function the correct answer is that the observed
13:378:26630:21:22:71:540:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:trade-offbetweenfirst period wage and wage growth is the same across high and low ability
13:379:26719:22:22:71:540:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:workers. To see this more formally, note that the observed trade-offis the ratio of the change
13:380:26813:22:21:71:539:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in earnings growth to the change infirst period earnings, where both changes are due to a
13:381:26902:21:22:71:539:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f8:change inβ. At the limit this is nothing but the partial derivative of∆Wwith respect toβ
13:382:26990:22:22:71:540:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f5:divided by the partial derivative ofWwith respect toβ. Therefore at the limit the trade-off

14:394:27252:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:rate and not also of the training ability. Recall, that under the assumption that smoking
14:395:27341:22:22:72:539:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is a proxy for discounting, this negative trade-offwill be larger for smokers (because they
14:396:27432:22:21:72:539:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:are presumed to have lowerβs) as we claimed earlier; but if smoking is a proxy for learning
14:397:27523:21:22:72:539:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:ability, then there is no difference in the observed negative trade-offbetweenfirst period
14:398:27613:22:22:72:540:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wages and second period wage growth across smokers and non-smokers. This “no difference”
14:399:27701:22:21:72:540:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:result is a consequence of the linear utility function, and as the next example illustrates, with
14:400:27798:21:22:72:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:convex utility functions the observed negative trade-offis predicted to be larger among non-
14:401:27890:22:22:72:540:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers under the learning hypothesis. The point however is that under the two alternative
14:402:27980:22:21:72:542:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:hypotheses the prediction in the difference in this trade-offbetweensmokersandnon-smokers
14:403:28069:21:22:72:359:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is reversed, implying that we have a discriminating test.

14:408:28350:22:21:71:539:345:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:future oriented-ness. Of course this type of utility function is more realistic in the sense that

16:462:31139:21:22:71:539:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:variable in our wage growth analyses. In the individual OLS regressions we specify the wage
16:463:31230:22:22:71:395:584:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:rate metric both as the real wage and as the log of real wage.12
16:464:31294:22:21:89:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:It should be pointed out that although we use a longitudinal data set, effectively we
16:465:31379:21:22:72:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:only observe one career per person. This is a drawback because a complete identification
16:466:31467:22:22:72:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of our model requires multiple observations per person. It is difficult, however, to think of
16:467:31560:22:21:72:540:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:a data set in which individuals are observed making more than one choice concerning their
16:468:31649:21:22:72:540:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:“careers”, and thus making more than one choice of a wage profile (i.e., initial wage as well
16:469:31742:22:35:72:183:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:as wage growth rate).
16:470:31763:35:29:72:269:419:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:3.2  Estimation Framework
16:471:31788:29:22:72:540:390:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:In this section we implement the discriminating test suggested by the model, using the
16:472:31874:22:21:72:539:368:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:NLSY data set. The test requires the inclusion of an interaction term betweenfirst wage
16:473:31961:21:22:71:540:347:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and smoking in a wage growth regression (in addition tofirst wage and smoking as separate
16:474:32050:22:34:71:353:325:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:variables). Therefore, we estimate the following model:
16:475:32105:34:33:197:414:291:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f4:∆Wi=Xiα+α1Si+α2Wi+α3SiWi+εi,
16:476:32133:33:22:72:540:258:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:where∆Wiis a measure of individuali’s wage growth,Xiis a vector of individual charac-
16:477:32218:22:21:72:540:236:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:teristics,Sis a smoking indicator,Wis the individual’sfirst wage, andεiis individuali’s
16:478:32305:21:22:72:540:215:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:error term. The estimated coefficient of the parameterα3will constitute the discriminating
16:479:32395:22:22:72:540:193:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:test between the two sources of unobserved heterogeneity. Our prediction of course is that
16:480:32485:22:18:72:540:171:145:g_d0_f8:145:g_d0_f4:∂∆Wi/∂W <0, implying thatα2is negative. But the discriminating test is whether this
16:481:32568:18:16:81:539:153:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:12Standard wage equations of course only use the log specification. The reason for this practice is the
16:482:32671:16:12:72:540:137:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:universal implementation of Mincer’s human capital earnings function. In the context of our paper, where
16:483:32775:12:12:72:540:125:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:what matters is the perception of wage increases, it is not evident a priori which measure of wage growth is
16:484:32883:12:12:72:539:113:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:more relevant. Therefore, we present evidence using both measures. In a previous version of the paper we
16:485:32987:12:0:72:475:101:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:also used nominal wages and its log counterpart and duplicated the same qualitative results.
17:486:33081:0:22:72:539:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:negative relation between thefirst wage and wage growth is stronger for smokers or non-
17:487:33168:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smokers — i.e. whether the sign onα3is negative or positive. Time preference implies that
17:488:33257:22:34:71:530:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:it should be negative, and learning ability implies that it should be reversed and positive.

17:490:33361:22:30:72:238:571:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:3.3.1  Descriptive Statistics
17:491:33390:30:22:72:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Table 1 presents smoking rates (reported in 1984) for a select group of occupations. In our
17:492:33481:22:21:72:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:entire sample 38% were classified as smokers in 1984.13The variation in this gross smoking
17:493:33571:21:22:71:539:498:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:rate is quite dramatic with “Maids and Housemen” at the high end with a smoking rate of
17:494:33658:22:22:71:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:62%, and “Teachers in Elementary Schools” at the low end with less than 10%. These rates
17:495:33746:22:21:71:343:454:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:are comparable to estimates found in other studies.14
17:496:33799:21:22:89:539:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Table 2 presents some descriptive statistics for smokers and non-smokers. These gross
17:497:33884:22:22:72:539:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:mean characteristics are strikingly different. For example, educational attainment is sub-
17:498:33974:22:21:72:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:stantially higher for the sample of non-smokers.15Non-smokers on average have over one
17:499:34060:21:22:71:539:368:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and a quarter more years of completed schooling, are much more likely to have a high school
17:500:34151:22:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:diploma, and score about 10 points higher on the Armed Forces Qualifying Tests (AFQT).
17:501:34237:22:21:71:540:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The differences in labor market outcomes are even more dramatic. Non-smokers earn higher
17:502:34325:21:22:71:539:303:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wages, have more “net” labor market experience, and have lower turnover rates, than smok-
17:503:34414:22:22:71:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:ers. Not surprisingly, a relatively smaller percent of non-smokers report health as a limiting
17:504:34508:22:17:71:355:259:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:factor to the amount and kind of work they could do.16
17:505:34562:17:16:81:539:242:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:13We define a smoker as someone who smokes at least one cigarette per day on average. This definition is
17:506:34666:16:12:72:539:226:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:more or less comparable to the definition of “current smoker” used by the US Center for Disease Control (See
17:507:34774:12:12:72:539:214:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the data appendix for further details). Similar rates have been reported by others (Evans and Montromery
17:508:34878:12:8:72:286:202:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(1994), Levine, Gustafson and Velenchik (1997)).
17:509:34926:8:16:81:539:194:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:14Although the detailed rankings of occupations by smoking has varied over the years (Nelson et.al. 1994),
17:510:35032:16:12:72:540:178:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:they are broadly similar to ours, where blue collar workers are at the top, and white collar workers are at
17:511:35139:12:8:72:532:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the bottom, where teachers and sales representative have the lowest smoking rates (Bang and Kim, 2001)
17:512:35241:8:12:81:319:158:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:15This is a well-documentedfinding (see Sander 1995).
17:513:35294:12:16:81:539:146:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:16It is possible that individuals having health problems will select into jobs where their health problems
17:514:35400:16:12:72:540:130:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:do not limit their work, thus resulting in an underestimation of health problems due to smoking. We hope
17:515:35504:12:12:72:540:118:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that the use of the word “could” in the survey instrument reduces such a problem. (See data appendix for
17:516:35608:12:0:72:540:106:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the exact wording of the survey instrument.) For additional evidence on the health limitations of smoking
18:517:35715:0:22:89:539:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The gross hourly pay is substantially lower for smokers compared to non-smokers. On
18:518:35798:22:22:72:543:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:average, the non-smoker wage premium is over 15%. The differences infirstwageandwage
18:519:35882:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:growth rates provide further insight into the overall wage disparity between smokers and
18:520:35970:21:22:72:539:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:non-smokers. The meanfirst wage is lower for smokers, but this difference (7%) is not as
18:521:36058:22:22:72:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:substantial as the difference in overall wages.  However, the substantial difference in the
18:522:36149:22:21:72:540:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:increases in hourly wages (.34 versus .21) represents a huge wage growth premium of over
18:523:36237:21:22:72:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:60% between smokers and non-smokers, and thus suggests that wage growth differentials are
18:524:36326:22:31:72:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:largely responsible for the well-documented fact that smokers earn less than non-smokers.17
18:525:36417:31:29:72:224:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:3.3.2  Regression Results
18:526:36442:29:22:72:539:459:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:In Table 3 we report ourfindings from a variety of wage growth models. We present the
18:527:36527:22:22:72:540:437:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:coefficient estimates of smoking,first wage, and interaction of smoking andfirst wage, from
18:528:36618:22:21:71:539:415:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:thefirst to the third row of each panel, respectively. The columns from left to right include
18:529:36711:21:22:71:539:394:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:different control variables: in thefirst column we do not include any additional variables,
18:530:36802:22:22:71:539:372:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and in the second and third columns we include the listed variables cumulatively. In panel

18:532:36966:21:22:89:540:329:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The estimated coefficient of the interaction between smoking andfirst wage (third row
18:533:37051:22:22:71:540:307:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of each panel) is negative and highly significant across all specifications. Note in particular
18:534:37146:22:21:71:539:285:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:that adding a host of control variables, including completed years of schooling and AFQT
18:535:37234:21:22:71:539:264:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:scores,18only seems to strengthen this negative interaction effect. Thisfinding is of course
18:536:37326:22:21:71:539:242:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:consistent with the time preference hypothesis and inconsistent with the learning hypothesis.
18:537:37419:21:8:72:236:221:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:on the job see Leigh (1985 and 1986).
18:538:37456:8:16:81:539:213:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:17If smoking is a proxy for discounting then our measure of wage growth may in fact underestimate the
18:539:37557:16:12:72:540:197:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:“effective” wage growth rate for non-smokers. Since non-smokers are more likely to have a College degree
18:540:37661:12:12:71:539:185:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and thus have considerably higher debt, their wages during the early part of careers will overstate their
18:541:37766:12:12:71:539:173:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:disposable income. Hence the “effective” wage growth differential between non-smokers and smokers is likely
18:542:37873:12:12:71:539:161:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to be even higher than what is suggested by our measured wage growth differences. Similar considerations
18:543:37977:12:12:71:539:149:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:suggest that the “effective”first wage differences between non-smokers and smokers will be smaller than the
18:544:38084:12:12:71:540:137:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:gross differences presented in Table 2. These considerations, however, are unlikely to lead to anyfirst order
18:545:38193:12:8:71:433:125:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:bias of our regression coefficients since we control for completed years of schooling.
18:546:38279:8:16:81:540:117:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:18If we consider schooling time as part of the trade-off, the gap between smokers and non-smokers will be
18:547:38384:16:0:71:348:101:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:much larger, given the lower levels of schooling among smokers.
19:548:38449:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Although this conclusion is unsurprising given that the inclusion of AFQT scores (or the ten
19:549:38541:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:ASVAB scores) failed to nullify the negative effect of smoking on wage growth, the robustness
19:550:38634:22:21:72:539:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of the interaction effect is strong evidence in support of the time preference hypothesis, and
19:551:38728:21:22:72:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:a rejection of the hypothesis that an unobserved dimension of learning ability is the culprit
19:552:38821:22:22:72:431:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:behind the observed correlation between smoking and wage dynamics.
19:553:38887:22:21:89:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:We conclude this section with a few noteworthy comments related to some of the other
19:554:38971:21:22:72:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:coefficient estimates. First, the correlation betweenfirst wage and wage growth is negative as
19:555:39065:22:22:71:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:predicted by dynamic equilibrium models of compensation. Second, the positive coefficient
19:556:39154:22:21:71:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:estimate of smoking should not be interpreted as a reversal of our earlierfinding of a negative
19:557:39249:21:22:71:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:correlation between smoking and wage growth. In the context of including an interaction
19:558:39336:22:22:71:540:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:term betweenfirst wage and smoking, the positive coefficient on smoking simply says that if
19:559:39427:22:21:71:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:thefirst wage is zero then smokers are predicted to have a higher future wage than their non-
19:560:39520:21:22:71:539:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smoker counterparts. Of course this hypothetical exercise is out of sample since we exclude
19:561:39611:22:22:71:539:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:all wage observations below a threshold of $2 (in 1987 dollars) from our analysis. However,
19:562:39702:22:21:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the broader implication of this result may be quite consistent with the time preference
19:563:39789:21:22:71:128:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:hypothesis.
19:564:39800:22:22:89:539:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Averylowfirst wage is likely to yield greater dis-utility for the present-oriented (smokers)
19:565:39892:22:21:71:539:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:than for the future-oriented (non-smokers), and thus the compensating future wage may in
19:566:39980:21:22:71:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:fact be relatively higher for smokers than for non-smokers at very low levels of current wages.
19:567:40075:22:22:71:540:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:None of these considerations, however, negate our keyfinding that an increase infirst wage
19:568:40165:22:21:71:475:237:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:leads to a higher wage growth penalty for smokers compared to non-smokers.19
19:569:40241:21:22:89:539:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:We attempt to summarize our keyfindings in the two diagrams given in Figures 6 and 7.
19:570:40326:22:22:71:540:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Figure 6 simply highlights the fact that smokers have lower andflatter wage profiles based
19:571:40416:22:21:71:540:172:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:on our analysis of the smoking “effects” onfirst wage and wage growth. In Figure 7 the
19:572:40502:21:18:71:539:151:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:graph displays the negative interaction effect of smoking andfirst wage on wage growth.
19:573:40589:18:16:81:539:133:49:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:19Of course in our data we do not observe individuals actually making these trade-offs betweenfirst wage
19:574:40693:16:12:71:539:117:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and wage growth since each individual represents a single data point in all our regressions.  Hence our
19:575:40796:12:0:71:318:105:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:conclusions are clearly based on cross sectional evidence.
20:576:40856:0:22:72:544:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:TheY-axisiswagegrowthandtheX-axisisfirstwage. Thenegativerelationshipshows
20:577:40930:22:22:71:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the predicted trade-offbetweenfirst wage and wage growth. The negative interaction term
20:578:41017:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:is illustrated by the fact that this negative relationship is steeper for smokers than it is for
20:579:41113:21:22:72:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:non-smokers. Note that the Y-intercept is higher for smokers than non-smokers (as implied
20:580:41202:22:22:72:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:by the positive smoking coefficient), but the two lines intersect at a relatively lowfirst wage
20:581:41297:22:21:71:540:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of approximately $4.50.  We also summarize in Figure 7 our earlierfindings depicted in
20:582:41383:21:22:71:540:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Figure 6 — both, lower averagefirst wage and lower average wage growth among smokers
20:583:41467:22:22:71:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:— to illustrate the consistency of our separate analyses. It is clear from Figure 7 that our
20:584:41559:22:21:71:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:earlierfindings are entirely compatible with either a steeper orflatter negative relationship
20:585:41652:21:40:71:342:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:betweenfirst wage and wage growth among smokers.
20:586:41700:40:34:72:213:436:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:4Conclusion
20:587:41711:34:21:72:540:402:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Much of the variation in wages across individuals remains unexplained despite the inclusion
20:588:41802:21:22:72:540:381:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of a host of observed variables. This unexplained variation in wages is due either to the lack of
20:589:41899:22:22:72:540:359:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:data or to the fact that some relevant individual characteristics are inherently unobservable.
20:590:41993:22:21:72:540:337:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The question we address in this paper is simple but challenging: Is it possible to say whether
20:591:42087:21:22:72:539:316:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:unexplained wage growth differentials across individuals is due to one type of unobserved
20:592:42176:22:22:72:540:294:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:heterogeneity or another? We consider time preference (discounting) and learning ability
20:593:42264:22:21:71:539:272:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:as two possible sources of unobserved heterogeneity that could in principle explain wage
20:594:42352:21:22:71:539:251:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:growth differences, and develop a test to address whether wage growth differentials are due
20:595:42443:22:22:71:539:229:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:to time preference or unobserved learning ability. In particular, we argue on the basis of
20:596:42533:22:21:71:540:207:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:evidence from our discriminating test that the significant differences in wage growth rates
20:597:42624:21:22:71:539:186:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:between smokers and non-smokers are due (unobserved) differences in the mean discount
20:598:42709:22:22:71:274:164:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:rate between smokers and non-smokers.
20:599:42746:22:21:89:540:142:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Ourfindings raise the possibility that a variety of psychological and personality traits are
20:600:42838:21:0:71:539:121:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:likely to be more important than simple cognitive ability to process information in explaining
21:601:42934:0:22:72:539:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:differences in labor market outcomes across individuals. As a consequence research endeavors
21:602:43026:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:related to the various dimensions and interactions of what we refer to in economic parlance
21:603:43117:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:as the “individual discount rate,” are likely to provide insights not only to our understanding
21:604:43212:21:22:72:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of career choice, investment in human capital, and wage determination, but more broadly to
21:605:43302:22:0:72:435:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:our understanding of the distribution of wealth, health, and happiness.
22:606:43375:0:22:72:540:671:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:5  Data Appendix: National Longitudinal Surveys of
22:607:43425:22:34:101:229:649:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:Youth, 1979-94
22:608:43439:34:21:72:540:615:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Our data is from the NLSY. This is a panel of 12,686 youth, aged 14-21 in 1978, and sampled
22:609:43530:21:22:72:540:594:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:continuously since 1979. Our sample includes data up to 1994. We include individuals in our
22:610:43621:22:22:72:539:572:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:sample when theyfirst report that their “main activity” is “working.” Therefore, our “First
22:611:43712:22:21:72:540:550:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Wage” variable is recorded accordingly. A key variable of our analysis is whether, in 1984,
22:612:43803:21:22:72:540:529:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:respondents answered affirmatively to whether they smoked or not. We classify a smoker
22:613:43889:22:22:72:540:507:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:(in 1984) as a person who at least smoked one cigarette per day on average. Out of 12,584
22:614:43978:22:21:72:540:485:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:who responded, 38.8% were classified as smokers. Similar, but not exact, questions were
22:615:44065:21:22:72:540:464:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:also asked in 1992. A smoker was classified as someone who “smokes daily” (as opposed to
22:616:44153:22:22:72:540:442:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:“occasionally” or “not at all”). Of the 8,341 who responded in 1992, 28.92% were classified
22:617:44244:22:21:72:540:420:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:as smokers.  We utilized only the 1984 smoking questions for the following reasons: By
22:618:44330:21:22:72:540:399:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:1992 the number of individuals that answered the smoking survey dropped dramatically due
22:619:44418:22:22:72:540:377:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:to sample attrition. Only 7,822 individuals answered the 1992 survey and had valid wage
22:620:44505:22:21:72:540:355:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:growth measures. More important, the sample attrition was not random. Individuals who
22:621:44590:21:22:72:540:334:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:smoked in 1984 were more likely to drop out, and even worse, those with lower wage growth
22:622:44679:22:22:72:290:312:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:were substantially more likely to drop out.
22:623:44722:22:21:89:539:290:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Our principal dependent variable is a wage growth measure for each individual con-
22:624:44804:21:22:72:540:269:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:structed over thefirst several years in the labor market.  We construct a wage growth
22:625:44889:22:22:72:540:247:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:coefficient for each individual by estimating a wage regression as a function of time only.
22:626:44980:22:21:71:540:225:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:This estimated coefficient is our measure of individual wage growth rates. For wages we use
22:627:45071:21:22:71:540:204:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:two measures of hourly payments, real wages (in1987 dollars) and their natural logarithm.
22:628:45160:22:22:72:540:182:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:In an earlier version of the paper we also used nominal wages. Since none of our results was
22:629:45252:22:21:72:539:160:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:affected by the use of nominal wages, we limit the analysis here to real wages. We consider
22:630:45343:21:22:71:539:139:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:wage reports to be valid only if nominal pay is between $2 and $200. Given the construction
22:631:45434:22:0:71:539:117:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of our wage growth measure, a minimum of two valid observations per individual is required
23:632:45526:0:22:72:265:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in order to be included in the sample.
23:633:45564:22:22:89:507:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Below we discuss the construction of several key variables used in the regressions.
23:634:45647:22:21:89:539:627:145:g_d0_f19:145:g_d0_f4:Health. Respondents in the NLSY were asked, in each survey, the following two questions:
23:635:45735:21:22:71:539:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:(1) “hltamt” - whether health limited the amount of work you could do since last survey
23:636:45822:22:22:71:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:(“(are you/would you be) limited in the kind of work you (could) do on a job for pay because
23:637:45914:22:21:71:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of your health?”), and (2) “hltknd” - whether health limited the kind of work you could do
23:638:46004:21:22:71:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:since last survey (“(are you/would you be) limited in the amount of work you (could) do
23:639:46091:22:22:71:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:because of your health?”). Using the answer to these two questions we constructed several
23:640:46180:22:21:71:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:other additional health measures: (1) “evera” - if a person ever reported hltamt=1; (2)
23:641:46267:21:22:71:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:“everk” - if a person ever reported hltknd=1; (3) “mhlta” - % of times reported hltamt=1;
23:642:46356:22:22:71:539:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and (4) “mhltk” - % of times reported hltknd=1. We experimented with all these measures
23:643:46443:22:21:71:540:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:but report the regression results using“mhltk” only. None of the results was affected by
23:644:46531:21:22:71:345:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:using any of the other alternative measures of health.
23:645:46585:22:22:89:540:389:145:g_d0_f19:145:g_d0_f4:Schooling. We use the respondents report on “highest grade completed” to construct six
23:646:46671:22:21:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:schooling dummies: 8 years or less, 9-11 years, 12 years, 12-15 years, 16 years, and 17+ years.
23:647:46766:21:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:We report only the results using the dummy variables. Replacing the schooling dummies
23:648:46851:22:22:71:346:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:with the continuous measure didn’t affect our results.
23:649:46905:22:21:89:539:302:145:g_d0_f19:145:g_d0_f4:AFQT Scores. During the summer and fall of 1980, NLSY79 respondents participated
23:650:46985:21:22:72:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in an effort of the U.S. Departments of Defense and Military Services to update the norms
23:651:47074:22:22:72:540:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The Department of Defense
23:652:47158:22:21:72:540:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and Congress, after questioning the appropriateness of using the World War II reference
23:653:47245:21:22:72:540:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:population as the primary basis for interpreting the enlistment test scores of contemporary
23:654:47336:22:22:72:540:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:recruits, decided in 1979 to conduct this new study. NLSY79 respondents were selected since
23:655:47427:22:21:72:540:172:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:they comprised a pre-existing nationally representative sample of young people born during
23:656:47517:21:22:72:539:151:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the period 1957 through 1964. This testing, which came to be referred to as the “Profile
23:657:47605:22:22:72:540:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of American Youth,” was conducted by NORC (National Organization for Research at the
23:658:47689:22:0:72:540:107:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:University of Chicago) representatives according to standard ASVAB procedure guidelines;
24:659:47779:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:respondents were paid $50 for their participation. Groups offive to ten persons were tested
24:660:47870:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:at more than 400 test sites, including hotels, community centers, and libraries throughout
24:661:47960:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the United States and abroad. A total of 11,914 civilian and military NLSY79 respondents
24:662:48048:21:22:72:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:(or 94 percent of the 1979 sample) completed this test: 5,766 or 94.4 percent of the cross-
24:663:48139:22:22:72:540:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:sectional sample, 4,990 or 94.2 percent of the supplemental sample, and 1,158 or 90.5 percent
24:664:48232:22:21:72:188:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of the military sample.
24:665:48255:21:22:89:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The ASVAB consists of a battery of 10 tests that measure knowledge and skill in the
24:666:48338:22:22:72:540:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:following areas: (1) general science; (2) arithmetic reasoning; (3) word knowledge; (4) para-
24:667:48431:22:21:72:540:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:graph comprehension; (5) numerical operations; (6) coding speed; (7) auto and shop in-
24:668:48517:21:22:72:540:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:formation; (8) mathematics knowledge; (9) mechanical comprehension; and (10) electronics
24:669:48605:22:22:72:540:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:information. A composite score derived from select sections of the battery can be used to
24:670:48694:22:21:72:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:construct an approximate and unofficial Armed Forces Qualifications Test score (AFQT)
24:671:48779:21:22:72:540:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:for each youth.  The AFQT is a general measure of trainability and a primary criterion
24:672:48865:22:22:72:540:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of enlistment eligibility for the Armed Forces. The creation of this percentile score, called
24:673:48958:22:21:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:AFQT89, involves: (1) computing a verbal composite score by summing word knowledge
24:674:49040:21:22:72:540:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and paragraph comprehension raw scores; (2) converting subtest raw scores for verbal, math
24:675:49130:22:22:72:540:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning; (3) multiplying the verbal standard score by two; (4)
24:676:49220:22:21:72:540:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:summing the standard scores for verbal, math knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning; and (5)
24:677:49309:21:22:72:350:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:converting the summed standard score to a percentile.
24:678:49362:22:22:89:539:259:145:g_d0_f19:145:g_d0_f4:Religion. We use two indicators for religious affiliation and frequency of attending reli-
24:679:49452:22:21:72:540:237:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:gious services: (1) dummy variables indicating whether the person was raised Protestant,
24:680:49540:21:22:72:540:216:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Baptist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, or Jewish. (2)
24:681:49628:22:22:72:540:194:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:The frequency in which respondents attended religious services (never, several times a year,
24:682:49720:22:21:72:540:172:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:about once a month, three times a month, about once a week, or more than once a week). In
24:683:49809:21:22:72:540:151:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:the regressions’ results reported in the paper we include both measures: religious affiliation
24:684:49903:22:22:72:220:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and frequency of attendance.
24:685:49931:22:0:89:540:107:145:g_d0_f19:145:g_d0_f4:Neighborhood Income. This variable was constructed using the 1980 census of population
25:686:50019:0:22:72:540:671:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:and later matched to the NLSY sample. It was calculated to describe the expected value
25:687:50105:22:22:72:540:649:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of a person’s neighborhood per capita income, given their race (white, black, or Hispanic),
25:688:50196:22:21:72:540:627:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:education level (less than 8 years, 9-11 years, 12-15 years, or 16+ years), and the county
25:689:50286:21:22:72:540:606:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:they live in, using data from the 1980 Census. Neighborhoods are defined as block groups
25:690:50374:22:22:71:539:584:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in the 1980 Census, so each block group’s per capita income was calculated by dividing
25:691:50460:22:21:71:539:562:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:aggregate household income for the block group by the total number of persons living in
25:692:50547:21:22:71:539:541:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:that block group. (Both of these were variables given to us by the census.) Since the 1980
25:693:50637:22:22:71:539:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Census does not include Hispanic as one of their race categories, but rather as an ethnic
25:694:50726:22:21:71:539:497:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:category separate of race (Hispanic persons were placed into one offive race categories:
25:695:50814:21:22:71:539:476:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:white, black, Asian, Native American or other.), we needed to approximate the number of
25:696:50901:22:22:71:539:454:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks living in each block group.  We
25:697:50987:22:21:71:539:432:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:did this by generating a beta for each race, which would represent the percent of Hispanic
25:698:51077:21:22:71:539:411:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:persons that are of that race, and multiplying it by the number of Hispanic persons living
25:699:51167:22:22:71:539:389:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:in the block group.  This would approximate the number of Hispanic persons that were
25:700:51251:22:21:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:recorded as belonging to each race, so that these categories could be amended. (This process
25:701:51343:21:22:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:was done for each block group and for each education level. It was repeated several times,
25:702:51433:22:22:71:539:324:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:replacing the betas, for precision.) The outcomes of this process were numbers for Hispanic,
25:703:51525:22:21:71:539:302:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black persons in each education level for each block
25:704:51614:21:22:71:539:281:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:group. “Neighborhood Income” was then found by creating the expected value of a person
25:705:51700:22:0:71:318:259:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:of race X and education level Y for each county.
