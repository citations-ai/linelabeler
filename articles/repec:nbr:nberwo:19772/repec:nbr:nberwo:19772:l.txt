2:36:2097:28:14:71:539:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:This paper provides quasi-experimental estimates of the causal effect of long-term unemployment
2:37:2192:14:14:71:539:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:on wages. Using standard job search theory, the paper derives and tests conditions on reemployment
2:38:2290:14:14:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:wages under which Unemployment Insurance (UI) extensions can be used as instrumental variables
2:39:2384:14:14:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:(IV) for unemployment duration. Using a regression discontinuity design, the paper shows that UI
2:40:2480:14:14:71:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:extensions at age thresholds reduced reemployment wages of job searchers in Germany. The UI
2:41:2558:14:14:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:extensions do not affect the reemployment wages conditional on the month of unemployment exit,
2:42:2652:14:14:71:538:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:implying reservation wages do not bind on average. Hence, UI extensions affect mean wages only
2:43:2746:14:14:71:538:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:through unemployment durations. Our IV estimates imply substantial negative effects of unemployment
2:44:2845:14:42:72:255:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:duration on wages of 0.8% per month.

3:69:3351:0:33:68:162:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:70:3366:33:21:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:At the peak of the Great Recession, long-term unemployment (unemployment spell lasting
3:71:3452:21:22:68:543:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more than one year) in the United States rose to a historical 5 million individuals, and stands
3:72:3547:22:21:68:543:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at 3.2 million in 2014. In many European countries, long-term unemployment has been a
3:73:3632:21:21:68:543:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persistent feature of labor markets since at least the early 1980s.  There is an increasing
3:74:3723:21:21:68:543:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:concern among policy makers and academics as to the costs of rising unemployment durations
3:75:3813:21:22:68:543:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to individuals and families, as well as for the labor market and the economy as a whole
3:76:3900:22:21:68:543:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., Bernanke 2012, Yellen 2014).1However, there are few causal estimates of the effect
3:77:3989:21:21:68:543:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of unemployment duration on wages, earnings, or other outcomes.2This makes it not only
3:78:4075:21:22:68:543:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difficult to assess the costs of long-term unemployment, but also difficult to choose policies
3:79:4169:22:21:68:543:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at both the micro and the macro level.3For example, if nonemployment durations decrease
3:80:4256:21:21:68:543:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reemployment wages, extensions in unemployment insurance (UI) durations – the largest
3:81:4341:21:22:68:543:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government program geared towards job losers in recessions – may hurt the prospects of job
3:82:4431:22:21:68:383:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:losers rather than helping them to obtain better job matches.
3:83:4492:21:21:85:543:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use the term ‘the causal effect of unemployment durations on job outcomes’ to describe
3:84:4581:21:22:68:543:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:how rising unemployment durations harm the job prospects of unemployed workers..  An
3:85:4665:22:21:68:543:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual who is unemployed longer may receive different job offers the longer the duration of
3:86:4760:21:21:68:543:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment, e.g. because of skill depreciation or stigma. Thus the worker will effectively
3:87:4852:21:21:68:543:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:face different labor demand solely due to the fact that she has been out of work longer. In
3:88:4943:21:22:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addition the worker may accept different jobs the longer she is unemployed (she may have a
3:89:5033:22:21:68:543:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:declining reservation wage), effectively constituting a labor supply response. We define the
3:90:5125:21:18:68:543:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:‘causal effect of unemployment duration’ as the change in reemployment wages that comes only
3:91:5217:18:16:81:543:231:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1It is widely thought that long unemployment durations can lower reemployment wages and other job
3:92:5314:16:11:68:543:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:outcomes of workers via depreciation of skills or because of stigma (e.g., Acemoglu 1995, Machin and Manning
3:93:5422:11:12:68:543:204:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:1999). As a result, long-term unemployment can affect the aggregate labor market and economic recovery
3:94:5524:12:9:68:344:192:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(e.g., Pissarides 1992, Ljungqvist and Sargent 2008, Ball 2009).
3:95:5588:9:15:81:543:183:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2We found essentially no studies estimating the effect of long-term unemployment on any outcome using
3:96:5689:15:12:68:543:168:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:quasi-experimental variation or within-spell variation from panels. This is reflected in Bernanke (2012) and
3:97:5797:12:12:68:543:156:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Yellen (2014), who do not cite a single empirical study in support of the claim that unemployment duration
3:98:5903:12:12:68:543:144:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:is costly. As discussed below, several studies estimate the depreciation of human capital as one of several
3:99:6010:12:9:68:256:132:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:parameters in models of life-cycle earnings.
3:100:6054:9:15:81:543:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:3Several papers show that the degree of skill depreciation affects the optimal policy mix at the micro level
3:101:6162:15:12:68:543:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(e.g., Shimer and Werning 2006, Pavoni and Violante 2007, Pavoni 2009). Moreover, the speed and sources of
3:102:6268:12:12:68:543:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:wage loss with unemployment duration have important implications for the potential usefulness of both fiscal
3:103:6376:12:0:68:292:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and monetary policy over the short and longer run.
4:104:6427:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the labor demand side, holding job acceptance decisions (labor supply) constant. This
4:105:6517:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change in the wage offer distribution throughout the unemployment spell is an important
4:106:6604:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameter as it describes how quickly the job prospects of the unemployed are declining,
4:107:6692:22:21:68:266:647:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:independent from their own decisions.4
4:108:6730:21:21:85:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Existing estimates suggest that the cost of a widespread rise of unemployment duration
4:109:6816:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:could indeed be very large.5However, these estimates potentially overstate the effect of unem-
4:110:6910:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment duration on job outcomes for two reasons. A common concern is that workers with
4:111:6998:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:longer nonemployment durations also have other, potentially unobserved characteristics that
4:112:7089:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make them hard to employ and lower their wages. Furthermore one would expect that any
4:113:7174:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous manipulation that affects nonemployment durations would also lead to changes in
4:114:7263:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which jobs are accepted by the unemployed. As a result, even estimates free of selection gener-
4:115:7358:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ally recover a combination of effects arising from the individual’s labor supply response (e.g., a
4:116:7456:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change in reservation wages) and a decline in wage offers in response to longer unemployment
4:117:7548:21:21:68:491:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations (what we call the causal effect on wages) and are thus hard to interpret.
4:118:7631:21:21:85:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of the causal effect of
4:119:7719:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment duration on wage offers. These estimates are free of selection and of effects from
4:120:7814:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in the reservation wage, and hence reflect true shifts in the wage offer distribution. We
4:121:7911:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:begin by laying out a conceptual framework based on the canonical partial-equilibrium model
4:122:8002:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of job search in which both unemployment duration and reemployment wages are endogenous,
4:123:8090:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which we augment with worker heterogeneity. A classic prediction from the model is that if
4:124:8180:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers value their outside option, a rise in potential UI durations leads to a decline in job
4:125:8274:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:search intensity and a rise in reservation wages.  A key insight we exploit is that one can
4:126:8365:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:learn about the behavior of reservation wages from observed reemployment wages at different
4:127:8456:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment durations. In particular, we show that if the path of observed reemployment
4:128:8544:21:18:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages does not shift outward in response to a rise in UI durations, this implies that reservation
4:129:8641:18:16:81:543:182:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4The duration of unemployment is an endogenous variable, determined by individuals’ search effort and
4:130:8742:16:12:68:543:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:job acceptance decisions as well as random arrivals of job offers. As in any instrumental variables setting, we
4:131:8853:12:12:68:543:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:identify the effect of unemploment duration that results from explit exogenous variation. Below, we derive
4:132:8959:12:8:68:334:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the mathematical formula for the treatment effect we obtain.
4:133:9019:8:15:81:543:134:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5Violante and Pavoni (2007) put consensus estimates from structural models (e.g., Keane and Wolpin 1997)
4:134:9123:15:12:68:543:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and regression studies (e.g., Addison and Portugal 1989) at 16-23% wage loss per year. For 3.2 million workers
4:135:9233:12:12:68:543:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:with unemployment spells longer than one year that implies a loss of over $30 Billion at median earnings.
4:136:9338:12:12:68:543:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:This loss is understated since many individuals have unemployment spells longer than one year, and skill
4:137:9442:12:12:68:543:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:depreciation is usually specified linearly, implying losses for the many unemployment spells lasting below one
4:138:9552:12:0:68:121:71:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:year as well.
5:139:9566:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages do not bind, at least in the part of the wage offer distribution relevant for workers’
5:140:9658:21:21:68:182:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment decisions.
5:141:9679:21:22:85:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If the condition on reemployment wages are satisfied in the data, the only effect of nonem-
5:142:9770:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment durations on wages must arise from the wage offer distribution changing over the
5:143:9859:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration of unemployment. We derive an expression of the resulting instrumental variables
5:144:9948:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(IV) estimator, show that it obtains a local average treatment effect of unemployment dura-
5:145:10039:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion on wages over individuals whose nonemployment duration responds to the UI extension,
5:146:10128:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and derive an estimable expression of the corresponding weighting function. To gain further
5:147:10219:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insights on the potential role of reservation wages, which are likely to affect the lower tail of
5:148:10316:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accepted wages, we also extend our approach to estimate the average effect of nonemployment
5:149:10407:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration throughout the wage distribution. Based on the theory, we derive bounds for the
5:150:10495:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:causal effect of nonemployment duration on wages in case the condition on reemployment
5:151:10581:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages does not hold and instead reservation wages do seem to affect job prospects in response
5:152:10674:21:21:68:155:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to UI extensions.
5:153:10691:21:21:85:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We implement our conceptual framework using quasi-experimental variation and data from
5:154:10777:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Germany, which has several features that are ideal for our purposes. During the 1980s, UI
5:155:10866:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations for middle aged workers in Germany were a step function of exact age at benefit
5:156:10955:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:claiming, such that the causal effect of UI durations on job outcomes can be estimated using
5:157:11047:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a regression discontinuity design. A key feature of the German environment is that we have
5:158:11137:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:access to the universe of social security records with information on day-to-day nonemployment
5:159:11231:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spells, exact dates of birth, as well as a broad range of worker and job characteristics. The
5:160:11324:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large samples and precisely measured unemployment and earnings information turn out to be
5:161:11413:22:21:68:435:242:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:crucial for estimating the effect of nonemployment durations on wages.6
5:162:11484:21:21:85:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We obtain three main findings. First, we find small but precisely estimated negative effects
5:163:11576:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of UI extensions on wages, job duration, and other job outcomes of middle aged workers, such
5:164:11668:22:17:68:543:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the probability of full-time work and working in the same industry and occupation. Second,
5:165:11761:17:16:81:543:161:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:6Similar data is currently not available for the United States, because administrative data do not measure
5:166:11867:16:12:68:543:145:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:exact unemployment and job durations, and samples from survey data are too small. During the period we
5:167:11969:12:12:68:543:133:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:study, the incidence of long unemployment spells and effect of UI extensions on unemployment duration in
5:168:12073:12:12:68:543:121:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Germany were similar to comparable estimates for the United States (Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender
5:169:12175:12:12:68:543:109:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2012); the size and structure of wage losses of job losers were similar as in the United States (Schmieder, von
5:170:12286:12:12:68:543:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Wachter, and Bender 2009); it is well known that the structure of earnings in the United States and Germany
5:171:12393:12:0:68:143:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:is similar as well.
6:172:12413:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we show that the path of average reemployment wages at different nonemployment durations
6:173:12501:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not shift, implying that reservation wages do not bind in our setting.  As a result,
6:174:12590:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages do not contribute to declining wages over the nonemployment spell, and one
6:175:12682:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can use UI extensions as valid manipulation of nonemployment durations. Third, we obtain
6:176:12770:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IV estimates of the causal effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers. We find that for
6:177:12863:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each additional month in nonemployment duration, average daily wages decline by a bit less
6:178:12953:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than one percent. Thes results are robust to bounds resulting from small effects of reservation
6:179:13048:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages consistent with our wage data. If one extrapolates linearly over the course of six months,
6:180:13144:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this effect can explain about a third of the average wage loss of unemployed workers. This
6:181:13234:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect fades after people have been on a job for a few years and is statistically indistinguishable
6:182:13333:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from zero after five years. This negative effect can arise from multiple sources, including skill
6:183:13430:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depreciation, stigma effects, or changes in job characteristics, something we address explicitly
6:184:13526:22:21:68:197:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our empirical analysis.
6:185:13552:21:21:85:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper is related to several strands of literature. Foremost, it presents both a framework
6:186:13645:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for obtaining causal estimates of the effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers, and a
6:187:13738:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new set of causal estimates, neither of which is currently available in the literature. Existing
6:188:13834:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates of wage effects are typically based on cross-sectional analyses of nonemployment
6:189:13924:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations and wages (e.g., Addison and Portugal 1989), or derived from structural models (e.g.,
6:190:14019:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Keane and Wolpin 1997).7While our ordinary-least squares estimates are of similar magnitude
6:191:14110:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as in the existing literature, our IV estimates are about two-thirds to a half of the basic
6:192:14201:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlation, suggesting a potential role of negative selection in standard estimates. In a recent
6:193:14298:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper, using an audit study Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013) provided experimental
6:194:14384:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence showing that there is a negative causal effect of nonemployment durations on call
6:195:14474:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:back rates for job interviews.  Our paper extends these findings by studying the effect of
6:196:14564:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment on other key outcomes of the employment process, wages and job outcomes,
6:197:14649:22:21:68:543:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which are harder to analyze in the context of an audit study because they inherently depend
6:198:14740:21:21:68:249:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the actual employment decision.
6:199:14774:21:21:85:543:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The parameter we estimate is important for policy. Our findings can be used to assess
6:200:14859:21:18:68:543:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with more confidence the potential cost of rising unenmployment durations for middle aged
6:201:14948:18:16:81:543:97:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7In an exception, Edin and Gustavsson (2008) document a significant negative effect of nonemployment
6:202:15048:16:12:68:543:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:spells on direct measures of skills in Sweden. Estimates of the earnings losses of displaced workers have also
6:203:15158:12:0:68:463:69:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:been used to infer the correlation of nonemployment duration and wages (e.g., Neal 1995).
7:204:15248:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers. Since we find that our IV estimate puts weight on all workers exiting unemployment
7:205:15339:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from one to 18 months, our results suggest even shorter increases in unemployment duration
7:206:15429:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be costly.  Our estimates can be used to calibrate models in macroeconomics or in
7:207:15514:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:public finance in which the causal effect of nonemployment plays an important role. In public
7:208:15607:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finance, a growing theoretical literature shows how the structure of labor market depends on
7:209:15699:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the degree of wage decline with nonemployment. For example, Pavoni and Violante (2007)
7:210:15785:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that this parameter plays a key role when multiple labor market policies are chosen
7:211:15873:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jointly. In macroeconomics, a series of papers by Ljungqvist and Sargent (2008) argues that
7:212:15964:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:skill depreciation in conjunction with generous UI benefits has led to rising unemployment
7:213:16054:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates in Europe in the 1980s. For the 2008 recession in the U.S., Katz, Kroft, Lange, and
7:214:16143:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Notowidigdo (2013) argue that negative duration dependence may explain part of the lasting
7:215:16233:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rise in long-term unemployment.  In an extension of our main findings, we show that the
7:216:16320:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of unemployment durations on wages appears to be larger in recessionary environments.
7:217:16412:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence, a negative causal effect of nonemployment duration on wage offers may indeed be a
7:218:16500:21:21:68:255:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reason for this duration dependence.
7:219:16536:21:22:85:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our findings also relate to the literature examining the properties and effects of reser-
7:220:16625:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vation wages. Most of the literature is based on survey evidence of reservation wages (e.g.,
7:221:16717:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Feldstein and Poterba 1984, Blau and Robins 1986, DellaVigna and Paserman 2005, Krueger
7:222:16804:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Mueller 2011, 2014). In contrast, here we show that it is possible to infer about the effect
7:223:16900:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of and changes in reservation wages directly when quasi-experimental variation of workers’
7:224:16990:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outside option is available. As in many other areas of economics, such a revealed-preference
7:225:17082:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach allows one to side step important measurement issues and hence provides an impor-
7:226:17172:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tant complement to analyses of stated preferences. This is in a similar spirit as Hornstein,

7:235:18037:11:0:68:447:79:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:at UI exhaustion that induces a slight positive overall effect of UI extensions on wages.
8:236:18127:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages are effectively unaffected by unemployment duration and UI exhaustion.  Hence, as
8:237:18214:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our setting, changes in reservation wages are unlikely to be responsible for reductions in

8:254:19571:33:22:68:543:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We use a discrete time, non-stationary search model (e.g. van den Berg 1990) to derive our
8:255:19661:22:21:68:543:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:main findings in three steps. First, we show how the effect of UI extensions on reemployment
8:256:19753:21:21:68:543:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages can be decomposed into changes in reservation wages and changes in the wage offer
8:257:19840:21:21:68:543:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution over the nonemployment spell.10Second, we use the model to show how the

9:282:21939:22:21:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:due to skill depreciation or stigma. To simplify the exposition we assume that the distribution

9:291:22654:29:21:68:543:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since unemployment duration is a choice variable in the model, it is useful to explicitly define

10:351:24968:15:16:77:543:157:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:12Our model is a discrete model in time, but for the following the notation will be simpler if we can work
10:352:25074:16:12:68:543:141:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f11:F:with time derivatives. In the model only the values ofφt,μtandwe(t,P)at discrete values of time{0,1,2,...}
10:353:25180:12:12:68:543:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are necessary to describe the relevant environment for an individual and the optimal search strategy. Without
10:354:25289:12:12:68:543:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:loss of generality we can therefore define the values ofφt,μtandwe(t,P)for the time values between these

10:357:25593:12:8:68:543:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:at the integer values. All time derivatives below are right derivatives so that by construction we have that:

11:365:26014:29:21:68:543:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To simplify the exposition we will first analyze the model under the additional assumption that

11:372:26286:17:22:68:543:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Below we will show that our result generalizes to the nonlinear case with heterogenous workers.

12:489:29278:21:38:68:525:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution with lower reservation wages – will tend to decrease the reemployment wage.

13:534:30731:22:21:68:543:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a straightforward test for whether or not reservation wages affect reemployment wages. If

13:539:31003:17:22:85:543:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that if reservation wages do not affect reemployment wages, then an increase in UI
13:540:31090:22:21:68:543:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations affects wages only through a rise in nonemployment durations and a corresponding
13:541:31180:21:21:68:543:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decline in wage offers (the third term in equation 5). In this case, UI extensions satisfy all
13:542:31274:21:22:68:543:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:conditions of a valid instrumental variable. From equation (5), thecausal effect of nonemploy-
13:543:31368:22:21:68:543:403:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment durations on wagesis simply the ratio between the effect of UI extensions on the average
13:544:31461:21:21:68:543:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage and the effect of UI extensions on nonemployment durations, which is the formula of
13:545:31549:21:22:68:543:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the standard IV estimator. In other words, if the conditions on the reemployment hazard
13:546:31636:22:21:68:543:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the path of reemployment wages hold, then the change in the wage offer distribution
13:547:31723:21:21:68:543:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be estimated by regressing wages on nonemployment durations using UI extensions as an

13:549:31823:22:21:85:543:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that the result that the reemployment wage path does not shift in response to UI
13:550:31908:21:21:68:543:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extensions does not necessarily imply that the reservation wage is not binding for the entire
13:551:32001:21:21:68:543:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage distribution. In the Web Appendix we show that all that is required for our empirical
13:552:32091:21:22:68:543:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy to hold is that for small changes reservation wages have no effectlocallyin the
13:553:32179:22:21:68:543:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution. This can be the case if for example the wage offer distribution is bimodal, with a
13:554:32275:21:18:68:543:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mode for very low wage jobs, and a mode for higher wage jobs, with little density in between.
13:555:32368:18:16:77:543:151:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:13Note that we have implicitly assumed that there is no direct of UI extensions on the wage offer distribution

14:591:33314:29:21:68:543:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The results generalize to the case of heterogeneous workers and nonlinear changes in reem-
14:592:33404:21:21:68:543:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment wage path. Allowing for heterogeneity in our context is important since it makes
14:593:33493:21:21:68:543:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it clear that our estimates of the effect of UI extensions on the path of reemployment wages
14:594:33585:21:22:68:543:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be affected by dynamic selection. As we further discuss in Section 3.3, selection may
14:595:33674:22:21:68:543:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entail either higher or lower ability individuals searching longer or responding more strongly
14:596:33768:21:21:68:543:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to UI incentives. In the theory, heterogeneity is purposefully kept completely flexible. In our
14:597:33863:21:22:68:543:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical analysis, we resolve the problem of dynamic selection using our quasi-experimental
14:598:33955:22:21:68:148:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research design.
14:599:33971:21:21:85:543:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Heterogeneity is also important because in its presence our IV estimates will be a weighted
14:600:34062:21:22:68:543:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average of the individual-specific treatment effects. Moreover, since skill depreciation is not
14:601:34157:22:21:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily linear throughout the nonemployment spell, the IV estimates will also be an average
14:602:34252:21:21:68:543:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over different parts of the potentially nonlinear skill depreciation schedule.  To be able to
14:603:34345:21:22:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interpret the IV estimate, we derive an expression for the IV estimator and its weighting

14:639:35036:21:18:68:543:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneous and nonlinear case. The average effect of extending UI benefits on wages can
14:640:35126:18:16:77:543:97:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:15One can show that if the wage distribution has a range in which workers do not receive wage offers and the
14:641:35234:16:12:68:543:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:reservation wage lies in that range, then our empirical strategy measures the causal effect of nonemployment

15:655:36322:21:21:85:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As in the linear, homogenous case, if the reemployment wage path is not affected by
15:656:36405:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in potential UI durations, then we can infer that the reservation wage does not affect
15:657:36499:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reemployment wages.  Thus, the second term in equation (7) would reduce to a weighted

16:707:37759:30:21:85:543:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition 1 states that the IV estimator from a regression of wages on nonemployment
16:708:37845:21:21:68:543:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations using UI extensions as an instrument has an interpretation of a local average treat-
16:709:37939:21:21:68:543:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment effect of unemployment durations on wages. The weighting functionω∗(t)is proportional
16:710:38029:21:22:68:543:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the differences in survivor functions. The IV estimator puts more weight on those individ-
16:711:38122:22:21:68:543:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uals whose nonemployment durations respond more strongly to the instrument (i.e., whose
16:712:38209:21:21:68:543:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:survival functions are shifting).  This is akin to the standard result in linear models with
16:713:38301:21:22:68:543:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneous parameters (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996), but is here derived for the gen-
16:714:38393:22:21:68:543:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eral case in which wages may be a nonlinear function of nonemployment durations (Angrist,
16:715:38482:21:21:68:543:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Graddy, and Imbens 2000). Hence, as in the more standard linear case, the weighting function
16:716:38574:21:22:68:543:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be estimated from the data. In the empirical section, we discuss the weighting function,
16:717:38666:22:21:68:543:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discuss how the IV estimator is affected if the underlying conditions of Propositions 1 fail, and
16:718:38763:21:38:68:537:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we present bounds for the case in which there are small shifts in the reservation wage path.

16:720:38886:29:21:68:543:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The main results do not depend on the particular model of wage setting. The contribution
16:721:38974:21:21:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the theory is to show that estimating whether the path of reemployment wages is affected
16:722:39065:21:22:68:543:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by changes in the UI benefit path (or other factors affecting the value of nonemployment),
16:723:39155:22:21:68:543:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provides a test for the importance of the outside option of unemployed workers in the wage
16:724:39245:21:21:68:543:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determination process. If reemployment wages conditional on unemployment duration do not
16:725:39333:21:22:68:543:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respond to changes in the outside option, then the decline of reemployment wages over the
16:726:39422:22:21:68:543:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment spell can not be due to a response to the the outside option throughout the
16:727:39510:21:21:68:543:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment spell. Instead, it must be due to a decline of the wage offer distribution over the
16:728:39606:21:21:68:543:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment spell. For this to be meaningful, individuals must value the outside option,
16:729:39696:21:22:68:543:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as implied by a change in hazard rates. The theory suggests a straightforward strategy for
16:730:39786:22:21:68:543:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the empirical work. Another key insight is that using weak additional assumptions implied by
16:731:39878:21:0:68:543:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the theory, one can estimate the effect of UI extensions on the path of reemployment wages
17:732:39970:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even if the distribution of characteristics throughout the nonemployment spell changes. We
17:733:40060:21:21:68:502:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will return to our empirical approach after briefly describing the institutional set up.
17:734:40148:21:22:85:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While we illustrated this insight in a model of wage posting, a symmetric intuition applies
17:735:40239:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in wage bargaining models, where wages should in principle also be affected by the outside
17:736:40329:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:option of the unemployed worker. If they are not, then changes in the value of the outside
17:737:40419:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:option throughout the unemployment spell should also not have an effect on reemployment
17:738:40506:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages and thus cannot explain the observed decline in reemployment wages. A similar intuition
17:739:40599:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would hold in a directed search model where workers choose to search for jobs in a segment of
17:740:40692:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the labor market. In such a model wages are affected by the choice of the labor market and
17:741:40782:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the reservation wage when searching in a market. If the wage conditional on unemployment
17:742:40870:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration does not respond to UI benefit changes, then the choice of which segment to search
17:743:40961:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in is not responding to changes in the outside option and the outside option cannot explain
17:744:41052:22:39:68:325:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the decline in wages over the unemployment spell.

17:747:41173:29:21:68:543:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:After working for at least 12 months in the previous three years, workers losing a job through
17:748:41267:21:22:68:543:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no fault of their own in Germany are eligible for UI benefits that provide a fixed replacement
17:749:41361:22:21:68:543:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of 63 percent for an individual without children.16This paper focuses on the time period
17:750:41454:21:21:68:543:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between 1987 and 1999, which is the longest period for which the UI system was stable, and
17:751:41544:21:22:68:543:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during which the maximum duration of benefits was tied to the exact age of the start of benefit
17:752:41639:22:21:68:543:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:receipt and to prior labor force history. Between July 1987 and March 1999, the maximum
17:753:41726:21:21:68:543:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential UI duration for workers who were younger than 42 years old was 12 months.17For
17:754:41814:21:21:68:543:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers age 42 to 43 maximum potential UI duration increased to 18 months and for workers
17:755:41903:21:22:68:543:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age 44 to 48, the maximum duration further rose to 22 months. Workers with lower prior
17:756:41989:22:21:68:543:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor force attachment also experienced increases in potential UI durations at the 42 and
17:757:42078:21:18:68:543:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:44 age cutoffs, albeit smaller.  Our main identification strategy is to use the variation in
17:758:42170:18:16:77:543:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:16For individuals with children the replacement rate is 68 percent. There is a cap on earnings insured, but
17:759:42277:16:11:68:543:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:it affects only a small number of recipients. Since they are derived based on net earnings, in Germany UI
17:760:42382:11:9:68:482:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:benefits are not taxed themselves, but can push total income into a higher income tax bracket.

18:766:42740:29:21:68:543:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For this paper we have obtained access to the universe of social security records in Germany
18:767:42832:21:22:68:543:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from 1975 to 2008. The data covers day-to-day information on every instance of employment
18:768:42921:22:21:68:543:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covered by social security and every receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, as well as cor-
18:769:43017:21:21:68:543:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responding wages and benefit levels. We observe several demographic characteristics, namely
18:770:43108:21:22:68:543:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gender, education, birth date, nationality, place of residence and work, as well as detailed job
18:771:43204:22:21:68:543:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics, such as average daily wage, occupation, industry, and characteristics of the
18:772:43297:21:21:68:125:495:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:employer.19
18:773:43308:21:22:85:544:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For our analysis sample, we extracted all unemployment insurance spells where the claimant
18:774:43398:22:21:68:543:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was between age 40 and age 46 on the claim date. We consider unemployment spells starting
18:775:43487:21:21:68:543:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:any time between July 1987 and April 1999. For each UI spell we created variables about
18:776:43574:21:21:68:543:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the previous work history (such as job tenure, labor market experience, wage, industry and
18:777:43664:21:22:68:543:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:occupation at the previous job), the duration of UI benefit receipt in days, the UI benefit
18:778:43755:22:21:68:425:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level, and information about the next job held after non-employment.
18:779:43823:21:21:85:543:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Since we do not directly observe whether individuals are unemployed we follow the previous
18:780:43913:21:22:68:543:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature and, in addition to duration of UI benefit receipt, we use length of non-employment
18:781:44007:22:21:68:543:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as a measure for unemployment durations (e.g., Card, Chetty, and Weber 2007b). The du-
18:782:44093:21:21:68:543:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ration of non-employment is measured as the time between the start of receiving UI benefits
18:783:44184:21:22:68:543:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the date of the next registered period of employment. Our analysis period assures that
18:784:44274:22:21:68:452:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we can follow individuals for at least 9 years after the start of the UI spell.
18:785:44353:21:21:85:543:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We calculate each individual’s potential UI duration at the beginning of the UI spell,
18:786:44439:21:18:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using information about the law together with information on exact birth dates and work
18:787:44526:18:15:77:543:179:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:18In Germany individuals who exhaust regular UI benefits are eligible for means tested unemployment
18:788:44625:15:12:68:543:164:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:assistance benefits (UA), which do not have a limited duration. The nominal replacement rate is 53%, but
18:789:44729:12:12:68:543:152:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:UA payments are reduced substantially by spousal earnings and other sources of income, which may explain
18:790:44833:12:12:68:543:140:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:why only about 50% of UI exhaustees take up UA benefits. In Schmieder, von Wachter and Bender (2012a)
18:791:44934:12:9:68:299:128:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:we provide an in-depth assessment of the role of UA.
18:792:44986:9:15:77:543:119:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:19Individual workers can be followed using a unique person identifier. Since about 80 percent of all jobs are
18:793:45095:15:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:within the social security system (the main exceptions are self-employed, students, and government employees)
18:794:45204:12:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:this situation results in nearly complete work histories for most individuals. Each employment record also
18:795:45310:12:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:has a unique establishment identifier that can be used to merge establishment characteristics to individual
18:796:45417:12:0:68:124:68:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:observations.
19:797:45432:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:histories. This method yields exact measures for workers who have been employed for a long
19:798:45522:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuous time and hence are eligible for the maximum potential benefit durations for their
19:799:45614:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age groups. However, the calculation is not as clear cut for workers with intermittent periods
19:800:45708:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of unemployment because of complex carry-forward provisions in the law.  We thus define
19:801:45795:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our core analysis sample to be all unemployment spells of workers who have been employed
19:802:45883:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for at least 36 months (44 months at the age 44 cutoff) of the last seven years and who did
19:803:45974:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not receive unemployment insurance benefits during that time period.20In Schmieder et.
19:804:46060:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:al. (2012a), we show that the characteristics of this sample are comparable with those of UI
19:805:46152:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recipients of similar age in the United States. In addition, in our sensitivity analysis we also
19:806:46248:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consider results when we use all workers affected by the two age cutoffs, irrespective of prior
19:807:46343:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor force history. While for these we cannot obtain the marginal effect of an additional
19:808:46433:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:month of UI extension, we show that we can obtain consistent IV estimates of the effect of
19:809:46523:22:38:68:455:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment duration under the same conditions as in our main sample.

19:811:46609:29:21:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The institutional structure and data allow us to estimate the causal effect of UI durations on
19:812:46703:21:21:68:543:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages. In addition, it allows us to verify the conditions on the path of reemployment wages

19:820:47366:21:21:68:543:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common practice and first show smoothed figures to visually examine discontinuities at the

19:822:47548:22:18:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects, we follow standard regression discontinuity methodology and estimate variants of the

19:824:47745:15:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:individuals who lost their job involuntarily and minimize selection concerns due to quitting we restrict our

20:833:48274:17:21:85:543:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For our main estimates, we focus on the period from July 1987 - March 1999, and we use
20:834:48360:21:22:68:543:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sharp threshold at age 42. We estimate equation (8) locally around the two cutoffs and

20:836:48543:21:21:68:543:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We use a relatively small bandwidth of two years on each side of the cutoff, and summarize

20:838:48728:22:21:68:543:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pooled regression model, where we take the estimation samples for the age 42 and the age 44

20:848:49582:21:21:68:543:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goal of the paper is to estimate the causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages. As
20:849:49672:21:21:68:543:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:derived in Section 2, the first step in obtaining such an estimate is to assess whether the path
20:850:49768:21:22:68:543:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of reemployment wages and the reemployment hazard shift in response to the UI extensions.
20:851:49857:22:17:68:543:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While estimating the shift is in principle straightforward, a key issue is the potential presence
20:852:49954:17:15:77:543:131:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:21We also estimated all results at the age 44 cutoff separately. The point estimates are very similar but lack
20:853:50064:15:9:68:109:116:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:precision.
20:854:50074:9:15:77:543:107:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:22Optimal bandwidth computations (as in Imbens and Kalyanaraman, 2012, and Calonico et al., forth-
20:855:50172:15:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:coming) are computationally quite demanding due to the large number of observations, especially when we
20:856:50275:12:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:calculate dynamic effects. We therefore keep the bandwidth at 2 years, but report optimal bandwidth estimates
20:857:50384:12:0:68:265:68:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:for the main results in our robustness checks.
21:858:50432:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of dynamic selection. For example, low skilled workers may be more credit constrained, and
21:859:50522:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence respond more strongly to UI extensions. Even absent changes in UI benefits, it is likely
21:860:50616:21:22:68:414:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that less productive workers have longer nonemployment durations.
21:861:50681:22:21:85:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the absence of selection, we could directly estimate the average shift in the reemployment

21:878:51396:21:22:68:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ever, under the standard assumption thatcov(t,-)≤0,we show in the Web Appendix that

21:882:51753:21:22:68:413:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less able individuals tend to have longer nonemployment durations.
21:883:51819:22:21:85:543:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This is sufficient for our purposes, because from the theory we know that the reservation

21:891:52181:17:21:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we find that the estimatedˆδis close to zero, given thatˆδis an upper bound of the trueδ, we
21:892:52273:21:22:68:543:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can conclude that the entire reemployment wage path and hence reservation wages have not
21:893:52361:22:21:68:543:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shifted. Below, we will also use the confidence interval for the estimateˆδto derive bounds for

21:895:52515:21:22:85:543:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We will also graphically examine the reemployment wage path, as well as a rich set of

21:898:52781:21:0:68:543:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unaffected by UI extensions, then this provides further direct evidence for the absence of a
22:899:52875:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strong role of selection. Similar arguments based on observables can be made as for estimates

22:910:53347:21:22:68:543:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to directly estimate the causal effect of nonemployment duration on wage offers using poten-

22:912:53529:21:21:68:543:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Section 2.3, the resulting IV estimator obtains the average effect of nonemployment duration
22:913:53621:21:22:68:543:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on wages for all individuals responding to the UI extension, irrespective of elapsed nonem-
22:914:53712:22:21:68:543:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment duration. Below, we will calculate the weighting function of the IV estimator over
22:915:53803:21:21:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the nonemployment spell. As explained in Section 3.2, we also extend our IV strategy and

22:920:54160:21:21:68:543:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The regression discontinuity method only yields consistent results if factors apart from the

22:926:54710:22:21:68:543:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:precursor paper for a more detailed discussion of manipulation, including potential reasons
22:927:54801:21:21:68:145:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for its absence.
22:928:54817:21:22:85:543:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A standard test for sorting around the threshold is to investigate whether the density of
22:929:54906:22:21:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observations shifts or spikes near the threshold (McCrary 2008). Figure 1 (a) shows the number
22:930:55000:21:18:68:543:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of unemployment spells in two-week age intervals around the cutoff. There is a small shift in
22:931:55093:18:15:77:543:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:23Most of the literature presents estimates of the effect of UI durations on reemployment hazards without
22:932:55198:15:0:68:250:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:specifically addressing this selection issue.
23:933:55245:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observations from two weeks before to two weeks after the age cutoffs, that affects only about
23:934:55339:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:200 individuals relative to about 500,000 observations in the sample close to the age cutoff.
23:935:55432:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Further investigation showed that this increase is not driven by individuals who postpone their
23:936:55527:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:claim, but that, if at all, the incidence of separations rises slightly at the eligibility age. To
23:937:55625:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investigate the nature of sorting further we investigated whether predetermined characteristics
23:938:55720:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vary discontinuously at the threshold. Figure 1 (b) shows the pre-unemployment log wage in
23:939:55810:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2 month bins around the thresholds and shows no discernible discontinuity. We investigated
23:940:55900:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many other baseline characteristics and found that only the fraction of UI recipients who
23:941:55989:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are female is estimated to increase statistically significantly by about 0.8 percentage points.
23:942:56084:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:All other variables show essentially no (economically or statistically) meaningful difference
23:943:56177:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the threshold.24In smaller datasets, such minor discontinuities and density shifts would
23:944:56268:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:almost certainly not be detectable. While these findings point to a small violation of the RD
23:945:56361:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identification assumptions, these should have a relatively small impact on the overall results.
23:946:56456:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In fact, neither trimming observations close to the eligibility thresholds nor directly controlling
23:947:56555:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for observable characteristics affects our results. To ensure that our results are not affected by
23:948:56653:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sorting around the threshold and by particular implementation choices of the RD estimator,
23:949:56743:22:39:68:533:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we performed multiple robustness checks summarized in the sensitivity section (Section 6).

23:952:56946:29:22:68:543:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We begin by replicating our findings on the effect of UI extensions on UI duration and nonem-
23:953:57039:22:21:68:543:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment duration from our previous paper (Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender 2012a),
23:954:57124:21:21:68:543:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which we will later use to calculate IV estimates of the effect of nonemployment duration on
23:955:57216:21:21:68:543:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages. Increases in potential UI durations have a very clear effect on nonemployment dura-
23:956:57306:21:22:68:543:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions and hence substantially change behavior of unemployed individuals. Showing averages
23:957:57395:22:21:68:543:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by two-months age windows, Figure 2 (a) shows that increasing potential UI durations at
23:958:57482:21:21:68:543:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the two age thresholds leads to substantial increases in UI durations. This effect is partly
23:959:57574:21:18:68:543:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mechanical, since individuals who would have exhausted their benefits at 12 months or 18
23:960:57662:18:16:77:543:102:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:24There is a tiny difference in the years of education variable at the first threshold of about 0.03 years (or
23:961:57772:16:0:68:164:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:10 days) of education.
24:962:57796:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:months are now covered for up to 6 more months, and partly behavioral, since individuals
24:963:57884:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may reduce their search effort and thus stay unemployed longer. The purely behavioral effect
24:964:57976:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of an increase in potential UI durations is demonstrated in Figure 2 (b), which shows the
24:965:58065:22:21:68:251:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect on nonemployment durations.
24:966:58099:21:21:85:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Table 1, columns (1) and (2) confirm the visual impression. The effects on actual UI
24:967:58186:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration and nonemployment duration are very precisely estimated. The table also shows the
24:968:58276:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal effect of an increase in potential UI durations by 1 month, i.e. the estimated RD
24:969:58366:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient rescaled by the increase in potential UI durations. For one additional month of
24:970:58457:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential UI benefits unemployed individuals receive about 0.3 months of additional benefits
24:971:58549:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and remain unemployed for about 0.15 months longer.  These marginal effects are similar
24:972:58636:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to findings from previous research including Moffitt (1985), Katz and Meyer (1990), Meyer
24:973:58725:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1990) Card, Chetty, and Weber. (2007a), or Lalive (2007), although much more precisely
24:974:58812:22:21:68:121:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated.
24:975:58822:21:21:85:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, as further discussed in von Wachter, Bender, and Schmieder (2012b), column (3)
24:976:58909:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 1 shows that the probability of ever again working in a social security liable job decreases
24:977:59004:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by about 0.5 (0.1) percentage points per additional month of potential UI benefits at the age
24:978:59097:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:42 threshold (pooled). In the sensitivity section, we will assess whether this small effect could
24:979:59194:21:38:68:442:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imply a potential bias from sample selection in our main wage estimates.
24:980:59266:38:29:68:416:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.2  The Effect of UI Extensions on Reemployment Wages
24:981:59320:29:21:68:543:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As discussed in the theory section, longer nonemployment durations in response to higher po-
24:982:59412:21:22:68:543:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tential UI durations could either raise wages as individuals have more time to search for a bet-
24:983:59508:22:21:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ter job, or lower wages if the negative effect from longer nonemployment durations dominates.
24:984:59601:21:21:68:543:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 3 (a) shows the effect on the log wage at the first job after the period of unemployment.
24:985:59697:21:22:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There appears to be a small decline by about 0.01 log points in the post-unemployment wage
24:986:59787:22:21:68:543:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the age 42 threshold.  At the age 44 threshold, the lines (fitted quadratic polynomials)
24:987:59878:21:21:68:543:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also seem to indicate a small drop in the post-unemployment wage. Figure 3 (b) shows the
24:988:59966:21:22:68:543:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference in the pre-unemployment log wage and the post-unemployment log wage.  This
24:989:60051:22:21:68:543:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference is a way to remove an individual fixed effect and hence can be viewed as a way to
24:990:60143:21:21:68:543:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both control for possible selection into employment and to obtain more precise estimates by
24:991:60234:21:0:68:543:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controlling for predetermined characteristics. The figure shows that the average wage loss for
25:992:60330:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the unemployed in our sample is substantial, ranging from 13% to 16%. While the gain in
25:993:60417:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:precision is modest, Figure 3 (b) indicates that selection along the previous wage has little
25:994:60510:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact on the results, and again clearly points to a negative effect of a rise in potential UI
25:995:60604:22:21:68:274:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations on post-unemployment wages.
25:996:60641:21:21:85:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The corresponding regression estimates in Table 1 columns (4) and (5) show that increases
25:997:60730:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in potential UI durations lead to precisely estimated negative effects on post-unemployment
25:998:60821:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages. Panel A shows that the post-unemployment wage is about 0.8 percent lower in both
25:999:60908:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:levels and first differences when potential UI durations increase by six months.  Panel B
25:1000:60997:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows the results from pooling both cutoffs and reveals similar estimates with a small gain in
25:1001:61091:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistical precision. The estimate from the pooled model implies that an increase in potential
25:1002:61186:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UI durations by one month decreases post-unemployment wages by about 0.1 percent. Below
25:1003:61273:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we show that these small effects of UI extensions on wages can imply substantial negative
25:1004:61362:22:21:68:303:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects of nonemployment durations on wages.
25:1005:61406:21:21:85:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although the effect on the initial wage obtained after reemployment shown in Table 1 is
25:1006:61493:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small, the losses can add up to more substantial effects if individuals remain in lower paying
25:1007:61587:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jobs for a long period of time. Table 2 shows the effect on the log wage one, three, and five
25:1008:61680:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years after the start of the new employment spell. The estimates decline from one to five
25:1009:61769:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years start of employment, consistent with the result in Table 2 that there is a small positive
25:1010:61864:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(yet insignificant) effect of potential UI durations on wage growth. Yet, although the longer-
25:1011:61958:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:term effects are not estimated precisely, the point estimates after 5 years are suggestive of
25:1012:62051:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potentially substantial cumulated wage losses. We will return to the implications for the total
25:1013:62146:21:22:68:334:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage loss and individual behavior in the conclusion.
25:1014:62198:22:21:85:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Other papers that have estimated the wage effect of increases in potential UI durations
25:1015:62285:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have found similar point estimates, although generally with less precision than we do. For
25:1016:62375:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example Card, Chetty and Weber (2007a) found a negative point estimate of UI durations
25:1017:62461:22:21:68:543:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on wages, quite comparable when rescaled to a marginal effect.  Similarly, van Ours and
25:1018:62548:21:21:68:543:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Vodopivec (2008) and Centeno and Novo (2009) find negative effects of similar magnitude of
25:1019:62638:21:21:68:543:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UI extensions. As further discussed in Section 5, an additional value added with respect to
25:1020:62729:21:22:68:543:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these papers is that we provide a framework and dynamic results that allow us to separate
25:1021:62818:22:0:68:305:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the wage offer and the reservation wage effect.
26:1022:62867:0:29:68:409:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.3  The Effect of UI Extensions on Other Job Outcomes
26:1023:62921:29:21:68:543:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we show that individuals do not simply accept lower wages in return for other
26:1024:63014:21:21:68:543:658:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:desirable job characteristics – i.e., jobs tend to be worse among all the dimensions we can
26:1025:63105:21:22:68:543:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measure here.  Columns (1) to (4) of Panel B of Table 2 show the effect of increases in
26:1026:63192:22:21:68:543:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential UI durations on a number of job-related outcome variables. The first outcome is the
26:1027:63285:21:21:68:543:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:completed job tenure at the post-unemployment job, which is often used as an indicator of the
26:1028:63378:21:22:68:543:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality of the job match. Column (1) of Panel B shows that there is a small decrease in the
26:1029:63469:22:21:68:543:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration of the post-unemployment job of about 0.0081 years in Panel A, which is a decline
26:1030:63559:21:21:68:543:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of about 1% relative to mean post-unemployment job tenure (it is statistically significant at

26:1032:63741:22:21:68:543:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that higher potential UI durations reduce job stability even beyond the initial spell. Hence, it
26:1033:63837:21:21:68:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not appear individuals with longer UI durations trade lower wages for more stable jobs
26:1034:63928:21:22:68:315:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or jobs that appear to represent better matches.
26:1035:63976:22:21:85:543:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We analyzed several additional indicators of job quality. Longer potential UI durations
26:1036:64063:21:21:68:543:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decrease the probability of finding a full time job, but although precisely estimated the effect
26:1037:64159:21:21:68:543:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is less than 1% relative to the mean of 89% (column (2) of Panel B).25An important finding of
26:1038:64252:21:22:68:543:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the literature on displaced workers is that those switching to another industry or occupation
26:1039:64345:22:21:68:543:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experience much larger declines in earnings (e.g., Neal 1995, Addison and Portugal 1989).
26:1040:64434:21:21:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence, one would expect that longer UI durations may help individuals to find jobs in their
26:1041:64525:21:22:68:543:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous line of work. Columns (3) and (4) of Panel B of Table 2 show that this is not the case.
26:1042:64621:22:21:68:543:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Longer potential UI durations increase the probability of switching to a different industry and
26:1043:64716:21:21:68:456:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a different occupation by about 0.12 to 0.18 percentage points, respectively.
26:1044:64793:21:22:85:543:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, all measures of job quality available in our data either point to negative effects
26:1045:64884:22:21:68:543:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of longer potential UI durations or no effect. Hence, at least based on this limited set of job
26:1046:64979:21:21:68:543:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics, it does not appear that workers with longer UI durations accept lower wages
26:1047:65071:21:22:68:543:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in return to better job outcomes along other dimensions. The analysis of other job outcomes
26:1048:65162:22:21:68:543:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also provides insights into the potential channels underlying the reduction in wages and the
26:1049:65254:21:18:68:406:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:role of nonemployment durations, which we further discuss below.
26:1050:65318:18:15:77:543:107:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:25We also analyzed changes in firm size as proxy for employer quality, as well as the probability of a rise in
26:1051:65428:15:0:68:263:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:commuting, and found no significant change.

27:1054:65591:29:21:68:543:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A key step in estimating the causal effect of nonemployment duration on wages is to assess
27:1055:65681:21:22:68:543:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the response in hazard rates and reemployment wages throughout the nonemployment spell.
27:1056:65768:22:21:68:543:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Although we will directly control for selection below, to assess the potential for dynamic
27:1057:65858:21:21:68:543:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selection we begin with a descriptive analysis of the evolution of observable characteristics
27:1058:65951:21:22:68:543:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:throughout the nonemployment spell.  As summary measures Figure 4 shows the mean of
27:1059:66034:22:21:68:543:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pre-unemployment wages (a) and the mean of predicted reemployment wages (b) (based on a
27:1060:66121:21:21:68:543:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:broad range of pre-determined characteristics) by month of nonemployment duration. Vertical
27:1061:66212:21:21:68:544:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bars indicate that the point estimates at timetare statistically significant at the 5 percent
27:1062:66305:21:22:68:543:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level.  As expected, there is some correlation between pre-determined characteristics and
27:1063:66394:22:21:68:543:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment duration, though the gradient is not very strong. For example, mean pre-
27:1064:66480:21:21:68:543:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment wages fall by about 5% and mean predicted wages fall by about 7% in the
27:1065:66564:21:22:68:543:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first year of nonemployment duration. In separate analysis, we found that years of schooling
27:1066:66656:22:21:68:543:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or fraction female is positively correlated with nonemployment duration. More importantly
27:1067:66745:21:21:68:543:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for our analysis, in both of these figures the pre-unemployment wage paths and the predicted
27:1068:66837:21:22:68:543:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reemployment wage path are essentially unaffected by changes in potential UI durations.
27:1069:66924:22:21:68:543:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While there are a few statistically significant point estimates in each figure (and in the figures
27:1070:67022:21:21:68:543:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of single characteristics not shown here), given that each figure is created from 24 separate
27:1071:67115:21:22:68:543:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:point estimates, it is expected that about one to two of the estimates are statistically significant
27:1072:67215:22:21:68:543:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the 5 percent level purely because of sampling variation.26Overall, these figures therefore
27:1073:67309:21:21:68:543:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:support the notion that the distribution of observable characteristics over the nonemployment
27:1074:67402:21:21:68:543:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spell is essentially uncorrelated with potential UI durations, suggesting that it is unlikely that
27:1075:67500:21:18:68:543:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential UI durations exert a strong effect on the distribution of unobservable characteristics.
27:1076:67597:18:16:77:543:181:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:26The one exception appears to be the spikes at the exhaustion point for fraction female. Individuals who
27:1077:67702:16:12:68:543:165:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are exiting from unemployment at the exhaustion points are significantly more likely to be female. This is
27:1078:67808:12:12:68:543:153:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:consistent with larger labor supply effects of UI benefits for women. The fact that the spikes in fraction women
27:1079:67920:12:12:68:543:141:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:cancel each other out, seems to indicate that some women are simply waiting until their benefits expire before
27:1080:68030:12:12:68:543:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:going back to work. To address this aspect, we show in the sensitivity section that our results hold within
27:1081:68137:12:0:68:132:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:gender groups.

28:1084:68310:21:21:68:543:658:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:see that the hazard rate shifts downward in response to increasingPfor all nonemployment

28:1086:68490:22:21:68:543:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for nearly all point estimates, even in the first period (t= 0), so individuals are clearly forward

28:1088:68683:21:22:68:543:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A similar pattern has been observed in many other studies of the effect of UI extensions on

28:1097:69272:22:21:68:543:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pattern when we control for individual heterogeneity by plotting the difference in post and

28:1102:69644:21:21:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:noteworthy that the two downward spikes are of very similar magnitude and essentially cancel

28:1104:69823:22:21:68:543:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicating that the negative wage spikes are partly driven by more women exhausting UI

28:1109:70191:21:22:68:543:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions, we can obtain direct estimates of the mean shift in the reemployment wage

29:1128:71099:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the potential UI duration, does not affect reservation wages and therefore that the effect of
29:1129:71192:22:21:68:534:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UI durations on wages found in Section 4 arises due to a rise in nonemployment durations.
29:1130:71281:21:21:85:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These results imply that reservation wages do not appear to bind in our sample. This
29:1131:71365:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is consistent with related findings in the literature. For example, DellaVigna and Paserman
29:1132:71456:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2005) calibrate a model similar to ours and find that very few wage offers fall below the
29:1133:71546:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wage. Our results are also consistent with structural estimates in van den Berg
29:1134:71637:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1990) who found that most job offers are indeed accepted and that unemployed workers do
29:1135:71725:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not seem to reject many jobs based on wages. Similarly, Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante
29:1136:71813:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2011) show that in broad classes of search models, the value of non market time – and hence
29:1137:71905:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the reservation wage – has to be low to be able to reconcile why despite high wage dispersion,
29:1138:71999:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and hence a high option value of searching, workers in practice accept jobs quickly. Following
29:1139:72093:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our approach, Lalive, Landais, and Zweimueller (2013) also find that the path of reemployment
29:1140:72186:21:21:68:394:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages does not respond to increases in UI durations in Austria.
29:1141:72249:21:22:85:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast, Krueger and Mueller (2014) find that jobs with wages above the self-reported
29:1142:72338:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wage are more likely to be accepted, although a substantial fraction of jobs paying
29:1143:72433:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below the reservation wage are accepted as well.  However, they also find that reservation
29:1144:72523:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages do not change significantly throughout the nonemployment spell within individuals,
29:1145:72611:22:0:68:482:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nor do they respond to UI exhaustion. Hence, in our notation these results imply

29:1149:72799:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the IV estimator discussed next recovers the causal effect of unemployment duration on
29:1150:72889:22:38:68:101:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages.
29:1151:72895:38:29:68:517:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.3  Estimates of the Causal Effect of Nonemployment Durations on Wages
29:1152:72966:29:21:68:543:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The results on the hazard and reemployment wage path imply that reservation wages do not
29:1153:73054:21:21:68:543:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bind. As a result, the observed decline in reemployment wages is entirely due to the decline
29:1154:73146:21:0:68:543:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the wage offer distribution (equation 1), and the effect of UI durations on wages is only due
30:1155:73244:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a rise in nonemployment durations (equation 5). Proposition 1 then allows us to obtain
30:1156:73333:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a valid estimate of the average decline in the reemployment wage path. In the final step of
30:1157:73424:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our empirical analysis, we thus estimate the slope of the reemployment wage path using UI
30:1158:73513:22:0:68:430:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:durations as instrumental variables for nonemployment durations:π=

30:1164:73675:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages using extensions in potential UI durations as an instrument. The table first shows the
30:1165:73767:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first stage regression (i.e., the effect of UI extension on nonemployment durations), which
30:1166:73858:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:easily passes weak instrument concerns. The second column shows the ’reduced form’ of the
30:1167:73947:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IV estimator, which correspond to the baseline estimates of the effect of potential UI durations
30:1168:74043:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on wages of Section 4.2. Column (3) reports the resulting 2SLS estimate of nonemployment
30:1169:74131:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:durations on wages. We find thatπ=−0.78%, which is precisely estimated. Thus, our main
30:1170:74217:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finding is that an additional month of nonemployment lowers average wage offers of middle
30:1171:74306:22:21:68:248:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aged workers by about 0.8 percent.
30:1172:74340:21:21:85:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To better understand the nature of our IV estimator, recall that Proposition 1 states that in
30:1173:74433:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the presence of heterogeneity and nonlinearity in the slope of the reemployment wage function,
30:1174:74527:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the IV estimator obtains the local average treatment effect of wage declines for individuals
30:1175:74619:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whose nonemployment durations are most affected by the instrument. As such, it is weighted
30:1176:74709:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:towards the treatment effects of compliers to the UI extensions that underlie our regression
30:1177:74801:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discontinuity (RD) estimates.  As seen from the survival functions in Panel (b) of Figure
30:1178:74890:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:5 the compliers come from the entire range of nonemployment durations, with the largest
30:1179:74977:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weight being between 12 and 18 months. Hence, the IV estimator estimates an average of the
30:1180:75067:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of nonemployment duration on wages over a broad spell of nonemployment durations.
30:1181:75155:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast to the IV estimator, the implicit weighting function of the OLS estimator puts
30:1182:75245:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more weight on long durations where there are fewer individuals but for whom the gradient is
30:1183:75337:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flatter. As a result the, OLS estimator for the full sample (column 3 of Table 4) is similar to
30:1184:75432:22:21:68:543:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the IV estimate. To obtain a better comparison, we reestimated the OLS estimator excluding
30:1185:75522:21:21:68:543:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals with spells longer than 18 months that would typically receive little weight in
30:1186:75613:21:21:68:543:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:surveys with much smaller sample sizes. The resulting estimate corresponds more closely to
30:1187:75703:21:22:68:441:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what is shown in Figure 6, and is approximately double the IV estimate.
30:1188:75774:22:21:85:543:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To gauge the magnitude of our estimates, our point estimates imply a loss in daily wages
30:1189:75862:21:0:68:543:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 4.8% (9.6%) for 6 (12) additional months of nonemployment duration. Based on Figure 6,
31:1190:75953:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this represents about 40% of the average wage loss at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Thus,
31:1191:76043:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the causal effect of nonemployment spells explain a substantial fraction of the average wage
31:1192:76135:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:loss at job loss. Since the causal effect we estimate here is likely due to multiple channels
31:1193:76228:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:– including skill depreciation, discouragement, or stigma – it is not clear what magnitude
31:1194:76318:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to expect. While it is hard to compare our estimate with previous findings based on non-
31:1195:76406:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experimental estimates, the findings fall in the same broad range. Estimates based on the
31:1196:76495:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlation of nonemployment duration of displaced workers with reemployment wages suggest
31:1197:76585:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects bigger than our IV estimate, and similar to our censored OLS estimate (e.g., Addison
31:1198:76677:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Portugal 1989), but as explained above may be affected by selection.27Estimates of the
31:1199:76767:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of depreciation of human capital during unemployment based on structural models show
31:1200:76856:21:38:68:497:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results of similar order of magnitude as our findings (e.g., Keane and Wolpin 1997).

31:1202:76987:29:21:68:543:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The finding in Table 3 and Figure 6 (a) provide strong evidence that UI extensions do not affect
31:1203:77083:21:22:68:543:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reemployment wages through changes in reservation wages. Even with large extensions that
31:1204:77171:22:21:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:clearly affect the hazard rate and a large administrative dataset the implied effect of changes
31:1205:77266:21:21:68:543:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the reservation wage on the mean reemployment wage is a precisely estimated zero. To
31:1206:77353:21:22:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investigate whether our focus on the mean (even though this is the correct measure in our
31:1207:77442:22:21:68:543:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model) masks small effects of the reservation wage at the bottom of the wage distribution
31:1208:77531:21:21:68:543:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(where one might expect the largest effect), we used our large sample sizes to analyze the full
31:1209:77626:21:21:68:543:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of wages. The percentiles of the wage distribution by nonemployment duration
31:1210:77715:21:22:68:543:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for those above and below the 12 month cut off point are shown in Figure 6 (b) (as before
31:1211:77804:22:21:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those RD estimates that are significant are shown with vertical bars). The figure clearly shows
31:1212:77899:21:21:68:543:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the evolution of the wage distribution with nonemployment duration as it shifts downwards
31:1213:77988:21:22:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and fans out. If a response in reservation wages to UI extensions mattered, one should see the
31:1214:78082:22:21:68:543:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect mostly at the bottom of the wage distribution. Figure 6 (b) indeed shows that there
31:1215:78172:21:21:68:543:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be a significant rise in the lower quantiles of the wage distribution in response to
31:1216:78267:21:22:68:543:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UI extensions. However, the rise at the first cutoff and appears to be offset by a decline at the
31:1217:78364:22:18:68:543:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second cutoff. As in case of mean wages in Figure 6 (a), this crossing of the reemployment
31:1218:78454:18:16:77:543:93:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:27Absent quasi-experimental evidence or detailed worker characteristics, Addison and Portugal (1989) ad-
31:1219:78558:16:0:68:281:77:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:dress selection using a Heckman correction term.
32:1220:78608:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage path can only be explained by dynamic selection and suggests the pattern may be due to
32:1221:78699:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a selective shifting from one exhaustion point to the next. To directly assess this possibility,
32:1222:78795:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we applied the same procedure as with the mean in Section 5.2 to the cumulative density
32:1223:78882:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function (CDF) of reemployment wages for the entire sample. Columns 3 to 5 of Table 3
32:1224:78967:21:21:68:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:show estimates of the mean shift of selected points of the CDF in response to UI extensions.28
32:1225:79061:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These estimates suggests that the effect of UI extensions on the CDF of wages for the entire
32:1226:79153:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample is very close to zero. Recall that the effect on the entire CDF is a weighted average of
32:1227:79248:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of the CDF at each nonemployment duration. Hence, since the theory suggests that
32:1228:79339:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages (and hence the CDF) should rise, the finding of a zero response implies that
32:1229:79433:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of UI extensions on the CDF at each nonemployment duration must be zero. This
32:1230:79521:21:21:68:533:498:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:provides direct evidence that the pattern in Figure 6 (b) are likely to be due to selection.29
32:1231:79615:21:22:85:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The interpretation of our IV estimates as causal effect of nonemployment duration on

32:1235:79795:17:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:establish empirically with certainty. It is however straightforward to derive bounds for the

33:1336:83637:29:22:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As discussed in the theory section, the interpretation of our estimate as the causal effect of
33:1337:83731:22:21:68:543:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment duration is independent of the particular economic model of job search we

33:1339:83855:9:7:77:375:145:7:g_d0_f5:5:g_d0_f23:F:31Another source of potential bias in the IV estimator arises ifdht

33:1341:83959:9:13:68:543:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:nonemployment durations greater than two years, when benefit durations are exhausted on both sides of the
33:1342:84064:13:0:68:267:116:10:g_d0_f6:7:g_d0_f20:F:age threshold. In that case, even though∂w

34:1349:84584:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independently of the particular underlying model or source of the effect, the parameter can
34:1350:84675:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be used to gauge the costs of uneployment duration and for assessing the optimal policy mix
34:1351:84766:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in response to nonemployment. However, for some applications it would be helpful to know
34:1352:84854:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more about the channels underlying the effect we find. Several channels have been suggested
34:1353:84945:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the literature.  Using longitudinal data on explicit skill measures from Sweden, Edison
34:1354:85035:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Gustavsson (2008) report that one year of unemployment duration reduces skills by an
34:1355:85123:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent of 0.7 years of schooling, pointing to the potential of skill decline. Kroft, Lange,
34:1356:85218:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Notowidigdo (forthcoming) find that employers discriminate against the long-term un-
34:1357:85306:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employed, even holding information on education and career progression constant. Similarly,
34:1358:85397:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is some evidence that the unemployed become increasingly unhappy throughout the
34:1359:85482:21:22:68:351:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment spell (e.g., Krueger and Mueller 2011).

34:1361:85624:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Nevertheless, our RD analysis reported in Section 4.3 provides some tentative findings about
34:1362:85716:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some potential channels.  To assess the potential impact of these effects on reemployment

34:1367:86167:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decline of 30-40%. Including proxies for employer quality made no difference. Overall, while
34:1368:86259:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such regressions have to be interpreted with caution, they imply some prima facie evidence of
34:1369:86352:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:role of industry and occupation changes, which have been associated with losses in (industry
34:1370:86444:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or occupation) specific skills in the literature. Similarly, the rise in part-time employment
34:1371:86537:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the reduction in completed job tenure could reflect a decline in job quality. Clearly, some
34:1372:86632:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of these outcomes could reflect several mechanisms, hence we do not stress any particular
34:1373:86721:22:21:68:167:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interpretation here.
34:1374:86741:21:21:85:543:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We have also analyzed differences in the effect of UI extensions on reemployment wages
34:1375:86827:21:21:68:543:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over the business cycle. On the one hand, if there is statistical discrimination and employ-
34:1376:86919:21:22:68:543:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ers correctly update their priors, the rise in expected mean quality of job applicants during
34:1377:87012:22:21:68:543:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recessions should lead to lower stigma of nonemployment duration. On the other hand, it is
34:1378:87102:21:0:68:543:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plausible that the effect of nonemployment duration on wage offers is stronger in recessions.
35:1379:87197:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For example, there is ample evidence of both a decline in job quality and of a reduction of
35:1380:87288:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages within jobs in recessions, which could hurt in particular workers with longer unemploy-
35:1381:87381:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment spells. When we compare our findings in periods with high and with low unemployment
35:1382:87469:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates, the results are very robust in recessions, but imprecise and ambiguous in expansions
35:1383:87560:21:21:68:495:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(not shown).32Hence, this does not point towards an explanation based on stigma.
35:1384:87640:21:22:85:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, we do not find prima facie evidence in favor of a stigma effect and find some
35:1385:87726:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggestive evidence for skill depreciation. However, our results would also be consistent with
35:1386:87820:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stigma, skill depreciation, and factors such as worker discouragement jointly determining the
35:1387:87913:21:40:68:333:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages.

35:1389:87996:33:29:68:393:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.1  Robustness of Regression Discontinuity Estimates
35:1390:88049:29:21:68:543:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our main results are all based on a two-year bandwidth around the age thresholds with linear
35:1391:88141:21:21:68:543:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age controls. Focusing on the model pooling both thresholds, Table 6 shows the sensitivity
35:1392:88231:21:22:68:543:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of our results when we allow for more flexibility in the estimation, focusing on five outcome
35:1393:88324:22:21:68:543:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables. Columns (2) and (3) show the estimated effects when the bandwidth is reduced
35:1394:88411:21:21:68:543:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 1 year and 0.5 years. While the sample size drops dramatically and the standard errors
35:1395:88500:21:22:68:543:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase correspondingly, the point estimates all become larger in absolute terms, pointing
35:1396:88591:22:21:68:543:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to worse match outcomes than in the baseline estimates. This pattern is very similar when
35:1397:88680:21:21:68:543:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we control for age with quadratic or cubic polynomials on both sides of the cutoff (columns
35:1398:88771:21:22:68:543:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3 and 4), where the point estimates are similar to the linear specification with 0.5 years of
35:1399:88864:22:21:68:543:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bandwidth. Using the Calonico et al. (forthcoming) optimal bandwidth algorithm - column
35:1400:88951:21:21:68:543:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(5) - we obtain optimal bandwidths between 0.6 to 0.7 and again slightly more negative wage
35:1401:89042:21:21:68:98:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effecs.
35:1402:89049:21:22:85:543:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In section 3, we reported that we found a slight increase in density just to right of the two
35:1403:89142:22:21:68:543:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age thresholds. Furthermore, we found a small increase in the fraction of female UI recipients
35:1404:89236:21:21:68:543:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the threshold. Here, we provide several methods to investigate whether this increase will
35:1405:89328:21:19:68:543:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affect our results. Column (6) of Table 6 shows the results from estimating the marginal effect
35:1406:89423:19:15:77:543:101:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:32The ideal test would hold the distribution of job types constant (comparable to what is done in audit
35:1407:89526:15:12:68:543:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:studies), but is not feasible in our quasi-experimental setting because of small sample sizes and endogeneity

36:1410:89732:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thresholds, when we exclude all observations within one month of the age threshold. Overall,
36:1411:89824:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while excluding the observations close to the cutoff reduces statistical power somewhat, it does
36:1412:89920:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not affect our overall conclusions. Column (7) of Table 6 shows how the estimates change when
36:1413:90013:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we control for a rich set of observables, including year, state, and industry fixed effects, as
36:1414:90108:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well as human capital and experience measures. The effects on nonemployment durations,
36:1415:90194:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the post-unemployment wage, and the duration of the post-unemployment job are slightly
36:1416:90280:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduced but still clearly imply negative match effects. Column (8) of Table 6 shows another
36:1417:90371:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:method robustness check to limit the effect of selective waiting before claiming UI, where we
36:1418:90464:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:limit the sample to individuals who claim UI within two weeks of losing their job.  These
36:1419:90553:21:38:68:307:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects are quite similar to our baseline results.
36:1420:90603:38:29:68:349:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.2  Robustness of Estimated Effects on Wages
36:1421:90648:29:21:68:543:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We implemented numerous robustness checks regarding our findings on wages as well. Here,
36:1422:90736:21:22:68:543:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we report results addressing the aspects of selective return to employment, differences in effects
36:1423:90834:22:21:68:524:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across groups, and changes in unemployment rates throughout the nonemployment spell.
36:1424:90918:21:21:85:543:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Section 4, we have shown that increases in UI extensions lead to precisely estimated
36:1425:91005:21:22:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:declines in the incidence of employment (Table 1). While these effects were very small relative
36:1426:91100:22:21:68:543:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the mean (less than 1%), we investigated the potential effect of such selection on our
36:1427:91189:21:21:68:543:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates of the effect of UI durations on wages by analyzing differences in the quantiles of
36:1428:91282:21:21:68:543:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the distribution of outcomes on the two sides of the age cutoffs (shown in the Web Appendix).
36:1429:91375:21:22:68:543:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This standard procedure yields consistent estimates if selection depends monotonously on a
36:1430:91465:22:21:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:single index of underlying characteristics.  The results suggest that the decline in median
36:1431:91556:21:21:68:543:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages is larger than the mean effect, suggesting that if at all our main findings underestimate
36:1432:91651:21:22:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of UI extensions on wages. Moreover, the lower percentiles of the wage distribution
36:1433:91745:22:21:68:543:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decline more strongly than the upper percentiles, , implying that the majority of wage declines
36:1434:91840:21:21:68:439:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in response to UI extensions occurr in the lower part of the distribution.
36:1435:91914:21:22:85:543:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The concern of selective participation also arises when studying reemployment wages at
36:1436:92000:22:21:68:543:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each point in the nonemployment spell.  As long as selection into employment for the full
36:1437:92089:21:21:68:543:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample is not an issue, our procedure for controlling for dynamic selection in Table 3 also
36:1438:92180:21:0:68:543:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controls for the effects of selective participation when estimating the effect of UI extensions
37:1439:92277:0:21:68:296:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the shift in the reemployment wage path.
37:1440:92320:21:21:85:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Section 5, we had said that part of the effect on reemployment wages at the exhaustion
37:1441:92409:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points month 12 and month 18 are likely to be due to a change in sample composition. In par-
37:1442:92501:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ticular, there is a rise in the fraction of women to the right of the RD cutoffs, and a rise in the
37:1443:92600:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of women exiting at the exhaustion points. To address this point, we have replicated
37:1444:92693:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our main RD analysis and our analysis of reemployment wages by gender. Women’s nonem-
37:1445:92778:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment durations clearly respond more strongly to UI extensions (Schmieder, von Wachter,
37:1446:92868:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Bender 2012a), there is no precisely estimated difference in the effect on reemployment
37:1447:92959:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages by gender. As a result, the implied IV estimate of the effect of nonemployment dura-
37:1448:93049:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions on wages is somewhat smaller for women, and approximately the same for men. Hence,
37:1449:93137:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our main findings are robust for the small degree of selection of women into nonemployment
37:1450:93227:21:22:68:207:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and UI exhaustion we find.
37:1451:93253:22:21:85:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Another potential concern is that our main analysis focuses on workers with comparatively
37:1452:93342:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high labor force attachment for whom nonemployment spells might be particularly costly. As
37:1453:93432:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed in Section 3, we can replicate our IV strategy for any worker eligible for UI. For this
37:1454:93529:21:22:68:544:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:broader sample, Table 4 shows we obtain a somewhat larger estimate of−1.2%for the age 42
37:1455:93617:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cutoff, and−1.5%when we pool both cutoffs, where only the latter is statistically significant
37:1456:93710:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from our main sample.33Thus, our findings are not driven by the particular sample we use,
37:1457:93799:21:22:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and hold for a broad sample of middle aged workers in Germany. We also considered the effect
37:1458:93891:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of UI durations and nonemployment durations on wages for other subgroups, but statistical
37:1459:93980:21:39:68:364:285:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:precision was low and hence did not pursue this further.34
37:1460:94038:39:33:68:152:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:7  Conclusion
37:1461:94051:33:22:68:543:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The effect of unemployment durations on job outcomes has important implications for policy
37:1462:94141:22:21:68:543:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the micro and macro level. Using an IV strategy based on quasi-experimental extensions
37:1463:94230:21:21:68:543:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in UI benefits we find that for middle aged workers each additional month of nonemployment
37:1464:94320:21:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration leads to a statistically significant and substantial reduction in wage offers of 0.8%. We
37:1465:94418:18:15:77:543:131:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:33The difference in the size of the IV estimate is mainly driven by a smaller effect of UI extensions on
37:1466:94522:15:12:68:543:116:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:nonemployment durations, which is to be expected since the average rise of potential UI durations is smaller
37:1467:94630:12:9:68:407:104:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:for this group. The corresponding estimates are shown in the Web Appendix.
37:1468:94704:9:15:77:543:95:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:34For example, while lower educated workers had substantially larger responses in employment duration,
37:1469:94806:15:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the effect of UI durations on wage changes appeared only slightly larger for the lower educated, implying a
37:1470:94913:12:0:68:458:68:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:smaller (but not precisely estimated) causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages.
38:1471:95003:0:21:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that this estimate identifies a weighted average of the slope of the wage offer distribution
38:1472:95100:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for individuals whose nonemployment durations are affected by the UI extensions. Given that
38:1473:95191:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UI durations lead to a decline in reemployment probabilities throughout the nonemployment
38:1474:95280:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spell, it is relevant for a broad group of unemployed workers. In our setting, over six to twelve
38:1475:95377:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:months this can explain about a third of wage losses from unemployment. These estimates
38:1476:95464:21:22:68:478:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are smaller than existing estimates with non-experimental controls for selection.
38:1477:95545:22:21:85:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our IV strategy is based on the key insight that the response of reemployment wages to UI
38:1478:95634:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extensions throughout the nonemployment spell is informative about the role of reservation
38:1479:95724:21:22:68:543:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages even if the degree of selection is arbitrarily affected by UI durations. Our finding that
38:1480:95819:22:21:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the path of reemployment wages over nonemployment duration does not shift in response to
38:1481:95907:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UI extensions implies that reservation wages do not bind. Hence, the UI extensions only affect
38:1482:96001:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages through a rise in unemployment durations and hence can be used as an instrument for
38:1483:96090:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-employment durations.  We also analyzed the response of different points in the wage
38:1484:96178:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution to UI extensions. While we do observe some small shifts in the lower quantiles
38:1485:96269:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates in response to UI extensions, these changes appear to be due to selection.  In a
38:1486:96359:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bounding exercise, we show that our main results are robust to small and realistic effects of
38:1487:96452:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages. The framework we develop here for the analysis of the causal effects of
38:1488:96542:21:21:68:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment durations on wages and other job outcomes will be useful for other studies
38:1489:96630:21:22:68:541:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that analyze the effects of exogenous changes in wokers outside options on worker outcomes.
38:1490:96721:22:21:85:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our findings can be used to help quantify the earnings losses from long unemployment spells
38:1491:96812:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for workers. They also affect the optimal policy mix in response to long-term unemployment
38:1492:96902:21:22:68:543:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and suggest that both at the micro- and macro-level policies should be front loaded to avoid
38:1493:96994:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the substatial cost associated with long-term unemployment. The results are also potentially
38:1494:97086:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:informative about the effects of prolonged nonemployment spells on the aggregate economy.
38:1495:97175:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our findings suggest that these can lead to persistent and substantial declines in wages that
38:1496:97268:22:21:68:543:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appear to be larger in recessions. In so far as workers may be receiving lower job matches or
38:1497:97361:21:21:68:543:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have lower productivity, this could imply a significant cost to society going beyond the direct
38:1498:97456:21:21:68:543:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of unemployment itself. However, by construction our regression discontinuity analysis
38:1499:97547:21:22:68:543:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is partial equilibrium in nature, and a full evaluation of the implications of causal effects of
38:1500:97643:22:21:68:543:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment we document here would require specifying the source of the losses and a
38:1501:97729:21:0:68:184:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:macroeconomic model.
39:1502:97751:0:21:85:543:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While we find unemployment duration has potentially large effects on wages, the small
39:1503:97836:21:21:68:543:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underlying effect of UI extensions on wages may not substantially affect the welfare conse-
39:1504:97927:21:22:68:543:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quences of UI extensions. If individuals get all the surplus from higher match quality, then
39:1505:98019:22:21:68:543:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they will have internalized the effect of their search behavior on match quality, and the effects
39:1506:98116:21:21:68:543:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of potential UI durations on match quality can be ignored from a social welfare perspective.
39:1507:98208:21:22:68:543:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This situation is different, if workers do not reap all the benefits of better matches—for ex-
39:1508:98302:22:21:68:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ample, because the surplus is shared with the employer or because the government receives
39:1509:98391:21:21:68:543:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taxes. Even in the latter case, the small direct effects of UI extensions on wages we find are
39:1510:98485:21:22:68:386:541:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:unlikely to imply a substantial rise in costs of UI extensions.35
39:1511:98550:22:21:85:543:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our results are also related to the value of leisure. Rational individuals incur the costs
39:1512:98640:21:21:68:543:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of additional wage reductions above and beyond foregone earnings during nonemployment
39:1513:98725:21:22:68:543:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in favor of additional leisure. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the present
39:1514:98817:22:21:68:543:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discounted value of the cost from lower wages due to higher nonemployment durations is
39:1515:98903:21:21:68:543:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about half a month of average earnings per additional month of nonemployment duration.
39:1516:98989:21:21:68:543:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This may indeed be rational, in so far fixed costs of working or fixed costs of leaving a job
39:1517:99082:21:22:68:543:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:put a wedge between the value of leisure and foregone earnings. Yet, it also could be that
39:1518:99172:22:21:68:543:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals do not fully foresee the wage penalty they incur. Without additional information
39:1519:99264:21:21:68:392:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and estimating structural parameters we cannot say more here.
39:1520:99325:21:22:85:543:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Last but not least, by the nature of our regression discontinuity design and institutional
39:1521:99415:22:21:68:543:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:framework, our estimates are based on middle age workers with stable labor force attach-
39:1522:99503:21:21:68:543:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment. While this is the core constituency of unemployment insurance in Germany, the United

39:1524:99683:22:21:68:543:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonemployment durations for a broader population. Studies with data and research designs
39:1525:99771:21:21:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:encompassing broader groups of workers will help to obtain additional information on how the
39:1526:99863:21:22:68:543:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects we measure here differ in the population, what the likely effect on the macroeconomy is,
39:1527:99959:22:21:68:543:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and what the underlying channels may be. Similarly, while we showed in our precursor paper
39:1528:100049:21:21:68:543:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the characteristics of our sample is comparable to similarly aged UI recipients in the
39:1529:100140:21:21:68:543:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:United States and that the effect of UI durations on employment are comparable (Schmieder,
