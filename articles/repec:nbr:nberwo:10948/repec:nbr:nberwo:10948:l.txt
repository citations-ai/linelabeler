2:21:734:31:26:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:I discuss economic approaches to the demand for harmfully addictive substances and estimate time-
2:22:831:26:28:71:539:566:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:series demand functions for the period from 1975 through 2003. My estimates suggest that changes
2:23:927:28:29:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:in  price  can  explain  a  good  deal  of  the  observed  changes  in  cigarette  smoking,  binge  alcohol
2:24:1034:29:28:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:drinking, and marijuana use by high school seniors. For example, the 70 percent increase in the real
2:25:1134:28:28:71:539:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:price of cigarettes since 1997 due to the Medicaid Master Settlement Agreement explains almost all
2:26:1232:28:29:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of the 12 percentage point reduction in the cigarette smoking participation rate since that year. The
2:27:1333:29:28:71:539:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:7 percent increase in the real price of beer between 1990 and 1992 due to the Federal excise tax hike
2:28:1434:28:28:71:539:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:on that beverage in 1991 accounts for almost 90 percent of the 4 percentage point decline in binge
2:29:1532:28:29:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:drinking in the period at issue. The wide swings in the real price of marijuana explain 70 percent of
2:30:1633:29:28:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the reduction in particpation from 1975 to 1992, 60 percent of the subsequent growth to 1997, and
2:31:1730:28:28:71:539:311:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:almost 60 percent of the decline since that year. I conclude with implications for tax policy and for
2:32:1831:28:34:71:527:283:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the lively and contentious debate concerning the legalization of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin.

3:40:2042:36:28:71:154:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:1.  Introduction 
3:41:2059:28:28:71:515:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The economics of substance use and abuse deals with the consumption of goods that 
3:42:2141:28:29:71:542:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share two properties.  First, they are addictive in the sense that an increase in past consumption of 
3:43:2243:29:28:71:513:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the good leads to an increase in current consumption.  Second, their consumption harms the 
3:44:2334:28:28:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumer and others.  This second property makes them of interest from policy, legal, and public 
3:45:2431:28:29:71:531:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health perspectives.  Clearly, not every addictive good harms the user and others.  A person can 
3:46:2528:29:28:71:526:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be addicted to jogging, classical music, detective novels, attending church, and other activities 
3:47:2626:28:28:71:536:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that do not harm others and may yield future benefits to the individual in addition to increases in 
3:48:2726:28:29:71:489:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current utility.  But the consumption of such substances as cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, 
3:49:2816:29:28:71:525:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marijuana, and heroin can harm the consumer and others.  For example, cigarette smoking has 
3:50:2908:28:28:71:511:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been labeled as the largest preventable cause of death by the last three annual U.S. Surgeon 
3:51:3001:28:29:71:535:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:General’s Report on Smoking and Health.  Motor vehicle accident mortality is the leading cause 
3:52:3096:29:28:71:527:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of death of persons between the ages of 1 and 35 in the U.S., and alcohol is involved in almost 
3:53:3192:28:28:71:520:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fifty percent of these fatal accidents.  The consumption of cocaine and other illicit substances 
3:54:3289:28:29:71:532:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results in deaths due to drug overdoses and the violence that accompanies the purchase and sale 
3:55:3385:29:28:71:538:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of illegal drugs. The existence of external costs (harm to others) and ignored internal costs (harm 
3:56:3485:28:28:71:508:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to self) suggests a possible justification for government intervention.  This policy may not, 
3:57:3579:28:29:71:525:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however, be justified if it generates substantial external costs, or if the costs of eliminating the 
3:58:3680:29:28:71:340:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:harms are greater than the costs arising from the harms. 
3:59:3737:28:28:71:522:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The U.S. government and those of many other countries have chosen to regulate some 
3:60:3820:28:29:71:528:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addictive substances (for example, cigarettes and alcohol) via taxation; minimum purchase age 
3:61:3914:29:28:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:laws; restrictions on consumption in schools, the workplace, and public places; and stiff fines for 
3:62:4014:28:0:71:501:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:driving under the influence of alcohol.  They have chosen to outlaw other substances (for 
4:63:4105:0:28:71:535:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, cocaine, heroin, opium, and marijuana).  Taxation, other forms of regulation, and bans 
4:64:4201:28:28:71:503:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raise the prices of these substances.  In addition, bans create black markets and encourage 
4:65:4293:28:29:71:324:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:criminal activities that may harm innocent victims.   
4:66:4347:29:28:71:525:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The full price of addictive goods can be defined broadly to include not only the money 
4:67:4433:28:28:71:500:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price but such indirect cost elements as the monetary value of the travel and waiting time 
4:68:4524:28:29:71:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:required to obtain the good, the monetary value of the expected penalties for possession of illegal 
4:69:4624:29:28:71:531:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drugs or conviction of drunk driving, and the monetary value of the adverse health effects.  The 
4:70:4721:28:28:71:516:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responsiveness of these substances to full price is an important parameter in determining the 
4:71:4815:28:29:71:525:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal level of taxation and the impacts of legalization.  The economics of substance use and 
4:72:4910:29:28:71:527:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:abuse is very relevant to these issues because recent theoretical advances predict that addictive 
4:73:5008:28:28:71:532:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods should be more sensitive to price than previously believed.  A growing body of empirical 
4:74:5103:28:29:71:228:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies confirms this prediction. 
4:75:5137:29:28:71:354:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:2.  Price and Consumption Trends in the United States 
4:76:5190:28:28:71:508:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: To keep this paper manageable, the research that I will be discussing deals with the 
4:77:5275:28:29:71:531:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects of money price on consumption and abuse and on interactions between money price and 
4:78:5367:29:28:71:525:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other components of full price.  It is natural to focus on money price given the preeminence of 
4:79:5463:28:28:71:511:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the law of the downward sloping demand function.  Moreover, money price is a convenient 
4:80:5551:28:29:71:508:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable for governments to manipulate via excise taxation.  Taxes are “blunt instruments” 
4:81:5642:29:28:71:535:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because they impose welfare cost on non-abusers.  But the enforcement and administrative costs 
4:82:5737:28:28:71:533:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of such policies as minimum purchasing ages are likely to be much higher than those associated 
4:83:5832:28:29:71:529:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with taxation (Grossman et al. 1994).  Taxation also is very relevant in the case of illegal drugs 
4:84:5931:29:28:71:499:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because policy proposals to legalize these substances can be combined with taxation (for 
4:85:6020:28:0:71:311:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, Becker, Murphy, and Grossman 2004).  
5:86:6067:0:28:71:507:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Given my emphasis on money price and on U.S. data and policy, it is instructive to 
5:87:6150:28:28:71:507:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:examine trends in the real prices of cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana (the 
5:88:6244:28:29:71:490:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:money price of each substance divided by the Consumer Price Index for all goods) and 
5:89:6329:29:28:71:530:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding trends in the prevalence of the use of these substances.  Figure 1 shows trends in 
5:90:6426:28:28:71:510:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real cigarette, beer, wine, and distilled spirits prices from 1975 through 2003.1  This period 
5:91:6521:28:29:71:520:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:encompasses most of the U.S. anti-smoking campaign which dates to the issuance of the first 
5:92:6613:29:28:71:524:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health in 1964.  It includes the entire campaign to 
5:93:6705:28:28:71:542:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduce deaths from motor vehicle accidents by discouraging alcohol abuse.  This campaign began 
5:94:6800:28:29:71:486:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the mid 1970s and has been expanded to include other outcomes of alcohol abuse.   
5:95:6885:29:28:71:536:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The figure shows that the real prices of alcohol and cigarettes have declined significantly 
5:96:6977:28:28:71:515:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for certain periods during which the anti-smoking and anti-drinking campaigns have been in 
5:97:7068:28:29:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect.  These declines can be traced in part to the stability in nominal terms of the Federal excise 
5:98:7170:29:28:71:541:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax rates on cigarettes and alcohol (see Table 1).  In the case of cigarettes, the real price fell by 14 
5:99:7275:28:28:71:533:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent between 1975 and 1980 (and by 20 percent between 1965 and 1980) before rising by 88 
5:100:7367:28:29:71:528:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent between 1980 and 1992.  This large increase resulted in part from the three Federal tax 
5:101:7463:29:28:71:541:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hikes.  The 12 percent decline in price between 1992 and 1997 was generated by a cut of 40 cents 
5:102:7560:28:28:71:524:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the nominal price of a pack of Marlboro cigarettes by the Philip Morris Companies in April 
5:103:7654:28:29:71:503:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1993, which was matched by competitors of other name brands soon after.  This price cut 
5:104:7742:29:28:71:525:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:represented an attempt to ward off competition from generic brands of cigarettes.  Since 1997, 
5:105:7837:28:28:71:542:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the real price has risen by 72 percent in response to the settlement of the lawsuits filed by 46 state 
5:106:7940:28:29:71:513:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attorneys general against cigarette makers to recover Medicaid funds spent treating diseases 
5:107:8033:29:28:71:536:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:related to smoking (the Master Settlement Agreement or MSA), two Federal tax increases, and a 
5:108:8127:28:0:71:216:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number of state tax increases. 
6:109:8159:0:28:71:516:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The downward trends in real price for beer, wine, and distilled spirits are much more 
6:110:8245:28:28:71:538:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dramatic.  These reductions between 1975 and 1990 were 20 percent, 28 percent, and 32 percent, 
6:111:8340:28:29:71:522:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respectively.  Since the Federal tax rates on all three beverages were raised in 1991, real price 
6:112:8438:29:28:71:486:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:declines amounted to 9 percent for beer, 13 percent for wine, and 8 percent for spirits. 
6:113:8527:28:28:71:510:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Trends in the real prices of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana for the period from 1975 
6:114:8612:28:29:71:496:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through 2003 are shown in Figure 2.  These prices are based on purchases made by drug 
6:115:8698:29:28:71:536:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enforcement agents to apprehend drug dealers as recorded in the System to Retrieve Information 
6:116:8793:28:28:71:530:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) maintained by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of 
6:117:8880:28:29:71:505:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the U.S. Department of Justice.2  Despite large allocations of resources to interdiction and 
6:118:8973:29:28:71:529:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:criminal justice as part of the Federal War on Drugs, the real price of one pure gram of cocaine 
6:119:9070:28:28:71:535:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fell by 89 percent, and the real price of one pure gram of heroin fell by 87 percent between 1975 
6:120:9168:28:29:71:525:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 2003.  Most of the cocaine price decline took place between 1975 and 1985.  On the other 
6:121:9261:29:28:71:443:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand, the price of heroin was fairly stable until 1983 and declined thereafter.  
6:122:9342:28:28:71:537:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The real price of marijuana shows a somewhat different trend.   It increased by almost 10 
6:123:9432:28:29:71:514:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent during the period as a whole.  This overall upward trend can be decomposed into an 
6:124:9523:29:28:71:531:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expansion from 1975 to 1991, followed by a decline until 1996, and an increase after that year.  
6:125:9620:28:28:71:529:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The price rose by 70 percent in the earliest period, declined by 40 percent in the middle period, 
6:126:9718:28:29:71:537:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and increased by 13 percent in the latest period.  Marijuana prices are not adjusted for purity, but 
6:127:9819:29:28:71:520:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Pacula et al. (2001) report that purity fell between 1982 and 1992 and rose between 1992 and 
6:128:9912:28:28:71:523:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1998.  Hence the price swings in Figure 2 may understate the changes in the price of one pure 
6:129:10006:28:29:71:170:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gram of marijuana.3 
6:130:10025:29:28:107:518:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The decline in the real price of cocaine has attracted the most attention in the popular 
6:131:10114:28:0:71:519:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:press.  Caulkins (1995) and Basov, Jacobson, and Miron (2001a) point to a number of causal 
7:132:10206:0:28:71:531:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factors.  One was the development of the production sector and the results of learning-by-doing 
7:133:10302:28:28:71:524:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that followed the reintroduction of cocaine into the U.S. market in the early 1970s after a long 
7:134:10399:28:29:71:535:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period of absence.  A second was vertical integration, which reduced the number of levels in the 
7:135:10496:29:28:71:526:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:chain of distribution and the cost of wholesaling and retailing.  In addition, there was a shift to 
7:136:10596:28:28:71:537:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low-cost labor as the professionals who dealt cocaine in the 1970s were replaced by unemployed 
7:137:10691:28:29:71:533:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:residents of urban ghettos in the 1980s.  Finally, the degree of competition in the illegal cocaine 
7:138:10791:29:28:71:529:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industry may have increased over time, and technological progress in evading law enforcement 
7:139:10884:28:28:71:486:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may have taken place.  While there is little “hard” empirical evidence to support these 
7:140:10972:28:29:71:538:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explanations, Basov, Jacobson, and Miron (2001b) find that the 25 percent decline in the relative 
7:141:11070:29:28:71:534:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage of low-skilled labor since 1979 can account for approximately 20 percent of the decline in 
7:142:11166:28:28:71:264:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the real price of cocaine since that year. 
7:143:11209:28:29:71:530:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The downward trend in the real price of cocaine that has accompanied the upward trend 
7:144:11295:29:28:71:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in resources allocated to enforcement does not mean that the War on Drugs has been a failure.  In 
7:145:11393:28:28:71:530:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a cross-sectional analysis that combines city-specific cocaine prices and state-specific expected 
7:146:11491:28:29:71:499:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:penalty variables, Grossman, Chaloupka, and Brown (1996) show that cocaine prices are 
7:147:11577:29:28:71:532:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positively related to monetary fines and prison terms for cocaine sale and to police and criminal 
7:148:11675:28:28:71:517:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:justice expenditures per capita.  By using data for cities over time for the years 1985 through 
7:149:11771:28:29:71:496:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1996, Kuziemko and Levitt (forthcoming) obtain more refined estimates that control for 
7:150:11858:29:28:71:527:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unmeasured state and time fixed effects.  They find that cocaine prices are positively related to 
7:151:11956:28:28:71:521:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the certainty of punishment as measured by per capita drug-offense arrests and the severity of 
7:152:12051:28:29:71:540:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:punishment as measured by the fraction of drug arrests that result in the criminal being sentenced 
7:153:12150:29:28:71:516:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to prison.  On balance, however, the rise in enforcement has been swamped by other factors. 
7:154:12242:28:0:107:510:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Trends in cigarette smoking participation, alcohol consumption, and binge drinking 
8:155:12326:0:28:71:530:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:among high school seniors for the years from 1975 through 2003 are shown in Figure 3.  These 
8:156:12419:28:28:71:530:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data come from the cross-sectional surveys conducted by the Institute of Social Research of the 
8:157:12515:28:29:71:541:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:University of Michigan each year since 1975 as part of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) project.  
8:158:12612:29:28:71:542:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Cigarette smoking is defined as the percentage who smoked in the past 30 days, alcohol use is the 
8:159:12710:28:28:71:527:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage who consumed beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the past year, and binge drinking is 
8:160:12807:28:29:71:533:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the percentage who had five or more drinks in a row on at least one day in the past two weeks.4  
8:161:12904:29:28:71:517:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There are several reasons to focus on MTF and on teenagers in examining trends in cigarette 
8:162:12996:28:28:71:532:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoking and alcohol use.  MTF data for high school seniors provide the longest consistent time 
8:163:13091:28:29:71:537:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series on these behaviors.  Moreover, there is a good deal of evidence that cigarette smoking and 
8:164:13189:29:28:71:517:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:excessive alcohol use are habits that begin early in life (for example, Grossman et al. 1994).  
8:165:13285:28:28:71:507:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence policies to reduce their prevalence among youths may be the most effective tools to 
8:166:13375:28:29:71:502:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discourage them in all segments of the population.  Finally, studies reviewed in Section 5 
8:167:13466:29:28:71:511:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conclude that substance use by teenagers and young adults is more sensitive to price than is 
8:168:13559:28:28:71:216:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substance use by older adults. 
8:169:13590:28:29:107:540:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:All three outcomes shown in Figure 3 declined between 1975 and 2003.  The reduction in 
8:170:13677:29:28:71:509:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoking participation is consistent with the dramatic increase in the real price of cigarettes 
8:171:13772:28:28:71:539:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shown in Figure 1, but the reductions in alcohol use and in binge drinking are not consistent with 
8:172:13871:28:29:71:528:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the reductions in the real prices of alcoholic beverages.  It is difficult, however, to make causal 
8:173:13971:29:28:71:519:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inferences from the data in Figures 1 and 3 because of developments in the anti-smoking and 
8:174:14063:28:28:71:533:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drinking campaigns that occurred during this time and lagged responses to these developments.  
8:175:14158:28:29:71:496:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They include the diffusion of knowledge about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking, 
8:176:14246:29:28:71:537:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases in the minimum legal ages required to purchase alcohol and cigarettes, the requirement 
8:177:14343:28:0:71:514:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers and cigarette packages, the enactment of 
9:178:14436:0:28:71:531:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions on advertising and bans on cigarette smoking in public places and in the workplace, 
9:179:14533:28:28:71:524:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the passage of legislation to increase the likelihood of apprehending and convicting drunk 
9:180:14628:28:29:71:140:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drivers.           
9:181:14647:29:28:107:530:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Trends in annual (past year) marijuana, cocaine, and heroin participation as percentages 
9:182:14736:28:28:71:521:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for high school seniors from 1975 through 2003 are presented in Figure 4.  The focus on high 
9:183:14829:28:29:71:510:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:school seniors is particularly relevant here because Grossman, Chaloupka, and Shin (2001) 
9:184:14919:29:28:71:502:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:summarize data that show that illegal drug use is a young person’s habit, at least for most 
9:185:15011:28:28:71:535:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:segments of the population.  Trends in marijuana use suggest that the number of youths who use 
9:186:15106:28:29:71:533:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this substance rises as its real price falls.  Marijuana participation fell from 40.0 percent in 1975 
9:187:15208:29:28:71:528:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 21.9 percent in 1992 while price was rising.  Participation then grew to 38.5 percent in 1997 
9:188:15305:28:28:71:485:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while price was falling before falling to 34.9 percent in 2003 while price was rising.    
9:189:15395:28:29:107:528:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With a participation rate that ranges between 0.4 percent and 1.5 percent, heroin use by 
9:190:15484:29:28:71:508:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high school seniors is extremely rare.  The series for cocaine is somewhat more revealing.  
9:191:15576:28:28:71:530:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Participation grew from 5.6 percent in 1975 to 13.1 percent in 1985 at the same time as the real 
9:192:15673:28:29:71:540:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price fell by approximately 64 percent.  Of course, the real price of cocaine continued to fall after 
9:193:15775:29:28:71:536:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the prevalence of its use peaked.  Grossman, Chaloupka, and Brown (1996) attribute this to such 
9:194:15871:28:28:71:507:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developments as the “just say no” to drugs campaign begun by Nancy Reagan shortly after 
9:195:15959:28:29:71:535:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ronald Reagan became President in 1981, efforts by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America to 
9:196:16053:29:28:71:537:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:publicize the harmful effects of cocaine, and the dramatic cocaine-related deaths in June 1986 of 
9:197:16151:28:28:71:522:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the basketball star Len Bias and the football star Don Rogers.  They also summarize evidence 
9:198:16244:28:29:71:513:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting that cocaine was viewed as a benign illicit drug from the early 1970s to the early 
9:199:16338:29:28:71:112:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1980s.   
9:200:16347:28:0:107:508:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The MTF surveys from which the data in Figure 4 were obtained contain imperfect 
10:201:16428:0:28:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measures of chronic drug use and obviously exclude certain groups of heavy users such as the 
10:202:16521:28:28:71:525:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:homeless and criminals.  Therefore, rates of hospital emergency room marijuana, cocaine, and 
10:203:16614:28:29:71:528:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heroin mentions per 100,000 population for the period from 1978-2002 are plotted in Figure 5, 
10:204:16708:29:28:71:522:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the percentages of arrestees testing positive for these three substances for the period from 
10:205:16805:28:28:71:531:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1989-2003 are plotted in Figure 6.  The hospital emergency room data cover persons of all ages 
10:206:16900:28:29:71:533:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and pertain to episodes in which one or more of the three drugs was mentioned as a cause of the 
10:207:16996:29:28:71:535:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:episode.  Hence there can be more mentions than episodes.  The figures are taken from the Drug 
10:208:17091:28:28:71:509:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) maintained by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health

10:210:17267:29:28:71:517:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persons 18 years of age and older, come from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Network 
10:211:17355:28:28:71:501:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(ADAM), formerly termed Drug Use Forecasting (DUF), and maintained by the National

10:213:17463:29:28:107:513:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:According to Figure 5, drug-related hospital emergency room episodes have trended 
10:214:17545:28:28:71:533:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:upward at rapid rates, especially for cocaine.  The shorter time series in Figure 6 reveal declines 
10:215:17645:28:29:71:528:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the percentages of arrestees who tested positive for cocaine and marijuana but an increase in 
10:216:17742:29:28:71:532:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the percentage who tested positive for marijuana.  As is the case with the outcomes in Figures 3 
10:217:17839:28:28:71:542:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 4, definitive statements about the relationship between price and participation in heavy use of 
10:218:17939:28:29:71:484:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:illegal drugs or consumption by chronic users cannot be made because trends in other 
10:219:18024:29:28:71:247:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determinants are not held constant.   
10:220:18062:28:28:71:253:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:3. Time-Series Demand Functions 
10:221:18093:28:29:107:531:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To examine the relationship between price and the substance use outcomes in Figures 3-
10:222:18179:29:28:71:521:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:6, I fit time-series demand functions using ten of the twelve indicators of use in the figures as 
10:223:18277:28:0:71:519:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes.  My procedure is to regress each outcome on a measure of its real price and a time 
11:224:18371:0:28:71:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trend.  In the cases of alcohol use and binge drinking, I use the real beer price as a measure of the 
11:225:18473:28:28:71:537:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of alcohol since beer is the drink of choice among youths who consume alcoholic beverages 
11:226:18568:28:29:71:530:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(for example, Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan 1998).  I do not consider heroin participation 
11:227:18663:29:28:71:516:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by high school seniors as an outcome because of its very low prevalence rate.  I do not show 
11:228:18756:28:28:71:506:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results for cocaine participation by seniors because the real price of cocaine always had an 
11:229:18849:28:29:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant regression coefficient.  That does not necessarily mean that the demand function for 
11:230:18948:29:28:71:507:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cocaine is perfectly inelastic because studies reviewed in Section 5 that capitalize on cross-
11:231:19042:28:28:71:495:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sectional price variation or within city variation over time do find evidence in favor of a 
11:232:19134:28:29:71:251:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downward-sloping demand function. 
11:233:19168:29:28:107:536:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Given the high correlations between real substance use prices and time, the estimation of 
11:234:19258:28:28:71:509:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand functions for the remaining ten items is perhaps more of an art than a science.  My 
11:235:19349:28:29:71:535:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:procedure is to experiment with three alternative trend specifications.  The first includes a linear 
11:236:19450:29:28:71:533:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time trend; the second adds time squared to the first model; and the third adds time cubed to the 
11:237:19548:28:28:71:541:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second model.  All three models contain the real price of the dependent variable.  I then select the 
11:238:19649:28:29:71:542:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model with the lowest residual variance and obtain Newey-West (1987) t-ratios for the regression 
11:239:19746:29:28:71:509:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients of that model.7  The standard errors on which these t-ratios are based allow for 
11:240:19840:28:28:71:516:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heteroscedasticity and for autocorrelation up to and including a lag of three.  Standard errors 
11:241:19936:28:29:71:524:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based on longer lags were very similar to those presented.  When small differences in residual 
11:242:20031:29:28:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variances produce large differences in the real price coefficient, I present the results of more than 
11:243:20133:28:28:71:158:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one specification. 
11:244:20152:28:29:107:529:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Compared to the use of repeated cross-sections or panels to estimate demand functions, 
11:245:20239:29:28:71:519:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the use of national time series has certain advantages.  First, one can cover a longer period of 
11:246:20336:28:0:71:524:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time and include the most recent data.  Second, one can examine whether price changes in the 
12:247:20431:0:28:71:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period at issue have the potential to account for a significant share of the observed changes in the 
12:248:20532:28:28:71:541:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding measures of use over time.  Examples are the reduction in the price of cigarettes in 
12:249:20631:28:29:71:541:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1993 generated by competition from generic brands, the increase in the price of this good in 1998 
12:250:20729:29:28:71:514:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:due to the MSA, the increase in the prices of alcoholic beverages in 1991 due to the Federal 
12:251:20822:28:28:71:541:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:excise tax hike, and the dramatic swings in the price of marijuana.  This analysis does not have to 
12:252:20922:28:29:71:541:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employ price effects obtained from data that do not cover the entire period.  Third, one avoids the 
12:253:21022:29:28:71:541:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:somewhat contentious issue of whether or not to include area-specific fixed effects (see Section 5 
12:254:21121:28:28:71:509:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for more details).  The disadvantages of the time series are that there are a small number of 
12:255:21215:28:29:71:519:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observations and a considerable amount of intercorrelation among the variables.  In addition, 
12:256:21309:29:28:71:500:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price effects are biased downward in absolute value if the price variables contain random 
12:257:21399:28:28:71:340:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measurement error or if supply functions slope upward. 
12:258:21454:28:29:107:510:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 contains regressions for cigarette smoking participation in the past 30 days, 
12:259:21540:29:28:71:536:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alcohol use in the past year, binge drinking in the past two weeks, and marijuana participation in 
12:260:21639:28:28:71:486:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the past year by high school seniors in Monitoring the Future.  Seniors complete MTF 
12:261:21724:28:29:71:539:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:questionnaires in school between March 15 and April 30 of year t.  Therefore, annual alcohol use 
12:262:21821:29:28:71:521:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and marijuana participation roughly cover year t-1, and the real price is lagged one year when 
12:263:21916:28:28:71:542:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each of these variables is the outcome.8  That is, the price in year t - 1 is employed as a regressor.  
12:264:22020:28:29:71:533:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since the binge drinking outcome pertains to the past two weeks, the real beer price is given by  
12:265:22118:29:28:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple average of the real beer price in the fourth quarter of year t - 1 and the first quarter of year 
12:266:22222:28:28:71:89:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:t.    
12:267:22228:28:29:107:525:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Cigarette smoking participation refers to the past thirty days, and the nominal cigarette 
12:268:22318:29:28:71:530:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price is reported as of November 1 of year t-1.  Therefore, the real cigarette price is the price as 
12:269:22419:28:0:71:511:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of November of year t-1 with the following adjustments to the nominal price.  Four cents is 
13:270:22513:0:28:71:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:added to the November 1982 nominal price to reflect the eight-cent increase in the Federal tax on 
13:271:22611:28:28:71:509:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a package of cigarettes on January 1, 1983.  Two cents is added to the November 1990 and 
13:272:22700:28:29:71:536:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:November 1992 nominal prices to reflect the four-cent increases in the Federal tax on January 1, 
13:273:22797:29:28:71:538:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1991 and on January 1, 1993.  Five cents is added to the November 1999 nominal price to reflect 
13:274:22893:28:28:71:537:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the ten-cent increase in the Federal tax on January 1, 2000.  Two cents is added to the November 
13:275:22990:28:29:71:505:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2002 nominal price to reflect the five-cent increase in the Federal tax on January 1, 2003.  
13:276:23083:29:28:71:517:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, 31.1 cents is added to the November 1998 price to reflect the 45-cent increase in the 
13:277:23178:28:28:71:516:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nominal price in late November 1998 due to the settlement of the state lawsuits filed against 
13:278:23272:28:29:71:544:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cigarette makers to recover Medicaid funds spent treating diseases related to smoking (the MSA).  
13:279:23370:29:28:71:515:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The logic of these adjustments is that smoking decisions reported in MTF in March or April 
13:280:23461:28:28:71:507:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should depend on the price in the period from October of year t-1 through March of year t. 
13:281:23552:28:29:107:534:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When alcohol use and binge drinking are the dependent variables, I add a regression that 
13:282:23641:29:28:71:535:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:includes the legal age for the purchase of beer with an alcoholic content of 3.2 percent or less by 
13:283:23741:28:28:71:539:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weight.9  I obtained this variable from Saffer, Chaloupka, and Grossman (1993).  I defined it as a 
13:284:23840:28:29:71:537:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:population-weighted average of the effective legal drinking age in effect in each state of the U.S. 
13:285:23940:29:28:71:528:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a given years, where the set of weights is the fraction of the U.S. population residing in each 
13:286:24039:28:28:71:533:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state in a given year.  While every state had enacted a legal drinking age of twenty-one by 1988, 
13:287:24137:28:29:71:516:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many enacted “grandfather clauses,” which exempted state residents of legal age prior to the 
13:288:24230:29:28:71:520:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase.  Hence, the effective legal drinking age in the U.S. did not become twenty-one until 
13:289:24325:28:28:71:531:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1991.  I lag this variable one year to allow for delayed adjustment and greater enforcement over 
13:290:24422:28:29:71:533:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time, but the results with a contemporaneous measure are almost identical to those in Table 2.  I 
13:291:24520:29:28:71:541:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include the drinking age because it is a readily available and widely cited policy instrument of the 
13:292:24621:28:0:71:540:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anti-drinking campaign.  Moreover, its effects have been studied extensively in previous research 
14:293:24721:0:28:71:250:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(for example, Grossman et al. 1994). 
14:294:24758:28:28:107:482:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Except when the legal drinking age is employed as a regressor, the cubic time 
14:295:24836:28:29:71:507:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specification minimizes the residual variances of the outcomes in Table 2.  Each real price 
14:296:24928:29:28:71:520:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient is negative and statistically significant in that table.  In addition, small changes in  
14:297:25029:28:28:71:508:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:residual variances are not associated with large changes in these estimates.  At the point of 
14:298:25123:28:29:71:479:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample means, the price elasticities of cigarette smoking participation and marijuana 
14:299:25209:29:28:71:518:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation are both equal to -0.46.  The price elasticity of alcohol use is -0.43 in the model 
14:300:25307:28:28:71:532:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without the drinking age and -0.55 in the model with this variable.  The price elasticity of binge 
14:301:25406:28:29:71:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drinking is quite large: -1.98 when the drinking age is excluded and -1.52 when it is included.  
14:302:25503:29:28:71:536:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This large estimate is not a function of the manner in which the trend is specified.  The elasticity 
14:303:25604:28:28:71:533:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is -1.46 in a regression that simply includes a linear trend and -0.93 in a regression that contains 
14:304:25705:28:29:71:245:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the drinking age but no trend terms. 
14:305:25742:29:28:107:537:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The regressions in Table 2 can be used to examine whether price changes in the period at 
14:306:25831:28:28:71:494:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:issue have the potential to account for a significant share of the observed changes in the 
14:307:25922:28:29:71:533:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding measures of use over time.  First, consider cigarette participation.  Between 1992 
14:308:26019:29:28:71:512:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 1997 the real price of cigarettes fell by 12 percent due mainly to a cut of 40 cents in the 
14:309:26115:28:28:71:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nominal price of a pack of Marlboro cigarettes by the Philip Morris companies in April 1993.  At 
14:310:26212:28:29:71:522:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same time, smoking participation rose from 29.9 percent in 1993 to 36.5 percent in 1997.  
14:311:26306:29:28:71:540:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The cigarette participation equation predicts a decline in participation of 2.5 percentage points.10  
14:312:26408:28:28:71:523:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This amounts to 38 percent of the observed 6.6 percentage point decline.  Since 1997, the real 
14:313:26503:28:29:71:499:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price has grown by 72 percent, while participation declined to 24.4 percent in 2003.  The 
14:314:26593:29:28:71:525:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicted decline from the regression is 11.8 percentage points or approximately 98 percent of 
14:315:26688:28:0:71:263:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the observed 12.1 percentage point fall. 
15:316:26731:0:28:107:534:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next consider alcohol use and binge drinking.  Between 1990 and 1992, the real price of 
15:317:26819:28:28:71:519:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:beer rose by 7 percent.  At the same time, alcohol use fell by 3.6 percentage points from 77.1 
15:318:26914:28:29:71:530:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent to 73.5 percent, and binge drinking dropped by 4.3 percentage points from 32.2 percent 
15:319:27009:29:28:71:536:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 29.9 percent.  For the former outcome, the predicted decline of 2.7 percentage points from the 
15:320:27107:28:28:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regression with the drinking age accounts for 75 percent of the observed reduction.  For the latter 
15:321:27207:28:29:71:531:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcome, the predicted decline of 3.7 percentage points accounts for 86 percent of the observed 
15:322:27303:29:28:71:118:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decline.   
15:323:27314:28:28:107:513:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The importance of controlling for the drinking age in estimating beer price effects is 
15:324:27401:28:29:71:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highlighted by the predicted decline of 3.9 percentage points in alcohol use and 9.2 percentage 
15:325:27497:29:28:71:509:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points in binge drinking due to the two year increase in the drinking age between 1975 and 
15:326:27588:28:28:71:536:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1991.11  Of course, both alcohol use and binge drinking have declined since 1991, while the real 
15:327:27685:28:29:71:515:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:beer price fell and the drinking age remained the same.  In the regressions these declines are 
15:328:27780:29:28:71:509:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:captured by the trend term.  Carpenter (2004) finds that the enactment of “Zero Tolerance” 
15:329:27871:28:28:71:538:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Drunk Driving Laws--which set very low legal blood alcohol limits for individuals under the age 
15:330:27967:28:29:71:358:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of twenty-one--can account for part of the downward trend. 
15:331:28026:29:28:107:536:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, consider the predicted impacts of the wide swings in the real price of marijuana.  
15:332:28118:28:28:71:529:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Between 1975 and 1992, price increased by approximately 100 percent, while participation fell 
15:333:28212:28:29:71:529:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from 40.0 percent to 21.9 percent.  The predicted decline of 12.4 percentage points explains 69 
15:334:28308:29:28:71:529:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the observed 18.1 percentage point reduction.  The real price proceeded to fall by 40 
15:335:28405:28:28:71:529:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent through 1997, while participation expanded to 38.5 percent.  The predicted increase of  
15:336:28501:28:29:71:519:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:9.8 percentage points accounts for 60 percent of the 16.6 percentage point growth.  The most 
15:337:28594:29:28:71:499:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recent period was characterized by a 14 percent price increase and a 3.6 percentage point 
15:338:28684:28:0:71:536:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduction in participation.  The regression explains approximately 56 percent of this reduction.12 
16:339:28784:0:28:107:507:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 contains the regressions for rates of hospital emergency room mentions for 
16:340:28867:28:28:71:508:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marijuana, cocaine, and heroin; and Table 4 contains the regressions for the percentages of 
16:341:28959:28:29:71:518:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arrestees testing positive for each of these three substances.  Since the outcomes in these two 
16:342:29055:29:28:71:537:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tables are collected throughout the year, prices are not lagged.  Unlike the estimated price effects 
16:343:29156:28:28:71:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Table 2, those in Tables 3 and 4 are sensitive to small changes in residual variances due to 
16:344:29252:28:29:71:535:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alternative trend specifications.  Therefore, I present two models for each outcome: one with the 
16:345:29350:29:28:71:517:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:best fitting trend specification and a second with a simple linear trend.  Changes in reporting 
16:346:29446:28:28:71:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:practices and in survey design may account for some of the instability in the results (for example, 
16:347:29546:28:29:71:140:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Reuter 1999). 
16:348:29560:29:28:107:518:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Eleven of the twelve price coefficients in Tables 3 and 4 are negative.  The exception 
16:349:29647:28:28:71:519:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:occurs in the heroin mention equation with a linear trend.  Seven of the eleven negative price 
16:350:29742:28:29:71:542:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients are significant at the five percent level of confidence on a one-tailed test (the relevant 
16:351:29846:29:28:71:530:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:test since the alternative hypothesis is that the coefficient is negative).  The exceptions occur in 
16:352:29947:28:28:71:535:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the cocaine mention equation with a linear trend, in the two marijuana arrestee equations, and in 
16:353:30045:28:29:71:306:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the heroin arrestee equation with a linear trend.   
16:354:30097:29:28:71:530:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Price elasticities in the arrestee data are all less than 0.20 in absolute value except when 
16:355:30190:28:28:71:537:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cocaine is the outcome.  Then the elasticity is estimated in a range between -0.41 and -0.35.  The 
16:356:30289:28:29:71:517:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities in the mentions data are very sensitive to the trend specification.  The cubic trend 
16:357:30387:29:28:71:529:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model produces elasticities of -0.26 for marijuana, -1.73 for cocaine, and -0.61 for heroin.  The 
16:358:30485:28:28:71:538:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:linear trend model yields corresponding elasticities of -1.18 for marijuana, -0.13 for cocaine, and 
16:359:30585:28:29:71:504:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.09 for heroin.  Given the short time series, especially in the arrestee data and changes in 
16:360:30679:29:28:71:495:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reporting and design, the results in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that the outcomes at issue are 
16:361:30770:28:0:71:213:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negatively related to price.13  
17:362:30804:0:28:71:167:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f7:C:4.  Basic Concepts 
17:363:30822:28:28:71:500:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: In the previous section I approached the demand for a harmful addiction from the 
17:364:30903:28:29:71:527:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perspective of  a conventional model of consumer behavior, which ignores addiction.  I simply 
17:365:30997:29:28:71:522:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allowed the outcome at issue to depend on its real price, trend terms, and for alcohol the legal 
17:366:31094:28:28:71:508:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drinking age (a positive correlate of the indirect costs borne by underage youths when they 
17:367:31186:28:29:71:516:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attempt to purchase alcohol).   One can employ two other approaches to this topic: a myopic 
17:368:31278:29:28:71:535:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of addictive behavior, which ignores the future consequences of current consumption and 
17:369:31372:28:28:71:510:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a rational model of addictive behavior, which incorporates future consequences.  The latter 
17:370:31464:28:29:71:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach is developed by Becker and Murphy (1988) in their seminal treatment of the economics 
17:371:31558:29:28:71:532:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of addiction.  Since the first two approaches are nested within the Becker-Murphy framework, I 
17:372:31653:28:28:71:541:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:emphasize this perspective.  Given its somewhat controversial nature, I indicate at the outset that, 
17:373:31754:28:29:71:529:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in my view, Becker and Murphy’s main contribution is to suggest that it is a mistake to assume 
17:374:31849:29:28:71:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that addictive goods are not sensitive to price.  Even if one does not accept all the aspects of their 
17:375:31952:28:28:71:507:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model, one can examine this proposition in the context of the standard theory of consumer 
17:376:32042:28:29:71:122:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior.  
17:377:32053:29:28:71:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:       An increase in past consumption of an addictive good raises current consumption because 
17:378:32148:28:28:71:531:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it increases the marginal utility of current consumption of that good (the increase in satisfaction 
17:379:32248:28:29:71:533:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or utility caused by an increase in consumption of the good).  This is the reinforcement property 
17:380:32346:29:28:71:538:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of an addictive good stressed by psychologists.  A harmful addiction, the focus of my discussion, 
17:381:32444:28:28:71:535:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is one in which past consumption has detrimental effects on current utility, such as reductions in 
17:382:32543:28:29:71:534:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health and therefore in utility caused by cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol use, and the use of 
17:383:32642:29:28:71:537:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cocaine.  Harmful addictions exhibit the physiological property of  tolerance in the sense that the 
17:384:32742:28:0:71:528:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility from a given amount of current consumption is lower when past consumption is higher.  
18:385:32838:0:28:71:516:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Note that I follow most of the literature in using the terms addiction and habit as synonyms.  
18:386:32933:28:28:71:533:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Consumers are myopic if they ignore the effects of current consumption on future utility 
18:387:33022:28:29:71:510:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when they determine the optimal or utility-maximizing quantity of an addictive good in the 
18:388:33113:29:28:71:526:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present period.  On the other hand, they are rational or farsighted if they take account of future 
18:389:33212:28:28:71:536:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects of current consumption when they determine the optimal quantity of an addictive good in 
18:390:33308:28:29:71:163:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the present period. 
18:391:33328:29:28:71:527:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: In sharp contrast to the myopic addiction approach, Becker and Murphy (1988) assume 
18:392:33412:28:28:71:524:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that consumers take account of future effects of current consumption when they determine the 
18:393:33505:28:29:71:525:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal amount of an addictive good in the current period.  They use this notion to construct a 
18:394:33601:29:28:71:535:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of rational addiction that among other things contains the first explicit derivation of long- 
18:395:33701:28:28:71:521:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and short-run demand functions for addictive goods in the case of farsighted consumers.  The 
18:396:33794:28:29:71:520:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conventional wisdom is that addictive goods are not sensitive to price possibly because small 
18:397:33888:29:28:71:502:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in the consumption of these goods cause large changes in the marginal benefit of 
18:398:33977:28:28:71:536:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption.  Contrary to this conventional wisdom, Becker and Murphy stress that the demand 
18:399:34070:28:29:71:536:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for addictive goods may be responsive to price in the long run.  They also stress that the quantity 
18:400:34170:29:28:71:535:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demanded of an addictive good is negatively related not only to the current price of the good but 
18:401:34268:28:28:71:500:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also to its past and future price.  Economists define a set of goods to be complements if a 
18:402:34360:28:29:71:510:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduction in the price of one good causes consumption of all of them to rise.  In the Becker-
18:403:34453:29:28:71:525:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Murphy model of rational addiction, the quantities of an addictive good consumed in different 
18:404:34547:28:28:71:197:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:periods are complements. 
18:405:34572:28:29:71:533:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1994) show that the Becker-Murphy model generates a 
18:406:34654:29:29:71:472:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand function for consumption of  an addictive good in period t (Ct) of the form 
18:407:34737:29:0:71:520:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  Ct = aCt-1 + baCt+1 + qPt.                           (1) 
19:408:34792:0:29:71:520:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here, Pt is the price of Ct.  Other determinants of current period consumption are suppressed. 
19:409:34887:29:29:71:541:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since a and b are positive and q is negative, current consumption is positively related to past and 
19:410:34987:29:29:71:504:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future consumption (Ct-1 and Ct+1, respectively) and negatively related to current price.  In 
19:411:35081:29:28:71:526:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular, a measures the effect of an increase in past consumption on the marginal benefit of 
19:412:35177:28:30:71:485:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current consumption.  This parameter also measures the effect of an increase in future 
19:413:35264:30:28:71:512:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption on the marginal benefit of current consumption.  The larger the value of a the 
19:414:35355:28:29:71:499:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:greater is the degree of reinforcement or addiction.  Equation (1) highlights the source of 
19:415:35447:29:28:71:522:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intertemporal complementarity in the rational addiction model.  It arises because  increases in 
19:416:35543:28:28:71:491:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:past or future consumption (caused by reductions in past or future prices) cause current 
19:417:35632:28:29:71:172:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption to rise. 
19:418:35653:29:28:71:541:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Equation (1) also implies that the short-run price elasticity, which holds past consumption 
19:419:35745:28:28:71:524:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant, must be smaller than the long-run price elasticity, which allows past consumption to 
19:420:35840:28:29:71:514:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vary.  This property does not hold in general for a non-addictive good.  Hence, comparisons 
19:421:35932:29:28:71:529:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the price elasticities of the two types of goods may be misleading if they are not based 
19:422:36029:28:28:71:494:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on long-run price elasticities.  Put differently, since past consumption reinforces current 
19:423:36121:28:29:71:536:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption, the price response grows over time in the case of an addictive good.  For example, 
19:424:36217:29:28:71:492:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a price increase in 2004 would reduce consumption in 2004, which in turn would cause 
19:425:36302:28:28:71:519:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption in 2005 and in all future years to fall ceteris paribus.  Indeed, the long-run price 
19:426:36399:28:29:71:416:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response is greater the higher the degree of addiction or reinforcement.  
19:427:36473:29:29:71:542:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The parameter b in equation (1) is the time discount factor and is equal to 1/(1 + r), where 
19:428:36566:29:28:71:531:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:r is the rate of time preference for the present.  Typically, economists and psychologists assume 
19:429:36664:28:29:71:499:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that this discount factor is smaller than one because people are impatient.  They prefer to 
19:430:36756:29:0:71:533:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consume 100 units of a good today instead of consuming 100 units of the same good tomorrow. 
20:431:36850:0:28:71:528:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The smaller the time discount factor (the greater the rate of time preference for the present) the 
20:432:36949:28:29:71:539:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller is the effect of future consumption or future price on current consumption.  In the case of 
20:433:37049:29:29:71:534:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perfectly myopic behavior, b equals zero (r equals infinity), and future variables have no impact 
20:434:37147:29:28:71:530:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on current decisions.  This is the sense in which a myopic model of addiction is nested within a 
20:435:37244:28:29:71:225:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rational model of this behavior. 
20:436:37277:29:28:71:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Time preference for the present enters this and other models of optimal consumption over 
20:437:37366:28:29:71:530:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the life cycle because consumers are assumed to maximize a lifetime utility function defined as 
20:438:37462:29:29:71:505:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the discounted sum or present value of utility in each period or at each age, where b is the 
20:439:37555:29:28:71:537:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discount factor.  While the discount factor is usually taken to be exogenous or given, Becker and 
20:440:37653:28:28:71:523:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Mulligan (1997) point out that consumers have incentives to make investments that lower the 
20:441:37745:28:29:71:529:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of time preference for the present.  This is because the present value of utility is higher the 
20:442:37846:29:28:71:362:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller is the rate of time preference for the present.    
20:443:37904:28:28:71:514:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: There are important interactions between time preference and addiction.  On the one 
20:444:37988:28:29:71:529:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand, people who discount the future more heavily are more likely to become addicted (Becker 
20:445:38081:29:28:71:516:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Murphy 1988).  On the other hand: “Since a decline in future utility reduces the benefits 
20:446:38175:28:28:71:533:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from a lower discount on future utilities, greater consumption of harmful substances would lead 
20:447:38271:28:29:71:530:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to higher rates of time preference by discouraging investments in lowering these rates” (Becker 
20:448:38367:29:28:71:533:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Mulligan 1997: 744).  Thus, “...harmful addictions induce even rational persons to discount 
20:449:38463:28:28:71:519:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the future more heavily, which in turn may lead them to become more addicted” (Becker and 
20:450:38553:28:29:71:176:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Mulligan 1997: 744). 
20:451:38574:29:28:71:522:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Extensions of the above framework imply differential price responses by age, income, 
20:452:38659:28:28:71:529:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and education in the case of addictive goods (Becker, Grossman, and Murphy 1991).  The total 
20:453:38752:28:0:71:532:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of addictive goods to consumers equals the sum of the good's price and the money value of 
21:454:38849:0:28:71:516:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the future adverse effects, such as the negative effects on earnings and health from smoking, 
21:455:38943:28:28:71:516:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heavy drinking, or heavy dependence on cocaine.14  Future costs tend to be less important to 
21:456:39036:28:29:71:528:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:poorer, less educated, and younger consumers because they generally place a smaller monetary 
21:457:39129:29:28:71:538:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value on health and other harmful future effects than richer, more educated, and older consumers 
21:458:39226:28:28:71:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who have higher wage rates.  Moreover, the poor, youths, and the less educated are likely to have 
21:459:39324:28:29:71:535:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower time discount factors (higher rates of time preference for the present) than the rich, adults, 
21:460:39425:29:28:71:521:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the more educated (Becker and Mulligan 1997).   It follows that the poor, youths, and the 
21:461:39519:28:28:71:515:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less educated are more sensitive to changes in money prices of addictive goods, whereas the 
21:462:39611:28:29:71:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:middle or upper income classes, adults, and the more educated respond more to changes in the 
21:463:39704:29:28:71:541:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perceived or actual harmful consequences that take place in the future.  Becker (1992) also shows 
21:464:39802:28:28:71:540:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that interactions between peer pressure, which is much more important for youths than for adults, 
21:465:39900:28:29:71:342:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and addiction predict greater price sensitivity by youths. 
21:466:39959:29:29:71:532:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: If the parameter a in equation (1) is zero or if consumers ignore the addictive properties 
21:467:40050:29:28:71:519:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the substances under discussion, a conventional model of the demand for these substances 
21:468:40142:28:29:71:512:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:emerges.  Yet all the factors mentioned just mentioned except for interactions between peer 
21:469:40234:29:28:71:533:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pressure and addiction still operate to produce differential price responses.  In particular, youths 
21:470:40335:28:28:71:542:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are expected to be more sensitive to changes money prices of addictive goods than adults because 
21:471:40432:28:29:71:524:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they value the future health consequences less, discount the future more heavily, and are more 
21:472:40527:29:28:71:538:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sensitive to peer pressure.  In addition, the fraction of disposable income that a youth allocates to 
21:473:40629:28:28:71:532:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:harmful substances is likely to exceed the corresponding fraction that an adult allocates to these 
21:474:40728:28:29:71:541:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substances.  An increase in the fraction of income spent on a good raises the absolute value of the 
21:475:40828:29:28:71:404:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uncompensated (money income-constant) price elasticity of demand. 
21:476:40894:28:0:71:509:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Differences in discount rates as a function of age are related to modifications of the 
22:477:40983:0:28:71:506:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rational addiction model by Gruber and K-szegi (2001).  They assume that consumers are 
22:478:41070:28:28:71:529:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forward looking but behave in a time-inconsistent manner because the discount factor that they 
22:479:41165:28:29:71:523:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:apply between the current period and the next one is smaller than the discount factor that they 
22:480:41261:29:28:71:533:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:apply to consecutive future periods.  Consumers still respond to future consumption or prices in 
22:481:41358:28:28:71:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their model, but the scope for government intervention in markets for addictive goods is greater 
22:482:41455:28:29:71:473:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because ignored internal costs are much bigger than in the Becker-Murphy model.   
22:483:41537:29:28:71:193:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.  Empirical Evidence  
22:484:41561:28:28:71:528:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: In this section I summarize empirical evidence that highlights the importance of money 
22:485:41648:28:29:71:527:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price as a determinant of the demand for harmful substances.  Compared to the estimates that I 
22:486:41743:29:28:71:522:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presented in Section 3, this evidence is based on large cross sections, repeat cross sections, or 
22:487:41841:28:28:71:519:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panels.  My review is not meant to be comprehensive or definitive.  Rather, I call attention to 
22:488:41937:28:29:71:496:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies that in my view have generated additional research and to some fairly recent and 
22:489:42026:29:28:71:507:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intriguing new findings.  I begin with studies that obtain price effects in the context of  the 
22:490:42122:28:28:71:528:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Becker-Murphy (1988) rational addiction model and then consider evidence that emerges from 
22:491:42213:28:29:71:325:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research using myopic or conventional approaches.   
22:492:42265:29:28:71:496:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The rational model has been applied successfully to the demand for cigarettes by 
22:493:42346:28:28:71:517:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chaloupka (1991); Keeler et al. (1993); Becker, Grossman, and Murphy  (1994); and Tauras 
22:494:42435:28:29:71:536:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1998).  It also has been applied successfully to the demand for alcohol by Grossman (1993) and 
22:495:42531:29:28:71:528:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) and to the demand for cocaine by Grossman and 
22:496:42621:28:28:71:524:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chaloupka (1998).  All these studies report negative and significant price effects, positive and 
22:497:42718:28:29:71:494:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant past and future consumption effects, and larger long-run than short-run price 
22:498:42808:29:28:71:537:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities.  Typical short-run and long-run price elasticities of demand in these studies are -0.40 
22:499:42910:28:0:71:539:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and -0.75 for cigarettes; -0.41 and -0.65 for alcohol measured by the number of drinks in the past 
23:500:43011:0:28:71:531:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year; -0.79 and -1.00 for alcohol measured by cirrhosis mortality (a standard index of excessive 
23:501:43108:28:28:71:403:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alcohol consumption); and -0.70 and -1.35 for cocaine consumption. 
23:502:43175:28:29:71:538:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Gruber and K-szegi (2001) also present evidence in support of forward-looking behavior 
23:503:43262:29:28:71:513:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by estimating reduced form demand function for cigarette consumption by pregnant women 
23:504:43349:28:28:71:491:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(number of cigarettes smoked per day by these women).  They find that this outcome is 
23:505:43435:28:29:71:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negatively related to the past and future state-specific cigarette excise tax as well as to the current 
23:506:43539:29:28:71:466:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax.  These are the complementary price effects stressed by Becker and Murphy.    
23:507:43621:28:28:71:541:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The studies just mentioned and others contain additional support in favor of the economic 
23:508:43711:28:29:71:520:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach to addictive behavior.  Chaloupka (1991) finds that smoking by the less educated is 
23:509:43804:29:28:71:497:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considerably more responsive to changes in cigarette prices than is smoking by the more 
23:510:43892:28:28:71:542:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:educated; a similar result has been obtained by Townsend (1987) with British data.  Lewit, Coate, 
23:511:43990:28:29:71:542:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Grossman (1981); Lewit and Coate (1982); and Chaloupka and Grossman (1996); Chaloupka 
23:512:44080:29:28:71:533:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Wechsler (1997); Lewit et al. (1997); Evans and Huang (1998); Evans and Farrelly (1998);  
23:513:44174:28:28:71:511:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Harris and Chan (1999); and Gruber and Zinman (2001) report that youths respond more to 
23:514:44262:28:29:71:537:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cigarette prices than adults.  By contrast, the information that began to emerge in the early 1960s 
23:515:44362:29:28:71:530:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about the harmful long-run effects of smoking has had a much greater effect on smoking by the 
23:516:44456:28:28:71:533:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rich and more educated than by the poor and less educated (Farrell and Fuchs 1982 for the U.S.; 
23:517:44552:28:29:71:211:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Townsend 1987 for Britain). 
23:518:44580:29:28:71:535:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: The negative relationship between age and the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 
23:519:44671:28:28:71:536:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth highlighting because it is very robust across a number of studies, and it suggests that price 
23:520:44771:28:29:71:512:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hikes are an extremely effective instrument to discourage youths from beginning to smoke.  
23:521:44862:29:28:71:533:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 5 contains cigarette price elasticities by age from nine studies--two completed in the early 
23:522:44961:28:0:71:498:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1980s and seven completed since 1996.  Both the price elasticity of participation and the 
24:523:45053:0:28:71:502:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unconditional price elasticity (the sum of the price elasticity of participation and the price 
24:524:45148:28:28:71:541:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity of the number of cigarettes smoked conditional on positive smoking) are shown.  While 
24:525:45245:28:29:71:523:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates for a given age group vary from study to study, the negative correlation between the 
24:526:45340:29:28:71:326:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:absolute value of the elasticity and age is striking.15   
24:527:45398:28:28:71:537:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: I have stressed the importance of the negative effect of price on youth participation in the 
24:528:45491:28:29:71:532:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption of harmful substances because changes in participation by youths primarily reflect 
24:529:45586:29:28:71:508:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:start behavior.  At older ages, changes in participation are due mainly to decisions to cease 
24:530:45680:28:28:71:538:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption.  Quits are key outcomes because most of the health effects at issue are reversible.   
24:531:45779:28:29:71:538:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: As predicted by myopic and rational addiction models, Yen and Jones (1996) find that an 
24:532:45867:29:28:71:530:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in peak past cigarette consumption lowers the quit probability in a large representative 
24:533:45965:28:28:71:519:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:survey of British adults.  They are not able to estimate direct price effects because there is no 
24:534:46063:28:29:71:536:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variation in price in their data.  Their results suggest, however, that an increase in past price may 
24:535:46165:29:28:71:163:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cause quits to rise. 
24:536:46186:28:28:71:515:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Douglas (1998) and Colman, Grossman, and Joyce (2003)  provides somewhat more 
24:537:46264:28:29:71:513:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:definitive evidence on the role of price in the decision to stop smoking in U.S. data.  Before 
24:538:46359:29:28:71:498:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considering this evidence, it is worth considering the theoretical determinants of the quit 
24:539:46451:28:28:71:525:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability in period t (qt).  The most straightforward approach is to let this price be a positive 
24:540:46551:28:29:71:386:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function of the change in price between consecutive periods as in 
24:541:46617:29:29:71:520:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:   qt = q1(pt - pt-1).       (2) 
24:542:46641:29:28:71:536:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Addiction considerations aside, Colman, Grossman, and Joyce (2003) show that this approach is 
24:543:46735:28:29:71:526:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not entirely correct because the quit probability can be positive even if the current price equals 
24:544:46834:29:28:71:494:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the past price.  That is because the quit probability is the complement of the conditional 
24:545:46925:28:0:71:530:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of continuing to smoke in period t given that a person smoked in period t-1.  In turn 
25:546:47025:0:28:71:496:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the latter probability is the ratio of the probability of smoking in period t or the smoking 
25:547:47118:28:28:71:535:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation rate in that period at the aggregate level to the smoking participation rate in period  
25:548:47220:28:29:71:518:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:t-1.  An increase in pt and pt-1 by the same amount will have no impact on qt only if the price 
25:549:47316:29:28:71:401:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities of smoking participation in the two periods are the same. 
25:550:47387:28:28:71:534:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Now assume that the two elasticities just mentioned are the same.  The myopic model of 
25:551:47474:28:29:71:522:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addiction would add past consumption (ct-1) to the set of regressors, and the rational model of 
25:552:47570:29:29:71:421:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addiction would add future consumption (ct+1).  The full model becomes 
25:553:47641:29:29:71:520:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:   qt =   q1(pt - pt-1) + q2ct-1 + q3ct+1,     (3) 
25:554:47685:29:29:71:539:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where q2 and q3 are negative.  The reduced form of equation (2) is one in which qt depends on pt, 
25:555:47783:29:28:71:523:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pt-1, and pt+1.  The current and future price effects are positive, while the sign of the past price 
25:556:47884:28:29:71:179:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect is ambiguous.16 
25:557:47906:29:28:71:510:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Douglas (1998) approaches the quit decision in the context of the rational addiction 
25:558:47991:28:28:71:534:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model.  Despite high correlations among the current price, the price next year (future price), and 
25:559:48090:28:29:71:533:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the price last year (past price), Douglas finds positive and significant future price coefficients in 
25:560:48192:29:28:71:527:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:his quit equations.  This indicates that smokers in his sample are forward looking.  The current 
25:561:48289:28:28:71:515:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and past price coefficients are not significant, but Douglas includes the number of cigarettes 
25:562:48384:28:29:71:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoked per day at a peak period in his hazard equations.  Clearly, past price may operate through 
25:563:48482:29:28:71:406:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this variable, suggesting that it should be omitted from the equations. 
25:564:48554:28:28:71:525:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Colman, Grossman, and Joyce (2003) study the effects of  cigarette excise taxes on the 
25:565:48641:28:29:71:518:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision to quit smoking by pregnant women.  This is a particularly important decision since 
25:566:48734:29:28:71:527:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoking by these women accounts for one in five low weight babies and is the most important 
25:567:48826:28:28:71:527:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes.  They have data on smoking three months 
25:568:48918:28:0:71:528:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prior to conception and three months prior to delivery.  Since rarely is there a change in the tax 
26:569:49019:0:28:71:521:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on cigarettes in this brief period, they focus on the current tax effect.  They find that pregnant 
26:570:49118:28:28:71:542:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:women living in states that raised cigarette taxes between 1993 and 1999 were more likely to quit 
26:571:49216:28:29:71:533:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoking once they became pregnant than women residing in other states.  The magnitude of the 
26:572:49309:29:28:71:537:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect at issue is substantial.  If a one cent increase in taxes increases price by one cent, then a 10 
26:573:49413:28:28:71:536:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent increase in price would increase the probability that a pregnant woman quits smoking by 
26:574:49509:28:29:71:529:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:10 percent.  Over one-quarter of the 9 percentage point increase in quit rates that occurred over 
26:575:49607:29:28:71:527:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sample period can be explained by increases in cigarette taxes during that period.  Colman, 
26:576:49703:28:28:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Grossman, and Joyce, estimate that a 30-cent increase in taxes in constant dollars would have the 
26:577:49801:28:29:71:485:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same effect on quit rates as enrolling women in prenatal smoking cessation programs. 
26:578:49886:29:28:71:533:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: As in the case of cigarettes, cocaine consumption by teenagers and young adults appears 
26:579:49974:28:28:71:493:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be more price sensitive than consumption by adults (Grossman and Chaloupka 1998; 
26:580:50058:28:29:71:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chaloupka, Grossman, and Tauras 1999; Saffer and Chaloupka 1999).  These three studies do 
26:581:50148:29:28:71:497:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not consider consumption by the homeless and by prison inmates, who may behave very 
26:582:50232:28:28:71:531:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differently from the population at large.  Recall, however, that I find negative and in most cases 
26:583:50331:28:29:71:542:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant cocaine price effects in the mentions and arrestee regressions in Tables 3 and 4.  
26:584:50425:29:28:71:513:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Marijuana has been the most widely used illicit substance in the U.S. since data first 
26:585:50512:28:28:71:496:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:became available in the early 1970s. Marijuana price elasticity estimates are particularly 
26:586:50603:28:29:71:528:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important in light of the swings in participation documented in Section 2.  Pacula et al. (2001)  
26:587:50701:29:28:71:512:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present a fairly wide range of estimates of marijuana participation price elasticities for high-
26:588:50797:28:28:71:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:school seniors but indicate that a conservative lower-bound figure is -0.30.  Their upper-bound 
26:589:50893:28:29:71:521:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:figure of -0.69 may be too small given the measurement error in price discussed in the study.  
26:590:50988:29:28:71:529:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They also show that the upward trend in price between 1982 and 1992 and the downward trend 
26:591:51079:28:0:71:513:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between 1992 and 1998 can explain at least part of the “1980s marijuana recession” and the 
27:592:51172:0:28:71:171:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“1990s expansion.”  
27:593:51192:28:28:71:511:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Historical data indicate that opium users responded to price during periods when its 
27:594:51277:28:29:71:519:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption was legal.  Van Ours (1995) estimates a short-run price elasticity of demand of  
27:595:51370:29:28:71:518:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:-0.70 and a long-run price elasticity of -1.00 in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) during 
27:596:51465:28:28:71:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Dutch colonial rule, for the years 1922-1938.  Liu, Liu, and Chou (1999) report similar findings 
27:597:51562:28:29:71:520:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a study of the demand for opium in the Japanese Colony of Taiwan during the period from 
27:598:51653:29:28:71:183:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1914 through 1942.      
27:599:51677:28:28:71:502:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Excessive alcohol consumption is perhaps the most common example of a legally 
27:600:51755:28:29:71:520:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addictive good next to cigarette smoking.  The two goods are not, however, linked to adverse 
27:601:51848:29:28:71:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health outcomes and to addiction in the same way. There is overwhelming evidence that smoking 
27:602:51942:28:28:71:525:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has detrimental health effects.  One can usually focus on whether and how much an individual 
27:603:52035:28:29:71:527:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smokes since these measures are highly correlated with the smoking-related costs of interest.17 
27:604:52130:29:28:71:538:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:With alcohol, the situation is more complex.  Unlike cigarettes, many persons regularly consume 
27:605:52226:28:28:71:529:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small quantities of alcohol.  Most individuals who consume alcohol do not harm themselves or 
27:606:52319:28:29:71:540:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:others; indeed, moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to lower the risk of coronary heart 
27:607:52415:29:28:71:537:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disease in men.   Instead, the adverse effects of alcohol spring from the overuse or misuse of this 
27:608:52515:28:28:71:531:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substance.  Examples include cirrhosis of the liver, drunk driving crashes, workplace accidents, 
27:609:52612:28:29:71:506:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:various forms of violent behavior, risky sexual behavior, and failure to complete college.   
27:610:52705:29:28:71:535:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Given the above, the following findings are particularly notable.  The short-run and long-
27:611:52795:28:28:71:519:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:run price elasticities of the number of drinks of alcohol in a panel sample of young adults are 
27:612:52891:28:29:71:517:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substantial, yet are smaller than the corresponding elasticities of cirrhosis mortality in a time 
27:613:52989:29:28:71:530:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series of state cross sections (Grossman, Chaloupka and Sirtalan 1998; Grossman 1993).  Cook 
27:614:53082:28:0:71:536:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Tauchen (1982) report that a $1 increase in the state excise tax on distilled spirits lowers the 
28:615:53185:0:28:71:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age-adjusted cirrhosis mortality rate by approximately the same percentage as it lowers per capita 
28:616:53284:28:28:71:517:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption of distilled spirits.  Using a similar methodology and a time series of countries, 
28:617:53379:28:29:71:519:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Saffer (1991) finds that the price elasticity of cirrhosis mortality is three times larger than the 
28:618:53479:29:28:71:322:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price elasticity of  per capita ethanol consumption.   
28:619:53534:28:28:71:521:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Kenkel (1993) reports large price elasticities for the number of days with five or more 
28:620:53622:28:29:71:475:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drinks in the past year, which is another standard measure of the incidence of heavy 
28:621:53707:29:28:71:525:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption: -0.92 for persons of all ages and -2.24 for youth between the ages of 18 and 21.  
28:622:53802:28:28:71:541:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests that young drinkers, like young smokers and young consumers of cocaine, are quite 
28:623:53898:28:29:71:536:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sensitive to price.  Similar findings using measures of frequent and heavy drinking by youths are 
28:624:53996:29:28:71:501:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:summarized by Grossman et al. (1994).  Kenkel also reports a strong positive association 
28:625:54085:28:28:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the measure of heavy drinking and the reported number of occasions of drunk driving in 
28:626:54180:28:29:71:526:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the past year.  This provides a plausible mechanism for the negative relationship between fatal 
28:627:54276:29:28:71:515:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:motor vehicle crashes (many of which are alcohol related) and the price of alcohol, which is 
28:628:54369:28:28:71:386:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:found in many studies (see Grossman et al. 1994 for a summary). 
28:629:54433:28:29:71:525:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Additional consequences of alcohol overuse or misuse fall as the cost of alcohol rises.  
28:630:54522:29:28:71:510:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These include workplace accidents (Ohsfeldt and Morrisey 1997); violent crime (Cook and 
28:631:54610:28:28:71:529:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moore 1993b); child abuse (Markowitz and Grossman 2000); spouse abuse (Markowitz 2000); 
28:632:54698:28:29:71:504:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suicide (Sloan, Reilly, and Schenzler 1994); failure to complete college (Cook and Moore 
28:633:54787:29:28:71:470:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1993a); and sexually transmitted diseases (Chesson, Harrison, and Kassler 2000).   
28:634:54870:28:28:71:542:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: To give a balanced treatment to the literature on money prices and substance use or abuse, 
28:635:54961:28:29:71:509:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I note that not every study has uncovered a negative price effect.  For example, using cross-
28:636:55054:29:28:71:527:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sectional data from Monitoring the Future for the period 1977 to 1992, Dee (1999) reports that 
28:637:55149:28:0:71:527:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the negative effects of the state excise tax on beer on youth drinking disappear once state fixed 
29:638:55249:0:28:71:522:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects are included as regressors.  These conclusions are not definitive, however.  Grossman, 
29:639:55344:28:28:71:520:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) find only a modest reduction in their estimate of the long-run 
29:640:55438:28:29:71:505:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price elasticity of demand for alcohol (i.e., from -0.65 to -0.54) when controlling for fixed 
29:641:55532:29:28:71:538:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects.  Furthermore, Cook and Moore (2001), who use data on young adults participating in the 
29:642:55628:28:28:71:534:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:National Longitudinal Survey of Youth conducted between 1982-1985 and 1988-1989, find that 
29:643:55719:28:29:71:518:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of the state beer tax on drinking participation and binge drinking actually increases 
29:644:55816:29:28:71:287:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significantly in state fixed-effects models.18  
29:645:55864:28:28:71:533:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: This discrepancy in findings may stem from the fact that the relative stability of the beer 
29:646:55956:28:29:71:512:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax makes it highly correlated with other state indicators (e.g., overall drinking sentiments). 
29:647:56052:29:28:71:530:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Accordingly, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of the beer tax and other state fixed effects. 
29:648:56155:28:28:71:510:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Furthermore, state excise taxes are an imperfect measure of the price of alcohol, and biases 
29:649:56248:28:29:71:535:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resulting from measurement errors are exacerbated in fixed-effects models. Thus, although most 
29:650:56343:29:28:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the empirical literature supports the conclusion that excise tax increases tend to curtail alcohol 
29:651:56445:28:28:71:520:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and heavy drinking by underage youths and young adults, more research on this 
29:652:56535:28:29:71:219:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important issue is necessary.19 
29:653:56566:29:28:71:190:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:6.  Policy Implications  
29:654:56591:28:28:71:514:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Since harmful addictions are sensitive to price, the government can discourage these 
29:655:56676:28:29:71:538:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behaviors by taxation or by bans.  In the United States, Federal and state excise taxes account for 
29:656:56776:29:28:71:541:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approximately 30 percent of the price of cigarettes (40 percent if the 45-cent price increase due to 
29:657:56877:28:28:71:528:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the settlement of the Medicaid lawsuits is treated as a tax) and approximately 20 percent of the 
29:658:56974:28:29:71:512:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price of alcohol.  Cocaine may sell for as much as 10-40 times its free market price (see the 
29:659:57068:29:28:71:515:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies summarized by Miron 2003).  My discussion implies that cigarette smoking, alcohol 
29:660:57158:28:0:71:541:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:abuse, and the consumption of illicit substances would rise substantially if tax rates were lowered 
30:661:57260:0:28:71:506:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or cocaine, marijuana, and heroin were legalized.  But this observation does not justify the 
30:662:57353:28:28:71:538:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current policies.  Revenue considerations aside, taxation of harmful addictions is justified only if 
30:663:57454:28:29:71:524:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are external costs or ignored internal costs associated with these behaviors.  Bans can be 
30:664:57551:29:28:71:518:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:viewed in a similar manner.  Moreover, legalization with taxation is an alternative to bans.  I 
30:665:57647:28:28:71:534:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:illustrate these issues with respect to cigarette and cocaine consumption because alcohol control 
30:666:57745:28:29:71:312:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is discussed in detail by Grossman et al. (1994).    
30:667:57798:29:28:71:534:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Consider the optimal tax on cigarettes.  There is widespread agreement that smoking has 
30:668:57886:28:28:71:537:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the potential to generate external costs because the premiums paid by smokers for health and life 
30:669:57984:28:29:71:487:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insurance do not fully reflect their excess use of medical care services and their higher 
30:670:58074:29:28:71:525:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of death (Manning et al. 1991; Viscusi,1995; Sloan et al. forthcoming).  The lower 
30:671:58169:28:28:71:521:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Social Security and pension payments to smokers who die earlier offset some of these costs.   
30:672:58263:28:29:71:533:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Some parents behave in ways that harm their children's health, and the health of spouses 
30:673:58352:29:28:71:513:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or unrelated persons can be worsened by the actions of smokers.  The best example of these 
30:674:58443:28:28:71:510:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:external costs is the harm done to their fetuses by pregnant women who smoke.  Numerous 
30:675:58531:28:29:71:506:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies show that these women are more likely to miscarry and to give birth to low-weight 
30:676:58621:29:28:71:526:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:infants.  Some of these infants die within the first month of life.  Many more require extensive 
30:677:58718:28:28:71:479:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:neonatal intensive care and suffer long-term impairments to physical and intellectual 
30:678:58804:28:29:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:development.  According to some, maternal smoking during pregnancy should not be treated as a 
30:679:58898:29:28:71:541:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost imposed on one person by another and ignored by the smoker, because pregnant women may 
30:680:58990:28:28:71:522:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:already have taken into account the impacts of their behavior on their infants.  Since they still 
30:681:59088:28:29:71:520:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choose to smoke, the benefits to them outweigh the potential costs.  Others argue that at least 
30:682:59184:29:28:71:536:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some pregnant women who smoke do so because they lack information about the effects of their 
30:683:59277:28:0:71:455:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior or heavily discount the future consequences of their current actions.     
31:684:59362:0:28:71:534:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Similar issues arise in considering the detrimental health effects suffered by nonsmokers 
31:685:59452:28:28:71:537:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from secondhand smoke. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that these effects 
31:686:59545:28:29:71:498:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include annually roughly 3,000 additional lung cancer deaths, between 9,000 and 17,000 
31:687:59632:29:28:71:538:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:additional deaths due to heart disease as well as a host of other respiratory illnesses.  When these 
31:688:59733:28:28:71:520:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects are attributed to the smoking behavior of a spouse, the costs are internal because most 
31:689:59829:28:29:71:529:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economists consider the family as the relevant economic decision making unit.  While children 
31:690:59923:29:28:71:527:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are members of this unit “... they are relatively powerless to affect consumption decisions that 
31:691:60020:28:28:71:514:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may influence their health, especially when they are very young” (Warner et al. 1995: 382).  
31:692:60113:28:29:71:529:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Increases in morbidity and mortality suffered by nonsmokers in the workplace and other public 
31:693:60207:29:28:71:288:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:places clearly are external costs of smoking.  
31:694:60254:28:28:71:500:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: As I indicated above, smoking generates ignored internal costs if consumers have 
31:695:60335:28:29:71:533:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imperfect information about the risks of smoking or behave in a myopic fashion.  In response to 
31:696:60431:29:28:71:528:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the first U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health in 1964, smoking participation 
31:697:60524:28:28:71:517:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates of more educated consumers declined rapidly in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  In this 
31:698:60618:28:29:71:524:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period educated consumers were more likely to quit smoking and less likely to begin than less 
31:699:60712:29:28:71:506:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:educated consumers.  These data imply differential ability to process new information as a 
31:700:60803:28:28:71:538:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function of education and possibly some government action.  It is still true today, after more than 
31:701:60903:28:29:71:542:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thirty years of providing information, that the more educated are less likely to smoke than the less 
31:702:61004:29:28:71:534:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:educated despite the massive antismoking campaign that has been mounted by Federal and state 
31:703:61097:28:28:71:145:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:governments.   
31:704:61112:28:29:71:520:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: It is tempting to attribute the recent data to more future oriented behavior by the more 
31:705:61201:29:28:71:516:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:educated rather than to differences in information.  Indeed, a survey taken by Viscusi (1995) 
31:706:61295:28:0:71:518:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows that both smokers and nonsmokers overestimate, not underestimate, the probability of 
32:707:61388:0:28:71:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:death and illness from lung cancer due to tobacco.  Teenagers, who have less information and are 
32:708:61485:28:28:71:534:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less future oriented than adults, actually attach much higher risks to smoking than the rest of the 
32:709:61585:28:29:71:509:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:population.  Schoenbaum (1997), however, finds that, among current heavy smokers in the 
32:710:61673:29:28:71:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Health and Retirement History Survey, expectations of reaching age 75 were nearly twice as high 
32:711:61769:28:28:71:501:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as actuarial predictions.  Moreover, other risks of cigarette smoking, including the risk of 
32:712:61862:28:29:71:284:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:becoming addicted, may be underestimated. 
32:713:61904:29:28:71:527:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The addiction studies previously summarized suggest that smokers and consumers of 
32:714:61989:28:28:71:493:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other addictive goods are farsighted in the sense that they anticipate the expected future 
32:715:62080:28:29:71:506:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of their current actions.  Consumers who behave in this manner reduce their 
32:716:62169:29:28:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current consumption in response to an increase in future price.  This is exactly what these studies 
32:717:62269:28:28:71:538:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find.  Yet some persons, particularly the young and the poor, may discount the future much more 
32:718:62365:28:29:71:308:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heavily than other segments of the population.     
32:719:62416:29:28:71:500:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: Added complications arise if smokers are forward looking but behave in the time-
32:720:62496:28:28:71:503:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inconsistent manner described by Gruber and K-szegi (2001).  In their model, even if the 
32:721:62585:28:29:71:516:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discount factor that consumers apply to consecutive future periods is reasonable, the smaller 
32:722:62679:29:28:71:523:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discount factor used in comparing the current period and the next one creates the potential for 
32:723:62775:28:28:71:527:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large ignored internal costs.  They then show that the optimal tax may be much higher than the 
32:724:62870:28:29:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one that offsets purely external costs because the tax acts as a self-control mechanism that makes 
32:725:62969:29:28:71:167:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smokers better off.  
32:726:62990:28:28:71:510:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: I have not provided enough information in this paper to compute the optimal tax on 
32:727:63073:28:29:71:541:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cigarettes.  A primary unresolved issue relates to what harmful consequences should be treated as 
32:728:63171:29:28:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:external.  What I can conclude is that permanent increases in price caused by excise tax increases 
32:729:63270:28:0:71:524:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will have substantial effects on the consumption of cigarettes.  These strong price effects have 
33:730:63369:0:28:71:505:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been proven over and over in the literature and should not be ignored in the policy debate. 
33:731:63461:28:28:71:526:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: If cocaine were legal and taxed, many of the factors just discussed would enter into the 
33:732:63550:28:29:71:510:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determination of the optimal tax.  Clearly that is not the case, and the main policy debate is 
33:733:63645:29:28:71:518:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether in fact the consumption of cocaine as well as that of marijuana and heroin should be 
33:734:63738:28:28:71:536:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legalized.20  At first glance, it appears as if I have added “fuel to the fire” of the anti-legalization 
33:735:63843:28:29:71:521:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advocates.  After all, the weight of the empirical evidence is that demand functions for illegal 
33:736:63940:29:28:71:540:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drugs, like demand functions for other goods, slope downward.   Youths and young adults appear 
33:737:64035:28:28:71:530:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be more responsive to price than older adults.  This is troubling since the former groups may 
33:738:64132:28:29:71:521:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discount the future most heavily and may be most susceptible to the type of time-inconsistent 
33:739:64226:29:28:71:326:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior described by Gruber and Köszegi (2001).    
33:740:64278:28:28:71:507:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: There are two factors, however, that add a good deal of “fuel to the fire” of the pro-
33:741:64364:28:29:71:529:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legalization advocates.  The increase in consumption that accompanies legalization depends on 
33:742:64458:29:28:71:538:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the price elasticity of demand and on the magnitude of the price reduction caused by the removal 
33:743:64555:28:28:71:541:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of penalties for production and distribution.  Published studies reviewed by Miron (2003) suggest 
33:744:64653:28:29:71:374:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an extremely large price reduction of between 10- and 40-fold. 
33:745:64716:29:28:107:530:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Miron’s extremely careful and detailed empirical analysis indicates, however, that these 
33:746:64805:28:28:71:528:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates of price reductions due to legalization are overstated.  He compares the markup from 
33:747:64900:28:29:71:491:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raw material (which he terms “farmgate”) to retail for cocaine to such legal products as 
33:748:64989:29:28:71:537:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:chocolate, coffee, tea, beer, spices, tobacco, and potatoes.  While the retail cocaine price is many 
33:749:65090:28:28:71:534:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:times the costs of the raw materials required to produce it, markups also are large for these legal 
33:750:65190:28:29:71:540:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods, although smaller than those for cocaine.  These data suggest that the black market price of 
33:751:65289:29:28:71:529:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cocaine is 2-4 times larger than the price that would prevail if it were legalized.  Miron reaches 
33:752:65388:28:0:71:521:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar conclusions based on the price of cocaine used for legal purposes.  He attributes these 
34:753:65486:0:28:71:517:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results to evasion of costs by black market suppliers.  These costs include taxes on labor and 
34:754:65581:28:28:71:516:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital, costs associated with environmental, safety, health, and labor market regulation, and 
34:755:65676:28:29:71:541:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:costs due to advertising.  The avoidance of these costs by black market suppliers offsets some but 
34:756:65775:29:28:71:507:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not all of the expected penalties imposed by the government on these suppliers.  While the 
34:757:65866:28:28:71:537:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact on price is smaller than suggested by previous analysts, Miron’s estimates still imply that 
34:758:65965:28:29:71:529:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legalization would result in significant reductions in price and, consequently, large increases in 
34:759:66064:29:28:71:138:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cocaine use.   
34:760:66079:28:28:107:508:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A second factor that “throws even more water on the fire” built by anti-legalization 
34:761:66164:28:29:71:512:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advocates is that a regime in which cocaine production and consumption are fully legal, but 
34:762:66256:29:28:71:508:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cocaine use is discouraged by excise taxes on production or consumption has not been and 
34:763:66345:28:28:71:511:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should be evaluated.  Monetary taxes have been considered a poor substitute for a drug war 
34:764:66436:28:29:71:535:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because excise taxes have been assumed to be unable to reduce drug use by as much as a war on 
34:765:66530:29:28:71:502:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drugs.  The argument is that producers could always choose to go “underground” and sell 
34:766:66618:28:28:71:443:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:illegally if a monetary tax made legal prices higher than underground prices.  
34:767:66697:28:29:107:530:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Becker, Murphy, and Grossman (2004) show, however, that the market price of cocaine 
34:768:66781:29:28:71:537:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a monetary excise tax could be greater than the price induced by a war on drugs, even when 
34:769:66877:28:28:71:529:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:producers could ignore the monetary tax and produce illegally underground.  The reason is that 
34:770:66972:28:29:71:536:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the government could allocate resources to preventing production in the illegal market.  In effect 
34:771:67071:29:28:71:529:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it imposes a non-monetary tax in this market whose expected value exceeds the tax in the legal 
34:772:67166:28:28:71:513:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market.  In certain circumstances, they conclude that the threat of imposing a cost on illegal 
34:773:67261:28:29:71:523:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:producers that is above the excise tax if they produce legally is sufficient to discourage illegal 
34:774:67360:29:28:71:522:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production.  Hence the threat does not have to be carried out on a large scale and is much less 
34:775:67456:28:0:71:451:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:costly to implement than a war on drugs in a regime in which drugs are illegal. 
35:776:67538:0:28:107:535:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Excise taxes imposed on producers or consumers of drugs play the same role in a regime 
35:777:67625:28:28:71:535:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which drugs are legal as expected penalties imposed on producers and consumers when drugs 
35:778:67718:28:29:71:515:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are illegal.  Both raise the full price of consumption and reduce the quantity demanded.  But 
35:779:67812:29:28:71:531:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:excise taxes are simply transfers, while penalties and efforts to enforce and evade them use real 
35:780:67910:28:28:71:524:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resources.  Hence social welfare potentially is greater in a regime in which drugs are legal and 
35:781:68007:28:29:71:520:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:taxed.  Tax revenue could be redistributed to the population in a lump sum fashion or used to 
35:782:68101:29:28:71:535:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fund drug treatment and prevention programs.  In the long run legalization might lead to a lower 
35:783:68198:28:28:71:302:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of consumption than the present situation. 
35:784:68247:28:29:107:518:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To address the problem of consumption by youths, legalization and taxation could be 
35:785:68331:29:28:71:532:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:combined with minimum purchase age laws already in place for alcohol and cigarettes.  Even if 
35:786:68425:28:28:71:520:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these laws are partially evaded, the higher money price of cocaine that might characterize the 
35:787:68520:28:29:71:511:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legalization regime might be a very powerful deterrent to youth consumption.  Legalization 
35:788:68611:29:28:71:537:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eliminates the current expected penalty costs imposed on users.  The latter costs are much higher 
35:789:68709:28:28:71:533:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for adults than youths because adults place a higher value on their time than youths and because 
35:790:68806:28:29:71:517:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:youths are much more likely to heavily discount the future effects of their current decisions.  
35:791:68902:29:28:71:527:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence an increase in money price accompanied by the elimination of prison terms, community 
35:792:68993:28:28:71:516:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:service, and the acquisition of a police record for possession would raise the full or effective 
35:793:69090:28:29:71:389:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price of drugs faced by youths even if this price falls for adults.     
35:794:69162:29:28:107:532:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:I have not provided enough evidence to conclude in a definitive manner whether the use 
35:795:69249:28:28:71:495:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of cocaine, marijuana, and other illicit substances should be legalized.  I have, however, 
35:796:69340:28:29:71:514:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highlighted three factors that have been ignored or not emphasized in the debate concerning 
35:797:69432:29:28:71:499:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legalization.  The first is that legalization is likely to have a substantial positive effect on 
35:798:69529:28:0:71:535:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption if prices fall by as much as that suggested by many contributors to the debate.  The 
36:799:69628:0:28:71:508:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second is that these price reductions, while almost certainly sizable, may have been greatly 
36:800:69721:28:28:71:521:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overestimated.  The third is that legalization and taxation--the approach that characterizes the 
36:801:69818:28:29:71:446:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regulation of cigarettes and alcohol--may be better than the current approach.  
36:802:69898:29:28:107:521:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Clearly, more research on the characteristics of the taxation and legalization regime is 
36:803:69987:28:28:71:519:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:required before it can be recommended.  I hope, however, that I have convinced the reader to 
36:804:70080:28:29:71:537:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treat with a significant amount of skepticism propositions such as the demand for illegal drugs is 
36:805:70179:29:28:71:494:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not sensitive to price; tremendous price reductions will occur if drugs are legalized; and 
36:806:70270:28:0:71:339:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legalization and taxation is not a feasible policy option.

45:986:82833:9:33:107:530:331:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:1Nominal cigarette prices are taken from Orzechowski and Walker (2004).  They report 
45:987:82918:33:29:71:520:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the price as of November 1 of calendar year t.  The cigarette smoking participation data that I 
45:988:83014:29:28:71:526:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employ to estimate demand functions in Section 3 pertain to the month of February or March.  
45:989:83107:28:28:71:534:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, the cigarette price series in the figure in year t is the price as of November of year t-1 
45:990:83209:28:29:71:534:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the following adjustments to the nominal price.  Four cents is added to the November 1982 
45:991:83304:29:28:71:510:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nominal price to reflect the eight-cent increase in the Federal tax on a package of cigarettes 
45:992:83399:28:28:71:536:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:January 1, 1983.  Two cents is added to the November 1990 and November 1992 nominal prices 
45:993:83490:28:29:71:529:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to reflect the four-cent increases in the Federal tax on January 1, 1991 and on January 1, 1993.  
45:994:83588:29:28:71:522:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Five cents is added to the November 1999 nominal price to reflect the ten-cent increase in the

46:996:83685:0:14:71:74:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
46:997:83685:14:28:71:515:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Federal tax on January 1, 2000.  Two cents is added to the November 2002 nominal price to 
46:998:83775:28:29:71:530:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reflect the five-cent increase in the Federal tax on January 1, 2003.  Finally, 31.1 cents is added 
46:999:83875:29:28:71:538:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the November 1998 price to reflect the 45-cent increase in the nominal price in late November 
46:1000:83972:28:28:71:541:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1998 due to the settlement of the state lawsuits filed against cigarette makers to recover Medicaid 
46:1001:84072:28:29:71:524:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:funds spent treating diseases related to smoking (the MSA).  The logic of these adjustments is 
46:1002:84167:29:28:71:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that smoking decisions in February or March should depend on the price in the three prior 
46:1003:84257:28:28:71:518:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:months.  Nominal annual beer, wine, and distilled spirits prices are taken from the Bureau of 
46:1004:84351:28:23:71:507:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Labor Statistics home page (www.bls.gov).  The CPI is taken from the same source.           
46:1005:84443:23:34:107:505:473:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:2Following Caulkins (1994) and Grossman and Chaloupka (1998), I computed the 
46:1006:84520:34:28:71:495:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nominal price of one pure gram of cocaine from purchases in STRIDE by regressing the 
46:1007:84605:28:28:71:499:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logarithm of  total purchase cost on the logarithm of weight, the logarithm of purity (as a 
46:1008:84697:28:29:71:523:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage), dichotomous indicators for each year except one, and dichotomous indicators for 
46:1009:84790:29:28:71:517:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each state of the U.S. except one.  The regression employed STRIDE purchases for the years 
46:1010:84881:28:28:71:530:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1974-2003.  I treated purity as endogenous in this regression and used the other variables in the 
46:1011:84979:28:29:71:517:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:total cost equation as instruments.  To identify the model, I constrained the coefficient of the 
46:1012:85076:29:28:71:547:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logarithm of purity to equal the coefficient of the logarithm of weight.  I then computed the price    
46:1013:85179:28:28:71:515:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of one pure gram of cocaine in year t as the antilogarithm of the sum of the intercept and the 
46:1014:85274:28:29:71:516:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient of the relevant year indicator.  I applied the same methodology to obtain nominal 
46:1015:85368:29:28:71:526:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heroin and marijuana prices except that there are no data in STRDE on the purity of marijuana 
46:1016:85462:28:28:71:532:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purchases.  Price trends based on regressions limited to purchases within specific weight ranges 
46:1017:85559:28:29:71:537:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are almost identical to trends based on regressions for all purchases.  For evaluations of STRIDE 
46:1018:85657:29:28:71:519:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data, see Caulkins (2001a), Grogger (2001), Horowitz (2001), Rhodes and Kling (2001), and 
46:1019:85747:28:0:71:74:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
47:1020:85749:0:14:71:74:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
47:1021:85749:14:28:71:527:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Magee (2001).  The main criticism--that there are substantial differences in these prices within 
47:1022:85846:28:29:71:520:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cities at a moment in time--should not have a significant effect on trends.  Moreover, Becker, 
47:1023:85941:29:28:71:536:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Murphy, and Grossman (2004) argue that illegal drugs should be cheaper in poor neighborhoods 
47:1024:86034:28:23:71:468:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because production and distribution are concentrated in these neighborhoods.         
47:1025:86119:23:34:107:516:586:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:C:3Pacula et al. (2001) obtain data on the price and purity of marijuana from the Illegal 
47:1026:86207:34:28:71:520:552:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:Drug Price/Purity Report (IDPPR) published by DEA.  Basov, Jacobson, and Miron (2001a) 
47:1027:86294:28:28:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicate that IDPPR data are derived from STRIDE, but that is not correct.  Instead, purchases on 
47:1028:86392:28:29:71:520:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which IDPPR prices are based are sent to a laboratory at the University of Mississippi, which 
47:1029:86486:29:28:71:531:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distinguishes between commercial purchases and sinsemilla (a more potent grade of marijuana) 
47:1030:86579:28:28:71:541:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and ascertains the delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) potency of each purchase as a percentage.  
47:1031:86676:28:28:71:524:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:I do not use IDPPR data in this paper because it is not available before 1982 or after 2001 and 
47:1032:86772:28:29:71:530:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because it only reports a price range (minimum and maximum price) for commercial marijuana 
47:1033:86863:29:28:71:520:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and sinsemilla in a given year.  Note that prices from IDPRR are fairly highly correlated with 
47:1034:86958:28:28:71:508:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:STRIDE prices for the period from 1982-1998 used by Pacula et al.  Note also that IDPRR 
47:1035:87046:28:23:71:377:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contains marijuana prices for cities that are not in STRIDE.       
47:1036:87113:23:34:107:535:275:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:4The question used to illicit past year alcohol use was changed in 1993.  Measures based 
47:1037:87202:34:28:71:536:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the old and new questions were reported in that year.  I multiplied figures from 1975-1992 by 
47:1038:87299:28:23:71:437:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the ratio of the new figure to the old figure in 1993.  This ratio equals 0.96.  
47:1039:87380:23:34:107:514:190:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:5Recent data from DAWN for the years 1995-2000 differ from previously published 
47:1040:87460:34:28:71:536:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:figures.  To keep each series as consistent as possible, I multiplied the figures for 2001 and 2002 
47:1041:87560:28:29:71:536:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the ratio of the mean of the unrevised to the revised ratio for the 1995-2000 period.  The ratio 
47:1042:87660:29:28:71:340:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is 0.89 for cocaine and marijuana and 0.91 for heroin.    
47:1043:87718:28:0:71:74:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:

48:1045:87720:8:34:107:540:700:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:6The data in Figure 6 are based on the 24 cities that have been in ADAM since 1989.  For 
48:1046:87809:34:29:71:512:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the years 2000-2003, the age range is 15 and over.  In 1995 the threshold for marijuana was 
48:1047:87901:29:28:71:541:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changed from 100 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml.  Percentages based on both thresholds were reported in that 
48:1048:87997:28:28:71:513:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year.  Marijuana percentages for previous years were multiplied by the ratio of the 50 ng/ml 
48:1049:88090:28:23:71:308:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage to the 100 ng/ml percentage in 1995.  
48:1050:88139:23:34:107:523:558:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:7The specification search assumes homoscedasticity and no serial correlation.  But the 
48:1051:88226:34:23:71:464:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Newey-West standard errors are very similar to the uncorrected standard errors.    
48:1052:88309:23:34:107:521:501:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:8Price lags do not generate missing data because my STRIDE file begins in 1974, and 
48:1053:88393:34:22:71:516:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alcohol and cigarette prices for 1974 are available from the sources mentioned in Section 2.  
48:1054:88487:22:34:107:536:445:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:9A few states had two legal drinking ages for beer, one for beer containing 3.2 percent or 
48:1055:88578:34:28:71:521:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less alcohol by weight and a second and higher one for beer containing more than 3.2 percent 
48:1056:88671:28:23:71:373:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alcohol by weight.  These two measures are highly correlated.  
48:1057:88734:23:34:107:538:360:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:10All predictions in this section are computed by multiplying the regression coefficient of 
48:1058:88826:34:28:71:507:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the real price by the actual change in price.  They are not obtained by multiplying the price 
48:1059:88920:28:29:71:532:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity by the percentage change in price.  Give the linear specification of the price effect, the 
48:1060:89022:29:23:71:335:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:former procedure clearly is the correct one to employ.  
48:1061:89078:23:28:107:472:246:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:11Between 1990 and 1992, there was almost no change in the drinking age.  
48:1062:89152:28:34:107:533:218:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:12The price reductions just cited pertain to the lagged price, which is the regressor in the 
48:1063:89245:34:23:71:166:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand functions.  
48:1064:89264:23:33:107:526:161:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:13Using city-specific DUF data for the years 1987-1991 and DAWN time series for the 
48:1065:89348:33:29:71:511:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years 1978-1996, Caulkins (1996, 2001b) obtains negative price effects for the cocaine and

49:1069:89535:28:23:71:209:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not control for time trends.   
49:1070:89566:23:34:107:536:643:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:14I abstract from indirect costs associated with time required to make purchases and with 
49:1071:89656:34:23:71:271:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected penalties for conviction of use.  
49:1072:89699:23:34:107:522:586:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:15DeCicca, Kenkel, and Mathios (2002) fail to find negative price effects in a study of 
49:1073:89787:34:28:71:488:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoking initiation by teenagers.  This result emerges, however, only after they include 
49:1074:89875:28:28:71:535:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dichotomous variables for each state of the U.S. in a panel that spans a very short four-year time 
49:1075:89974:28:29:71:523:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period.  It is plausible that there is not enough price variation in the data to estimate a demand 
49:1076:90073:29:28:71:527:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function once state dummies are included as regressors in a sample that spans only four years.  
49:1077:90169:28:28:71:533:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Glied (2002) finds that initiation of smoking by people in their mid to late twenties is positively 
49:1078:90269:28:28:71:536:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:related to the state excise tax faced by these people at age fourteen and argues that this finding is 
49:1079:90371:28:29:71:525:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inconsistent with economic theory.  This is a puzzling conclusion because the decision to start 
49:1080:90467:29:28:71:533:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smoking should depend on changes in price between periods.  Hence with the current price held 
49:1081:90561:28:23:71:392:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant, initiation should be positively related to the past price.     
49:1082:90634:23:34:107:542:303:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:16The ambiguous sign of the past price effect can explain Glied’s (2002) insignificant past 
49:1083:90726:34:23:71:270:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tax effect in her estimated quit equation.  
49:1084:90770:23:33:107:525:246:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:17Some debate exists with regard to this proposition.  Evans and Farrelly (1998) report 
49:1085:90858:33:29:71:525:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that cigarette excise tax hikes lead smokers to shift to higher tar and nicotine cigarettes.  Their 
49:1086:90958:29:28:71:516:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated effects are so large that many of the health benefits generated by reduced smoking 
49:1087:91051:28:28:71:542:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation are eliminated.  On the other hand, Moore (1996) finds that state cigarette excise tax 
49:1088:91152:28:29:71:522:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases lead to decreases in mortality due to heart disease, cancer, and asthma and that a ten 
49:1089:91249:29:28:71:344:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent tax hike would save over 5,000 lives per year.     
49:1090:91308:28:0:71:74:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
50:1091:91310:0:8:71:74:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
50:1092:91310:8:34:107:515:700:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:18In their study of the demand for cocaine, Grossman and Chaloupka (1998) report a 
50:1093:91393:34:23:71:538:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduction in the long-run price elasticity from -1.35 to -0.67 when they control for fixed effects.   
50:1094:91495:23:34:107:541:643:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:19I do not address the issue of whether cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs are substitutes 
50:1095:91590:34:28:71:538:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or complements in this review.  Grossman, Chaloupka, and Shim (2002) summarize a number of 
50:1096:91681:28:29:71:521:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies that contain the tentative conclusion that these substances are complements.  Thus, an 
50:1097:91776:29:28:71:485:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the price of one harmful substance is reinforcing in the sense that it causes 
50:1098:91866:28:28:71:506:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption of that substance and others to fall.   I also do not discuss the effects of other 
50:1099:91961:28:29:71:527:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:components of the total price of a harmful substance on consumption and consequences in any 
50:1100:92053:29:28:71:500:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:detail.  For reviews of the evidence of these effects, see Grossman (2001) and Grossman, 
50:1101:92142:28:23:71:222:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chaloupka, and Shim (2002).   
50:1102:92172:23:33:107:539:416:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:20Much of the following discussion is relevant to marijuana, heroin, and other legal drugs 
50:1103:92263:33:29:71:506:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as well as to cocaine.  It is based on material on  the same in issue contained in Grossman, 
50:1104:92356:29:0:71:219:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chaloupka, and Shim (2002).
