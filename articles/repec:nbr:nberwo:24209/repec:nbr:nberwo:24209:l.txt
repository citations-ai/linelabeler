2:31:1579:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  test  the  long-standing  hypothesis  that  ethnic  groups  that  are  organized  around  `segmentary 
2:32:1685:14:28:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:lineages' are  more  prone  to  conflict  and  civil  war.  Ethnographic  accounts  suggest  that  in 
2:33:1893:28:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:individuals  are  obligated to  come  to  the  defense  of  fellow  lineage  members  when  they  become 
2:34:1997:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:involved  in  conflicts.  As  a  consequence, small  disagreements  often  escalate  to  larger-scale 
2:35:2098:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:conflicts  involving  many  individuals.  We  test  for this  link  between  segmentary  lineage  and 
2:36:2199:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:conflict  across  145  African  ethnic  groups  in  sub-Saharan Africa.  Using  a  number  of  estimation 
2:37:2304:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:strategies, including an RD design at ethnic boundaries, we find that segmentary lineage societies 
2:38:2402:14:28:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:experience  more  conflicts  and  ones  that  are  longer  in  duration  and larger  in  scale.  We  also  find 
2:39:2617:28:28:72:346:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:Africa is only found within segmentary lineage societies.

3:61:3110:0:34:70:154:724:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:C:1.  Introduction
3:62:3126:34:22:70:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Civil wars are a common feature of the modern world. In2013, there were34ongoing civil wars,
3:63:3218:22:22:70:541:668:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:18in Asia and the Middle East,14in Africa and2in the Americas.1Some of these wars have been
3:64:3309:22:22:70:541:646:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:very protracted. An example is the conflict between the Lord’s Resistance Army and the Ugandan
3:65:3403:22:22:70:541:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:state, which can be traced back to1987or the civil war in Mindanao, the southern island of the
3:66:3497:22:21:70:541:602:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Philippines,  which  has  been ongoing  since  the  late1960s  (Allen  and  Vlassenroot,2010).  These
3:67:3598:21:22:70:541:581:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:wars  cause  a  great  deal  of  damage  and  loss  of  human  life.   In2013alone,  an  estimated70,451
3:68:3702:22:22:70:541:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:people died fighting in civil wars and10.7million civilians were newly displaced, resulting in a
3:69:3798:22:22:70:380:537:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:total stock of33million people being displaced due to conflict.2
3:70:3862:22:22:85:541:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In  this  paper,  we  test  a  long-standing  hypothesis  from  the  field  of  anthropology  about  the
3:71:3966:22:22:70:541:493:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relationship  between  conflict  and  the  kinship  structure  of  a  society,  namely  whether  an  ethnic
3:72:4073:22:22:70:541:471:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group is organized into segmentary lineages.  Although in Western cultures, the central kinship
3:73:4168:22:22:70:541:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unit  is  the  nuclear  family,  in  most  of  the  world  people  live  within  much  more  complex  social
3:74:4276:22:22:70:541:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structures, connected by extended kin networks. Segmentary lineage is one such social structure.
3:75:4372:22:22:70:541:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The first defining characteristic of this organizational form is unilineal descent, where people trace
3:76:4474:22:22:70:541:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their  ancestry  back  either  through  either  the  male  line  (patrilineal)  or  female  line  (matrilineal),
3:77:4586:22:22:70:541:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:but not both. Typically, ancestry is traced back to a common, often mythical, founder, after whom
3:78:4683:22:22:70:541:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the tribe or society is named.  Examples areSamaleandOrmawho are the common ancestors of
3:79:4771:22:21:70:541:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Somali and Oromo (Ahmed,2013b, p.20).  The second feature is the presence of sub-sets or
3:80:4863:21:22:70:540:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segments of a full lineage, which function as coherent autonomous groups (Smith,1956, pp.39–
3:81:4955:22:22:70:541:274:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:40). The lineage segments take a ‘corporate form,’ meaning that they are important for organizing
3:82:5052:22:22:70:541:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a range of activities and functions that are political, judicial, and administrative in nature (Fortes,
3:83:5155:22:22:70:103:230:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:C:1953).3
3:84:5162:22:22:85:541:208:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Figure1displays a hypothetical patrilineal segmentary lineage system. In the figure, triangles
3:85:5256:22:22:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:indicate  men  and  the  straight  lines  indicate  descent,  with  each  row  of  triangles  indicating  a
3:86:5363:22:22:70:541:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:generation. All individuals in the figure descend from a common ancestor indicated by “I.” Also
3:87:5458:22:19:70:541:142:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shown in the figure are various segments of the full lineage.  The segments are of different sizes:
3:88:5557:19:13:83:488:123:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:1These figures are based on the authors’ calculations using the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset.
3:89:5654:13:13:83:516:110:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:2These figures are from the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset and the UNHCR Statistical Yearbook,2013.
3:90:5757:13:14:83:541:97:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:3As  described  by  Fortes  (1953,  p.26):  “the  individual  has  no  legal  or  political  status  except  as  a  member  of  a
3:91:5886:14:11:70:541:83:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:lineage;. . . all legal and political relations in the society take place in the context of the lineage system. . . all the members
3:92:6017:11:11:70:541:72:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of a lineage are to outsiders jurally equal and represent the lineage when they exercise legal and political rights and
3:93:6136:11:0:70:416:61:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:duties in relation to society at large. This is what underlies. . . collective responsibility.”

4:106:6432:47:22:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The smallest is the “Minimal Segment,” the next larger is the “Minor Segment,” and the largest
4:107:6526:22:22:70:187:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is the “Major Segment.”
4:108:6549:22:22:85:541:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Although  it  is  true  that,  from  a  biological  perspective,  decent  is  universal  among  human
4:109:6650:22:21:70:541:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:societies, in terms of social significance, descent varies significantly.  For example, not all groups
4:110:6752:21:22:70:541:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:trace  descent  through  unilineal  lineages.   Another  common  kinship  form  is  cognatic  descent
4:111:6853:22:22:70:541:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where individuals can simultaneously belong to two sets of groups and trace their lineage through
4:112:6950:22:22:70:541:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:either their mother’s relatives, father’s relatives, or both. Many small-scale societies, for example,
4:113:7052:22:22:70:541:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hunter-gatherer groups such as the Hadza or San, have no established elaborate kinship system
4:114:7145:22:22:70:541:190:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at all.  In addition, the importance placed on a society’s kinship system, as well as the associated
4:115:7245:22:22:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:responsibilities and obligations, also vary widely.  Unlike in a segmentary lineage society, where
4:116:7343:22:22:70:541:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  and  kinship  are  of  the  utmost  importance,  in  many  societies,  local  residence  functions
4:117:7450:22:22:70:541:124:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as a primary source of identity, even though this clearly mixes together individuals who are not
4:118:7546:22:22:70:541:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:genetically related.  In other societies, completely different types of social structures, such as age
4:119:7648:22:22:70:541:80:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sets  and  age  grades,  provide  the  main  way  of  organizing  societies,  both  administratively  and
4:120:7753:22:0:70:120:58:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:politically.
5:121:7766:0:22:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A  number  of  scholars  in  the  anthropology  literature  have  hypothesized  that  there  is  a  rela-
5:122:7871:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tionship between the social structure of groups and the prevalence of violence and conflict. More
5:123:7968:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specifically,  it  is  argued  that  segmentary  lineage  societies  are  more  prone  to  become  engaged
5:124:8074:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  more  conflicts,  and  in  ones  that  are  longer  in  duration  and  larger  in  scale,  than  societies
5:125:8184:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:without a segmentary lineage structure.  This is not because segmentary lineage societies harbor
5:126:8280:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:particular grievances, but because the social structure is designed to mobilize combatants when a
5:127:8377:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dispute or conflict occurs.  To see why this is the case, consider Figure1.  An important aspect of
5:128:8476:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage societies is that lineages and segments, and one’s responsibility to them, are of
5:129:8576:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the utmost importance. In the figure, if individual “i” were to have a dispute with individual “ix”
5:130:8675:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:within a segmentary lineage system,  this would mean that all individuals belonging to “Major
5:131:8768:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Segment  A”  would  be  allied  with,  and  come  to  the  defense  of,  individual  “i.”   Similarly,  all
5:132:8875:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals in “Major Segment B” would be allied with and come to the defense of individual
5:133:8966:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“ix.”  Thus, a dispute between two individuals immediately escalates into a dispute between two
5:134:9061:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:large  communities.   Outside  of  segmentary  lineage  systems,  these  allegiances  do  not  exist  and
5:135:9166:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the dispute might comprise,  at most,  a small number of friends or family members of the two
5:136:9259:22:22:70:185:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:involved in the dispute.
5:137:9283:22:22:85:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:More generally, the number of individuals involved in a conflict depends on the genealogical
5:138:9375:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distance of those involved in the dispute. Because of one’s membership in a set of nested segments
5:139:9473:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the strong obligations to one’s kinsmen within the segments, in segmentary lineage societies,
5:140:9570:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small-scale  disputes  can  easily  escalate  into  larger-scale,  sustained  fighting  or  even  full-blown
5:141:9678:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:warfare.  In the modern context, and particularly in Africa, the region of our study, conflict often
5:142:9778:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:takes the form of civil conflict, where the external enemy is the government. However, even in this
5:143:9877:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:context, the same characteristics of segmentary lineage societies are still relevant.  The structure
5:144:9977:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allows segments to effectively mobilize against the common enemy, which in the setting of civil
5:145:10072:22:22:70:182:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:war is the government.
5:146:10094:22:22:85:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This  characteristic  of  segmentary  lineage  systems  has  been  well-studied  by  anthropologists.
5:147:10195:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For  example,  Sahlins  (1961,  pp.323,333)  argues  that  “segmentary  lineage  organization  is  a
5:148:10295:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:successful  predatory  organization  in  conflicts  with  other  tribes. . . [Conflict],  even  if  it  has  been
5:149:10408:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:initiated by a small lineage segment, it pits ‘all of us’ against ‘them’." Along similar lines, Evans-
5:150:10510:22:22:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Pritchard  (1940a,  p.142)  describes  the  organization  of  the  Nuer,  a  segmentary  lineage  group:
5:151:10614:22:0:70:541:66:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“Each segment is itself segmented and there is opposition between its parts. The members of any
6:152:10710:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segment unite for war against adjacent segments of the same order and unite with these adjacent
6:153:10805:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segments against larger sections.”  The logic is also illustrated by a traditional Bedouin proverb
6:154:10903:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that is roughly translated as:  “I against my brothers; my brothers and I against my cousins; my
6:155:10999:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cousins, my brothers, and I against the world.” (e.g., Barth,1973, p.13; Combs-Schilling,1985, p.
6:156:11096:22:22:70:93:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:660).
6:157:11101:22:22:85:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In  this  study,  we  take  this  long-standing  hypothesis  to  the  data  and  test  for  a  relationship
6:158:11208:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between the presence of segmentary lineage organization and conflict today. There are a number
6:159:11302:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of benefits to moving beyond the case study evidence.  First, it is unclear whether the cases that
6:160:11400:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have  been  examined  in  the  anthropology  literature  are  a  representative  sample  of  all  possible
6:161:11506:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cases.    Our  empirical  strategy  has  the  advantage  of  being  able  to  estimate  an  average  effect
6:162:11613:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across ethnicities in our sample.  Second, it is possible that segmentary lineages, exactly because
6:163:11712:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they  escalate  the  scale  of  conflict  if  it  starts,  prevent  wars  from  occurring.   In  other  words,  in
6:164:11826:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:theory,  segmentary  lineage  societies  may  escalate  conflicts  if  they  start,  but  also  prevent  them
6:165:11935:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from starting in the first place.  The case-study literature provides no evidence of this.  However,
6:166:12035:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a  lack  of  evidence  for  this  channel  is  not  the  same  as  evidence  against  such  a  channel.   Our
6:167:12144:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:empirical analysis allows us to estimate the separate effects of segmentary lineage organization
6:168:12240:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and conflict onset and on conflict escalation.  Third, the ethnographic studies are primarily from
6:169:12338:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:before the1970s and so it is possible that the strength of segmentary lineage organization, and the
6:170:12437:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:obligations that go with it, have weakened in recent decades. Although, there are many examples
6:171:12532:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of segmentary lineages between important for recruitment in modern conflicts (e.g., Sterns,2013),
6:172:12629:22:22:70:449:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our findings will provide systematic evidence that is relevant to this question.
6:173:12709:22:21:85:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Information  on  the  presence  of  segmentary  lineage  systems  is  not  available  from  standard
6:174:12809:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ethnographic sources such as theEthnographic Atlasor theStandard Cross-Cultural Sample.  There-
6:175:12904:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fore, we collected data using previously published ethnographies.  The primary source used was
6:176:12998:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:theEthnographic Survey of Africa, which is a series of studies, produced from the1940s until the
6:177:13094:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:1970s and edited by Daryll Forde. Following the definition of Middleton and Tait (1958), we define
6:178:13192:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an  ethnic  group  as  having  a  segmentary  lineage  organization  if:  (1)  there  is  a  recognized  and
6:179:13300:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:known unilineal descent system; (2) segments of the lineage take a ‘corporate form’, meaning that
6:180:13397:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they are sub-units that are important and affect administrative functions and political positions.;
6:181:13496:22:22:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and (3) lineages and genealogical relationships influence one’s location of residence.  We code an
6:182:13594:22:0:70:541:66:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ethnicity as not having a segmentary lineage organization if any of these three characteristics are
7:183:13694:0:22:70:191:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:known to not be present.
7:184:13718:22:22:85:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We restricted our data collection to ethnic groups from Africa. This was done for two reasons.
7:185:13812:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:First, the ethnographic data are most readily available from comparable and systematically doc-
7:186:13907:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:umented sources for groups within Africa. Second, and probably most important, the geo-coded
7:187:13999:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:micro-level conflict data that we use (described below) is only available for Africa.  In the end,
7:188:14097:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  are  able  to  definitively  categorize145African  ethnic  groups,74of  which  are  segmentary
7:189:14195:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  societies  and71of  which  are  not.   Although  we  are  unable  to  construct  measures  for
7:190:14298:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:every  ethnic  group  within  Africa,  our  sample  is  sizeable,  comprising  an  estimated212million
7:191:14400:22:21:70:412:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:people or approximately 38% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa.
7:192:14468:21:22:85:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  use  conflict  data  from  the  Armed  Conflict  Location  and  Event  Data  Project  (ACLED),  a
7:193:14569:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:geo-coded  data  set  that  catalogs  information  about  each  conflict  event  in  Africa  from  January
7:194:14675:22:22:70:540:483:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:1,1997to  December31,2014.   The  database  includes  information  on  the  location,  date,  and
7:195:14772:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:other characteristics of “politically violent events.”4To link the conflict data with the data on the
7:196:14873:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage structure of each ethnic group,  we use the digitized map of the traditional locations of
7:197:14970:22:22:70:540:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ethnic groups from Murdock (1959) to calculate the frequency of conflicts that occur within the
7:198:15065:22:22:70:221:395:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:territory of each ethnic group.5
7:199:15097:22:22:85:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  empirical  analysis  comprises  two  estimation  strategies.The  first  is  to  estimate  the
7:200:15195:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cross-ethnicity relationship between the traditional presence of a segmentary lineage organization
7:201:15293:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the prevalence of conflicts from1997–2014.  Our estimates show a positive and statistically
7:202:15388:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant relationship between segmentary lineage and a range of conflict measures, including
7:203:15483:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict  incidence,  duration,  and  fatalities.   In  addition,  we  also  examine  conflicts  of  different
7:204:15593:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:types – namely, civil conflicts, non-civil conflicts, and localized within-group conflicts.  We find
7:205:15693:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  that  segmentary  lineage  experience  more  of  each  type  of  conflict.   In  addition,  to  being
7:206:15800:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statistically  significant,  the  estimated  effects  are  also  quantitatively  meaningful.   For  example,
7:207:15908:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:according to our estimates, segmentary lineage societies experienced approximately 100% more
7:208:16000:22:22:70:431:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:deadly conflict incidents relative to societies without segmentary lineages.
7:209:16076:22:20:85:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  find  that  these  relationships  are  robust  to  controlling  for  a  large  number  of  covariates,
7:210:16182:20:14:83:541:134:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:4Civil  conflicts  (i.e.,  conflicts  between  the  government  military  and  other  non-government  groups)  account  for
7:211:16305:14:11:70:541:120:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:39.4% of the117,823events in their database, while the other60.6% are non-civil-conflict events that do not involve the
7:212:16424:11:9:70:154:109:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:government military.
7:213:16444:9:15:83:541:100:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:5The strategy of using location to link conflicts to ethnic groups follows the methodology of Michalopoulos and
7:214:16555:15:10:70:540:85:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:Papaioannou (2016).  Prior to this, the same methodology was also used to estimate average incomes of ethnic groups
7:215:16670:10:0:70:469:75:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:(e.g., Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,2013,2014, Alesina, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,2016).
8:216:16764:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:including:  country fixed effects, historical covariates (namely, political centralization and histor-
8:217:16866:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ical  development  as  measured  by  settlement  complexity),  and  a  host  of  geographic  covariates
8:218:16969:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(agricultural  suitability,  altitude,  distance  from  the  equator,  amount  of  land  inhabited  by  the
8:219:17076:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ethnic group, distance from the center of an ethnic group to the nearest country border, and an
8:220:17171:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:indicator for the ethnic group being split by a national border). The estimates of interest are very
8:221:17271:22:22:70:343:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:similar whether or not we condition on these covariates.
8:222:17327:22:22:85:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The conditional correlations potentially suffer from the standard inference issues that plague
8:223:17421:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cross-sectional  estimates,  namely  the  presence  of  omitted  factors,  particularly  those  that  are
8:224:17526:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobservable  to  the  researcher.   Given  this,  we  implement  a  second  set  of  estimates  that  at-
8:225:17632:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tempt  to  address  the  presence  of  omitted  factors  that  may  bias  our  estimates.   We  first  restrict
8:226:17743:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:attention to pairs of ethnic groups that share a border and where one has a segmentary lineage
8:227:17837:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization  and  the  other  does  not.   In  our  sample,  there  are68such  pairs.   We  then  take
8:228:17940:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:10km-by-10km grid-cells to be the unit of observation and implement a regression discontinuity
8:229:18034:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(RD) identification strategy, where we estimate the effect of segmentary lineage organization on
8:230:18130:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict across grid-cells that are restricted to be sufficiently close to the border, while controlling
8:231:18234:22:22:70:260:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for two-dimensional running variables.
8:232:18272:22:22:85:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We find that the RD estimates are qualitatively identical to our OLS estimates.  The estimated
8:233:18366:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relationships  between  segmentary  lineage  organization  and  conflict  are  all  positive  and  highly
8:234:18471:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant.   These  findings  hold  for  each  of  our  measures  of  conflict,  for  a  range  of  different
8:235:18582:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bandwidths,  and  for  a  number  of  different  specifications  that  control  for  the  two-dimensional
8:236:18687:22:22:70:158:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:running variables.
8:237:18705:22:21:85:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The benefit of the RD estimates over the OLS estimates is that omitted factors, even those that
8:238:18800:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are  unobservable,  are  better  accounted  for.   As  long  as  the  omitted  factors  vary  smoothly  over
8:239:18908:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:space – for example, because physically close units have similar geography, climate, and history –
8:240:19006:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they will be taken into account by the RD estimation strategy. However, the strategy is ineffective
8:241:19105:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:if the omitted factors also vary discontinuously at the border. In other words, there may be other
8:242:19203:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differences between the ethnic groups besides the presence of segmentary lineages and the RD
8:243:19295:22:22:70:327:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates may be capturing these differences as well.
8:244:19348:22:22:85:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To explore the potential importance of this issue, we first check average differences in observ-
8:245:19444:22:22:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:able characteristics between societies with and without segmentary lineages. We find that the two
8:246:19541:22:0:70:541:66:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups are balanced on a wide variety of observable covariates.  This finding is consistent with
9:247:19638:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:arguments suggesting that the presence of segmentary lineage societies is not correlated with a
9:248:19733:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:large set of structural factors, but is an idiosyncratic process (Evans-Pritchard and Fortes,1940,
9:249:19831:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Smith,1956, Salzman,1978, Kelly,1983).  Second, we conduct a series of placebo tests where we
9:250:19924:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:classify ethnic groups as either treatment or control based on a range of alternative ethnicity-level
9:251:20025:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics.   We  then  use  our  RD  specification  to  estimate  any  treatment  effects  for  these
9:252:20132:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative  characteristics.   To  make  sure  that  any  observed  effect  is  not  driven  by  segmentary
9:253:20240:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage organization, for the placebo checks, we focus the comparison on ethnicity pairs with the
9:254:20337:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same segmentary lineage classification. Reassuringly, we find no statistically significant effects of
9:255:20438:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these other characteristics on conflict.  Importantly, the point estimates are not only statistically
9:256:20539:21:22:70:272:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:insignificant but also small in magnitude.
9:257:20581:22:22:85:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One of the conditions that is necessary for the validity of the RD estimates is that we correctly
9:258:20678:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identify  the  location  of  ethnic  boundaries.   We  check  whether  this  is  satisfied  using  data  from
9:259:20787:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the third round of the Afrobarometer surveys on the location and ethnicity of over5,500respon-
9:260:20881:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dents.   The  RD  estimate,  with  self-reported  ethnicity  as  the  outcome  variable,  shows  a  sharp
9:261:20986:22:22:70:534:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discontinuity at ethnicity borders. This provides confidence in the validity of our RD estimates.
9:262:21083:22:22:85:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  primary  mechanism  explaining  the  estimated  relationship  between  segmentary  lineage
9:263:21178:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:societies and conflict is the strong in-group allegiances and segmented structure that can cause
9:264:21274:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:initially-small  disputes  to  escalate  into  larger-scale  conflicts.   In  addition,  given  these  effects,
9:265:21385:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary  lineage  organization  could,  in  theory,  actually  result  in  fewer  conflicts.   It  may  be
9:266:21494:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  conflicts  tend  to  be  larger  in  scale  and  duration  if  they  occur,  but  are  less  likely  to  occur.
9:267:21611:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We explore these and related issues by separately estimating the effects of segmentary lineage on
9:268:21708:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the onset of new conflicts and on the duration (i.e., offset) of existing conflicts.  Estimating these
9:269:21810:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two mechanisms using a set of hazard models, we find that the presence of a segmentary lineage
9:270:21904:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization  increases  the  duration  of  conflicts.   This  effect  is  large  in  magnitude  and  highly
9:271:22012:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant.  Turning to conflict onset, we find that segmentary lineage also has a positive effect,
9:272:22112:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:although it is smaller in magnitude and less precisely estimated.  Thus, there is no evidence that
9:273:22210:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization, through its escalation effects, prevents conflicts from occurring
9:274:22308:22:22:70:151:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the first place.
9:275:22327:22:22:85:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As an alternative method to examine the escalation effect of segmentary lineages, we estimate
9:276:22420:22:22:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  relationship  between  a  segmentary  lineage  organization  and  the  frequency  of  conflicts  of
9:277:22524:22:0:70:541:66:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:different  sizes,  namely  conflicts  with:   no  fatalities,1–10fatalities,11–100fatalities,  and  more
10:278:22629:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than100fatalities.  We find that although segmentary lineage organization is associated with a
10:279:22723:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:greater  probability  of  conflicts  of  all  types,  the  estimated  relationship  is  significantly  stronger,
10:280:22835:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance, the larger the conflict.  In addition, these
10:281:22936:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differences are large. For example, we find that while segmentary lineage societies have59% more
10:282:23032:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts with zero fatalities, they have183% more conflicts with over100fatalities. These findings
10:283:23131:22:22:70:518:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are consistent with segmentary lineages working, in part, through an escalation mechanism.
10:284:23221:22:22:85:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  final  empirical  exercise  that  we  undertake  is  motivated  by  the  existing  evidence  of  the
10:285:23326:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relationship  between  adverse  rainfall  shocks  and  civil  conflict  within  sub-Saharan  Africa  (e.g.,
10:286:23433:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Miguel,  Satyanath  and  Saiegh,2004).   We  test  whether  the  effect  of  adverse  rainfall  shocks  on
10:287:23539:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict is different for segmentary lineage societies.  We find greater effects of rainfall shocks on
10:288:23641:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts for segmentary lineage ethnicities.  In fact, we find that the average relationship across
10:289:23741:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:all ethnicities in our sample is driven solely by segmentary lineage societies.  For ethnic groups
10:290:23839:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:without segmentary lineage organization, the relationship between adverse rainfall and conflict
10:291:23934:22:22:70:478:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is not statistically different from zero, and if anything, negative rather than positive.
10:292:24023:22:22:85:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  findings  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  incidence,  intensity,  and  duration
10:293:24126:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of conflict in developing countries.6This literature has proposed various types of explanations,
10:294:24222:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:many  based  on  the  dichotomy  between  ‘greed’  and  ‘grievance’  (Collier  and  Sambanis,2005).
10:295:24321:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Greed factors influence whether or not individuals or groups decide to engage in civil war. These
10:296:24418:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:include  things  like  the  presence  of  ‘lootable  wealth,’  such  as  oil  or  diamonds  (Weinstein,2006,
10:297:24526:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Ross,2004,2006), or foreign aid (De Ree and Nillesen,2009, Nunn and Qian,2014, Crost, Felter
10:298:24618:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Johnston,2014). On the grievance side, conflict could be induced by inequality within society

10:301:24901:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Papaioannou,2016),  the lack of political accountability and democracy (Gleditsch and Ruggeri,
10:302:24995:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:2010)  or  other  types  of  exploitative  institutions  (Richards,1996,  Wood,2003).   Also  potentially
10:303:25100:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important  are  factors  that  influence  the  opportunity  cost  of  engaging  in  conflict  (Miguel  et  al.,

10:305:25300:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:recurrent theme in the literature is that conflict – namely, civil conflict – occurs as a consequence
10:306:25401:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of state weakness, as proxied by real per capita GDP (Fearon and Laitin,2003) or measured more
10:307:25495:22:19:70:312:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:directly by state history (Depetris-Chauvin,2014).

11:309:25613:0:22:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our findings also contribute to a well-established anthropological literature that, through case
11:310:25709:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:studies, has hypothesized and documented the effects that segmentary lineage structures have on
11:311:25804:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict (e.g., Evans-Pritchard,1940a,b, Bohannon,1958, Kelly,1985, Lewis,1994,1989, Salzman,
11:312:25897:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:2007, Zeman,2009, Stearns,2013, Ahmed,2013b, Hoehne,2015). While the studies recognize that
11:313:25988:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization can potentially affect all types of conflict, their focus tends to be
11:314:26089:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the effects that segmentary lineages have on smaller-scale within-ethnicity conflict, whether it
11:315:26188:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be individuals from the same village against one another or individuals from separate villages
11:316:26282:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:against one another.  Our estimates test for this directly by examining the effects of segmentary
11:317:26379:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage organization on localized within-group conflicts, as well as extending this line of inquiry
11:318:26478:21:22:70:455:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and asking whether the same mechanisms are also important for civil conflicts.
11:319:26556:22:22:85:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our findings also contribute to a deeper understanding of the long-run consequences of the
11:320:26646:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pre-colonial characteristics of African societies. A number of important studies have documented
11:321:26742:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the importance of historical political centralization for economic outcomes today (e.g., Gennaioli
11:322:26840:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Rainer,2007, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,2013).  Although this is clearly an important
11:323:26932:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determinant of subsequent outcomes, our analysis shows that other dimensions – namely, social
11:324:27025:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structure and the nature of kinship – are also important.  Our focus on this dimension of social
11:325:27121:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structure connects our findings to previous studies that also examine the importance of various
11:326:27216:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dimensions  of  social  structure  within  developing  countries.    For  example,  La  Ferrara  (2007),

11:328:27423:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:importance of matrilineal versus patrilineal inheritance, while Bau (2016) studies the importance
11:329:27520:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  matrilocal  versus  patrilocal  residence.   Dunning  and  Harrison  (2010)  show  how  the  social
11:330:27623:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:custom  of  cross-cutting  alliances  called  “cousinage”  influences  the  appeal  of  ethnic  political

11:333:27929:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allow the Genoese to use community enforcement mechanisms in contractual relations and Greif
11:334:28021:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Tabellini (2010),  building on a large historical literature,  use a similar argument to explain
11:335:28121:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the historical divergence between Europe and China.  More recently, studies have examined the

12:340:28511:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:members has a basis in biology (Hamilton,1963, Henrich and Henrich,2007) and has been applied
12:341:28604:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  study  problems  of  economic  development  (Banfield,1958).    Kinship,  as  measured  by  the
12:342:28703:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strength of family ties, has also been extensively used in the literature on social networks (Ansell
12:343:28803:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Padgett,1993, Naidu, Robinson and Young,2015), and has been shown to be associated with
12:344:28894:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a range of economic, social, and political outcomes (Alesina and Giuliano,2014).  In the political
12:345:28992:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economy literature, family ties have also been explored as sources of political power and dynastic
12:346:29090:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:politics (Dal Bo, Dal Bo and Snyder,2009, Querubín,2016, Cruz, Labonne and Querubin,2017).

12:350:29488:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:others are not. We then discuss case study evidence which makes a causal link between segmen-

12:359:30248:30:22:70:541:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Numerous studies have documented examples of an apparent link between segmentary lineage
12:360:30336:22:22:70:541:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization and the initiation and/or propagation of conflict.  Many point out the strong effect
12:361:30433:22:21:70:541:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  segmentary  lineage  organization  can  have  on  the  exacerbation  of  small  conflicts.   Once  a
12:362:30539:21:22:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict begins,  segmentary lineage structure results in an essentially automatic mobilization of
12:363:30637:22:22:70:436:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:additional combatants, which makes resolving the conflict much less likely.
12:364:30712:22:22:85:541:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One  of  the  best-studied  segmentary  lineage  societies  is  the  Somali,  whose  social  structure
12:365:30814:22:22:70:541:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  dominated  by  segmentary  organization.   Anthropologist  Ioan  Lewis  (1961)  argues  that  the
12:366:30915:22:22:70:541:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage system plays a major role in propagating conflict in Somalia.  He writes that
12:367:31011:22:22:70:541:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“quarrels between individuals which result in loss of life or property or both are often quickly
12:368:31107:22:0:70:541:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:followed  by  retaliation  where  there  is  little  thought  of  negotiation.   Within  a  clan  bitter  feuds
13:369:31220:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:develop  and  persist,  often  for  many  years  and  sometimes  generations,  erupting  spasmodically
13:370:31322:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as later incidents occur, and being temporarily forgotten only in the context of wider hostilities”
13:371:31421:22:22:70:171:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(Lewis,1961, p.243).
13:372:31441:22:22:85:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Segmentary  lineage  has  also  been  associated  with  more-organized  forms  of  conflict,  like
13:373:31539:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:political  violence.    In  his  bookBlood  and  Bone,  Ioan  Lewis  (1994)  describes  the  link  between
13:374:31645:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization and organized violence in the Somali region during the1980s.
13:375:31737:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:After the Ogaadeen war of1977–1978, there was an upsurge of “tribalism,” which was led by the
13:376:31830:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:President Siyad, whose goal was to consolidate the position of his own clan and family.  Rather
13:377:31925:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than develop a national identity, his strategy was to recruit as many tribal segments as possible
13:378:32022:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:within  the  segmentary  system.   In  turn,  this  caused  segments  opposed  to  the  government  to
13:379:32124:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:build allegiances among their own segments (Lewis,1994, pp.225–226). That is, the “segmentary
13:380:32217:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structure  allowed  both  the  government  and  opposition  to  mobilize  large  swaths  of  the  lineage
13:381:32322:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:system” (Lewis,1994, p.232). This societal polarization along tribal and genealogical lines lays at
13:382:32421:22:22:70:346:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the foundation of Somalia’s subsequent political conflict.
13:383:32479:22:22:85:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Even  today,  the  relationship  between  lineage  organization  and  violent  conflict  continues  to
13:384:32581:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be  important.   A2015Rift  Valley  Institute  Report  reaffirms  its  importance  in  a  discussion  of
13:385:32685:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an upsurge of conflict during2006.  It describes how the military efforts of the Warsangeli and
13:386:32780:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Dubays fighters is “in line with the segmentary logic of the northern Somali society as a whole: as
13:387:32879:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:soon as a common threat emerges from outside, members of a descent group unite at the highest
13:388:32972:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:necessary level (sub-clan, clan or clan-family). Conversely, in the absence of such a threat, a group
13:389:33073:22:22:70:446:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:breaks up into smaller units that fend for themselves” (Hoehne,2015, p.217).
13:390:33149:22:21:85:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  Somali  example  clearly  illustrates  the  obligations  that  arise  due  to  segmentary  lineages
13:391:33253:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  how  these  can  cause  individuals  to  align  with  large  portions  of  society  against  common
13:392:33357:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:threats  and  to  become  involved  in  conflicts  even  if  they  are  otherwise  far  removed  from  the
13:393:33463:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:source  of  the  conflict.   This  effect  has  also  been  documented  among  several  other  segmentary
13:394:33568:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage groups.  The Nuer, an ethnic group from South Sudan that strictly abides by segmentary
13:395:33662:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  organization,  have  been  well  studied.  Evans-Pritchard  (1940a)  describes  this  obligation
13:396:33767:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:among the Nuer of South Sudan, writing that they “state this structural principle clearly in the
13:397:33863:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expression of their political values. Thus they say that if the Leng tertiary section of the Lou tribe
13:398:33965:22:22:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fights the Nyarkwac tertiary section – and, in fact, there has been a long feud between them – the
13:399:34063:22:0:70:520:66:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:villages which compose each section will combine to fight.” (Evans-Pritchard,1940a, p.142).
14:400:34156:0:22:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Numerous other segmentary lineage societies also exhibit this same pattern.  Lienhardt (1958)
14:401:34249:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:describes this same allegiance structure among the Dinka. Bohannon (1958) describes it amongst
14:402:34343:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  Tiv  of  Nigeria,  another  segmentary  lineage  society  and  provides  the  specific  example  of
14:403:34447:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fighting  between  the  Morov  of  MbaKetsa  and  MbaHura  of  Tondov.In  this  case  also,  the
14:404:34543:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary structure facilitated recruitment to conflict, which significantly escalated a feud that
14:405:34642:22:38:70:381:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:began between just two tribal segments (Bohannon,1958, p.46).

14:407:34731:30:22:70:541:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Those societies without segmentary lineage organization comprise our control group. A common
14:408:34823:22:22:70:541:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative  organization  form  is  centered  around  the  village,  which  is  led  by  a  village  chief.
14:409:34931:22:22:70:541:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Radcliffe-Brown  (1950,  p.42)  describes  this  form  of  organization,  referring  specifically  to  the
14:410:35037:22:44:70:541:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Lozi  and  Bemba  of  modern  Zambia:   “The  typical  corporate  group  in  that  region  is  a  village
14:411:35250:44:21:70:541:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a closed group;  that is, individuals or families may join or leave it, moving from one village to
14:412:35348:21:22:70:541:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:another.  It is usual that a number of the inhabitants of a village at any time should be related,
14:413:35446:22:22:70:541:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:either by cognatic ties or through marriage with the headman or with one another, but they do
14:414:35539:22:22:70:445:371:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not form a unilineal kin group, which is by its constitution a ‘closed’ group.”
14:415:35618:22:22:85:541:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Radcliffe-Brown (1950, p.43) also describes why unilineal descent (lineage traced through the
14:416:35711:22:22:70:541:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:male line only or the female line only) is important for segmentary lineage organization and why
14:417:35807:22:22:70:541:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cognatic descent (tracing lineage through both the male or female lines) is not compatible with
14:418:35902:22:22:70:541:283:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization:  “It is the corporate kin group. . . that controls the use of land,
14:419:36002:22:22:70:541:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whether  for  hunting,  for  pastoral  life,  or  for  cultivation;  that  exacts  vengeance  for  the  killing
14:420:36113:22:22:70:541:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  a  member,  or  demands  and  receives  an  indemnity. . . A  continuing  social  structure  requires
14:421:36218:22:22:70:541:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the aggregation of individuals into distinct separated groups, each with its own solidarity, every
14:422:36316:22:22:70:541:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:person belonging to one group of any set. . . In kinship systems cognatic kinship cannot provide
14:423:36412:22:22:70:541:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this;  it  is  only  made  possible  by  the  use  of  the  principle  of  unilineal  descent.”7Analyses  of
14:424:36520:22:21:70:541:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cognatic kinship groups illustrate that they are very different in structure from segmentary lineage
14:425:36620:21:22:70:541:130:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups.  Most important for thinking about the mechanisms linking social structure and conflict
14:426:36715:22:20:70:541:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  the  fact  that  segmentary  lineage  societies  are  closed  in  a  way  cognatic  societies  are  not  and
14:427:36827:20:14:83:541:88:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:7As  we  discuss  further  below,  one  of  the  primary  characteristics  of  segmentary  lineage  organizations,  which  is
14:428:36952:14:0:70:428:74:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:relevant for creating an ethnicity-level measure is whether a society has unilineal descent.
15:429:37046:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  all  of  the  functions  that  a  corporate  group  might  undertake  –  social,  political,  judicial,  or
15:430:37159:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:administrative – are fused together in a segmentary lineage group. These elements seem to create
15:431:37255:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a far greater social solidarity in segmentary lineage societies and much greater ability to engage in
15:432:37356:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:collective action.  This is not so in societies with cognatic kinship, where there is typically a clear
15:433:37459:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differentiation  between  kinship  relations  and  political  relations  (Fortes,1953,  p.26;  Gluckman,
15:434:37563:22:22:70:127:614:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:1951, p.31).
15:435:37575:22:22:85:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Writing about the Lozi of Zambia, Max Gluckman (1950) makes a similar point: “No corporate
15:436:37665:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unilineal group of kinsmen exists among the Lozi.  Every child. . . has a right to make its home in
15:437:37764:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a village of either of its mother’s parents and to inherit there.  It also has these rights with the
15:438:37864:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:kin of its father. . . There are no broadly based unilineal groups associating in common rights of
15:439:37962:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residence,  ownership,  inheritance,  production  etc.”  (Gluckman,1950,  pp.171,173).   Thus,  it  is
15:440:38064:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:clear that the social organization of ethnic groups, like the Bemba or Lozi, who base groups on
15:441:38159:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:villages,  is  very  different  from  segmentary  lineage  organization,  in  which  kinship  ties  are  pre-
15:442:38268:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determined,  clearly defined,  and form distinct non-overlapping groups (e.g.,  segments).  While
15:443:38365:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Bemba and Lozi had centralized states, their form of village/chief organization can also be
15:444:38460:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:found among ethnic groups that were stateless,  such as  the nearby Tonga  (Colson,1951).  This
15:445:38555:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:system is also common among groups in other parts of Africa, with the most well-studied groups
15:446:38649:22:22:70:522:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:being the Wabena of Tanzania and the Ankole and Toro of Uganda (Gluckman,1950, p.178).
15:447:38735:22:22:85:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In addition to cognatic kinship societies, there are a number of other forms of non-segmentary
15:448:38829:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  organization.   For  example,  there  are  societies,  like  the  Masai  in  Kenya  and  Tanzania,
15:449:38936:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whose politics and administration are organized by age – i.e., around age-sets – and by lineage or
15:450:39034:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:descent.  Age-based organization also create obligations although to those within one’s own age
15:451:39129:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:set. One could also imagine that age could also provide a useful axis for mobilization and collec-
15:452:39227:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tive action and there is some evidence that it certain instances it can, either historically (Gluckman,
15:453:39330:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:1940, Eldredge,2014) or in the modern period (Kurimoto and Simonse,1998).  However, what is
15:454:39421:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distinct  about  segmentary  lineage  societies  is  the  number  of  individuals  that  can  be  mobilized
15:455:39528:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:through lineage relative to age sets. While an age grade typically consists of tens of people lineage
15:456:39629:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segments consist of hundreds or even thousands of people.  Another example is very small scale
15:457:39723:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:societies  that  never  develop  either  unilineal  or  cognatic  kinship  in  any  institutionalized  form.
15:458:39831:22:0:70:377:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Examples include such groups as the Hadza or the San people.

17:489:42398:34:22:85:541:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For  each  of  the  four  types  of  conflict,  we  construct  three  measures  of  the  frequency  and
17:490:42501:22:22:70:541:646:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prevalence  of  each  type:   the  number  of  deadly  conflict  incidents,  number  of  conflict  deaths,

17:492:42699:22:22:70:214:602:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:different measures of conflict.
17:493:42732:22:43:85:541:580:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Following the methodology of previous studies (e.g., Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,2016),
17:494:42930:43:22:70:541:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:location of the conflict event with a digitized version of the map of ethnic boundaries taken from
17:495:43028:22:22:70:541:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Murdock (1959) to construct measures of the frequency and intensity of conflicts occurring within
17:496:43125:22:22:70:541:493:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the territory of each ethnic group.14The use of location to infer those who are involved in the
17:497:43220:22:22:70:541:471:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts is motivated by the fact that, in general, conflicts tend to occur close to the homelands
17:498:43319:22:22:70:541:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  participants.    This  is  most  clearly  true  for  disputes  and  conflicts  that  do  not  involve  the
17:499:43429:22:22:70:541:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:government military, which tend to be very localized.  For conflicts that involve the government
17:500:43525:22:22:70:541:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:military – i.e., conflicts that we refer to as civil conflicts – conflicts also generally occur within the
17:501:43631:22:22:70:541:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ethnic homelands of the combatants.  (See for example the recent findings of Michalopoulos and
17:502:43725:22:22:70:541:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Papaioannou (2016).)  Therefore, for these forms of conflicts as well, within which ethnic group’s
17:503:43823:22:22:70:278:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:territory the fighting occurs is informative.
17:504:43868:22:22:85:541:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A shortcoming of our strategy is that conflicts that involve members of an ethnic group but
17:505:43959:22:22:70:541:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:occur outside of the group’ boundaries will not be correctly identified in our estimates. Although
17:506:44057:22:21:70:541:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it  would  also  be  informative  to  connect  ethnic  groups  to  conflict  by  using  information  on  the
17:507:44165:21:22:70:541:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants involved, unfortunately this strategy is not feasible.  It requires detailed information
17:508:44266:22:22:70:541:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the ethnicity of the parties involved in each conflict,  which is not available.  Often,  we only
17:509:44366:22:20:70:541:208:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have a very general description of the participants, such as “locals”, “protestors”, “civilians”, etc.
17:510:44468:20:14:79:541:188:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:11This includes values of the interaction variable from40–47,50–57and60–67. We exclude conflicts in which one of
17:511:44580:14:10:70:398:174:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the participants is listed as “other," defined as “outside/external force (e.g., UN).”
17:512:44666:10:12:79:402:164:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:12By ‘deadly’ conflicts we mean a conflict that results in at least one battle death.
17:513:44751:12:15:79:541:152:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:13All  are  positively  correlated  and  the  correlation  coefficients  range  from0.489–0.837.   The  lowest  correlation  is
17:514:44878:15:9:70:541:137:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:between civil conflicts and within-group conflicts and the highest correlation is between all conflicts and civil conflicts.
17:515:45002:9:14:79:541:128:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:14The digitized map is taken from Nunn (2008) and is the same map as used in Michalopoulos and Papaioannou
17:516:45108:14:0:70:142:114:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:(2013,2014,2016).
18:517:45127:0:30:70:287:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f10:C:B.  Identifying Segmentary Lineage Societies
18:518:45171:30:22:70:541:694:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The most commonly used source for ethnographic information is theEthnographic Atlas,  which
18:519:45262:22:22:70:541:672:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contains information on the traditional practices and characteristics of1,265ethnic groups.  Al-
18:520:45358:22:22:70:541:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:though this source does include a number of characteristics of kinship practices, it does not con-
18:521:45456:22:21:70:541:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tain information on whether a society is organized according to segmentary lineages.15Therefore,
18:522:45552:21:22:70:541:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:to identify the presence or absence of a segmentary lineage system, we relied on theEthnographic
18:523:45648:22:22:70:541:585:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:Survey  of  Africa,  which  is  a  multi-volume  work  that  compiles  ethnographic  information  from
18:524:45750:22:22:70:541:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a  large  number  of  African  ethnic  groups.   TheSurvey,  edited  by  Daryll  Forde,  was  published
18:525:45853:22:22:70:541:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:over the course of several decades, beginning during the late-1940s, by the International African
18:526:45950:22:22:70:541:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Institute  in  London.   It  is  divided  into  individual  volumes,  first  by  region  and  then  by  ethnic

18:528:46166:22:22:70:541:475:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economic practices of each ethnic group, as well as a description of the ecological environment
18:529:46261:22:22:70:541:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:inhabited  by  the  group.   If  a  particular  group  was  not  included  in  theEthnographic  Survey  of

18:531:46462:22:22:70:541:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage society, we then consulted additional sources, including the references used
18:532:46557:22:22:70:540:387:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:in theEthnographic Atlasto try to determine if the group had a segmentary lineage structure.16
18:533:46651:22:22:70:464:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Full details of the data construction are provided in the paper’s online appendix.
18:534:46733:22:21:85:541:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For a group to be coded as a segmentary lineage society, we required that it satisfy the follow-
18:535:46829:21:22:70:541:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing three criteria,  which are taken from Middleton and Tait’s (1958) definition of a segmentary
18:536:46925:22:31:70:143:300:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage society.
18:537:46941:31:22:84:540:269:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:1.  The  society  must  be  based  on  unilineal  descent  and  there  must  have  been  direct  and
18:538:47041:22:22:98:541:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:explicit evidence that people identify with their lineages and are aware of their genealogical
18:539:47135:22:31:98:318:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:connections to members of other sub-groups.
18:540:47178:31:22:84:540:194:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:2.  The segments of the lineages must take on a ‘corporate form’, which means that branching
18:541:47270:22:19:98:541:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:lineage segments must determine administrative functions and political allegiances and that
18:542:47361:19:14:79:541:153:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:15TheEthnographic Atlashas information on the presence of clans and whether living arrangements are organized
18:543:47470:14:11:70:541:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:around them (variables v15/v16) and whether there are lineages that are unilineal (matrilineal or patrilineal) (v17/v19).
18:544:47591:11:11:70:541:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:However, whether or not a society had a segmentary lineage structure is not a simple composition of these. Although
18:545:47706:11:11:70:541:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:these measures are correlated with our constructed segmentary lineage variable, the two variables only explain about
18:546:47822:11:10:70:264:106:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:11% of the total variation in segmentary lineage.
18:547:47871:10:14:79:541:96:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:16In total, for111of the145ethnic groups coded, information was from theEthnographic Survey of Africa.  For the
18:548:47982:14:11:70:541:82:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:remaining  groups,  information  was  taken  from  a  number  of  other  sources,  which  are  documented  in  the  paper’s
18:549:48105:11:0:70:110:71:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:appendix.
19:550:48116:0:31:98:540:724:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:A:a centralized political authority entirely divorced from the lineage structure does not exist.17
19:551:48212:31:22:84:540:693:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:3.  Lineage and genealogical relationships affect where people live, with those who are more
19:552:48304:22:22:98:541:671:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:closely related living geographically closer to one another.  Thus, we require evidence that
19:553:48396:22:31:98:508:649:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:A:there is a geographic organization of residence that is based on the lineage system.18
19:554:48482:31:22:85:541:618:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For an ethnic group to be coded as a segmentary lineage society, we required direct evidence
19:555:48574:22:22:70:541:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  each  of  the  three  criteria  is  satisfied.Likewise,  for  an  ethnic  group  to  be  coded  as  a
19:556:48681:22:22:70:541:574:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-segmentary lineage society, we required direct evidence that any of the three criteria is not
19:557:48778:22:21:70:541:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:satisfied.  That is, lack of evidence for a criterion was not sufficient for a variable to be coded as
19:558:48880:21:22:70:541:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not being a segmentary lineage system.  In the end, we are able to code our segmentary lineage
19:559:48974:22:22:70:541:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:society  indicator  variable  for145ethnic  groups  within  Africa  (using  the  ethnicity  classification
19:560:49080:22:22:70:541:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  Murdock  (1959)).   For  the  other  ethnic  groups,  the  existing  evidence  was  not  sufficient  to
19:561:49187:22:22:70:541:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determine with confidence whether an ethnic group is based on segmentary lineage organization
19:562:49280:22:22:70:540:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or not.  Although we do not have data for all ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa, the145ethnic
19:563:49375:22:22:70:393:421:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:groups account for38% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa.19
19:564:49439:22:22:85:541:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As a check on the validity of our coding, after the variable was constructed, we consulted the
19:565:49533:22:22:70:541:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:existing secondary literature for cases where scholars had previously characterized or described
19:566:49629:22:22:70:541:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specific ethnic groups as having a segmentary lineage organization or not.  Reassuringly,  in all
19:567:49726:22:22:70:541:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cases (42in total), our classification matched the majority consensus. These cases are summarized
19:568:49823:22:22:70:197:311:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:in the paper’s appendix.20

19:571:50036:21:22:70:541:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our sample includes ethnic groups from many parts of Africa. In Figure2b, we add the locations

19:573:50226:22:20:70:140:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in our sample.
19:574:50240:20:13:79:541:182:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:17On the importance of this aspect of segmentary lineage organization, see Evans-Pritchard and Fortes (1940, p.13).
19:575:50355:13:14:79:541:169:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:18On  the  importance  of  this  aspect  of  segmentary  lineage  organization,  see  Radcliffe-Brown  (1950,  p.42),  Fortes
19:576:50480:14:9:70:220:155:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:(1953, p.36), or Sahlins (1961, p.328).

19:579:50644:9:14:79:541:122:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:20This is not to say that there is always unanimity within the literature about the classification of every society.  For
19:580:50765:14:11:70:541:108:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:example, Sahlins (1961) argues that the Dinka are not a segmentary lineage society, while Butt (1952) and Middleton
19:581:50880:11:11:70:541:97:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:and  Tait  (1958)  argue  that  they  are.   The  difference  arises  because  Sahlins  appears  to  have  been  using  a  narrower
19:582:51011:11:0:70:269:86:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:definition of segmentary lineage than is standard.

21:588:51411:0:22:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To better understand the extent to which our sample of145ethnic groups is representative of
21:589:51502:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the full population of societies within sub-Saharan Africa, we compare the characteristics of the
21:590:51599:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ethnic groups within our sample to the ethnic groups outside of our sample. This can be done for
21:591:51695:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any of the variables that are available from theEthnographic Atlasor for geographic characteristics.
21:592:51795:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:Within theEthnographic Atlas, there are420ethnic groups from sub-Saharan Africa. Of these,145
21:593:51888:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are in our sample and275are not.  In Table1, we report averages of both groups for a number
21:594:51979:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of characteristics, as well as their differences in means and statistical significance.  We find that
21:595:52080:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for16of the19variables examined, there is no statistically significant difference between the two
21:596:52177:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups (at the5% level or stronger).  The three measures for which the samples appear different
21:597:52272:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are:   jurisdictional  hierarchy,  the  natural  log  of  total  population,  and  longitude.   Thus,  larger
21:598:52381:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups that have a more centralized political system are more likely to be in our sample.  This is
21:599:52479:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:explained by the fact that larger ethnic groups were more likely to be studied and documented
21:600:52572:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by anthropologists and therefore are more likely to appear in our sample. This difference should
21:601:52668:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be kept in mind when interpreting our results.  The explanation for the difference in longitude is
21:602:52766:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less clear. Our sample is slightly more likely to include ethnic groups from the eastern portion of
21:603:52865:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Africa.  It is possible that ethnic groups in the region were studied in greater detail than ethnic
21:604:52964:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups in other regions.  It is also possible that it is simply due to the large number of variables
21:605:53064:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that we examine.  With almost20variables being examined, it is expected that even with balance
21:606:53158:22:38:70:476:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:one of the twenty will be significantly different from zero at a5% significance level.

24:729:60654:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zero.    Particularly  noteworthy  is  the  similarity  between  the  two  groups  in  terms  of  reliance
24:730:60760:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on  animal  husbandry.   This  alleviates  concerns  that  segmentary  lineage  organization  might  be
24:731:60863:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:correlated with the practice of animal husbandry, which has been hypothesized to be associated
24:732:60957:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a ‘culture of honor’, which can lead to the escalation of violence and conflict (Nisbett and
24:733:61054:22:22:70:212:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Cohen,1996, Grosjean,2014).
24:734:61081:22:21:85:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The one measure that is statistically different between the two groups is the number of levels of
24:735:61178:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:jurisdictional hierarchy beyond the local community. This is a particularly important characteris-
24:736:61276:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tic, especially given the existing evidence that this is associated with better development outcomes
24:737:61376:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:today (Gennaioli and Rainer,2007, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,2013).  It is plausible that
24:738:61468:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups with a history of statelessness might experience more conflicts today.  However, it is also
24:739:61566:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worth noting that although segmentary lineage societies tend to be less centralized on average, the
24:740:61665:22:22:70:540:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference of0.34between the two groups is small.  This reflects the fact that many segmentary
24:741:61759:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  societies  had  experienced  processes  of  political  centralization.   Indeed,  Southall  (1956)
24:742:61866:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pioneered  the  term  ‘segmentary  state’  to  refer  to  the  co-existence  of  these  different  structures.
24:743:61976:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Thus, lineage organization was compatible both with large centralized states and with societies
24:744:62071:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  were  stateless.   To  illustrate  this,  in  Figure3we  categorize  our  societies  into  four  groups
24:745:62180:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depending on: (1) whether or not they have a segmentary lineage structure, and (2) whether or not
24:746:62277:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they are politically centralized (defined as having two or more levels of political authority beyond
24:747:62377:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  local  community).   To  define  centralized  and  stateless  societies,  we  use  information  on  the
24:748:62485:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:levels of political authority beyond the local community from variablev33from theEthnographic
24:749:62578:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:Atlas. Stateless societies are defined as having0or1levels, while centralized societies are defined
24:750:62677:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as  having2–4levels.   As  shown,  there  are  examples  of  ethnic  groups  in  all  four  groups,  and
24:751:62781:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they are distributed fairly equally between the different cells.  This is consistence with the small
24:752:62881:22:22:70:204:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference found in Table2.

25:779:64875:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which is measured on a1–8integer scale.22The coefficient of interest isβ.  A positive coefficient
25:780:64972:22:22:70:401:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:indicates that segmentary lineage societies experience more conflict.
25:781:65041:22:22:85:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Estimates of equation (1) are reported in Table3.  Each panel reports estimates for one of the
25:782:65135:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:four conflict types: all conflicts, civil conflicts, non-civil conflicts, and within-group conflicts. Each
25:783:65241:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:triplet of columns reports estimates for one of our three measures of conflict intensity: the natural

26:787:65658:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(columns7–9).  For each outcome variable,  we report three specifications,  each with a different
26:788:65755:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:set  of  covariates.  The  first  specification  (in  columns1,4,  and7)  is  the  most  parsimonious  and
26:789:65861:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only includes country fixed effects. The second specification (in columns2,5, and8) also controls
26:790:65958:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the geographic covariates.  The final specification (in columns3,6,  and9) also includes the
26:791:66054:22:22:70:169:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:historical covariates.
26:792:66076:22:22:85:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Across  all36specifications,  we  estimate  a  positive  and  significant  relationship  between  the
26:793:66177:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:presence of segmentary lineage organization and conflict. In addition to being statistically signif-
26:794:66277:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:icant, the estimates are also quantitatively meaningful.  For example, according to the estimates
26:795:66374:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the number of deadly conflict incidents (columns1–3of panel A), a segmentary lineage society
26:796:66470:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experiences80–110%  more  incidents  than  a  society  that  does  not  have  a  segmentary  lineage
26:797:66570:22:22:70:532:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization. The magnitudes of the effects are fairly similar across the different conflict types.
26:798:66669:22:22:85:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In  Figures4a–4d,  we  report  partial  correlation  plots  for  each  type  of  conflict,  measured  by
26:799:66773:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:number of incidents, and from the specification that includes country fixed effects, the geographic
26:800:66872:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controls, and the historical controls (column3).  For each conflict type, the relationship appears
26:801:66970:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:general and to not be driven by a small number of influential observations.  Interestingly, the fit
26:802:67069:22:22:70:325:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:appears tightest for localized within-group conflicts.
26:803:67123:22:22:85:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In the figures,  we label each observation with the name of the ethnicity.  This allows one to
26:804:67217:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identify the location of ethnic groups that have been widely studied in the anthropology literature.
26:805:67317:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:One  example  of  such  a  group  is  the  Lele,  who  are  from  the  Kasai  province  of  the  Democratic
26:806:67424:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Republic of the Congo.  They are a society that is not based on segmentary lineage, but instead
26:807:67519:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on age sets (Douglas,1963).  Further, this has been an area of the country with little large-scale
26:808:67617:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict.  The Lele appear in the bottom left of the figures.  Also noteworthy are the Bemba and
26:809:67713:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Toro, two societies identified by anthropologists as not having segmentary lineage structures and
26:810:67810:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experiencing relatively little conflict.  The Bemba are behind the left side of the trend line,  and
26:811:67910:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  Toro  are  just  above  the  left  side  of  the  trend  line,  seen  most  clearly  in  Figure4a  and4b.
26:812:68020:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:By  contrast,  in  the  upper  right  of  the  figure  are  such  societies  as  the  Kissi,  in  Sierra  Leone,  a
26:813:68135:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage society whose territory experienced a great deal of conflict during the Sierra
26:814:68232:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Leone civil war (Middleton and Tait,1958, Massing,1980). We also see the Songhai, a segmentary

28:1239:75556:29:22:70:541:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:While the RD analysis that we undertake below is our primary strategy for estimating the causal
28:1240:75651:22:22:70:541:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relationship between segmentary lineage organization and conflict, in this section we undertake
28:1241:75746:22:22:70:438:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a number of additional exercises to assess the validity of the OLS estimates.
28:1242:75823:22:22:85:541:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  start  by  first  assessing  the  sensitivity  of  the  OLS  estimates  to  controlling  for  observable
28:1243:75931:22:22:70:541:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics.   We  first  employ  the  strategy  adapted  by  Nunn  and  Wantchekon  (2011)  from
28:1244:76032:22:22:70:541:125:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Altonji,  Elder  and  Taber  (2005)  that  allows  us  to  determine  how  much  stronger  selection  on
28:1245:76136:22:22:70:541:103:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobservables would have to be compared to selection on observables in order to fully explain
28:1246:76229:22:22:70:541:81:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:away  our  results.   To  perform  this  test,  we  calculate  the  ratioˆβF/(ˆβR−ˆβF),  whereˆβFis  our
28:1247:76333:22:0:70:541:59:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient  of  interest  from  a  regression  that  includes  a  full  set  of  controls  whileˆβRis  our
29:1248:76442:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient  of  interest  from  a  regression  that  includes  a  restricted  set  of  controls.   The  results
29:1249:76554:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are  reported  in  columns1–3of  Appendix  Table  A2.Each  panel  reports  a  ratio  where  the
29:1250:76649:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fully-controlled  regression  includes  the  geographic  and  historical  controls,  while  the  restricted
29:1251:76756:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regression including country fixed effects only. This yields twelve ratios that range from−160.24
29:1252:76853:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to 193.71.  In some cases,  the coefficient in the fully-controlled model is larger than that on the
29:1253:76953:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:uncontrolled  model  giving  a  negative  ratio.   In  general,  these  ratios  suggest  that  the  influence
29:1254:77062:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  unobservable  characteristics  would  have  to  be  far  greater  than  the  influence  of  observable
29:1255:77168:22:22:70:300:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics to fully account for our findings.
29:1256:77218:22:21:85:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  also  use  the  method  from  Oster  (2017)  to  calculate  a  lower  bound  for  our  coefficient  of
29:1257:77324:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interest.   Oster  shows  that  if  one  assumes  that  observables  and  unobservables  have  the  same
29:1258:77428:22:20:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f21:B:explanatory  power  in  the  outcome  variable,  then  the  following  is  a  consistent  estimator:β∗=

29:1260:77554:7:0:164:237:478:8:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f4:A:R2F−R2R, where
29:1261:77568:0:24:245:541:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:ˆβFandˆβRare as defined above,R2Fis theR-squared from the
29:1262:77625:24:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fully-controlled regression, andR2Ris theR-squared from the restricted regression.R2is the
29:1263:77718:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f19:11:g_d0_f4:B:R-squared from a regression that includes all observable and unobservable controls. Although in
29:1264:77813:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:theory, the maximum possible value ofR2maxis one, as Gonzalez and Miguel (2015) have shown,
29:1265:77904:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  the  real  world,  where  there  is  significant  measurement  error,  the  value  ofR2maxshould  be
29:1266:78008:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:much  lower  than  one.   However,  in  order  to  produce  the  most  conservative  estimates,  we  set
29:1267:78112:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f19:11:g_d0_f4:B:R2max=1.  The lower bound estimates are reported in columns4–6of Appendix Table A2.  All
29:1268:78200:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lower bound estimates from this exercise remain positive and, taken at face value, still imply a
29:1269:78296:22:22:70:419:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sizeable estimated effect of segmentary lineage organization on conflict.
29:1270:78369:22:22:85:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:An alternative strategy to OLS is to use matching to compare each segmentary lineage society
29:1271:78461:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  the  non-segmentary  lineage  society  that  is  most  similar,  based  on  a  range  of  observable
29:1272:78565:21:22:70:540:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics.23We report such matching estimates in Appendix Table A3.  Column1reports
29:1273:78654:22:22:70:540:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates where ethnicity pairs are matched on latitude and longitude only.  Column2reports
29:1274:78745:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates  from  matching  based  on  the  baseline  set  of  geographic  and  historical  controls  from
29:1275:78850:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equation (1).  Column3reports estimates from matching the geographic and historical controls,
29:1276:78943:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:but  where  we  also  require  that  members  of  a  matched  pair  have  the  same  number  of  levels  of
29:1277:79050:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:jurisdictional  hierarchy  beyond  the  local  community.   This  is  motivated  by  the  importance  of
29:1278:79154:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:accounting  for  political  centralization  as  thoroughly  as  possible.   As  reported,  for  each  conflict
29:1279:79264:22:19:70:407:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcome, the estimates continue to be positive and highly significant.
29:1280:79334:19:0:79:355:69:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:23We use nearest neighbor matching based on Mahalanobis distance.
30:1281:79401:0:30:70:179:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f10:C:B.  Robustness Checks
30:1282:79422:30:22:70:541:694:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  now  turn  to  an  examination  of  the  robustness  and  sensitivity  of  the  OLS  estimates.   Given
30:1283:79529:22:22:70:541:672:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  all  of  our  conflict  measures  are  count  variables,  we  check  that  our  estimates  are  robust  to
30:1284:79641:22:22:70:541:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:using a Poisson or negative binomial estimator. Table A4reports estimates for the most stringent
30:1285:79737:22:21:70:541:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specification that includes country fixed effects, geographic controls, and the historical controls.
30:1286:79837:21:22:70:541:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our  findings  remain  robust.In  every  specification,  the  estimated  relationship  between  the
30:1287:79936:22:22:70:541:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage and conflict is positive, sizeable, and in all specifications but one, statistically
30:1288:80039:22:22:70:123:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant.
30:1289:80051:22:22:85:541:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  next  check  the  robustness  of  our  estimates  to  alternative  measures  of  conflict.One
30:1290:80148:22:22:70:541:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristic  of  the  ACLED  conflict  data  is  that  they  include  a  wide  range  of  different  activi-
30:1291:80259:22:22:70:541:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ties  as  incidents,  sometimes  activities  of  conflict  actors  that  are  part  of  larger  conflicts  but  are
30:1292:80374:22:22:70:541:475:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not  themselves  explicitly  violent.   These  include  (i)  instances  when  a  headquarters  or  base  is
30:1293:80481:22:22:70:541:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:established, (ii) non-violent activity by a conflict actor, and (iii) a non-violent transfer of territory.
30:1294:80587:22:22:70:541:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We construct versions of our outcome variables that exclude conflict events that are in the ACLED
30:1295:80684:22:22:70:541:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:database  but  are  “non-violent.”  While  our  baseline  conflict  measures  already  exclude  conflicts
30:1296:80789:22:22:70:541:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:without fatalities, excluding conflicts classified as non-violent on the basis of the actors’ intentions
30:1297:80893:22:22:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is another strategy to check that our conflict measures capture variation in violent conflict.  The
30:1298:80992:22:21:70:540:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates using this alternative measure are reported in panel A of Appendix Table A5.  We find
30:1299:81087:21:22:70:489:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that our estimates remain robust to using this alternative measure of conflict intensity.
30:1300:81176:22:22:85:541:300:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also check the robustness of our estimates to the use of data from an alternative commonly-
30:1301:81270:22:22:70:541:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:used source of conflict data, theUppsala Conflict Data Program - Georeferenced Event Dataset(UCDP
30:1302:81367:22:22:70:541:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:GED). There are a number of differences between this data source and the ACLED source that
30:1303:81457:22:22:70:541:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we use.  First, this source begins in1991, six years earlier than the ACLED data.  Second, unlike
30:1304:81554:22:22:70:541:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the ACLED data, this source has a minimum mortality threshold (25fatalities in a calendar year)
30:1305:81649:22:22:70:541:190:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  has  to  be  met  for  the  conflict  to  appear  in  the  dataset.   Thus,  checking  the  robustness  of
30:1306:81761:22:22:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our findings to this alternative data source also checks the robustness of our estimates to using
30:1307:81858:22:22:70:540:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:a  slightly  different  time  period  and  a  higher  death  threshold.   Panel  B  of  Appendix  Table  A5
30:1308:81965:22:22:70:541:124:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reports the estimates using the UCDP GED conflict data.  The estimates remain very similar to
30:1309:82058:22:22:70:180:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our baseline estimates.
30:1310:82081:22:22:85:541:80:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Another potential concern is that our results may be driven by a small number of particularly
30:1311:82174:22:0:70:541:58:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:influential  outlying  observations.    One  is  particularly  concerned  that  observations  with  very
31:1312:82280:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensive fighting may have particularly strong leverage in the regressions.  An example would
31:1313:82374:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be  the  ethnic groups  that experienced the conflicts that  were initiated by the Lord’s Resistance
31:1314:82474:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Army in Uganda.  These conflicts primarily occurred within the territory of segmentary lineage
31:1315:82568:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:societies like the Acholi.  Although the partial correlation plots reported in Figures4a–4d seem
31:1316:82664:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to show that the estimates are fairly general and are not driven by a small number of influential
31:1317:82761:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observations,  we  undertake  a  systematic  check  here.   Specifically,  we  re-estimate  our  baseline
31:1318:82866:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specification after dropping influential observations that we identify using Cook’s Distance.  As
31:1319:82963:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an  alternative  strategy,  we  re-estimate  equation  (1),  after  removing  observations  with  extreme
31:1320:83068:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:values of conflict, defined as those within the top five percent. The estimates, which are reported
31:1321:83167:21:22:70:540:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in panels A and B of Appendix Table A6, show that both strategies yield estimates that are similar
31:1322:83265:22:22:70:191:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the baseline estimates.
31:1323:83291:22:22:85:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  final  robustness  check  that  we  perform  includes  additional  covariates  in  our  estimating
31:1324:83394:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equation.   In  our  baseline  specifications,  we  were  careful  not  to  include  variables  that  are  po-
31:1325:83504:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tentially endogenous to segmentary lineage organization.  However, with the standard concerns
31:1326:83597:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:associated with endogenous covariates in mind, we now check the sensitivity of our findings to
31:1327:83691:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controlling for a number of potentially endogenous factors. The first that we consider is a society’s
31:1328:83792:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:history of conflict which, as Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014) document, is positively correlated
31:1329:83888:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  the  prevalence  of  conflict  today.   Estimates  controlling  for  the  prevalence  of  pre-colonial
31:1330:83996:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts, using data from Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014), are reported in Appendix Table A7.
31:1331:84090:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our results remain highly significant and the magnitude of the point estimates are very similar
31:1332:84185:22:22:70:200:285:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:to the baseline estimates.24
31:1333:84213:22:21:85:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  next  check  the  sensitivity  of  our  estimates  to  controlling  for  ethnicity-level  measures  of
31:1334:84319:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economic  prosperity  and  the  presence  of  Islam  today,  both  of  which  are  potentially  important
31:1335:84424:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determinants  of  conflict.   We  include  two  measure  of  economic  prosperity:  the  natural  log  of
31:1336:84529:22:22:70:540:198:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:night  light  intensity  normalized  by  population,25and  the  natural  log  of  population  density.26
31:1337:84633:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To measure the presence of Islam, we use data from theWorld Religion Database, which records
31:1338:84725:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:religious affiliation for ethnicities in Africa, and construct an indicator variable that equals one if
31:1339:84828:22:19:70:345:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Islam is the dominant religion of the ethnic group today.
31:1340:84885:19:13:79:521:113:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:24The estimates in the table are directly comparable to the estimates reported in columns3,6, and9of Table3.
31:1341:84993:13:15:79:541:100:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:25The use of nightlights as a proxy for economic development follows, among others, Henderson, Storeygard and
31:1342:85102:15:9:70:461:85:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:Weil (2012), Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013), and Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014).
31:1343:85194:9:0:79:233:76:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:26Both variables are measured in2000.
32:1344:85233:0:22:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Estimates  of  equation  (1)  with  these  additional  covariates  are  reported  in  Appendix  Table
32:1345:85334:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:A8.  We find that even after accounting for these potentially endogenous factors,  the estimated
32:1346:85430:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relationship between segmentary lineage and conflict remains positive, although the magnitude
32:1347:85523:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the estimated effects decline slightly. Interestingly, the most notable decline is for civil conflicts,
32:1348:85629:22:40:70:453:636:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:while the decline is modest for non-civil conflicts and within-group conflicts.27
32:1349:85710:40:34:70:377:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:C:5.  Accounting for Unobservables: Spatial RD Estimates
32:1350:85764:34:22:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Despite  the  robustness  of  our  OLS  estimates  and  the  fact  that  our  findings  are  similar  when
32:1351:85870:22:22:70:541:540:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  account  for  a  range  of  observable  characteristics,  there  remains  the  concern  that  there  are
32:1352:85978:22:22:70:541:518:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobservables that may be biasing our estimates. For example, if ethnic groups have a persistent
32:1353:86074:22:22:70:541:496:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobservable propensity to engage in conflict and if this affected whether ethnic groups adopted
32:1354:86170:22:22:70:541:474:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a segmentary lineage form of social organization in the past, then this unobservable trait could
32:1355:86266:22:22:70:541:452:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bias our estimates of interest.  In this case, we would observe a relationship between segmentary
32:1356:86363:22:21:70:541:430:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage systems and conflict today even if no causal relationship exists. These unobservable traits
32:1357:86462:21:22:70:541:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:could originate from a range of different sources, including the physical environment or historical
32:1358:86561:22:22:70:541:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experiences. Similarly, there may be unobservable contemporary factors, like the extent to which
32:1359:86657:22:22:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  rule  of  law  is  able  to  reach  more  remote  locations  from  the  capital  city  or  the  quality  of
32:1360:86769:22:22:70:541:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:transportation and communication infrastructure.  These, and similar factors, might have direct
32:1361:86864:22:22:70:157:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effects on conflict.
32:1362:86884:22:22:85:541:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Given this possibility, we also implement an alternative estimation strategy. Since unobservable
32:1363:86980:22:22:70:541:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factors  are,  by  definition,  unobservable,  the  strategy  we  undertake  is  to  examine  and  compare
32:1364:87086:22:22:70:541:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:locations  that  are  geographically  close,  but  where  one  location  is  inhabited  by  a  segmentary
32:1365:87191:22:22:70:541:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  society  and  the  other  by  a  society  without  segmentary  lineages.   For  this  analysis,  a
32:1366:87298:22:22:70:541:211:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:10km-by-10km  grid-cell  is  the  unit  of  observation  and  the  sample  consists  of  grid-cells  within
32:1367:87405:22:22:70:541:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pairs  of  contiguous  ethnic  groups  where  one  ethnicity  has  segmentary  lineages  and  the  other
32:1368:87509:22:19:70:541:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:does not. Figure5illustrates this setup, showing grid-cells and pairs of contiguous ethnic groups,
32:1369:87607:19:14:79:541:148:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:27The estimated relationships between either population density, night lights, or Islam and conflict are opposite in
32:1370:87723:14:11:70:541:134:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:sign  from  what  one  might  have  expected.   Night  lights  and  population  density  are  both  positively  correlated  with
32:1371:87851:11:11:70:541:123:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:conflict and Islam is negatively correlated.  One explanation for the population-density relationship is that one needs
32:1372:87970:11:11:70:541:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:people to fight and thus conflicts often occur where there are people.  In addition,  it may be that places with more
32:1373:88087:11:11:70:541:101:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:populations or higher incomes (proxied by night lights) are more likely to be strategic locations that are the focus of
32:1374:88206:11:11:70:541:90:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:civil conflicts.  Lastly, higher population density may indicate greater population pressures which has been shown to
32:1375:88323:11:0:70:455:79:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:correlate with conflict (e.g., Andre and Platteau,1998, Acemoglu, Fergusson and Johnson,2017).

33:2312:91873:22:22:70:204:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of deadly conflict incidents.
33:2313:91902:22:22:85:541:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  strategy  is  to  use  a  regression  discontinuity  (RD)  estimation  method  that  restricts  the
33:2314:92006:22:22:70:541:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample to grid-cells that are sufficiently close to the ethnic boundaries and estimates the causal
33:2315:92104:22:22:70:541:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect of segmentary lineage organization on conflict using the estimated difference in conflict at
33:2316:92203:22:22:70:541:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the ethnic boundary.  The benefit of this strategy is that it accounts for unobservable factors that
33:2317:92303:22:22:70:541:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vary smoothly across space.  Therefore, as long as the determinants of unobservable traits – like
33:2318:92400:22:22:70:541:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:geography,  history,  idiosyncratic  shocks,  state  presence etc.  –  vary  smoothly,  the  unobservable
33:2319:92505:22:22:70:296:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:traits will be accounted for by the RD strategy.
33:2320:92553:22:33:85:348:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our RD estimating equation takes the following form:
33:2321:92605:33:0:202:541:60:11:g_d0_f19:11:g_d0_f4:A:yip=ωp+γISLe(i)+f(locationip) +Z′iΓ+εip(2)

34:2325:92940:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that equals one if cellibelongs to the ancestral homeland of an ethnic groupethat traditionally
34:2326:93035:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:had  a  segmentary  lineage  organization.f(locationip)denotes  a  polynomial  that  controls  for  a
34:2327:93136:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:smooth function of the geographic location of grid cells.  In our baseline specification, we use a
34:2328:93234:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:location’s Euclidian distance from the border as the running variable, and, following Gelman and
34:2329:93330:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Imbens (2014), use a local linear specification, estimated separately on both sides of the border.
34:2330:93428:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We also report estimates using several other functional forms.ωpdenotes fixed effects for each

34:2332:93622:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:well as the following set of grid-cell level geographical controls: elevation, agricultural suitability,
34:2333:93726:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and an indicator if the grid-cell is intersected by a national border.28The sample includes all grid
34:2334:93826:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cells  of  all  pairs  of  ethnic  groups  that  share  a  border  and  where  one  has  segmentary  lineages
34:2335:93935:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the other does not.29The sample is further restricted to grid-cells that are within a certain
34:2336:94032:22:22:70:457:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distance of the border of the two ethnic groups, either60,80, or100kilometers.
34:2337:94110:22:22:85:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Before  turning  to  our  estimates  we  first  examine  the  raw  data  for  the  RD  sample.   Figures

34:2339:94311:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the four types of conflict and the distance from the ethnicity boundary.  Even in the raw data, a
34:2340:94408:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discontinuity at the border is apparent.  We observe a discontinuous increase in conflict on the
34:2341:94504:22:22:70:489:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage side of the border. We next turn to our more formal RD estimates.

34:2343:94691:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:months),  are  reported  in  Table4.   For  each  outcome,  we  report  three  specifications,  each  in  a

34:2345:94898:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:country fixed effects; and in the third, we add the set of geographic controls.  Each panel of the
34:2346:94996:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:table reports estimates for a different type of conflict, either all conflicts, civil conflict, non-civil
34:2347:95101:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts,  and  within-group  conflicts.   All  estimates  use  a  restricted  sample  of  grid  cells  within
34:2348:95212:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:60km  of  the  ethnicity-pair  border.   We  find  that  in  every  specification,  and  irrespective  of  the
34:2349:95322:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:measure of conflict, the estimated effect of segmentary lineage systems on conflict is positive and
34:2350:95421:22:23:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statistically significant. We also find that for each outcome, the magnitude of the estimated effect

34:2352:95605:13:14:79:541:74:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:29If an ethnic group is adjacent to more than one ethnic group of different treatment status, then the ethnic group
34:2353:95720:14:0:70:193:60:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:can be a part of multiple pairs.

38:2438:101628:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:geo-referenced by Nunn and Wantchekon (2011).  Combining this information with the ethnicity
38:2439:101720:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:map from Murdock (1959), we are able to examine whether we observe a discontinuity in ethnic
38:2440:101812:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identity at the Murdock boundaries among our sample of ethnicity pairs. This is shown in Figure
38:2441:101907:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:8, which reports the bivariate relationship between distance from the border and ethnic affiliation.

38:2443:102101:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of a segmentary lineage society and thex-axis is distance in kilometers from the border, with a
38:2444:102196:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positive distance indicating a location within the territory of the segmentary lineage society and
38:2445:102294:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a negative distance indicating a location outside of the segmentary lineage territory. We find that
38:2446:102393:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:there is a discontinuous change in the fraction of the population that report that they are members
38:2447:102492:22:22:70:304:417:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:of a segmentary lineage society at the borders.30
38:2448:102541:22:22:85:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The estimates from Figure8have important implications for assessing the relative magnitudes
38:2449:102632:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  the  estimate  OLS  and  RD  effects.   According  to  the  estimated  RD  coefficients,  segmentary
38:2450:102736:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  organization  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  conflict  of  0.082  to  0.104  standard  devia-
38:2451:102847:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions.31These estimates are smaller than those from the cross-ethnicity OLS regressions (reported
38:2452:102944:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Table3).  According to the OLS estimates, segmentary lineage organization is associated with
38:2453:103039:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an  increase  in  conflict  of  0.333  to  0.622  standard  deviations.   Thus,  the  magnitude  of  the  OLS
38:2454:103148:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates  are  significantly  larger  than  the  RD  estimates.   Although  one  explanation  for  this  is
38:2455:103256:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a  potential  bias  from  unobservables  present  in  the  OLS  estimates,  the  difference  might  also  be
38:2456:103364:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:explained  by  the  fact  that  close  to  the  border  within  a  segmentary  lineage  society,  a  smaller
38:2457:103472:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fraction of the population is likely to belong to the segmentary lineage society. As shown in Figure
38:2458:103572:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:8,  close to the border approximately50% of the population does not belong to the segmentary
38:2459:103664:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage group. This, suggests that the magnitude of the RD estimates could be biased downwards
38:2460:103758:22:19:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by this amount as well. In addition, if conflict in non-segmentary lineage ethnic groups is affected
38:2461:103858:19:15:79:541:113:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:30In Appendix Figure A3, we report RD plots for pairs of prominent ethnic groups that have been widely studied
38:2462:103968:15:11:70:541:98:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:in the anthropology literature:  Ganda and Soga, and Sotho and Zulu.  In both cases, we observe a discontinuous and
38:2463:104083:11:9:70:383:87:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:sharp change in self-reported ethnicity at Murdock’s ethnic group boundaries.

39:2469:104625:14:13:70:541:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Thex-axis reports geographic distance.  Positive values imply kilometers into the territory of the

39:2474:105063:22:39:70:282:318:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimated effects at the border to be muted.

39:2476:105144:29:22:70:541:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  now  check  the  sensitivity  of  our  estimates  to  a  range  of  robustness  checks,  which  include:
39:2477:105252:22:22:70:541:228:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative  specifications  for  the  running  variable,  different  restrictions  on  the  window  of  ob-
39:2478:105360:22:22:70:541:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:servations  that  are  included  in  the  sample,  and  estimation  using  Poisson  or  negative  binomial
39:2479:105466:22:22:70:541:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models.    The  estimates  are  reported  in  Table5,  where  each  column  reports  estimates  using
39:2480:105567:22:22:70:540:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a  different  restriction  on  the  range  of  observations  included  in  the  sample  (60km,80km,  or
39:2481:105670:22:22:70:541:140:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:100km),  and  each  panel  reports  different  running  variables  and  estimators.32In  panel  A,  for
39:2482:105773:22:22:70:541:118:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reference, we report the baseline estimates from Table4.  In panels B and C, we use the baseline
39:2483:105869:22:19:70:541:96:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:running variable, but use a negative binomial and Poisson estimator.  In panels D to I, we report
39:2484:105966:19:14:79:541:77:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:32The estimates are for total conflicts. The estimates for civil conflicts, non-civil conflicts, and within-group conflicts
39:2485:106089:14:0:70:150:63:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:are similarly robust.
40:2486:106112:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates using more flexible specifications for the running variable.  Specifically, we use latitude
40:2487:106213:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  longitude  (and  their  interaction)  instead  of  Euclidean  distance  as  running  variables.   This
40:2488:106320:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allows us to control more directly for features that vary over two-dimensional space rather than
40:2489:106416:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:collapsing a two-dimensional location into a one-dimensional distance measure (see Dell (2010)
40:2490:106510:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:for a similar strategy).  In panel D, we include the baseline running variable interacted with14
40:2491:106606:22:22:70:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cluster indicator variables, where a cluster is defined as a set of contiguous ethnic groups.  Thus,
40:2492:106706:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in this specification, the coefficient on the running variable is allowed to differ for different ethnic
40:2493:106810:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups  in  the  same  region.   In  panel  E,  rather  than  using  the  distance  from  the  border  as  the
40:2494:106920:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:running variable,  we use latitude and longitude and interact both with the14cluster indicator
40:2495:107014:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variables. In panel F, we include quadratic polynomials in the latitude and longitude (i.e. latitude,
40:2496:107115:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:longitude,  squared,  longitude  squared,  and  latitude  times  longitude),  with  each  component  of
40:2497:107218:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the polynomial interacted with the14cluster indicators. Panels G–I are equivalent to panels D–F,
40:2498:107314:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:except instead of interacting distance or latitude and longitude with14cluster indicator variables,
40:2499:107413:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we interact them with68pair indicator variables.  Although these are demanding specifications
40:2500:107506:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(the running variable in Panel I, for example, consists of340variables) by allowing the running
40:2501:107601:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variable to vary for each ethnicity pair we are about to control for specific conflict patterns around
40:2502:107703:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each  border  segment.   Overall,  the  estimates  using  any  of  these  alternative  specifications  are
40:2503:107809:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:similar to the baseline RD estimates. The estimated coefficients all remain positive and similar in
40:2504:107908:22:22:70:462:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude, and in nearly every specification they remain statistically significant.
40:2505:107991:22:22:85:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  final  robustness  check  that  we  perform  concerns  the  precision  of  the  location  data  for
40:2506:108095:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts.  This is particularly important for the RD estimates since they are derived from differ-
40:2507:108194:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ences in conflict intensity between areas that are geographically close.  As a result, misreported
40:2508:108292:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict locations and imprecise geocoding of the conflict data could potentially bias the results.
40:2509:108391:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To confront this issue, we re-estimate equation (2), reporting the same specifications as in Table
40:2510:108489:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:4,  except  that  we  exclude  conflict  incidents  that,  according  to  the  ACLED  documentation,  are
40:2511:108594:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:georeferenced with lower precision.33While conflict incidents are only included in the ACLED
40:2512:108686:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:data  if  a  minimum  level  of  information  about  geographic  location  is  known,  it  is  nevertheless
40:2513:108793:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important that our results are robust when we restrict to conflict incidents that are georeferenced
40:2514:108892:22:23:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a high level of certainty.  The estimates, which are reported in Appendix Table A10, show
40:2515:108986:23:15:79:541:87:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:33We exclude conflicts that are given a score of3in ACLED’s geo-precision measure. These conflicts make up4.75%
40:2516:109097:15:0:70:251:72:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of the all observations in the ACLED dataset.
41:2517:109144:0:39:70:438:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that our estimates are nearly identical when these observations are omitted.

41:2519:109279:29:22:70:541:656:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:One  assumption  of  the  RD  approach  is  that  unobservables  vary  smoothly  across  the  borders.
41:2520:109381:22:22:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although this is impossible to test directly, we glean evidence about the validity of this assump-
41:2521:109479:22:22:70:541:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tion  by  estimating  whether  there  appears  to  be  a  discontinuity  at  the  border  for  the  following
41:2522:109588:22:22:70:541:590:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observable  variables:   elevation,  slope,  average  temperature,  the  presence  of  a  body  of  water,
41:2523:109694:22:22:70:541:568:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suitability for the cultivation of cereals,34the percentage of land that is currently under cultivation,
41:2524:109798:22:22:70:541:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the presence of petroleum, the presence of diamonds, the number of mission stations during the
41:2525:109892:22:22:70:541:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:early colonial period, an indicator for the presence of a colonial railway, and an indicator for the
41:2526:109992:22:22:70:540:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:presence of a pre-colonial explorer route.35We check for discontinuities by estimating equation
41:2527:110087:22:44:70:541:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2) with each variable as the dependent variable. Table6reports estimates using the specification
41:2528:110288:44:21:70:541:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  indicator  is  always  small  in  magnitude  and  it  is  never  statistically  different  from  zero.

41:2530:110493:22:22:70:541:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  find  for  segmentary  lineage  organization.   Therefore,  the  estimates  reduce  the  concern  that
41:2531:110599:22:39:70:517:371:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:other factors may also vary discontinuously at the borders that are used in our RD analysis.

41:2533:110749:29:22:70:541:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although we find no evidence of discontinuities in geographic or historical factors, there remains
41:2534:110847:22:22:70:541:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the concern that other ethnic characteristics, besides segmentary lineage organization, may also
41:2535:110943:22:22:70:541:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vary discontinuously at the boundaries.  To threaten the validity of our RD estimates, any other

41:2537:111146:22:22:70:541:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:case, and if segmentary lineage organization were correlated with the other characteristics, then

41:2542:111584:22:19:70:541:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:then re-estimate equation (2) to obtain estimates of the impact of the characteristic on conflict. To

43:2659:119728:19:0:79:533:78:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:36Thus, there are four jurisdictional hierarchy indicator variables and eight settlement pattern indicator variables.

45:2713:124165:22:22:70:541:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts  to  escalate  and  last  longer  (i.e.,  longer  duration)  or  because  they  result  in  more  new
45:2714:124276:22:22:70:541:595:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts (i.e., more onset) or a combination of the two. In theory, the effect of segmentary lineage
45:2715:124377:22:22:70:541:573:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization on these two channels could be very different.  For example, if segmentary lineage
45:2716:124472:22:22:70:541:551:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization causes conflicts to escalate, as case-study evidence suggests, one could imagine that
45:2717:124570:22:22:70:541:529:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this  is  foreseen  and  prevents  conflicts  from  starting  in  the  first  place.38That  is,  the  effects  of
45:2718:124683:22:22:70:541:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization on conflict duration and conflict onset could differ substantially.
45:2719:124782:22:22:85:541:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To investigate these and related issues, we separately estimate the effects of segmentary lineage

45:2746:126350:11:10:70:309:105:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:organization is associated with a form of ‘tribal hospitality’.
45:2747:126413:10:13:79:294:95:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:39See Jenkins (1995) for the finer details of estimation.
45:2748:126470:13:14:79:541:82:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:40The granularity of the ACLED data allows one to measure time in months. However, doing so results in a number
45:2749:126581:14:11:70:541:68:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of ‘false’ onsets and offsets that are coded anytime there is a pause in fighting of a month or greater, which is common.
45:2750:126702:11:0:70:311:57:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:Thus, we measure time in years rather than something finer.

46:2758:127423:22:22:70:121:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of conflict.
46:2759:127435:22:21:85:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  find  strong  evidence  that  segmentary  lineage  organization  is  associated  with  escalation
46:2760:127536:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  conflict.    Specifically,  we  find  a  robust  negative  relationship  between  segmentary  lineage
46:2761:127641:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization and conflict offset.  Once conflicts start, in a segmentary lineage societies, they are
46:2762:127741:22:22:70:301:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less likely to end and more likely to last longer.
46:2763:127791:22:22:85:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also find some evidence that segmentary lineage organization is associated with the start
46:2764:127883:22:22:70:541:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  new  conflicts.  We  estimate  a  positive  relationship  between  segmentary  lineage  organization
46:2765:127987:22:22:70:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and conflict onset.  Thus, there is no evidence that segmentary lineage organization reduces the
46:2766:128083:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probability of conflict onset.  In comparing the onset versus duration/escalation mechanisms, we
46:2767:128179:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:find that the estimated effects on onset tend to be smaller and less precisely estimated than those
46:2768:128278:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for  conflict  offset.   For  example,  in  the  specifications  reported  in  panel  A  of  columns3and6,
46:2769:128384:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the marginal effect (estimated at the mean) of segmentary lineage organization on conflict offset
46:2770:128481:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is about1.71times larger in magnitude than its effect on conflict onset (0.082versus0.048).41In
46:2771:128576:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:addition, two of the three estimates for conflict onset in panel A are not statistically different from
46:2772:128679:22:21:70:94:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zero.
46:2773:128684:21:22:85:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Overall,  the  estimates  are  consistent  with  the  emphasis  on  an  escalation  channel  that  is
46:2774:128785:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed  in  the  ethnographic  literature.   Because  segmentary  lineage  societies  mobilize  a  large
46:2775:128891:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:number of combatants, they have particularly large effects on the duration and scale of conflicts.
46:2776:128989:22:20:70:509:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Once a conflict starts, it is much more likely to escalate and turn into a prolonged conflict.
46:2777:129083:20:14:79:541:156:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:41It is unlikely that this is explained by differences in the relative frequency of onset versus offset.  For all conflicts,
46:2778:129207:14:0:70:134:142:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:they are similar.

48:2824:131883:30:22:70:541:694:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As another way of gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying our estimates,
48:2825:131975:22:22:70:541:672:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we examine the effects of segmentary lineage organization on conflicts of different sizes.  Specif-
48:2826:132074:22:22:70:540:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ically,  we  use  a  negative  binomial  model  to  estimate  equation  (1)  with  the  number  of  conflict
48:2827:132182:22:21:70:541:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:incidents  of  each  of  the  following  sizes  as  dependent  variables:  incidents  with0deaths,1-10
48:2828:132284:21:22:70:541:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:deaths,11-100deaths, or100+ deaths. The estimates are reported in Table9.42We find a positive
48:2829:132377:22:22:70:541:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relationship  between  segmentary  lineage  and  the  incidence  of  conflict  incidents  of  all  sizes.
48:2830:132482:22:22:70:541:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, the magnitude of the coefficient increases monotonically with the scale of the conflict
48:2831:132578:22:22:70:541:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as  measured  by  the  number  of  fatalities.   As  shown,  in  panels  A  to  D,  this  is  true  irrespective
48:2832:132690:22:22:70:541:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  whether  we  examine  all  conflicts,  civil  conflict,  non-civil  conflict,  or  within-group  conflicts.
48:2833:132801:22:22:70:541:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This  finding  is  consistent  with  segmentary  lineage  organization  mobilizing  large  numbers  of
48:2834:132903:22:39:70:449:475:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:combatants, which causes small disputes to escalate into larger-scale conflicts.
48:2835:132983:39:29:70:491:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f10:C:C.  The Differential Relationship between Adverse Environmental Shocks and Conflict
48:2836:133066:29:22:70:541:407:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  final  exercise  that  we  undertake  to  better  understand  the  channels  behind  our  findings
48:2837:133169:22:22:70:541:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:examines  how  environmental  shocks,  which  have  been  shown  to  cause  conflict,  interact  with
48:2838:133270:22:22:70:541:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  presence  of  segmentary  lineage  systems.It  is  possible  that  segmentary  lineage  groups
48:2839:133369:22:22:70:541:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have a more difficulty dealing with adverse environmental shocks and mitigating the extent to
48:2840:133462:22:22:70:541:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which they lead to escalated armed conflict.  Motivated by this, we test whether adverse rainfall
48:2841:133559:22:22:70:541:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shocks lead to more conflict in segmentary lineage societies compared to non-segmentary lineage
48:2842:133654:22:22:70:541:275:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:societies.   Using  a  monthly  panel  of  ethnic  groups,  we  first  examine  the  relationship  between
48:2843:133760:22:22:70:541:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:adverse rainfall shocks and conflict. This is motivated by prior evidence of a relationship between
48:2844:133859:22:21:70:541:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rainfall and conflict within sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Miguel et al.,2004, Rogall,2014).  We then
48:2845:133956:21:22:70:541:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allow the relationship to differ depending on whether the ethnic group has a segmentary lineage
48:2846:134051:22:22:70:541:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization or not.  Given that rainfall shocks provide a catalyst for conflict, these estimates test
48:2847:134153:22:22:70:541:166:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  extent  to  which  segmentary  lineages  amplify  the  effects  of  these  shocks,  allowing  them  to
48:2848:134260:22:22:70:280:144:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more frequently result in full-scale conflict.
48:2849:134306:22:19:85:541:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  rainfall  data  are  from  the  Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission  (TRMM)  satellite.43The

48:2851:134516:13:15:79:541:90:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:43The  use  of  satellite  data  is  especially  important  in  our  context  since  ground  sensors  are  scarce.Wherever

52:2987:143568:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage groups,  we estimate relationships that are not statistically different from zero,  and that

52:2990:143871:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:since the previous literature examining the relationship between rainfall and conflicts has focused

52:2992:144079:22:21:70:312:548:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:although these tend to be smaller in magnitude.47

52:3001:144887:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fore,  we also estimate a version of equation (5) that does not include the ethnicity fixed effects
52:3002:144986:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(or  their  interactions  with  a  time  trend),  but  instead  includes  the  segmentary  lineage  indicator
52:3003:145095:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variable, as well as our baseline set of ethnicity-level geographic and historical covariates.  From
52:3004:145195:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the estimates, which are reported in columns3and6segmentary lineage societies are associated
52:3005:145287:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with more conflict even when rainfall is at its historical average (Neg Shocki,t=0).  The estimated
52:3006:145386:21:22:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect,  which  is  given  by  the  coefficient  for  the  (uninteracted)  segmentary  lineage  indicator
52:3007:145491:22:22:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variable,  is  positive,  sizeable,  and  statistically  significant.   This  is  consistent  with  other  factors,
52:3008:145606:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:besides  adverse  rainfall,  being  a  catalyst  for  conflict,  which  is  then  exacerbated  by  segmentary
52:3009:145715:22:22:70:172:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage organization.
52:3010:145736:22:22:85:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  also  check  the  robustness  of  these  findings  to  the  use  of  alternative  specifications  that
52:3011:145842:22:19:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have been used in previous studies that examine the effects of weather shocks on conflict.  These
52:3012:145939:19:15:79:541:113:7:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f4:F:47Given the presence of lagged dependent variables in our regression equation, there is concerned about the presence
52:3013:146055:15:11:70:541:98:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of a Nickel bias.  If we instead use an Arellano-Bond estimator, we obtain very similar results to what we report here.
52:3014:146174:11:11:70:541:87:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:The coefficient on the interaction term in column2of Panel A, for example, is 2.602 and significant at the5% level.
52:3015:146289:11:11:70:541:76:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:Also, as we report in Appendix Table A12, we obtain similar estimates using specifications that do not include lags of
52:3016:146407:11:0:70:164:65:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the dependent variable.
53:3017:146432:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates are reported in Appendix Table A12.  Specifically,  we report estimates of a version of
53:3018:146529:22:22:70:540:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equation (5) without lagged dependent variables, but with:  ethnicity fixed effects and ethnicity-

53:3022:146879:34:22:70:541:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We feel that our findings provide insight into a previously unexplored determinant of conflict.
53:3023:146974:22:22:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although  our  findings  hold  for  all  forms  of  conflict,  they  are  potentially  the  most  informative
53:3024:147083:22:22:70:541:540:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for civil conflicts,  helping us to better understand why some armed non-state actors have been
53:3025:147178:22:22:70:541:518:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:better  able  to  recruit  soldiers  than  others.   As  an  example  of  a  non-state  organization  that  has
53:3026:147289:22:22:70:541:496:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:been successful in this dimension consider Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria.  It is very difficult
53:3027:147385:22:22:70:541:474:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to explain their success using standard determinants. Certainly, the Nigerian state lacks capacity,
53:3028:147484:22:22:70:541:452:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:but it does so everywhere, not just in the North. Indubitably, there is greed in Nigeria and perhaps
53:3029:147584:22:21:70:541:430:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the incentive to mobilize is due to the prospect of grabbing oil rents.  But the oil is in the South,
53:3030:147685:21:22:70:541:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not in the North.  Certainly, the North also has legitimate grievances,  but one can imagine that
53:3031:147782:22:22:70:541:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such grievances are widespread in Nigeria.  Why then has the rebellion in the North attracted so
53:3032:147878:22:22:70:150:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:many followers?
53:3033:147893:22:22:85:541:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our findings suggest that one missing element in such a puzzle may be the social structure of
53:3034:147986:22:22:70:541:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the societies involved.  Boko Haram has recruited primarily from the Kanuri people who histor-
53:3035:148080:22:22:70:541:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ically constituted a segmentary lineage society.  That there is a connection between segmentary
53:3036:148175:22:22:70:541:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  societies  and  Boko  Haram  has  been  argued  by  Akbar  Ahmed  (2013b)  who  argues  that
53:3037:148276:22:31:70:451:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they actively recruit where segmentary lineage structures are most prominent:
53:3038:148353:31:22:114:514:224:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:“Over the previous three years,  the group popularly known as Boko Haram had
53:3039:148429:22:22:98:514:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:struck fear into Nigerians with its ferocious attacks on both government and civilian
53:3040:148514:22:22:98:514:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:targets. . . The  group  was  dominated  by  the  historically  segmentary  lineage  Kanuri

54:3047:149133:26:22:85:541:676:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Though  we  have  conducted  our  analysis  within  Africa  because  of  the  rich  geocoded  sub-
54:3048:149231:22:22:70:541:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:national  conflict  data,  the  findings  we  present  are  likely  applicable  beyond  the  continent.   For
54:3049:149340:22:22:70:541:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:example, Osama bin Laden and many individuals recruited to Al Qaeda were and are Yemeni;
54:3050:149428:22:22:70:541:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:moreover, “Yemeni tribes in Asir are organized around a segmentary lineage system, with elders
54:3051:149522:22:22:70:541:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  councils,  a  spirit  of  egalitarianism,  and  a  code  of  honor  guiding  society  that  emphasizes
54:3052:149629:22:22:70:541:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:courage,  loyalty,  hospitality,  and  revenge”  (Ahmed,2013b,  p.110).   The  same  logic  of  lineage-
54:3053:149733:22:22:70:541:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:based  obligation  and  revenge  among  segmentary  groups  in  Somalia  and  Sudan  applies  to  the
54:3054:149834:22:22:70:541:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Yemeni.  According to Paul Dresch, “If a man from a village in Khamis Abu Dhaybah or Kharif
54:3055:149925:22:22:70:541:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:kills  someone  from  Arhab. . . a  debt  exists  between  the  two  tribes. . . a  man’s  immediate  kin  are
54:3056:150035:22:22:70:541:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:involved (those who Islamic law recognizes as always al-dam), but men much further from the
54:3057:150126:22:22:70:541:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:particular antagonist may also be drawn in.  If a man from section A of our tribe kills someone
54:3058:150221:22:21:70:541:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from  another  tribe,  that  other  tribe  might  perhaps  kill  someone  in  a  quite  different  section  of
54:3059:150331:21:22:70:541:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ours,  section B” (Dresch,1989,  pp.84–85).  As we documented within Africa,  here too lineage-
54:3060:150426:22:22:70:541:391:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:based obligation and responsibility to participate in conflict appear to facilitate the escalation and
54:3061:150528:22:22:70:541:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:persistence of conflicts that otherwise would be small and short-lived.  Thus, it is likely that our
54:3062:150628:22:22:70:284:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:findings for Africa also apply more broadly.
54:3063:150672:22:22:85:541:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A better understanding of segmentary lineage systems also has the potential to shed important
54:3064:150765:22:22:70:541:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:light and new understanding on key international security issues.  It is possible that segmentary
54:3065:150862:22:22:70:541:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage organization is not only associated with within-country conflicts but also with inter-state
54:3066:150961:22:22:70:541:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:warfare,  international  violence,  and  terrorism.   Ahmed  (2013b)  points  out  a  broad  correlation
54:3067:151065:22:22:70:541:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between areas of high-intensity Islamist violence and areas where society is structured based on
54:3068:151161:22:26:70:470:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization. In a2013speech, Ahmed claimed the following:
54:3069:151238:26:22:114:514:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:“Here is a correlation for you.  Ask yourselves:  where are [US] drones most used?
54:3070:151320:22:22:98:514:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:They are really segmentary lineage systems: the Pashtuns in Afghanistan and Pakistan
54:3071:151404:22:22:98:514:145:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:tribal  areas,  mainly  in  Waziristan;  among  the  Somali  segmentary  lineage  system;
54:3072:151493:22:22:98:514:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:the  Yemenis’  segmentary  lineage  system;  the  Kurds  in  eastern  Turkey,  segmentary

54:3074:151665:22:22:98:514:79:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:correlation.  So there is some connection that we can identify. . . Take a look at these
54:3075:151753:22:0:98:514:57:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:mutant  militant  groups  that  are  emerging:   the  TTP  (Tehrik-i-Taliban  Pakistan),  for
55:3076:151848:0:22:98:514:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:example.   Where  is  it  coming  out  of?   It’s  coming  out  of  a  specific  tribe,  a  specific
55:3077:151948:22:22:98:514:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:clan.  Al Shabaab:  tribal.  Tribal:  Boko Haram in West Africa.  Again, because we tend
55:3078:152036:22:22:98:514:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:to jump on Islam as the explanation for what’s going on, we are missing this whole
55:3079:152118:22:22:98:514:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:tribal  basis  of  the  discussion.   All  of  these  are  coming  out  of  straight  segmentary
55:3080:152214:22:31:98:324:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:lineage system backgrounds.” (Ahmed,2013a)
55:3081:152256:31:22:85:541:605:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Philip Salzman extends this reasoning and argues that Islam, at its inception, was structured as
55:3082:152352:22:43:70:541:583:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an amalgamation of segmentary lineage societies and was designed to unite these tribes against
55:3083:152553:43:22:70:541:540:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extending  the  basic  tribal  principle  of  balanced  opposition.  This  Muhammad  did  by  opposing
55:3084:152655:22:22:70:541:518:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Muslim to the infidel, and the dar al-Islam, the land of Islam and peace, to the dar al-harb,
55:3085:152752:22:22:70:541:496:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the land of the infidels and conflict.  Balanced opposition was raised to a higher structural level
55:3086:152851:22:22:70:541:474:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the newly Muslim tribes were unified in the face of the infidel enemy” (Salzman,2007, pp.
55:3087:152944:22:22:70:541:452:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:137–138).  In this conceptualization, the entire Islamic world comprises the largest tribal segment
55:3088:153043:22:22:70:541:430:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that is compelled to unite against any non-Muslim – infidels,  the West,  or the dar al-harb.  For
55:3089:153141:22:22:70:541:408:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Salzman,  an  understanding  of  segmentary  organization  becomes  crucial  to  understanding  all
55:3090:153240:22:22:70:177:386:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Islam-fueled violence.
55:3091:153262:22:22:85:541:364:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This logic is moreover not confined to the writing of academic anthropologists. Philip Zeman,
55:3092:153355:22:22:70:541:342:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a strategist with the U.S. Marine Corps,  has argued that there is a strong relationship between
55:3093:153451:22:22:70:541:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary organization and “terror.”  He writes not only that “members of Islamist extremist
55:3094:153544:22:22:70:541:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups commonly come from societies with strong tribal [segmentary] traditions” but also that
55:3095:153637:22:21:70:541:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:there are explicit links between tribal organization and violent extremism (Zeman,2009, p.682).
55:3096:153732:21:22:70:541:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For Zeman, there is a national security “need for in-depth understanding of tribal systems and
55:3097:153826:22:22:70:234:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:influences” (Zeman,2009, p.682).
55:3098:153858:22:22:85:541:211:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Although  our  analysis  has  focused  specifically  on  the  African  context,  our  findings  have
55:3099:153958:22:22:70:541:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  potential  to  explain  conflict  elsewhere.   They  raise  the  possibility  that  segmentary  lineage
55:3100:154066:22:41:70:333:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization may be a crucial driver of global conflict.
55:3101:154122:41:33:70:147:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:C:8.  Conclusion
55:3102:154136:33:22:70:541:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We have tested a long-standing hypothesis from the anthropology literature about the relationship
55:3103:154233:22:0:70:541:71:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between  segmentary  lineage  organization  and  conflict.   A  rich  ethnographic  literature  suggests
56:3104:154339:0:22:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that segmentary lineage organization results in large numbers of men being mobilized for warfare
56:3105:154435:22:22:70:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:anytime there is a dispute or conflict.  This is true when the initial feud is between individuals
56:3106:154533:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:within the same segment, but especially when it is between individuals from different segments or
56:3107:154630:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineages. To investigate these ideas, we collected information from existing ethnographic sources
56:3108:154727:22:22:70:406:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the social structure of145ethnic groups from sub-Saharan Africa.
56:3109:154794:22:22:85:541:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our first strategy was to examine the cross-ethnicity relationship between the historical pres-
56:3110:154889:22:22:70:541:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ence of a segmentary lineage system and measures of conflict today.  Our second empirical strat-
56:3111:154985:22:22:70:541:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:egy was to restrict our analysis to pairs of contiguous ethnic groups where one ethnic group was
56:3112:155081:22:21:70:541:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:traditionally organized based on segmentary lineages and the other was not. Examining variation
56:3113:155176:21:22:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across10km-by-10km grid-cells,  we estimated the effect of segmentary lineage organization on
56:3114:155269:22:22:70:541:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflict using a regression discontinuity (RD) approach. This strategy allowed us to better control
56:3115:155368:22:22:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for any omitted factors that change smoothly over space, such as geographic factors, ecological
56:3116:155463:22:22:70:541:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics, or historical shocks. Using either strategy, we found a strong positive relationship
56:3117:155564:22:22:70:364:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between segmentary lineage organization and conflict today.
56:3118:155623:22:22:85:541:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Motivated by the existing case-study and historical literatures, which suggest that the primary
56:3119:155718:22:22:70:541:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consequence of segmentary lineages is to cause the escalation of conflicts that otherwise would
56:3120:155813:22:22:70:541:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have been relatively small, we turned to an examination of mechanisms. Estimating hazard mod-
56:3121:155906:22:22:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:els, we found robust evidence that segmentary lineage organization prolongs conflicts once they
56:3122:156001:22:22:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:start.  The estimated effects on conflict onset, although positive, were smaller in magnitude and
56:3123:156098:22:22:70:541:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less robust. We also examined the effects of segmentary lineage organization on the prevalence of
56:3124:156195:22:22:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conflicts of different sizes. We found that although segmentary lineage organization is positively
56:3125:156293:22:21:70:541:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:associated  with  conflicts  of  all  sizes,  the  relationship  was  much  larger  in  magnitude  and  more
56:3126:156401:21:22:70:285:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:precisely estimated for larger-scale conflicts.
56:3127:156448:22:22:85:541:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  final  exercise  that  we  undertook  was  to  examine  the  differential  ability  of  segmentary
56:3128:156551:22:22:70:541:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage and non-segmentary lineage societies to cope with adverse rainfall shocks.  Examining a
56:3129:156646:22:22:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:monthly panel at the ethnicity-level, we first documented a positive relationship between adverse
56:3130:156743:22:22:70:541:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rainfall  shocks  and  conflict  across  the145ethnic  groups  in  our  sample.   We  then  allowed  the
56:3131:156847:22:22:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect to differ for segmentary lineage and non-segmentary lineage societies and found that the
56:3132:156942:22:22:70:541:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average effect was being driven solely by segmentary lineage societies.  Among non-segmentary
56:3133:157035:22:22:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lineage  societies,  there  was  no  relationship  between  adverse  rainfall  shocks  and  conflict.   This
56:3134:157143:22:0:70:541:66:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that segmentary lineage societies are less successful at containing conflicts that results
57:3135:157244:0:22:70:210:724:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from adverse rainfall shocks.
57:3136:157273:22:22:85:541:702:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Although our analysis has focused specifically on the African context, our results are applica-
57:3137:157368:22:22:70:541:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ble outside of Africa, where segmentary lineage organization is also common. Outside of Africa,
57:3138:157463:22:22:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  especially  in  the  Middle  East,  there  are  many  examples  of  prolonged  conflicts  involving
57:3139:157567:22:22:70:541:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups that are traditionally organized in segmentary lineages.  Thus, our findings suggest that
57:3140:157663:22:50:70:484:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segmentary lineage organization may be an important determinant of global conflict.
