2:41:2553:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper explores the effect of news shocks on the current account and other macroeconomic variables
2:42:2655:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:using worldwide giant oil discoveries as a directly observable measure of news shocks about future
2:43:2753:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:output–the delay between a discovery and production is on average 4 to 6 years. We first present a
2:44:2851:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:two-sector small open economy model in order to predict the responses of macroeconomic aggregates
2:45:2948:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to news of an oil discovery.  We then estimate the effects of giant oil discoveries on a large panel of
2:46:3051:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:countries. Our empirical estimates are consistent with the predictions of the model.  After an oil discovery,
2:47:3160:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the current account and saving rate decline for the first 5 years and then rise sharply during the ensuing
2:48:3266:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:years. Investment rises robustly soon after the news arrives, while GDP does not increase until after
2:49:3367:14:42:72:405:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:5 years. Employment rates fall slightly for a sustained period of time.

3:71:3877:16:21:72:75:676:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:72:3877:21:21:72:539:655:144:Times:144:Times:Economists  have  long  explored  how  changes  in  expectations  affect  the  behavior  of  forward-
3:73:3978:21:21:71:545:634:144:Times:144:Times:looking  agents.  This  literature  dates  back  at  least  to  Pigou  (1927)  and  Keynes  (1936)  who  
3:74:4083:21:20:72:544:613:144:Times:144:Times:suggested  that  changes  in  expectations  may  be  important  in  driving  economic  fluctuations.    In  
3:75:4191:20:21:72:544:593:144:Times:144:Times:closed-economy  macroeconomics,  a  seminal  paper  by  Beaudry  and  Portier  (2006)  triggered  a  
3:76:4292:21:21:72:545:572:144:Times:144:Times:resurgence  of  interest  in  news-driven  business  cycles  by  providing  evidence  that  news  about  
3:77:4397:21:20:72:544:551:144:Times:144:Times:future  productivity  could  explain  half  of  business  cycle  fluctuations  in  the  United  States.  Since  
3:78:4509:20:21:72:542:531:144:Times:144:Times:then, there has been a growing number of studies using various identification methods to explore 
3:79:4606:21:21:72:544:510:144:Times:144:Times:the  importance  of  so-called  “news  shocks”  in  driving  business  cycles.    Most  of  the  existing  
3:80:4713:21:20:72:545:489:144:Times:144:Times:studies  rely  on  structural  vector  autoregressive  models  (VAR)  or  on  structural  estimation  of  
3:81:4819:20:21:72:545:469:144:Times:144:Times:standard  dynamic  stochastic  general  equilibrium  models.    In  open-economy  macroeconomics,  
3:82:4918:21:21:72:543:448:144:Times:144:Times:the intertemporal approach to the current account has sought to explain fluctuations in the current 
3:83:5018:21:21:72:544:427:144:Times:144:Times:account as the optimal response to changing expectations of future output growth (e.g. Obstfeld 
3:84:5114:21:20:72:543:406:144:Times:144:Times:and Rogoff (1995), Engel and Rogers (2006)).  The main challenge in both literatures has been to 
3:85:5211:20:21:72:543:386:144:Times:144:Times:identify  news  shocks  and  to  provide  evidence  of  “anticipation  effects”  following  those  shocks.  
3:86:5319:21:21:72:545:365:144:Times:144:Times:Unfortunately,  there  is  little  direct  evidence  of  the  empirical  relevance  of  the  effect  of  news  
3:87:5430:21:30:72:258:344:144:Times:144:Times:shocks on macroeconomic variables.1  
3:88:5467:30:21:71:545:314:144:Times:144:Times:This  paper  provides  empirical  evidence  of  the  effect  of  news  shocks  on  the  current  account,  
3:89:5574:21:21:72:544:293:144:Times:144:Times:saving, investment, GDP, consumption, and employment using plausibly exogenous variation in 
3:90:5666:21:20:71:544:272:144:Times:144:Times:the  timing  of  worldwide  giant  oil  discoveries  as  a  directly  observable  measure  of  news  shocks  
3:91:5775:20:21:71:544:252:144:Times:144:Times:about higher future output.  The delay between a discovery and production is on average 4 to 6 
3:92:5870:21:21:71:544:231:144:Times:144:Times:years.2 We first extend the Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008) small open economy model to include 
3:93:5962:21:20:72:544:210:144:Times:144:Times:two  sectors,  where  one  sector  is  a  resource  sector  with  oil  discoveries.    We  use  this  model  to  
3:94:6075:20:21:72:544:190:144:Times:144:Times:develop  the  macroeconomic  predictions  for  news  about  oil  discoveries  and  to  determine  how  
3:95:6178:21:9:72:218:169:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
3:96:6238:9:17:72:542:160:64:Times:100:Times:1 Some of the few examples are in the fiscal literature, which has employed measures of news of future fiscal actions 
3:97:6356:17:12:71:518:143:100:Times:100:Times:(e.g. Ramey (2011), Barro and Redlick (2011), Mertens and Ravn (2012), Kueng (2012)).  Alexopoulos (2011) 
3:98:6462:12:11:71:484:131:100:Times:100:Times:measures productivity shocks with book publications, but the publications represent information about 
3:99:6564:11:7:71:337:120:100:Times:100:Times:contemporaneous innovations, not news about future innovations. 
3:100:6628:7:16:72:543:113:42:Times:100:Times:2 Thereafter we refer to discoveries of giant oil (including condensate) and gas fields as simply giant oil discoveries. 
3:101:6749:16:12:72:543:97:100:Times:100:Times:A giant oil discovery is defined as a discovery of an oil and/or gas field that contains at least a total of 500 million 
3:102:6870:12:11:72:546:85:100:Times:100:Times:barrels  of  ultimately  recoverable  oil  equivalent.  Ultimately  recoverable  reserve  refers  to  the  amount  that  is  
3:103:6995:11:0:72:276:74:100:Times:100:Times:technically recoverable given existing technology. 
4:104:7049:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:they  might  differ  from  the  standard  aggregate  TFP  news  shock.    In  the  empirical  work,  we  
4:105:7154:20:21:71:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:construct  a  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  oil  discovery  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  at  the  time  of  
4:106:7268:21:21:71:547:667:144:Times:144:Times:the  discovery.  The  NPV  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  gross  oil  revenue  derived  from  an  
4:107:7369:21:20:71:546:646:144:Times:144:Times:approximated  oil  production  profile  discounted  by  country-specific  discounting  factors,  and  
4:108:7471:20:21:71:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:valued at the oil price prevailing at the time of the discovery. We then estimate a dynamic panel 
4:109:7569:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:distributed lag model over a sample covering the period 1970-2012 for up to 130 countries. Our 
4:110:7664:21:20:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:empirical estimates of the effects of oil discoveries on key macroeconomic variables are largely 
4:111:7761:20:31:71:294:564:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with the predictions of our model.   
4:112:7809:31:21:71:544:533:144:Times:144:Times:A  historical  example  of  giant  oil  discoveries  is  Norway.  The  country  borrowed  extensively  to  
4:113:7916:21:21:71:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:build up its North Sea oil production facilities following the first several discoveries in the late 
4:114:8017:21:20:71:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:1960s  and  early  1970s  (see  Obsfeld  and  Rogoff,  1995  pp.  1751  and  Figure  2.3).  Meanwhile,  
4:115:8121:20:21:71:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:Norway’s saving rate also declined due to the expectation about higher future output. The rise in 
4:116:8219:21:21:71:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:investment and the decline in saving translated into a sharp current account deficit approaching 
4:117:8316:21:20:72:545:429:144:Times:144:Times:minus  15  percent  of  GDP  at  its  trough  in  the  year  1977.  The  current  account  then  started  to  
4:118:8426:20:21:72:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:improve as saving began to rise and investment demand declined following the start of massive 
4:119:8520:21:31:72:129:388:144:Times:144:Times:oil exports. 
4:120:8533:31:20:72:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:This  example  illustrates  three  unique  features  of  giant  oil  discoveries  that  make  them  an  ideal  
4:121:8644:20:21:72:544:337:144:Times:144:Times:candidate  for  a  measure  of  news  about  future  production  possibilities:  the  relatively  significant  
4:122:8755:21:21:72:546:316:144:Times:144:Times:size,  the  production  lag,  and  the  plausible  exogenous  timing  of  discoveries.  First,  giant  oil  
4:123:8863:21:21:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries  represent  a  significant  amount  of  oil  revenue  for  a  typical  country  of  modest  size.  
4:124:8974:21:20:72:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:The median value of the constructed NPV as a percentage of country’s GDP is about 9 percent. 
4:125:9067:20:21:72:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:Giant oil discoveries provide a unique source of macro-relevant news shocks since it is difficult 
4:126:9165:21:21:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:to find other direct measures of news shocks at the country level that have similar significance. 
4:127:9263:21:20:72:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:Second,  giant  oil  discoveries  do  not  immediately  translate  into  production.  Instead,  there  is  an  
4:128:9374:20:21:72:545:192:144:Times:144:Times:initial  burst  of  oil  field  investment  for  several  years  and  production  typically  starts  with  a  
4:129:9484:21:21:72:544:171:144:Times:144:Times:substantial  delay  of  4  to  6  years  on  average  following  the  discovery.  Giant  oil  discoveries  thus  
4:130:9597:21:20:72:546:150:144:Times:144:Times:constitute  news  about  future  output  shocks.  This  feature  is  unique  in  the  sense  that  other  
4:131:9703:20:21:72:544:130:144:Times:144:Times:plausibly  exogenous  shocks  used  in  other  strands  of  literature  and  based  on  directly  observable  
4:132:9813:21:21:72:548:109:144:Times:144:Times:measures   such   as   natural   disasters   are   contemporaneous.   Third,   the   timing   of   giant   oil   
4:133:9926:21:0:72:547:88:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries  is  plausibly  exogenous  and  unpredictable  due  to  the  uncertain  nature  of  oil  
5:134:10030:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:exploration. Thus exploiting the variation in the timing of giant oil discoveries provides a unique 
5:135:10130:20:31:71:327:688:144:Times:144:Times:way to identify the news effect on macro variables. 3 
5:136:10183:31:21:72:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:The unique timing characteristic of oil discoveries provides a methodological contribution to the 
5:137:10281:21:20:72:546:636:144:Times:144:Times:identification  problem  of  news  shocks  and  the  associated  anticipation  effects  in  the  recent  
5:138:10386:20:21:72:545:616:144:Times:144:Times:literature  on  “expectation  driven”  business  cycles  and  current  account  movements.  Standard  
5:139:10488:21:21:72:546:595:144:Times:144:Times:approaches  in  this  literature  rely  on  VARs  or  DSGE  models,  both  of  which  require  many  
5:140:10589:21:20:72:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:untested  identification  assumptions  and  are  thus  subject  to  debate.  Exploiting  the  natural  lags  
5:141:10698:20:21:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:between giant oil discoveries and the subsequent increase in production provides a unique way to 
5:142:10795:21:21:72:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:directly  measure  news  shocks  about  future  output  increase.  In  turn,  that  allows  us  to  conduct  a  
5:143:10907:21:21:72:544:512:144:Times:144:Times:quasi-natural  experiment  that  does  not  rely  on  identification  using  VARs  or  parametric  DSGE  
5:144:11012:21:20:72:545:491:144:Times:144:Times:models.    Our  approach  provides  direct  evidence  on  how  news  shocks  affect  macroeconomic  
5:145:11112:20:21:72:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:variables.  While our approach cannot answer the question of what fraction of output or current 
5:146:11208:21:21:72:546:450:144:Times:144:Times:account  fluctuations  are  driven  by  news  shocks,  our  results  can  help  answer  this  question  
5:147:11312:21:20:72:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:indirectly  because  our  response  estimates  can  be  used  to  test  which  of  the  competing  VAR  or  
5:148:11420:20:31:71:482:409:144:Times:144:Times:DSGE identification schemes yield responses that are consistent with our estimates.   
5:149:11506:31:21:71:543:378:144:Times:144:Times:To estimate the dynamic impact of giant oil discoveries on macro variables, we adopt a dynamic 
5:150:11601:21:20:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:panel distributed lag model. Panel techniques including year- and country- fixed effects allow us 
5:151:11699:20:21:71:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:to control for global common shocks and cross-country difference in time invariant factors such 
5:152:11795:21:21:71:546:316:144:Times:144:Times:as  countries’  geographical  location,  institutions,  and  culture.  In  addition,  exploiting  solely  
5:153:11901:21:21:71:547:295:144:Times:144:Times:within-country  variations  in  the  timing  of  the  giant  oil  discoveries  allay  concerns  about  
5:154:12004:21:20:71:546:274:144:Times:144:Times:endogeneity  bias  that  would  have  otherwise  resulted  from  omitted  variable  problems.  The  
5:155:12104:20:21:71:544:254:144:Times:144:Times:impulse  responses  are  qualitatively  consistent  with  the  predictions  of  the  model.  In  the  years  
5:156:12213:21:21:71:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:immediately following the discoveries, the current account decreases significantly as investment 
5:157:12310:21:20:71:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:rises  and  the  saving  rate  declines.  Five  years  after  the  discovery,  the  average  effect  of  giant  oil  
5:158:12427:20:21:71:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries  on  the  current  account  turns  positive  and  significant,  as  output  and  saving  rise  and  
5:159:12539:21:21:71:545:171:144:Times:144:Times:investment  declines.  A  peak  effect  is  reached  about  eight  years  following  the  discovery  after  
5:160:12647:21:16:71:545:150:144:Times:144:Times:which  the  effect  of  giant  oil  discoveries  gradually  declines.  Interestingly,  employment  rates

5:162:12813:8:18:72:544:126:64:Times:100:Times:3 A  limited  number  of  papers  have  used  giant  oil  discoveries  in  the  context  of  studies  of  democratization  and  
5:163:12941:18:11:72:543:108:100:Times:100:Times:conflicts.  Tsui  (2011)  explores  the  impact  of  giant  oil  discoveries  on  medium  run  democratization.  Cotet  and  Tsui  
5:164:13072:11:12:72:543:97:100:Times:100:Times:(2013)  and  Lei  and  Michael  (2011)  study  the  relationship  between  giant  oil  discoveries  and  civil  conflicts.  To  the  
5:165:13205:12:11:72:544:85:100:Times:100:Times:extent  of  our  knowledge,  we  are  the  first  to  exploit  the  timing  of  giant  oil  discoveries  to  test  the  predictions  of  a  
5:166:13345:11:0:72:172:74:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:macro model with news. 
6:167:13371:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:decline  after  the  news  arrives  and  remain  below  normal  for  over  10  years.  We  also  explore  
6:168:13477:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:empirically the respective roles of the private and public sectors in explaining our main results. 
6:169:13576:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:We find that the private investment-GDP ratio rises robustly, but that the public investment-GDP 
6:170:13673:21:20:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:ratio  falls.    In  contrast,  the  total  consumption  response  is  driven  by  both  an  increase  in  private  
6:171:13789:20:31:72:395:626:144:Times:144:Times:and public consumption, though the estimates are very imprecise.   
6:172:13856:31:21:71:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:Our  results  are  robust  to  a  wide  array  of  checks.  First,  we  use  two  alternative  measures  of  oil  
6:173:13970:21:20:71:545:574:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries:  the  NPV  with  constant  production  profile  and  the  NPV  with  common  discount  
6:174:14070:20:21:71:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:factors  across  countries.  The  impulse  responses  are  virtually  the  same,  which  implies  that  our  
6:175:14179:21:21:71:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:results are not subject to the way we construct the NPV. Second, we find that our results are not 
6:176:14277:21:21:71:544:512:144:Times:144:Times:driven  by  a  particular  group  of  countries.  Removing  groups  of  countries  including  countries  in  
6:177:14386:21:20:71:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:Middle  East  and  North  Africa,  major  oil  exporters  or  countries  without  any  discoveries  do  not  
6:178:14495:20:21:71:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:alter  the  pattern  of  the  dynamic  effects  of  giant  oil  discoveries.  Third,  because  discoveries  that  
6:179:14609:21:21:71:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:immediately follow a discovery could be seen as predictable, we check whether our main results 
6:180:14704:21:20:71:545:429:144:Times:144:Times:still  hold  if  we  remove  them.  We  also  selectively  use  discoveries  that  occurred  when  no  
6:181:14807:20:21:71:544:409:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries  happen  in  the  last  past  three  years  and  separately  control  for  current  and  lagged  
6:182:14916:21:21:71:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:values  of  exploration  expenditures.  All  our  results  are  virtually  unchanged.  Finally,  our  results  
6:183:15027:21:20:71:544:367:144:Times:144:Times:are  also  robust  to  using  different  model  specifications,  particularly  including  higher  order  lags  
6:184:15138:20:31:71:340:347:144:Times:144:Times:for the dependent variable and for giant oil discoveries. 
6:185:15196:31:21:71:544:316:144:Times:144:Times:  Our  paper  has  implications  for  the  news-driven  business  cycles  hypothesis.    Barro  and  King  
6:186:15303:21:21:71:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:(1984)  and  Cochrane  (1994)  pointed  out  that  in  a  standard  RBC  model  news  about  future  TFP  
6:187:15409:21:20:71:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:could not be a driver of business cycles since news about future production possibilities should 
6:188:15506:20:21:71:544:254:144:Times:144:Times:lead to an initial rise in consumption and fall in labor because of the wealth effect.  Using time 
6:189:15605:21:21:71:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:series techniques to identify news shocks from stock prices and TFP, Beaudry and Portier (2006) 
6:190:15701:21:20:71:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:found  empirical  evidence  that  labor  increased  in  response  to  news,  and  that  news  shocks  could  
6:191:15810:20:21:71:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:account  for  50  percent  of  the  business  cycle  variation  of  output.    Beaudry  and  Lucke  (2009),  
6:192:15919:21:21:71:542:171:144:Times:144:Times:Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012), Blanchard, L’Huillier and Lorenzoni (2012), and Kurmann and 
6:193:16011:21:20:71:545:150:144:Times:144:Times:Otrok  (2013)  used  other  techniques  to  reach  similar  conclusions.  In  response,  Beaudry  and  
6:194:16114:20:21:71:544:130:144:Times:144:Times:Portier  (2004),  Jaimovich  and  Rebelo  (2008,  2009),  den  Haan  and  Katlenrunner  (2009),  and  
6:195:16216:21:21:71:547:109:144:Times:144:Times:others  developed  models  that  could  produce  an  increase  in  labor  input  in  response  to  news.    
6:196:16324:21:0:71:544:88:144:Times:144:Times:More  recently,  however,  Barsky  and  Sims  (2011)  and  Barsky,  Basu  and  Lee  (2014)  have  used  
7:197:16431:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:time  series  techniques  to  identify  news  shocks  from  consumer  confidence  and  found  that  news  
7:198:16537:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:shocks did not generate business cycle fluctuations.  Moreover, Fisher (2010) and Kurmann and 
7:199:16631:21:21:71:548:667:144:Times:144:Times:Mertens  (2014)  have  highlighted  problems  with  Beaudry  and  Portier’s  identification  method.    
7:200:16735:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, the empirical work based on time series identification is in flux. 4  To our knowledge, we 
7:201:16832:20:21:72:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:are the first to employ direct measures of news about future output.  As we will demonstrate later, 
7:202:16932:21:31:72:463:605:144:Times:144:Times:the results are not consistent with news as a driver of business cycle fluctuations. 
7:203:17017:31:20:72:543:574:144:Times:144:Times:This paper also provides direct evidence for the classic intertemporal trade model of the current 
7:204:17115:20:21:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:account (e.g. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995)).  That model uses insights from the permanent income 
7:205:17210:21:21:72:545:533:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesis  to  make  predictions  about  the  current  account  based  on  the  intertemporal  budget  
7:206:17314:21:21:72:544:512:144:Times:144:Times:constraint  of  an  open  economy.    Testing  the  present  value  model  is  difficult,  though,  because  
7:207:17423:21:20:72:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:there  are  few  direct  measures  of  expectations  about  future  output  or  productivity.    Typically,  
7:208:17532:20:21:71:546:471:144:Times:144:Times:time  series  methods  are  used  to  identify  effects,  but  often  the  results  are  sensitive  to  the  
7:209:17641:21:21:71:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:particular  assumptions  used  (e.g.  Ghosh  and  Ostry (1995), Bergin and Sheffrin (2000), Corsetti 
7:210:17742:21:20:71:545:429:144:Times:144:Times:and  Konstantinou  (2012)).  We  find  evidence  for  a  statistically  and  economically  significant  
7:211:17846:20:21:71:545:409:144:Times:144:Times:anticipation  effect  on  the  current  account  through  both  the  saving  and  investment  channels  
7:212:17950:21:21:71:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:following  the  announcement  of  a  giant  oil  discovery,  supporting  the  view  that  expectations  can  
7:213:18059:21:20:72:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:be an important driving force for the current account dynamics. Thus, this empirical finding also 
7:214:18157:20:21:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:contributes  to  a  broader  literature  exploring  the  empirical  determinants  of  the  current  account  
7:215:18266:21:31:72:468:326:144:Times:144:Times:and its adjustment to shocks (e.g. Chinn and Prasad, 2003; Chinn and Wei, 2013). 
7:216:18347:31:21:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a two-sector small open 
7:217:18443:21:20:72:545:274:144:Times:144:Times:economy  model  to  develop  the  implications  of  news  from  giant  oil  discoveries.  Section  III  
7:218:18547:20:21:72:544:254:144:Times:144:Times:discusses the relevance of using giant oil discoveries. Section IV lays out the empirical strategy 
7:219:18646:21:21:71:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:and  Section  V  presents  the  main  results.  Section  VI  presents  some  extensions  and  Section  VII  
7:220:18754:21:34:71:328:212:144:Times:144:Times:discusses robustness checks. Section VIII concludes.

13:425:28849:31:21:72:544:625:144:Times:144:Times:In the typical model, the news shock is represented as news that aggregate TFP will increase at 
13:426:28945:21:20:72:542:604:144:Times:144:Times:some later date.  Since the economy starts in a steady-state with positive capital and labor inputs, 
13:427:29046:20:21:72:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:output will rise when aggregate TFP rises at the future date even if there is no new investment or 
13:428:29145:21:21:72:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:change in labor supply.  This is not the case with giant oil discoveries.  Although the reserves are 
13:429:29246:21:20:71:543:542:144:Times:144:Times:known to exist as soon as the discovery is made, no oil can be extracted until capital and labor 
13:430:29343:20:21:71:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:have  been  reallocated.    Moreover,  most  of  the  investment  in  capital  in  the  new  oil  field  must  
13:431:29454:21:21:71:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:occur before the first barrel of oil is extracted.  Figure I shows oilfield investment and production 
13:432:29556:21:21:71:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:for two oilfields in Norway.  Note how investment displays a dramatic hump after discovery, but 
13:433:29652:21:20:71:545:459:144:Times:144:Times:that  oil  production  starts  only  after  investment  falls  toward  zero.    At  the  Heidrun  oilfield,  
13:434:29761:20:21:71:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:production  rises  rapidly  before  gradually  declining.    At  the  Draugen  oilfield,  production  rises  
13:435:29870:21:31:71:352:418:144:Times:144:Times:more gradually and declines at a faster rate after the peak.

13:445:30486:21:20:72:544:211:144:Times:144:Times:take  into  account  the  fact  that  investment  in  exploration  increases  the  probability  of  discovery  
13:446:30597:20:21:72:545:191:144:Times:144:Times:and  that  production  leads  to  resource  depletion.    Because  optimal  resource  extraction  is  not  
13:447:30704:21:21:72:545:170:144:Times:144:Times:central  to  the  current  application,  we  model  this  feature  with  an  exogenous  depletion  rate

14:453:31196:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.  Our baseline calibration is summarized in Table I.  Most of the parameters are similar

14:455:31402:20:21:71:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:match  our  data.    For  example,  the  value  of  γ  is  set  so  that  preferences  are  very  close  to  GHH  
14:456:31516:21:21:71:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:preferences  and  χ  is  set  so  that  the  elasticity  of  interest  rates  is  very  low. 7      We  set  the  world  
14:457:31637:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:interest rate to 10 percent to match the average of the risk adjusted interest rate in our data.  The

14:459:31849:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:Hansen (2013), we set the labor share to 13 percent and the capital share to 49 percent, leaving a 
14:460:31948:21:31:72:506:522:144:Times:121:g_d0_f3:resource share of 38 percent.  These numbers are also broadly consistent with U.S. data.8

14:473:33013:21:21:72:544:236:144:Times:144:Times:and  the  case  of  discovery  with  immediate  availability  is  shown  by  the  green  dashed  line.    The  
14:474:33124:21:20:72:543:215:144:Times:144:Times:upper left graph of Figure II shows that news about future resources leads the current account to 
14:475:33222:20:21:72:543:195:144:Times:144:Times:turn sharply negative for five years before becoming positive.  The ratio of saving to GDP is also 
14:476:33321:21:24:72:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:negative  for  several  years  before  becoming  very  positive.    The  declines  in  the  current  account  
14:477:33431:24:8:72:218:150:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
14:478:33491:8:14:72:476:142:64:Times:100:Times:7 We choose a value for χ half way between Jaimovich-Rebelo’s and Schmitt-Grohe-Uribe’s values. 
14:479:33586:14:17:72:499:128:64:Times:100:Times:8 For example, in the U.S. labor share is 13 percent of value added in the oil and gas extraction sectors.  A 
14:480:33696:17:12:72:539:111:100:Times:100:Times:comparison of the estimates of the value of resources in The Survey of Current Business, April 1994, pp. 50-72 with 
14:481:33812:12:8:72:528:99:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:the BEA estimates of fixed capital by industry suggest that our capital and resource shares are roughly consistent. 
14:482:33928:8:17:72:503:91:64:Times:100:Times:9 Note that this latter case is similar to an unanticipated rise in the relative price of oil that is expected to be 
14:483:34045:17:0:72:196:74:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:persistent but not permanent.   
15:484:34081:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:and  the  ratio  of  saving  to  GDP  are  due  to  the  anticipation  effect  of  future  resource  and  output  
15:485:34195:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:increases.  In  contrast,  when  the  resources  are  immediately  available  the  current  account-GDP  
15:486:34300:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:ratio turns only slightly negative for couple of years and the saving-GDP ratio is always positive. 
15:487:34400:21:20:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:The  saving-GDP  ratio  rises  because  households  smooth  their  consumption  over  time  since  the  
15:488:34504:20:21:71:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:shock is not permanent.  The slight decline in the current account-GDP ratio is due to the rising 
15:489:34602:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:investment-GDP ratio, as shown in the lower left graph, which makes the response of the current 
15:490:34698:21:20:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:account-GDP  ratio  for  the  immediate  availability  case  different  from  the  pure  endowment  
15:491:34798:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:economy. As discussed by Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé (2014), unanticipated persistent shocks (e.g. 
15:492:34893:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:the  contemporaneous  oil  shock)  can  have  negative  impact  effects  on  the  current  account  in  an  
15:493:35001:21:21:72:551:522:144:Times:144:Times:economy    with    modest    investment    adjustment    cost.    However,    when    the    shock    is    
15:494:35109:21:20:72:548:501:144:Times:144:Times:contemporaneous,   rising   investment   is   the   only   channel   leading   to   the   counter-cyclical   
15:495:35218:20:21:72:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:movement of the current account.  In contrast, the news shocks leads to counter-cyclicality of the 
15:496:35317:21:31:72:458:460:144:Times:144:Times:current account through two channels: rising investment and declining savings.  
15:497:35397:31:20:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:The  upper  right  graph  shows  the  results  for  GDP.    In  the  case  of  news  about  future  resources,  
15:498:35509:20:21:72:545:409:144:Times:144:Times:GDP  rises  very  little  during  the  first  five  years,  and  then  shoots  up  rapidly  before  gradually  
15:499:35620:21:21:71:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:declining.    In  contrast,  shocks  to  current  resources  cause  output  to  jump  immediately.    It  stays  
15:500:35733:21:20:71:546:367:144:Times:144:Times:high  for  several  years  during  which  the  reallocation  of  capital  and  labor  to  the  oil  sector  
15:501:35841:20:31:71:319:347:144:Times:144:Times:overcomes the exogenous depletion, and then falls. 
15:502:35892:31:21:71:545:316:144:Times:144:Times:Consumption  jumps  immediately  in  both  experiments,  as  one  would  expect  from  a  positive  
15:503:35992:21:21:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:wealth shock.  It jumps more for the contemporaneous shock because the wealth effect is greater 
15:504:36088:21:30:71:423:274:144:Times:144:Times:since the present discounted value of the increase in resources is greater. 
15:505:36164:30:21:71:542:244:144:Times:144:Times:The biggest qualitative difference is in the response of hours.  The contemporaneous shock to the 
15:506:36262:21:21:71:543:223:144:Times:144:Times:oil sector leads to a rise in hours during the first five years, followed by oscillations around zero 
15:507:36364:21:20:71:544:202:144:Times:144:Times:thereafter.    In  contrast,  hours  fall  in  both  the  short-run  and  the  medium  run  in  the  case  of  the  
15:508:36480:20:21:71:544:182:144:Times:144:Times:news  shock.10    Thus,  even  when  we  use  preferences  that  are  close  to  GHH  preferences,  thus  
15:509:36586:21:21:72:543:161:144:Times:144:Times:shutting down most of the wealth effect on labor supply, we find that hours fall in response to a 
15:510:36684:21:40:72:436:140:144:Times:144:Times:news shock.  This is in contrast to Jaimovich and Rebelo’s (2008) findings. 
15:511:36760:40:9:72:218:100:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
15:512:36820:9:17:72:521:91:64:Times:100:Times:10 It should be noted, though, that in both cases the response of hours is small, only one-tenth of the response of 
15:513:36936:17:0:72:252:74:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:aggregate GDP (note the scale of the graph). 
16:514:36985:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:In  order  to  understand  whether  the  special  features  of  the  oil  sector  –  low  labor  share  and  high  
16:515:37100:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:capital  share  –  account  for  the  differences  in  our  model’s  predictions  relative  to  Jaimovich  and  
16:516:37212:21:21:72:546:667:144:Times:144:Times:Rebelo’s  model,  we  conduct  two  additional  experiments.  The  first  experiment  compares  the  
16:517:37313:21:20:72:545:646:144:Times:144:Times:effect  of  the  oil  news  shock  to  the  effect  of  a  news  shock  on  TFP  in  a  standard  one-sector  
16:518:37423:20:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:economy, similar to the experiment analyzed in Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008).  In both cases, the 
16:519:37519:21:21:72:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:news arrives five years before the increase in resources or TFP.  Figure III shows these results.  
16:520:37618:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:The paths of GDP look very similar across the experiments, in part because we normalized their 
16:521:37713:20:21:72:540:564:144:Times:144:Times:peaks  to  be  the  same.    The  qualitative  responses  of  the  current  account-GDP  ratio,  the  saving-
16:522:37822:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:GDP ratio, and the investment-GDP ratio are also similar across experiments, but the swings are 
16:523:37918:21:21:72:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:much more pronounced for the oil shock than for the aggregate TFP.  The magnification is due to 
16:524:38014:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:the required capital reallocation in the case of the oil shock, particularly since the capital share in 
16:525:38118:20:21:72:539:481:144:Times:144:Times:the  oil  sector  is  higher  than  in  sector  1.  The  responses  of  consumption  and  hours  are  hump-
16:526:38225:21:21:72:545:460:144:Times:144:Times:shaped  and  both  are  positive  for  the  TFP  shock.    Because  the  Jaimovich-Rebelo  preferences  
16:527:38329:21:20:72:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:induce nonseparability in consumption and hours, the consumption responses tend to mirror the 
16:528:38423:20:21:72:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:hours  responses.    Thus,  even  with  our  slightly  different  calibration  of  several  (non-oil  sector  
16:529:38533:21:21:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:related)  parameters,  our  use  of  an  annual  frequency,  and  longer  news  lags,  the  aggregate  TFP  
16:530:38641:21:30:72:298:377:144:Times:144:Times:news shock still has a positive effect on hours. 
16:531:38690:30:21:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:Our  second  experiment  is  designed  to  determine  whether  the  difference  in  results  is  due  to  the  
16:532:38801:21:21:72:546:326:144:Times:144:Times:special  nature  of  the  oil  sector,  with  its  low  labor  share  and  high  capital  share,  or  to  the  
16:533:38912:21:21:72:545:305:144:Times:144:Times:assumption  that  the  shock  hits  only  one  sector.    To  answer  this  question,  we  compare  our  
16:534:39017:21:20:72:545:284:144:Times:144:Times:baseline  model,  in  which  the  Sector  2  labor  share  is  0.13,  the  capital  share  is  0.49,  and  the  
16:535:39129:20:21:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:resource share is 0.38, to a model in which Sector 2 has a labor share equal to 0.4, capital share 
16:536:39228:21:21:72:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:equal  to  0.22,  and  a  resource  share  of  0.38.    Thus,  the  latter  parameterization  sets  the  ratio  of  
16:537:39344:21:20:72:544:222:144:Times:144:Times:labor  share  to  capital  share  equal  to  their  ratio  in  Sector  1,  which  are  standard  values  used  for  
16:538:39460:20:31:72:190:202:144:Times:144:Times:one-sector economies.11 
16:539:39483:31:21:72:543:171:144:Times:144:Times:Figure  IV  shows  the  results  of  the  second  experiment.    The  qualitative  responses  of  GDP,  the  
16:540:39592:21:20:72:547:150:144:Times:144:Times:current  account-GDP  ratio  and  the  saving-GDP  ratio  are  similar  across  experiments.  The  
16:541:39691:20:30:72:546:130:144:Times:144:Times:investment-GDP response is substantially muted in the experiment with the lower capital share.  
16:542:39787:30:9:72:218:100:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
16:543:39847:9:17:72:539:91:64:Times:100:Times:11 Alternatively, if we raise the labor share in the oil sector to 0.6 so that it is close to the one in Sector 1, and set the 
16:544:39974:17:0:72:528:74:100:Times:100:Times:capital share and resource share to 0.3 and 0.1 respectively, the response of investment and hours is very similar.  
17:545:40095:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:This  implies  that  a  large  portion  of  the  spike  in  investment  in  our  baseline  model  is  due  to  the  
17:546:40211:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:high  capital  share  in  the  resource  sector.  The  differences  in  the  responses  of  hours  are  more  
17:547:40321:21:21:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:complex.  We can see the responses of hours look very similar whether the oil sector is high or 
17:548:40417:21:20:71:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:low labor share in the interval between the arrival of the news and the start of oil production, but 
17:549:40518:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:differ  significantly  after  oil  production  starts.  The  decline  in  hours  during  the  initial  interval  is  
17:550:40635:21:21:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:due to the anticipated wealth effect, which is similar across experiments. However, after the oil 
17:551:40733:21:20:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:production  begins,  the  impact  of  reallocation  from  Sector  1  to  Sector  2  on  hours  crucially  
17:552:40839:20:21:72:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:depends  on  whether  Sector  2  is  labor  intensive  or  capital  intensive.  Thus,  when  oil  production  
17:553:40949:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:commences, the hours in the baseline case continue to decline as the reallocation effect leads to a 
17:554:41049:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:decline  in  labor  demand,  while  the  hours  become  significantly  positive  in  the  fifth  year  for  the  
17:555:41162:21:30:72:272:501:144:Times:144:Times:case of high labor share in the oil sector.  
17:556:41207:30:21:72:545:471:144:Times:144:Times:Thus,  our  theoretical  finding  of  a  negative  news  effect  on  hours  is  not  due  to  the  special  
17:557:41315:21:21:72:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:calibration required for a realistic oil sector. However, our finding of a sustained decline in hours 
17:558:41417:21:20:72:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:after  the  oil  is  produced  is dependent  on  the  special  features  of  the  oil  sector.    Perhaps  these  
17:559:41531:20:21:72:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:results on hours should not be a surprise, given Jaimovich and Rebelo’s (2009) two-sector model 
17:560:41627:21:21:72:542:388:144:Times:144:Times:results in a closed economy setting. They model consumption and investment goods sectors, and 
17:561:41721:21:20:72:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:assume the same labor and capital shares.  They show that the parameter space that is consistent 
17:562:41818:20:21:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:with  a  positive  effect  of  sector-specific  news  on  aggregate  hours  is  much  smaller  than  for  an  
17:563:41928:21:21:72:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate  shock;  indeed,  the  lower  panel  of  their  Table  1  shows  that  the  space  is  exceedingly  
17:564:42038:21:31:72:110:305:144:Times:144:Times:small.   
17:565:42047:31:20:72:542:274:144:Times:144:Times:To summarize, our theoretical analysis shows that the current account response to news is robust 
17:566:42144:20:21:72:546:254:144:Times:144:Times:to sector-specific news shocks (whether labor share is high or low) and to aggregate TFP shocks.  
17:567:42242:21:21:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:In every case, the current account becomes significantly negative for the five years between the 
17:568:42339:21:20:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:arrival of the news and the increase in resources.  In contrast, the behavior of some of the other 
17:569:42438:20:21:72:545:192:144:Times:144:Times:variables, such as labor input and consumption, depends significantly on the details of the shock.  
17:570:42538:21:21:72:542:171:144:Times:144:Times:In particular, we find that the positive response of hours to the news shock is a feature only of the 
17:571:42640:21:20:72:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:one-sector  model.    In  the  two-sector  model,  hours  decline  when  the  news  arrives  but  before  it  
17:572:42750:20:21:72:546:130:144:Times:144:Times:materializes,  no  matter  whether  the  labor  share  in  the  oil  sector  is  low  or  high.  After  oil  
17:573:42859:21:21:72:543:109:144:Times:144:Times:production starts, hours fall more if the labor share is low, while hours rise robustly if the labor 
17:574:42960:21:0:72:148:88:144:Times:144:Times:share is high.    
18:575:42982:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Testing the theory empirically presents serious challenges because it is difficult to find a source 
18:576:43082:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:of macro-relevant and country-specific news shocks. In the following sections, we use a unique 
18:577:43177:21:47:72:485:667:144:Times:144:Times:panel data of announcement of giant oil discoveries as news shocks to test the theory.

18:580:43302:26:20:72:543:572:144:Times:144:Times:Evaluating the empirical relevance of news shocks is quite challenging.  Difficulties arise on two 
18:581:43401:20:21:72:543:552:144:Times:144:Times:main fronts. First, our theory suggests that the main driving force is agents’ perception of future 
18:582:43501:21:21:71:544:531:144:Times:144:Times:availability  of  resource  input,  but  it  is  empirically  difficult  to  measure  agents’  expectation  as  is  
18:583:43617:21:20:71:545:510:144:Times:144:Times:well-known  from  the  literature  on  news  shocks.  As  discussed  earlier,  the  literature  generally  
18:584:43724:20:21:71:543:490:144:Times:144:Times:relies  on  subtle  identification  assumptions  in  the  context  of  VARs,  which  extract  news  shocks  
18:585:43832:21:21:71:544:469:144:Times:144:Times:from  stock  prices  or  surveys  of  expectations  about  the  future,  or  estimation  of  DSGE  models,  
18:586:43940:21:21:71:542:448:144:Times:144:Times:which are subject to controversies (see for instance, Beaudry and Portier, 2014). This approach is 
18:587:44039:21:20:71:543:427:144:Times:144:Times:even less promising if we want to test the effect of news shocks on the current account because, 
18:588:44136:20:21:71:544:407:144:Times:144:Times:as  pointed  out  by  Glick  and  Rogoff  (1995),  the  current  account  responds  to  country-specific  
18:589:44242:21:31:71:239:386:144:Times:144:Times:shocks, rather than global shocks.  
18:590:44278:31:20:71:544:355:144:Times:144:Times:We  adopt  a  quasi-natural  experiment  approach  to  test  the  dynamic  impact  of  news  shocks  on  
18:591:44383:20:21:71:544:335:144:Times:144:Times:output, the current account, saving, investment, consumption and employment by using giant oil 
18:592:44478:21:21:71:542:314:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries for a sample covering the period going from 1970 to 2012 and up to 130 countries. 12 
18:593:44574:21:20:71:543:293:144:Times:144:Times:Three unique features of giant oil discoveries make them ideal candidates for measures of news 
18:594:44669:20:21:71:543:273:144:Times:144:Times:about  future  output  increase.  In  turn,  exploiting  variation  in  the  timing  of  giant  oil  discoveries  
18:595:44783:21:21:71:543:252:144:Times:144:Times:allow us to adopt a quasi-natural experiment approach that does not rely on a VAR structure and 
18:596:44879:21:31:71:256:231:144:Times:144:Times:on subtle identification assumptions.   
18:597:44919:31:20:72:544:200:144:Times:144:Times:The  first  attractive  feature  of  giant  oil  discoveries  is  that  they  signal  significant  increases  in  
18:598:45033:20:21:72:545:180:144:Times:144:Times:production  possibilities  in  the  future.13    To  be  able  to  test  the  effect  of  news  shocks  on  the  
18:599:45146:21:22:72:543:159:144:Times:144:Times:dynamics  of  macroeconomic  aggregates,  particularly  to  isolate  a  significant  anticipation  effect,  
18:600:45254:22:9:72:218:137:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
18:601:45314:9:17:72:543:128:64:Times:100:Times:12  We  are  heavily  indebted  to  Mike  Horn,  former  President  of  the American Association of  Petroleum  Geologists,  
18:602:45439:17:8:71:424:111:100:Times:100:Times:for his guidance through some of the technical considerations discussed in this section.  
18:603:45529:8:18:72:542:103:64:Times:100:Times:13 For example, the IMF (2013a) released its latest estimation suggesting that the recent energy booming in the U.S. 
18:604:45646:18:11:71:542:85:100:Times:100:Times:could increase the real GDP in the U.S. by about 1.2 percent and employment by 0.5 percent over the next 12 years, 
18:605:45761:11:0:71:487:74:100:Times:121:Times:if the energy production is assumed to increase during this period due to the so called shale revolution.  
19:606:45871:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:those shocks must be significant for the whole economy. It might be difficult to find other output 
19:607:45970:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:shocks  at  the  country  level  that  have  the  macro-relevance  of  giant  oil  discoveries.  Moreover,  
19:608:46078:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:giant  oil  discoveries  are  relatively  rare  events  with  a  country-specific  location,  so  we  can  treat  
19:609:46192:21:30:72:235:646:144:Times:144:Times:them as country-specific shocks.  
19:610:46226:30:21:72:550:616:144:Times:144:Times:Second,  there  is  a  significant  delay  between  the  discovery  and  the  start  of  production.    
19:611:46330:21:21:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:Discoveries  involve  years  of  delay  for  platform  fabrication,  environmental  approvals,  pipeline  
19:612:46436:21:20:72:548:574:144:Times:144:Times:construction,   refinery   and   budgetary   considerations.   Figure   I   showed   the   delay   for   two   
19:613:46547:20:21:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:Norwegian  oilfields.    Anecdotally,  the  average  delay  in  the  United  Kingdom  during  the  period  
19:614:46654:21:21:72:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:1954-2011 was 4.5 years.14 Experts’ empirical estimates suggest that for a giant oil discovery, it 
19:615:46753:21:20:72:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:takes between 4 and 6 years to go from drilling to production.15    Based  on  our  own  calculation  
19:616:46855:20:21:72:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:using an alternative data source to Mike Horn’s that is less comprehensive but for which we have 
19:617:46952:21:21:72:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:more  detailed  information  at  the  field  level,  we  find  that  the  average  delay  between  discovery  
19:618:47062:21:21:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:and  production  start  is  5.4  years.16  Obviously,  there  is  some  heterogeneity  between  oil  and  gas  
19:619:47173:21:20:71:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:fields.  One  potential  source  of  heterogeneity  is  the  difference  between  onshore  and  offshore  
19:620:47279:20:21:72:544:409:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries.  Using  the  aforementioned  alternative  dataset,  we  find  that  the  average  delay  is  6.4  
19:621:47390:21:21:72:545:388:144:Times:144:Times:years  for  offshore  discoveries  and  4.6  for  onshore  discoveries.  All  in  all,  the  lag  between  the  
19:622:47502:21:20:72:544:367:144:Times:144:Times:announcement  of  oil  discoveries  and  production  can  be  substantial  and  thus  allows  us  to  treat  
19:623:47611:20:21:72:346:347:144:Times:144:Times:giant oil discoveries as news shocks about future output.

19:625:47669:21:20:72:544:305:144:Times:144:Times:The last attractive feature of giant oil discoveries is that their timing is arguably exogenous and 
19:626:47769:20:21:72:545:285:144:Times:144:Times:unexpected  due  to  the  uncertainty  surrounding  oil  and  gas  exploration,  after  controlling  for  
19:627:47875:21:21:72:547:264:144:Times:144:Times:country  and  year  fixed  effects  and  previous  discoveries.17  This  feature  is  crucial  for  our  
19:628:47980:21:24:72:546:243:144:Times:144:Times:identification  of  the  anticipation  effect  on  macroeconomic  aggregates  including  the  current

19:633:48447:18:7:71:255:168:100:Times:110:g_d0_f15:time lag between discovery and production.  
19:634:48491:7:16:72:532:161:42:Times:100:Times:16 The data are from Global Energy Systems, Uppsala University. The dataset includes 358 discoveries of giant oil 
19:635:48605:16:11:71:540:145:100:Times:100:Times:fields and covers 47 countries. The number of discoveries however shrinks to 157 when considering the period 1970 
19:636:48719:11:8:71:110:134:100:Times:100:Times:onwards. 
19:637:48728:8:18:72:543:126:64:Times:100:Times:17 One might also argue that the precise timing of the announcement of a giant oil discovery could be manipulated 
19:638:48842:18:11:72:542:108:100:Times:100:Times:by governments or other entities. Based on conversations with Mike Horn, we understand that these concerns about 
19:639:48955:11:12:72:543:97:100:Times:100:Times:a possible manipulation have little ground. In addition, Mike Horn’s dataset is immune from such concerns, as each 
19:640:49070:12:11:72:543:85:100:Times:100:Times:discovery date included in his dataset has been independently verified and documented using multiple sources which 
19:641:49185:11:0:72:283:74:100:Times:100:Times:are reported systematically for each discovery date.  
20:642:49243:0:20:72:546:708:144:Times:144:Times:account  because  the  latter  adjusts  only  after  the  agents  receive  the  news  about  giant  oil  
20:643:49348:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries. Resource exploration is an uncertain activity because it is affected by technological 
20:644:49447:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:innovation in exploration and drilling, and by the relative knowledge of geological features for a 
20:645:49546:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:particular location including knowledge about the detailed structure of the oil field, its depth or 
20:646:49646:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:whether  the  oil  is  located  in  deep  water.  Some  may  argue  that  oil  discoveries  are  somewhat  
20:647:49753:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:predictable because some countries appear to have larger oil endowments, or because they have 
20:648:49847:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:had discoveries in the past.18 The exact timing of giant oil discoveries is however less likely to be 
20:649:49949:20:21:72:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:predictable.  Moreover,  ex  ante  no  one  has  information  about  the  potential  size  of  discoveries  
20:650:50057:21:31:72:328:543:144:Times:144:Times:which we will also exploit in our empirical strategy.  
20:651:50112:31:20:72:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, the timing of giant oil discoveries constitutes a unique source of within-country variation 
20:652:50210:20:21:72:545:492:144:Times:144:Times:that  can  be  used  to  test  both  directly  and  precisely  whether  news  shocks  about  future  output  
20:653:50319:21:21:72:545:471:144:Times:144:Times:shocks  may  affect  macroeconomic  aggregates.  Our  data  covers  giant  oil  discoveries  for  the  
20:654:50422:21:21:72:546:450:144:Times:144:Times:period  1970-2012  for  up  to  130  countries.  This  allows  us  to  adopt  panel  data  estimation  
20:655:50525:21:30:72:365:429:144:Times:144:Times:techniques which control for country and year fixed effects.  
20:656:50587:30:21:72:546:399:144:Times:144:Times:The  giant  oil  discovery  dataset  is  from  Horn  (2004).  Some  summary  statistics  of  giant  oil  
20:657:50692:21:21:72:545:378:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries  around  the  world  are  now  discussed.  Table  II  shows  the  spatial  and  temporal  
20:658:50794:21:20:72:542:357:144:Times:144:Times:distribution of giant oil discoveries during 1970-2012. In total, 64 countries have had at least one 
20:659:50895:20:21:72:544:337:144:Times:144:Times:giant  oil  discovery  during  the  sample  period.  While  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  region  
20:660:51002:21:21:72:542:316:144:Times:144:Times:experienced a total of 97 discovery events out of a total of 371 in the world, other regions such as 
20:661:51103:21:21:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:Asia  (74),  the  Western  Hemisphere  (74)  and  the  Common  Wealth  of  Independent  States  and  
20:662:51204:21:20:72:546:274:144:Times:144:Times:Mongolia  (51)  also  experienced  significant  numbers  of  discovery  events  during  the  same  
20:663:51303:20:21:71:542:254:144:Times:144:Times:period.19 The 1970s is the peak period for giant oil discoveries, but the number of discoveries has 
20:664:51403:21:39:72:544:233:144:Times:144:Times:been  growing  since  1980s.  This  contradicts  the  commonly  held  view  that  it  is  more  and  more  
20:665:51510:39:8:72:218:194:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
20:666:51570:8:18:72:543:186:64:Times:100:Times:18 Past  discoveries  may  have  two  opposite  effects  on  the  likelihood  of  current  and  future  discoveries.  On  the  one  
20:667:51702:18:11:72:545:168:100:Times:100:Times:hand,  cumulative  discoveries  may  drive  up  discovery  costs  so  that  future  discoveries  become  less  likely  (see  
20:668:51827:11:12:72:543:157:100:Times:100:Times:Pindyck,  1978).  On  the  other  hand,  past  discoveries  foster  learning  about  the  geology  and  render  future  discovery  
20:669:51958:12:11:72:543:145:100:Times:100:Times:more likely (see Hamilton and Atkinson, 2013). Thus, past discoveries do not necessarily increase the likelihood of 
20:670:52074:11:12:72:544:134:100:Times:100:Times:new  discoveries,  nor  reduce  the  uncertainty  about  the  timing  of  new  discoveries.  In  order  to  control  for  possible  
20:671:52206:12:11:72:543:122:100:Times:100:Times:serial  correlations  in  oil  discoveries,  we  do  include  previous  discoveries  and  country  and  year  fixed  effect  in  our  
20:672:52340:11:8:72:277:111:100:Times:100:Times:empirical regression presented in the next section.

21:695:54230:21:20:72:544:234:144:Times:144:Times:In  regressions  using  log  levels  of  variables  (rather  than  as  a  percent  of  GDP)  and  employment  
21:696:54340:20:31:72:346:214:144:Times:144:Times:rate, we also include country-specific quadratic trends.    
21:697:54400:31:21:72:544:183:144:Times:144:Times:The richness of the data has three advantages. First, the panel structure allows us to identify the 
21:698:54500:21:28:72:540:162:144:Times:144:Times:dynamic  effect  of  oil  discoveries  on  macroeconomic  aggregates,  while  controlling  for  country-

21:700:54664:8:18:72:544:126:64:Times:100:Times:20  Technological  innovations  for  exploration  and  drilling  render  future  discoveries  more  likely.  One  notorious  
21:701:54789:18:11:71:543:108:100:Times:100:Times:example  of  the  role  of  technology  in  oil  exploration  and  drilling  is  George  Mitchell’s  innovative  use  of  horizontal  
21:702:54923:11:12:71:543:97:100:Times:100:Times:wells and hydraulic fracturing in the 1990s to release gas from a previously-impermeable rock formation near Fort 
21:703:55037:12:11:71:542:85:100:Times:100:Times:Worth, Texas. Those drilling breakthroughs have paved the way for tapping into previously inaccessible and vast oil 
21:704:55153:11:0:71:355:74:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:and gas reserves including in the United States, Poland and Argentina. 
22:705:55228:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:specific  and  year  fixed  effects.    Controlling  for  country  fixed  effects  is  important  because  it  
22:706:55339:20:21:72:545:688:144:Times:144:Times:allows  us  to  estimate  the  within-country  variation  in  giant  oil  discoveries  on  within-country  
22:707:55446:21:21:72:546:667:144:Times:144:Times:variation  in  macroeconomic  aggregates  and  thus  to  control  for  any  unobservable  and  time  
22:708:55547:21:20:72:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:invariant characteristics which may affect giant oil discoveries and macroeconomic aggregates.21 
22:709:55643:20:21:71:547:626:144:Times:144:Times:Second,  including  lagged  values  of  oil  discoveries  allows  us  to  control  for  the  possible  
22:710:55746:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:correlations in oil discoveries. Thus, we can identify the conditional effect of oil discoveries at a 
22:711:55848:21:20:71:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:given  point  in  time  on  macroeconomic  variables.  Third,  the  dynamic  feature  of  the  panel  
22:712:55950:20:21:71:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:regression in the form of an autoregressive model with distributed lags allows us to use impulse 
22:713:56047:21:21:71:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:response  function  to  capture  the  dynamic  effect  of  giant  oil  discoveries,  which  is  given  by

22:715:56247:21:21:71:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:number  of  cross-sectional  units,  ܰ  and  time  span,  ܶ)  to  fully  utilize  within  country  variation  in  
22:716:56361:21:20:72:542:480:144:Times:144:Times:giant oil discoveries. Because of the infrequent nature of giant oil discoveries, and because of the 
22:717:56462:20:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:long gestation period surrounding the production process, it is crucial to use large panel dataset 
22:718:56561:21:30:72:318:439:144:Times:144:Times:to capture the dynamic effect of those discoveries.

22:722:56628:26:20:72:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:Our data set consists of an oil discovery measure combined with macroeconomic data for many 
22:723:56720:20:21:72:545:316:144:Times:144:Times:countries.    We  begin  by  discussing  the  oil  discovery  measure.  Mike  Horn’s  dataset  contains  
22:724:56825:21:21:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:information on the country and year of the discovery, in addition to other key information such 
22:725:56921:21:21:72:542:274:144:Times:144:Times:as whether the field contains oil and/or gas and the estimated total ultimately recoverable amount 
22:726:57020:21:20:72:543:253:144:Times:144:Times:in oil equivalent.22   Because agents should respond to the net present value of the output shock 
22:727:57118:20:50:72:545:233:144:Times:144:Times:revealed  by  the  discovery  news,  we  construct  a  measure  of  the  net  present  value  of  giant  oil  
22:728:57228:50:9:72:218:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
22:729:57288:9:17:72:542:174:64:Times:100:Times:21  It is worth noting that the estimates of the dynamic panel with fixed effect are inconsistent if the time span of the 
22:730:57410:17:12:72:543:157:100:Times:100:Times:panel, ,ܶ is small. In our case, our sample period covers at least thirty years, thus the Nickell bias of order (1/T) is 
22:731:57531:12:11:72:543:145:100:Times:100:Times:seemingly negligible. However, the Nickell bias relies on asymptotic assumptions. Indeed, Barro (2012) shows that 
22:732:57645:11:12:72:543:134:100:Times:100:Times:there  could  be  substantial  bias  in  relatively  small  samples.  Relying  on  the  plausible  exogenous  nature  of  giant  oil  
22:733:57779:12:11:72:543:122:100:Times:100:Times:discoveries,  we  also  tried  excluding  country  fixed  effects  and  verified  that  our  main  results  were  qualitatively  and  
22:734:57913:11:12:72:545:111:100:Times:100:Times:quantitatively  similar.  We  include  the  country  fixed  effects  in  our  benchmark  model  because  they  are  jointly  
22:735:58038:12:8:72:122:99:100:Times:100:Times:significant.  
22:736:58052:8:17:72:544:91:64:Times:100:Times:22 The  ultimately  recoverable  size  for  each  discovery  is  based  on  the  estimation  of  the  value  at  the  time  of  the  
22:737:58185:17:0:72:363:74:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:discovery, rather than potentially revised estimates in subsequent years.  
23:738:58264:0:20:72:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries.    An  approach  using  solely  variation  in  the  timing  would  not  take  into  account  the  
23:739:58375:20:31:72:279:688:144:Times:144:Times:heterogeneity in the size of discoveries.23   
23:740:58421:31:21:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:We  construct  a  measure  of  the  net  present  value  of  a  giant  oil  discovery  as  a  percent  of  GDP,

23:749:58602:31:21:71:543:553:144:Times:144:Times:NPV for a given country, i, at the time the discovery is made, t, is the discounted sum of gross 
23:750:58698:21:22:71:547:532:144:Times:144:Times:revenue  derived  from  an  approximated  oil  production  profile,  ݍ௜,௧ା௝,  from  the  fifth  year  
23:751:58800:22:21:72:543:510:144:Times:144:Times:following the discovery to the exhaustion year, ܬ, valued at the oil price prevailing at the time of 
23:752:58900:21:21:72:543:489:144:Times:144:Times:the discovery.  The approximated production profile follows a piece-wise process in the form of 
23:753:58996:21:21:72:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:reserve specific plateau production followed by an exponential decline (see Höök et al., 2014 and 
23:754:59094:21:20:71:546:447:144:Times:144:Times:Robelius,  2007).24  Appendix  B.I.  describes  in  detail  the  approximation  method  relying  on  
23:755:59195:20:21:72:547:427:144:Times:144:Times:estimates   using   an   alternative   oil   field   database.   Gross   revenues   are   valued   at   current   
23:756:59309:21:21:72:547:406:144:Times:144:Times:international   prices.   The   rationale   behind   using   current   international   prices   to   value   the   
23:757:59424:21:20:72:543:385:144:Times:144:Times:production is that oil price series typically follow a random walk process so that current price is 
23:758:59524:20:31:72:193:365:144:Times:144:Times:the best price forecast.25  
23:759:59552:31:21:72:545:334:144:Times:144:Times:To  account  for  the  fact  that  giant  discoveries  may  happen  in  countries  where  the  perceived  
23:760:59658:21:20:72:547:313:144:Times:144:Times:political  risk  is  high,  we  allow  for  country-specific  risk  adjusted  discount  rates.  Indeed,  
23:761:59763:20:21:72:546:293:144:Times:144:Times:exploiting  oil  and  gas  fields  can  be  rendered  difficult  if  not  impossible  in  countries  where  
23:762:59871:21:21:72:544:272:144:Times:144:Times:political  risk  is  high.  Discoveries  in  countries  where  political  risk  is  elevated  should  thus  be  
23:763:59983:21:20:72:543:251:144:Times:144:Times:discounted more than places where risk is lower. We thus compute the adjusted discount rate as 
23:764:60078:20:21:72:543:231:144:Times:144:Times:the sum of the risk free rate set to 5 percent and a country specific risk premium.26 The risk free 
23:765:60178:21:18:72:543:210:144:Times:144:Times:rate is assumed to be the rate prevailing in the United States. Considering that measures of risk

23:767:60336:9:17:72:527:183:64:Times:100:Times:23 In practice, though, our qualitative results are robust to using discoveries events in lieu of our benchmark NPV 
23:768:60452:17:7:72:119:166:100:Times:100:Times:measures.   
23:769:60464:7:16:72:527:159:42:Times:100:Times:24 We choose not to use the so-called Hubbert curve to approximate oil production profiles since it is regarded by 
23:770:60579:16:12:71:530:143:100:Times:100:Times:petroleum engineers as a good fit for aggregated field production profiles for a whole region or at the global level. 
23:771:60697:12:11:71:523:131:100:Times:100:Times:For single fields, a reserve specific piecewise process consisting in a plateau production and then an exponential 
23:772:60812:11:7:71:180:120:100:Times:100:Times:decline is commonly used. 
23:773:60838:7:12:72:425:113:42:Times:100:g_d0_f3:25 See Hamilton (2009) and references therein for a discussion on forecasting oil prices.  
23:774:60929:12:16:72:542:101:42:Times:100:Times:26 Some researchers have however argued that an annual interest rate as high as 14 percent is needed to be consistent 
23:775:61047:16:11:72:544:85:100:Times:100:Times:with  United  States’  consumption-income  relationships  in  a  closed  economy  setting  (see  Bernanke,1985).  Using  
23:776:61168:11:0:72:413:74:100:Times:121:g_d0_f3:alternative values for the risk free rates does not significantly affect our main results.

24:778:61360:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:are  not  necessarily  comparable,  we  use  predicted  values  for  risk  premia  based  on  the  historical

24:780:61567:21:20:71:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:risk ratings. The data on spreads on sovereign bonds are from the Emerging Markets Bond Index 
24:781:61661:20:21:71:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:Global (EMBI Global) that is available for 41 emerging market economies for the period 1997-
24:782:61753:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:2007.27 Emerging markets are a set of countries for which risk ratings can vary substantially and 
24:783:61851:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:thus providing with significant statistical variation to estimate a relationship between risk ratings 
24:784:61953:20:21:72:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:and  sovereign  bond  spreads.  Bond  spreads  are  measured  against  a  comparable  US  government  
24:785:62055:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:bond  and  are  period  averages  for  the  whole  year.  The  political  risk  rating  is  from  International

25:830:65685:21:21:72:543:304:144:Times:144:Times:Figure VII displays the responses of the current account, saving, and investment.  The top panel 
25:831:65782:21:20:72:544:283:144:Times:144:Times:shows  that  giant  oil  discoveries  have,  in  the  years  immediately  following  the  announcement,  a  
25:832:65890:20:21:72:544:263:144:Times:144:Times:negative  effect  on  the  current  account-GDP  ratio.    Five  years  after  the  discovery,  the  average  
25:833:66000:21:21:72:543:242:144:Times:144:Times:effect  of  giant  oil  discoveries  turns  positive.  A  peak  effect  is  reached  eight  years  following  the  
25:834:66115:21:20:72:543:221:144:Times:144:Times:discovery after which the effect starts declining. Those results are consistent with the theoretical 
25:835:66216:20:21:72:545:201:144:Times:144:Times:predictions  of  both  the  endowment  and  the  two-sector  production  economy  presented  earlier.  
25:836:66319:21:21:72:544:180:144:Times:144:Times:The  negative  effect  of  giant  oil  discoveries  on  the  current  account  immediately  following  the  
25:837:66427:21:22:72:546:159:144:Times:144:Times:announcement  strongly  supports  the  existence  of  an  anticipation  effect.  The  timing  of  the

25:839:66590:9:17:72:544:128:64:Times:100:Times:29  The  supplementary  appendix  provides  the  coefficient  estimates.    Both  the  country  and  year  fixed  effects  are  
25:840:66718:17:12:71:543:111:100:Times:100:Times:jointly  significant  with  a  p-value  of  0.000.    For  variables  we  do  not  include  country-specific  quadratic  trends,  we  
25:841:66852:12:8:71:488:99:100:Times:100:Times:also adopt formal panel unit root tests which rejects unit root hypothesis at standard significance levels. 
25:842:66960:8:17:72:493:91:64:Times:100:Times:30 We use xtscc and nlcom commands in Stata.  The bands are similar if we instead use a non-parametric 
25:843:67063:17:0:72:164:74:100:Times:100:Times:bootstrapping method. 
26:844:67089:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:anticipation effect is also consistent with the fact that oil production occurs with a delay of 4-6 
26:845:67189:20:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:years  on  average.  The  effect  starts  to  be  positive  five  years  after  the  discovery  which  is  
26:846:67296:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:consistent  with  the  timing  at  which  oil  production  starts  and  output  increases.  The  second  and  
26:847:67406:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:third panels of Figure VII show that the anticipation effect plays out through both the saving and 
26:848:67505:20:21:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:investment channels.  The saving-GDP ratio becomes negative for about five years following the 
26:849:67600:21:21:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:announcement  of  the  discovery,  and  then  becomes  robustly  positive.  On  the  other  hand,  the  
26:850:67704:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:investment-GDP ratio starts to rise one year after the giant oil discovery. It hits a peak around 5 
26:851:67804:20:21:72:434:564:144:Times:144:Times:years once oil production starts and then returns to normal quite quickly.31

26:853:67882:21:21:72:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:The top panel of Figure VIII shows the effects of a giant oil discovery on GDP.  On average a 
26:854:67976:21:20:72:545:501:144:Times:144:Times:giant  oil  discovery  has  a  slightly  negative  impact  on  aggregate  GDP  initially,  but  then  has  a  
26:855:68086:20:21:72:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:robust  positive  effect  after  the  start  of  oil  and  gas  production,  about  5  years  after  the  discovery  
26:856:68203:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:announcement is made. Output peaks about 7 to 8 years after discovery and then slowly returns 
26:857:68297:21:20:72:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:to normal over the following years.  The pattern of the response of aggregate output to the news 
26:858:68394:20:21:72:544:419:144:Times:144:Times:of  a  giant  oil  discovery  is  thus  qualitatively  consistent  with  the  theoretical  predictions  from  the  
26:859:68509:21:21:72:473:398:144:Times:144:Times:two- sector model presented earlier.  We will discuss the quantitative match below.

26:861:68593:20:21:72:546:357:144:Times:144:Times:The second panel of Figure VIII shows the effect on log consumption (not as a percent of GDP).  
26:862:68689:21:21:72:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:The estimates indicate that consumption does not respond much at first, but then does start to rise 
26:863:68789:21:20:72:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:three  years  after  the  discovery.    The  estimates,  however,  are  very  imprecise.    This  imprecision  
26:864:68900:20:21:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:could reflect the fact that there is substantial measurement error in our consumption variable.  As 
26:865:69000:21:21:72:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:we  will  discuss  below,  another  issue  is  that  the  consumption  variable  includes  both  private  and  
26:866:69111:21:21:72:173:253:144:Times:144:Times:public consumption.

26:869:69225:21:21:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:that the employment rate begins to fall immediately after a giant oil discovery and continues to 
26:870:69322:21:20:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:fall  even  after  the  start  of  production.    The  employment  rate  remains  depressed  for  quite  a  few  
26:871:69435:20:27:72:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:years before returning to normal.  The estimates are small in magnitude, but precisely estimated.

26:873:69595:9:17:72:541:114:64:Times:100:Times:31 These swings in variables from negative to positive in response to news about future opportunities are reminiscent 
26:874:69713:17:7:72:420:97:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:of Mertens and Ravn’s (2012) analysis of the effects of news about future tax changes. 
26:875:69800:7:16:72:537:90:42:Times:100:Times:32 We use the employment rate rather than total hours because the latter were not available for all of the countries in 
26:876:69920:16:0:72:124:74:100:Times:100:Times:our sample.

27:878:69937:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:Not  all  of  the  point  estimates  of  the  impulse  responses  are  different  from  zero  at  conventional  
27:879:70049:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:levels  of  significance.    The  hypotheses  we  really  want  to  test,  though,  are  about  the  general  
27:880:70159:21:20:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:patterns, not whether a response at one particular horizon is statistically different from zero.  In 
27:881:70260:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:particular,  we  want  to  test  whether  the  integral  of  the  response  between  the  discovery  and  the  
27:882:70371:21:21:72:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:start  of  oil  production  is  different  from  zero  and  whether  the  integral  of  the  response  after  
27:883:70481:21:20:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:production is different from zero.  Table III shows the hypothesis tests for the relevant integrals.  
27:884:70583:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:We develop the alternative hypotheses to be consistent with our theory.  For example, we test the 
27:885:70681:21:21:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:null hypothesis that the response of the current account-GDP ratio is greater than or equal to zero 
27:886:70781:21:21:71:545:522:144:Times:144:Times:against our theoretical prediction that it is negative during the first five years (horizons 0 to 4).33  
27:887:70886:21:20:71:544:501:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly we then test the null hypothesis that the response is less than or equal to zero against 
27:888:70985:20:21:71:383:481:144:Times:144:Times:the theoretical prediction that it is positive for horizons 5 to 11.   
27:889:71056:21:21:71:74:460:144:Times:144:Times: 
27:890:71056:21:20:71:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:The results show that in most cases we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the theoretical 
27:891:71154:20:21:71:543:419:144:Times:144:Times:prediction at standard levels of statistical significance.  For example, the response of the current 
27:892:71255:21:21:71:545:398:144:Times:144:Times:account-GDP  ratio  is  significantly  negative  between  discovery  and  production,  indicating  a  
27:893:71357:21:20:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:significant anticipation effect, and is significantly positive after oil production starts. The results 
27:894:71461:20:21:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:are similar for the saving-GDP ratio.  The investment-GDP ratio is significantly positive (with a 
27:895:71559:21:21:71:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:p-value of 0.06) for the first five years, but not for the following years.  The GDP response is not 
27:896:71660:21:20:71:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:different from zero during the first few years, but is significantly positive for the years after the 
27:897:71762:20:21:71:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:oil  production  starts  up.34    The  consumption  response,  however,  has  a  p-value  of  0.13,  so  even  
27:898:71873:21:21:72:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:the integral response is not statistically significant at conventional levels. On the other hand, the 
27:899:71975:21:21:72:366:253:144:Times:144:Times:employment response is (statistically) significantly negative.

27:901:72038:20:21:71:545:212:144:Times:144:Times:Figure  IX  compares  the  empirical  estimates  of  the  responses  of  all  six  variables  against  the  
27:902:72146:21:21:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:responses derived from our theoretical model. The latter are normalized so that the peak response 
27:903:72244:21:20:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:of GDP is the same as the one from the empirical model; we will return to the issue of magnitude 
27:904:72341:20:30:72:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:in the next paragraph. The graphs show that the empirical and theoretical responses are broadly 
27:905:72437:30:7:72:218:120:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
27:906:72497:7:16:72:537:113:42:Times:100:Times:33 The null hypothesis is consistent with the response of the current account to a contemporaneous positive shock in 
27:907:72614:16:7:71:487:97:100:Times:100:Times:the oil sector, thus we can reject that an oil discovery is a contemporaneous shock if we reject the null.  
27:908:72722:7:16:72:541:90:42:Times:100:Times:34 The two high p-values occur only because the estimates are not precise enough to rule out some values opposite in 
27:909:72839:16:0:71:222:74:100:Times:100:Times:sign to those predicted by the theory. 
28:910:72882:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:consistent in shape, magnitude, and timing. There are a few notable differences. For example, the 
28:911:72980:20:21:72:545:688:144:Times:144:Times:(positive)  current  account  and  savings  responses  are  larger  in  the  empirical  responses  than  in  
28:912:73089:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:theoretical  model  ones,  following  the  start  of  oil  production.    Furthermore,  the  saving  response  
28:913:73200:21:20:72:546:646:144:Times:144:Times:reaches  a  peak  later  in  the  empirical  model  than  in  the  theoretical  one.  The  response  of  
28:914:73305:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:consumption  is  larger  than  predicted  by  the  theoretical  model,  but  the  empirical  estimates  are  
28:915:73414:21:21:72:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:imprecise.  The  negative  employment  response  in  the  theoretical  model  is  somewhat  more  
28:916:73512:21:20:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:pronounced  than  in  the  empirical  one.  That  said,  the  responses  from  empirical  and  theoretical  
28:917:73620:20:21:72:530:564:144:Times:144:Times:models are overall remarkably close, particularly since we used calibrations from other papers. 
28:918:73716:21:21:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
28:919:73716:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:There  is  one  notable  discrepancy  between  the  model  and  the  data  that  is  not  evident  from  the  
28:920:73826:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:graphs. As discussed earlier, we normalized the shock in the model so that the GDP peak would 
28:921:73920:20:21:72:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:match the empirical responses. The shock used in the empirical estimates is an oil discovery that 
28:922:74018:21:21:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:we estimate to lead to a potential stream of oil revenues equal to one percent of initial GDP.  The 
28:923:74118:21:20:72:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:shock in the model represents a much smaller shock.  If we had used a shock that represented an 
28:924:74214:20:21:72:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:increase  in  the  value  of  oil  production  that  was  one  percent  of  GDP  in  NPV,  we  would  have  
28:925:74322:21:21:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:found  that  all  of  the  theoretical  model  responses  would  have  been  substantially  greater.    For  
28:926:74431:21:20:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:example, the peak of GDP would have been 0.19 rather than 0.03.  This discrepancy implies that 
28:927:74526:20:21:72:544:357:144:Times:144:Times:either our estimate of the oil discovery NPV is higher than the value perceived by the agents at 
28:928:74623:21:21:72:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:the time or that there are important elements that our model does not incorporate.  For example, 
28:929:74720:21:20:72:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:the  discounting  factor  we  used  in  the  NPV  calculation  might  be  not  high  enough  as  the  risk  
28:930:74828:20:21:72:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:premium  does  not  fully  capture  all  the  uncertainty  associated  with  oil  extraction  including  
28:931:74933:21:21:72:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:unknown features of oil fields and the related social tensions. However, those factors are either 
28:932:75031:21:21:72:430:253:144:Times:144:Times:difficult to measure precisely or to incorporate into the theoretical model.

28:936:75127:26:20:72:544:153:144:Times:144:Times:We  now  seek  to  shed  some  light  on  two  elements  we  did  not  incorporate  in  our  theory  –  the  
28:937:75236:20:21:72:543:133:144:Times:144:Times:potential government response and real exchange rates.  We begin by considering the behavior of 
28:938:75332:21:21:72:544:112:144:Times:144:Times:government.  Our data on investment and consumption is for total amounts, aggregating private 
28:939:75426:21:0:72:545:91:144:Times:144:Times:and  public.    Our  theoretical  model  did  not  model  public  investment  and  public  consumption  
29:940:75534:0:20:72:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:separately,  and  instead  (implicitly)  considered  government  consumption  and  investment  to  be  
29:941:75637:20:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:perfect  substitutes  for  private  consumption  and  investment.    Pieschacón  (2012)  models  the  
29:942:75739:21:21:72:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:government  spending  and  tax  responses  to  oil  price  increases  and  shows  that  a  differential  
29:943:75844:21:20:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:response  is  important  for  understanding  the  differences  in  the  effects  of  oil  price  increases  on  
29:944:75956:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:Norway  versus  Mexico.    To  determine  the  extent  to  which  government  is  playing  a  role  after  
29:945:76063:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:giant oil discoveries, we investigate the responses of public vs. private investment and public vs. 
29:946:76163:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:private consumption using data from the IMF (2013), as well as the response of the government 
29:947:76257:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:spending-GDP ratio. As shown in Figure X, the private investment-GDP ratio increases, but the 
29:948:76351:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:public investment-GDP ratio decreases.  Thus, all of the increase in the investment-GDP ratio we 
29:949:76448:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:saw  in  the  earlier  graph  was  due  to  the  response  of  private  agents.    Private  consumption  (log  
29:950:76559:21:20:72:544:501:144:Times:144:Times:levels)  increases  somewhat  while  public  consumption  does  not  respond  to  the  initial  discovery  
29:951:76666:20:21:72:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:but then jumps up once the oil production begins.  Thus, the government is an important part of 
29:952:76762:21:21:72:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:the  response  of  total  consumption.    The  final  graph  of  Figure  X  shows  that  while  government  
29:953:76870:21:20:72:546:439:144:Times:144:Times:spending  does  rise,  it  rises  less  than  the  increase  in  GDP.    Thus,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  
29:954:76979:20:21:72:505:419:144:Times:144:Times:government behavior is significantly changing the outcomes relative to our simple model.

29:956:77068:21:20:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:In order to keep our model simple, we did not include a non-tradeable sector, and thus our model 
29:957:77165:20:21:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:does not yield any prediction for the real exchange rate.  Standard models would suggest that the 
29:958:77263:21:21:71:545:336:144:Times:144:Times:announcement  of  a  giant  oil  discovery  would  lead  to  an  immediate  appreciation  of  the  real  
29:959:77368:21:20:71:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:exchange rate, operating through an increase in the relative price of non-tradeables (See the early 
29:960:77468:20:21:71:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:contribution  by  Eastwood  and  Venables,  1982).35  Empirically,  we  found  that  the  real  exchange  
29:961:77574:21:21:72:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:rate  appreciated  during  the  first  five  years  following  oil  discoveries,  either  using  CPI-based  or  
29:962:77686:21:21:72:545:253:144:Times:144:Times:GDP  deflator-based  measures.  However,  in  both  specifications,  the  point  estimates  were  very  
29:963:77790:21:20:72:543:232:144:Times:144:Times:imprecise so no response was significantly different from zero. Real exchange rate responses are 
29:964:77887:20:78:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:shown in the Supplementary Appendix. Our results are somewhat consistent with the empirical

29:966:78039:8:18:72:533:126:64:Times:100:Times:35 Pieschacón (2012) analyzes the effects of oil price increases on Norway and Mexico, and finds mixed effects on 
29:967:78153:18:11:72:534:108:100:Times:100:Times:the relative price of non-tradeables.  In Mexico, the relative price of nontradeables increases, whereas in Norway it 
29:968:78271:11:12:72:538:97:100:Times:100:Times:increases for a couple of quarters but then decreases. Wills (2013) explores the optimal response of monetary policy 
29:969:78388:12:11:72:524:85:100:Times:100:Times:to a giant oil discovery in a standard small open economy model.  He finds that the real exchange rate appreciate 
29:970:78502:11:0:72:456:74:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:twice: when forward-looking households and then the government increases their consumption. 
30:971:78598:0:20:72:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:literature  on  the  so-called  Dutch  disease,  finding  mixed  evidence  for  the  latter.36  It  should  be  
30:972:78710:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:noted  however  that  one  key  difference  between  our  estimates  and  results  from  the  empirical  
30:973:78815:21:21:72:547:667:144:Times:144:Times:literature  on  Dutch  Disease  is  that  the  latter  has  so  far  been  focused  on  the  effect  of  
30:974:78920:21:20:72:545:646:144:Times:144:Times:contemporaneous  windfall  shocks  as  opposed  to  news  shocks.  Besides  obvious  measurement  
30:975:79018:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:issues associated with real exchange rates, there are several potential explanations as to why we 
30:976:79116:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:do not find evidence of significant real exchange rate appreciation following the announcement 
30:977:79211:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:of a giant discovery. Perhaps, most importantly, is the fast moving nature of (real) exchange rates 
30:978:79311:20:21:72:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:combined with the fact that we rely on annual frequency data for oil discovery announcements. 
30:979:79405:21:21:72:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed,  as  argued  by  Ramey  (2011)  getting  the  timing  right  is  essential  to  avoid  bias  in  
30:980:79510:21:21:72:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:empirically investigating the effect of news shocks, and perhaps even more so when considering 
30:981:79605:21:46:72:215:501:144:Times:144:Times:the exchange rate responses.

30:984:79658:31:20:72:546:407:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  following,  we  discuss  the  results  of  extensive  robustness  checks  for  the  benchmark  
30:985:79762:20:21:72:545:387:144:Times:144:Times:specification.  First,  our  main  results  are  robust  to  alternative  measures  of  NPV  of  giant  oil  
30:986:79871:21:21:72:545:366:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries.  Instead  of  using  a  more  realistic  projected  oil  production  profile,  we  assume  a  
30:987:79978:21:21:72:547:345:144:Times:144:Times:constant  production  rate  for  20  years  after  production  starts.  Moreover,  alternative  to  the  
30:988:80083:21:20:72:546:324:144:Times:144:Times:country-specific  risk  adjusted  discount  rate,  we  also  use  common  discount  factors  of  10  
30:989:80184:20:21:72:543:304:144:Times:144:Times:percent.37  The  impulse  responses  of  main  macro  variables  are  virtually  the  same,  implying  that  
30:990:80293:21:21:72:544:283:144:Times:144:Times:our results are not subject to the way we construct our measure of NPV of discoveries. (Figures 
30:991:80389:21:30:72:270:262:144:Times:144:Times:C.I in the Supplementary Appendix.)38    
30:992:80430:30:21:72:542:232:144:Times:144:Times:Also, we check whether removing groups of countries affects the robustness of the effect of giant 
30:993:80528:21:21:72:543:211:144:Times:144:Times:oil discoveries on the current account. Given the relative concentration of giant oil discoveries in 
30:994:80629:21:28:72:544:190:144:Times:144:Times:certain  Middle  East  and  North  African  countries,  we  tried  removing  all  countries  belonging  to  
30:995:80737:28:9:72:218:162:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
30:996:80797:9:17:72:539:153:64:Times:100:Times:36 See for instance Arezki and Ismail (2013) and references therein for a discussion of the empirical literature on the 
30:997:80917:17:12:72:537:136:100:Times:100:Times:Dutch Disease. Arezki and al. (2013) discuss the difficulty of assessing the effect of windfalls on real exchange rate 
30:998:81036:12:7:72:464:124:100:Times:100:Times:for oil exporters and find some evidence of asymmetrical Dutch Disease along boom-bust cycles. 
30:999:81131:7:18:72:534:117:64:Times:100:Times:37 One advantage of this measure is that we can expand our sample to cover about 170 countries for our key macro 
30:1000:81244:18:8:72:454:99:100:Times:100:Times:variables, although most of countries in the extended sample do not have giant oil discoveries.  
30:1001:81341:8:17:72:521:91:64:Times:100:Times:38 As we noted earlier, most of our results are also qualitatively robust to using a simple dummy variable for oil 
30:1002:81456:17:0:72:473:74:100:Times:100:Times:discoveries.  In fact, we used the dummy variable for our baseline in an earlier version of the paper. 
31:1003:81563:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:this region, and our main results still hold. Also, we explore the robustness of our main results to 
31:1004:81664:20:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:using  solely  countries  which  have  experienced  at  least  one  discovery  (Figure  C.II  in  the  
31:1005:81767:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:Supplementary Appendix). Results are again robust thus suggesting that the lack of comparison 
31:1006:81861:21:30:72:362:646:144:Times:144:Times:from countries where discoveries are absent is not an issue.  
31:1007:81923:30:21:72:545:616:144:Times:144:Times:Next,  we  investigate  formally  the  predictability  of  giant  oil  discoveries.  Indeed,  agents  might  
31:1008:82032:21:21:72:545:595:144:Times:144:Times:learn  about  giant  oil  discoveries  from  information  observable  to  the  econometrician  such  as  
31:1009:82137:21:20:72:545:574:144:Times:144:Times:previous  discoveries  which  has  been  controlled  for  in  the  empirical  specification.  However,  
31:1010:82241:20:21:72:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:agents  might  have  other  hidden  information  that  is  unobserved  by  the  econometrician  and  that  
31:1011:82348:21:21:72:545:533:144:Times:144:Times:could  help  predict  discoveries.  In  this  case,  agents  may  adjust  their  behaviors  including  their  
31:1012:82458:21:21:72:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:saving and investment (and in turn the current account) as a response to anticipated discoveries. 
31:1013:82556:21:20:72:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:For  example,  agents  could  borrow  through  current  account  deficits  before  oil  discoveries,  and  
31:1014:82663:20:21:72:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:then  the  Granger  causality  between  discoveries  and  the  current  account  would  be  reversed.  To  
31:1015:82770:21:21:72:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:test this possibility, we used a linear probability model and a logit model to test whether lagged 
31:1016:82869:21:20:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:values of the current account, saving and investment have predictive power on the incidence of 
31:1017:82964:20:21:72:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:oil discoveries. Table IV presents the results of the test of the hypothesis that three lagged values 
31:1018:83066:21:21:72:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:of current accounts and investment do not have significant predictive power on the incidence of 
31:1019:83162:21:20:72:544:367:144:Times:144:Times:oil  discoveries.39  The  conclusion  that  emerges  from  these  tests  is  that  there  are  no  evidence  of  
31:1020:83275:20:21:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:predicting power of giant oil discoveries derived from lagged values of the current account and 
31:1021:83371:21:21:72:543:326:144:Times:144:Times:investment. However, we go further in exploring whether our results are robust to removing any 
31:1022:83466:21:20:71:544:305:144:Times:144:Times:potentially  predictable  giant  oil  discoveries.  Because  discoveries  that  followed  others  are  more  
31:1023:83575:20:21:71:544:285:144:Times:144:Times:likely  to  be  subject  to  the  view  that  they  are  predictable,  we  test  whether  our  main  results  still  
31:1024:83692:21:21:72:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:hold  if  we  remove  discoveries  in  the  year  immediately  following  a  pre-existing  discovery.  The  
31:1025:83800:21:21:72:547:243:144:Times:144:Times:impulse  responses  for  our  key  macro  variables  are  virtually  unchanged  compared  to  our  
31:1026:83899:21:20:72:543:222:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark results, except the response of employment becomes less informative. We also tried 
31:1027:83992:20:21:72:543:202:144:Times:144:Times:retaining as news shocks only discoveries that happened without a prior history of discoveries in 
31:1028:84090:21:21:72:546:181:144:Times:144:Times:the  last  past  three  years,  and  the  impulse  responses  are  again  qualitatively  similar  to  our  
31:1029:84197:21:20:72:543:160:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark results (Figure C.III in the Supplementary Appendix).  Finally, we also controlled for 
31:1030:84294:20:21:72:544:140:144:Times:144:Times:current  and  lagged  exploration  expenditures  using  data  from  Global  Energy  Systems  and  our  
31:1031:84397:21:31:72:471:119:144:Times:144:Times:main results are robust to doing so (Figure C.IV in the Supplementary Appendix).  
31:1032:84479:31:8:72:218:88:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
31:1033:84539:8:0:72:276:80:64:Times:100:Times:39 Saving is excluded due to obvious redundancy.  
32:1034:84593:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:One may also wonder whether the anticipation effect of news shocks on the current account may 
32:1035:84687:20:21:72:547:688:144:Times:144:Times:depend  on  countries’  borrowing  constraints.  This  is  true  in  our  theory  where  borrowing  
32:1036:84787:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:constraints  are  modeled  as  a  debt-elastic  interest-rate  premium  over  the  world  interest  rate  for  
32:1037:84898:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:small open economies which is a function of countries’ foreign asset/debt ratio (see for instance, 
32:1038:84997:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:Schmitt-Grohé  and  Uribe,  2003).  However,  borrowing  constraints  are  possibly  endogenous  to  
32:1039:85098:21:21:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:giant  oil  discoveries.  Because  poor  countries  initially  may  have  limited  access  to  international  
32:1040:85208:21:20:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:financial  capital  markets  due  to  collateral  constraints,  they  however  could  use  the  giant  oil  
32:1041:85316:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries as collateral to borrow from abroad once they discovered such new oil fields. Thus, it 
32:1042:85415:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:is still possible to identify the anticipation effect of giant oil discoveries on the current account 
32:1043:85517:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:for  countries  with  ex  ante  borrowing  constraints.  Indeed,  we  found  evidence  that  anticipated  
32:1044:85623:21:20:72:544:501:144:Times:144:Times:effect  to  giant  oil  discoveries  on  the  current  account  for  African  countries  only  is  present  and  
32:1045:85736:20:31:72:460:481:144:Times:144:Times:similar to our benchmark results (Figure C.V in the Supplementary Appendix).   
32:1046:85815:31:21:72:547:450:144:Times:144:Times:One  important  feature  for  giant  oil  discoveries  is  the  lag  between  the  announcement  of  
32:1047:85916:21:20:72:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries and the start of production. One could argue that the discovery of an oil field might 
32:1048:86014:20:21:72:544:409:144:Times:144:Times:induce a substitution effect between the newly found oil field and existing ones so much so that 
32:1049:86111:21:21:72:545:388:144:Times:144:Times:future  oil  production  and  future  output  may  remain  unchanged,  and  the  current  output  may  
32:1050:86214:21:20:72:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:increase.  This  substitution  effect  could  potentially  reduce  the  anticipation  effect.  However,  due  
32:1051:86324:20:21:71:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:to  the  nature  of  oil  extraction,  adjustment  costs  tend  to  be  high  and  further  investment  is  
32:1052:86432:21:21:71:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:necessary  to  increase  the  oil  output  in  existing  fields.  Thus,  in  reality  it  might  be  difficult  to  
32:1053:86548:21:21:71:545:305:144:Times:144:Times:speed  up  the  oil  pumping  in  existing  fields  in  a  short  period.  Moreover,  conceptually  the  
32:1054:86653:21:20:71:545:284:144:Times:144:Times:substitution  effect  might  be  more  relevant  for  large  oil  exporters  because  they  would  tend  to  
32:1055:86762:20:21:71:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:internalize  the  effect  of  their  production  on  international  oil  and  gas  prices.  We  thus  tested  the  
32:1056:86877:21:21:72:541:243:144:Times:64:Times:robustness of our main results to removing the top ten largest oil or gas exporters in the world.40 
32:1057:86977:21:30:72:500:222:144:Times:121:g_d0_f3:Our main results are virtually unchanged (Figure C.V in the Supplementary Appendix).   
32:1058:87064:30:21:72:542:192:144:Times:144:Times:Our results are also robust to using different specifications. In particular, our results are robust to 
32:1059:87168:21:21:72:544:171:144:Times:144:Times:using  alternative  econometric  specifications  that  consist  in  higher  order  lags  for  the  dependent  
32:1060:87278:21:21:72:542:150:144:Times:144:Times:variable  such  as  ൌ2݌,  and  different  orders  in  lag  independent  variables,  say  12	ݎ݋,ൌ8ݍ. 
32:1061:87378:21:18:72:546:129:144:Times:144:Times:Results  are  indeed  virtually  unchanged  to  the  case  when  we  only  use  the  first  lag  of  the

33:1070:88106:16:31:72:74:604:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: 
33:1071:88107:31:20:72:543:573:144:Times:144:Times:In this paper, we have examined the effect of news about giant oil discoveries on macroeconomic 
33:1072:88203:20:21:72:542:553:144:Times:144:Times:aggregates. We first presented a two-sector open economy model to highlight the predicted effect 
33:1073:88300:21:21:72:545:532:144:Times:144:Times:of  sector-specific  news  on  variables  such  as  the  current  account,  saving,  investment,  GDP,  
33:1074:88404:21:20:72:545:511:144:Times:144:Times:consumption,  and  employment.    To  identify  the  news  shock  in  the  data,  we  exploited  the  
33:1075:88506:20:21:72:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:plausibly exogenous within country variation in the timing and size  of  giant  oil  discoveries.  To  
33:1076:88609:21:21:72:543:470:144:Times:144:Times:test this prediction, we estimated a dynamic panel distributed lag model over a sample covering 
33:1077:88705:21:21:72:546:449:144:Times:144:Times:1970  to  2012  for  about  130  countries.  Results  from  the  estimation  provided  evidence  for  a  
33:1078:88810:21:20:72:545:428:144:Times:144:Times:statistically  and  economically  significant  anticipation  effect  following  the  announcement  of  a  
33:1079:88916:20:21:72:545:408:144:Times:144:Times:giant  oil  discovery.  In  particular,  we  found  that  immediately  following  the  news  shock,  the  
33:1080:89022:21:21:72:544:387:144:Times:144:Times:current  account  and  saving  decreased,  while  investment  increased.    Only  after  the  beginning  of  
33:1081:89131:21:20:72:544:366:144:Times:144:Times:oil  production  did  we  find  that  the  current  account  and  saving  increased  along  with  GDP.    In  
33:1082:89241:20:21:72:544:346:144:Times:144:Times:contrast,  we  found  that  employment  fell  when  the  news  arrived  and  continued  to  decline  for  a  
33:1083:89350:21:31:72:156:325:144:Times:144:Times:number of years. 
33:1084:89367:31:20:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:One might wonder whether the special nature of our oil news shock limits the degree to which it 
33:1085:89463:20:21:72:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:can  inform  the  news-driven  business  cycle  literature.    Our  theoretical  analysis  shows  that  the  
33:1086:89572:21:21:72:543:253:144:Times:144:Times:initial negative news effect on hours is not driven by the special feature of low labor share in the 
33:1087:89673:21:21:72:540:232:144:Times:144:Times:oil  sector.    Rather,  the  negative  effect  occurs  more  generally  when  the  news  is  about  a  sector-
33:1088:89784:21:20:72:545:211:144:Times:144:Times:specific,  rather  than  an  aggregate,  TFP  shock.    While  aggregate  TFP  shocks  are  useful  for  
33:1089:89889:20:21:72:547:191:144:Times:144:Times:theoretical  exercises,  it  would  be  difficult  to  find  one  in  reality.    Even  general  purpose  
33:1090:89995:21:31:72:549:170:144:Times:144:Times:technologies that ultimately raise aggregate TFP will initially be anticipated in only a few sectors.  
33:1091:90098:31:20:72:543:139:144:Times:144:Times:Our  finding  that  news  about  future  economic  events  leads  to  immediate  responses  is  consistent  
33:1092:90206:20:21:72:543:119:144:Times:144:Times:with  the  fiscal  literature  results  of  Ramey  (2011)  and  Barro  and  Redlick  (2011),  who  study  the  
33:1093:90317:21:0:72:543:98:144:Times:144:Times:effects of news about future government spending changes, and Mertens and Ravn (2012), who 
34:1094:90412:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:study the effects of news about future tax changes.  Like Mertens and Ravn (2012), we find that 
34:1095:90508:20:31:72:535:688:144:Times:144:Times:some key macroeconomic aggregates oscillate from negative to positive after the news arrives.   
34:1096:90604:31:21:71:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, our results also provide strong support for the notion that news about future output can 
34:1097:90702:21:20:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:be an important source of fluctuations in the current account.  Thus, our findings are supportive 
34:1098:90800:20:31:71:453:616:144:Times:144:Times:of the work of Engel and Rogers (2006) and Corsetti and Konstantinou (2012).

42:1419:103136:30:31:72:394:678:144:Times:144:Times:B.I. Approximation of production profile of giant oil discovery 
42:1420:103200:31:16:72:545:647:144:Times:144:Times:Following  the  typical  4-6  year  delay  after  the  discovery  announcement  of  a  giant  oil  field,  
42:1421:103307:16:16:72:542:631:144:Times:144:Times:production is set to start.41 To compute the net present value of giant oil field discoveries used in 
42:1422:103409:16:16:72:543:615:144:Times:144:Times:our econometric analysis, an approximation of the production profile following each discovery is 
42:1423:103506:16:25:72:524:599:144:Times:144:Times:needed considering the unavailability of comprehensive actual data on field level production.  
42:1424:103601:25:16:72:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:The  approximation  relies  on  empirical  production  rates  from  limited  available  production  data  
42:1425:103707:16:16:72:545:558:144:Times:144:Times:and  the  size  of  the  reserve  associated  with  the  discovery.  Given  the  assessment  of  the  initial  
42:1426:103818:16:16:72:546:542:144:Times:144:Times:reserve,  a  production  profile  is  derived  using  a  plateau  production  level  that  is  field  size  
42:1427:103926:16:16:72:544:526:144:Times:144:Times:dependent, qp  ,  and  a  maximum  depletion  rate  of  remaining  reserves,  dm.  Production  equals  the  
42:1428:104034:16:16:72:543:510:144:Times:144:Times:plateau level as long as the depletion rate d(t) is lower than the maximum rate. When exceeded, 
42:1429:104130:16:26:72:448:494:144:Times:144:Times:the depletion rate is held constant, causing exponential decline in production.  
42:1430:104211:26:34:72:377:468:144:Times:144:Times:The depletion rate of remaining reserves at time t is defined as:

43:1474:106222:25:16:71:544:331:144:Times:144:Times:To illustrate the approximation, Figure A1 shows the production and depletion rate for a typical

43:1476:106427:16:16:72:543:299:144:Times:144:Times:following the discovery announcement, production starts to rise and reaches a production plateau
