2:16:432:36:13:117:510:481:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:This  paper  examines  the  causal  effects  of  criminal  convictions  on  labor  market
2:17:521:13:14:101:510:468:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:outcomes in young men using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
2:18:600:14:13:101:510:454:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:1997 cohort.  Unlike previous research in this area which relies on assumptions strong
2:19:686:13:14:101:510:441:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:enough to obtain point identification, this paper imposes relatively weak nonparametric
2:20:773:14:13:101:510:427:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:assumptions that provide tight bounds on treatment effects.  Even in the absence of a
2:21:858:13:14:101:510:414:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:parametric model, under certain specifications, a zero effect can be ruled out, though
2:22:944:14:14:101:510:400:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:after a bias correction this result is lost.  In general the results for the effect on yearly
2:23:1037:14:13:101:510:386:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:earnings align well with previous findings, though the estimated effect on weeks worked
2:24:1124:13:14:101:510:373:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:are smaller than in previous findings.  Results of a novel sensitivity analysis test how
2:25:1212:14:13:101:510:359:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:the estimated bounds respond to a weakening/strengthening of two key assumptions.
2:26:1293:13:14:101:510:346:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:Even under a significant strengthening of a key assumption a negative treatment effect
2:27:1379:14:78:101:198:332:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:cannot be ruled out.

3:36:2097:0:53:72:208:696:17:g_d0_f11:17:g_d0_f11:1    Introduction
3:37:2114:53:24:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In April of 2011, the city of Philadelphia enacted a “ban the box” ordinance making it illegal
3:38:2208:24:24:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for employers to inquire into applicants’ criminal histories on initial job applications.  Four
3:39:2303:24:23:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:states have similar state-wide measures:  New Mexico, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Minnesota.
3:40:2392:23:24:72:540:572:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In the same year, the U.S. Department of Labor released nearly $12 million to 10 organi-
3:41:2480:24:24:72:540:548:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:zations to provide adult offenders with job market assistance.  Motivating these measures
3:42:2569:24:24:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is  the  conventional  wisdom  that  individuals  with  criminal  records  face  unique  difficulties
3:43:2670:24:24:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in the labor market.  One statistic that might stand as evidence of the existence of these
3:44:2760:24:24:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:difficulties  is  the  observed  negative  relationship  between  criminal  convictions  and  average
3:45:2861:24:24:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:earnings.  But to some extent convictions may simply be a mark of individuals with poor
3:46:2948:24:40:72:477:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:labor market skills, hence the evidentiary value of this statistic is questionable.
3:47:3031:40:24:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The sheer number of people affected marks the link between convictions and employment
3:48:3116:24:24:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcomes  as  an  area that  warrants  attention.   In  2009,  nearly  7.2  million  adults,  or  3.1%
3:49:3218:24:24:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the adult population, were incarcerated, on parole, or on probation (U.S. Department of
3:50:3308:24:24:72:540:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Justice 2010).  These figures are significantly higher than they were several decades ago -
3:51:3399:24:24:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the correctional population has quadrupled in the last 30 years - and this trend has been
3:52:3488:24:24:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:overwhelmingly  concentrated  among  young,  less  educated  men  (Western,  Kling,  Weiman
3:53:3579:24:24:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2001).  Given this concentration, any stigmatizing effect of convictions would work to further
3:54:3673:24:40:72:372:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:hinder a group already disadvantaged in the labor market.
3:55:3730:40:24:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The  labor  market  effects  of  interactions  with  the  criminal  justice  system  -  be  it  arrests,
3:56:3834:24:24:72:540:156:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:convictions, or incarcerations - are a well studied area in which several authors have used
3:57:3925:24:24:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:various empirical strategies to point identify causal effects of interest.  Freeman (1991), using
3:58:4022:24:24:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), finds individuals who had been in
3:59:4110:24:24:72:540:84:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:jail worked substantially fewer weeks several years after incarceration (between a 8 and 16
3:60:4201:24:0:72:540:60:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:week reduction).  He employs both a simple cross sectional regression and one that exploits
4:61:4293:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the longitudinal nature of the 1979 NLSY controlling for before incarceration labor market
4:62:4383:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:experience.  Grogger (1995), also addressing possible endogeneity concerns over convictions
4:63:4474:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with a fixed effect panel model, focuses on California data from individuals arrested between
4:64:4567:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:1973 and 1987 to estimate the effect of arrests on earnings and employment levels over the
4:65:4657:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:years 1980-1984 (using the ‘as yet to be arrested’ as a control group).  He finds arrests to
4:66:4749:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:have a negative effect on young mens’ earnings in the range of about 4% but that this effect
4:67:4841:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:disipates after 6 quarters and the effect of convictions above arrest is insignificant.  He also
4:68:4937:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:finds  simple  arrests  to  have  no  negative  effects  on  employment  (even  significant  positive
4:69:5038:24:24:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effects) though multiple arrests have significant negative effects on employment lasting up to
4:70:5132:24:23:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:five quarters. Allgood, Mustard and Warren (2003), also using the 1979 NLSY cohort, relying
4:71:5223:23:24:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on a selection-on-observables assumption, focus on youth (aged 14-21) criminal arrests and
4:72:5313:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:convictions on 1983 and 1989 earnings, and find a criminal conviction causes a reduction in
4:73:5404:24:24:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:earnings of 12% which lasts up to ten years.  They also find being charged but not convicted
4:74:5496:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:as a youth has no effect.  Finlay (2008) using the 1997-2004 waves of the 1997 NLSY and
4:75:5583:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a fixed effect panel strategy investigates the effect of incarceration on several labor market
4:76:5677:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcomes.  He fails to find a significant effect on wages or employment but finds a very large
4:77:5771:24:40:72:366:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effect on yearly earnings in the range of a 20% reduction.
4:78:5829:40:24:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Another  strand  of  the  literature  uses  some  form  of  experiment  or  instrument  to  identify
4:79:5929:24:24:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other specific causal effects of interest.  Pager (2003) uses and experimental audit to assess
4:80:6023:24:24:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:employers’ responses to job applicants with criminal histories.  She finds white men with self
4:81:6117:24:24:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reported criminal records are only 50% as likely to receive a ‘callback’ from an employer.
4:82:6207:24:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Black men were found to be even more penalized for a criminal record and were only 33% as
4:83:6296:24:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:likely to receive a callback (and this is beyond the already 50% reduction in callbacks non-
4:84:6388:24:24:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:criminal black men received compared to non-criminal white men). Finlay (2008) investigates
4:85:6479:24:24:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:how  the  expanded  availability  of  criminal  history  data  through  the  internet  affects  labor
4:86:6580:24:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcomes of those with and without criminal histories. He finds the effects of incarceration on
5:87:6676:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:employment and earnings to be larger in states with open record policies.  Kling (2006) uses
5:88:6768:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:multiple estimation strategies, including using randomly assigned judges and their history
5:89:6858:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of  leniency  as  an  instrument  for  incarceration  length,  and  fails  to  find  strong  evidence  of
5:90:6963:24:41:72:429:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:substantial effects of incarceration length on employment or earnings.
5:91:7033:41:24:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This paper investigates the effects criminal convictions have on several labor market outcomes
5:92:7127:24:23:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of interest and adds to the literature in two ways.  First, it uses a newer data set than used
5:93:7221:23:24:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in  most  previous  studies,  the  1997  National  Longitudinal  Survey  of  Youth,  and  focuses
5:94:7318:24:24:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on  2006  labor  market  outcomes.   Given  the  dramatic  rise  in  the  correctional  population
5:95:7416:24:24:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in  the  last  few  decades  this  seems  warranted.   Second,  this  paper  differs  from  previous
5:96:7516:24:24:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:studies in the choice of  identification strategy.  In a  similar strand to Kling (2006),  given
5:97:7612:24:24:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the latitude given to prosecutors over charges and deferred prosecutions, one might consider
5:98:7704:24:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the  variation  in  local  district  attorneys’  prosecution  record  (or  a  similar  measure)  as  an
5:99:7807:24:24:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:instrument for criminal convictions much as Kling used judges’ record as an instrument for
5:100:7897:24:24:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:prison length.  However, the exogeneity of this variable is likely to be more contentious as
5:101:7989:24:24:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the prosecutors’ record is likely to be much more reflective of local conditions.  Furthermore,
5:102:8084:24:23:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:using a fixed effect panel approach to capture individual heterogeneity as a means to control
5:103:8177:23:24:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for the endogeneity of convictions also seems less than appealing in the current setting as
5:104:8268:24:24:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:many  convictions  appear  very  early  in  adulthood  prior  to  much  being  revealed  regarding
5:105:8366:24:24:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individual  labor  market  potential.   Thus,  as  an  alternative,  this  paper  applies  a  partial
5:106:8467:24:24:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identification strategy that derives its power from relatively weaker assumptions than those
5:107:8559:24:24:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:typically  imposed.   Though  point  identification  of  the  causal  parameters  is  not  obtained,
5:108:8659:24:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:informative identification regions emerge.  In particular, I estimate identification regions for
5:109:8755:24:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:three causal effects: the causal effect of criminal convictions on yearly earnings, hourly wages
5:110:8851:24:24:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and weeks worked.  In Section 2, I articulate the identification problem within the potential
5:111:8944:24:24:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcomes  framework  and  discusses  in  detail  assumptions  used  in  this  analysis.   Section  3
5:112:9044:24:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:introduces  the  data,  estimation  methods  and  inference.   Section  4  discusses  results  and  a

6:115:9219:58:49:72:335:567:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:2.1Potential Outcomes Framework
6:116:9250:49:23:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Causal effects are common subjects of interest in a wide range of fields.  When the impact
6:117:9340:23:24:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:variable  is  dichotomous,  as  in  the  present  setting,  it  is  convention  to  refer  to  the  causal
6:118:9446:24:24:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effect as a treatment effect.  The potential outcomes framework presented below provides an
6:119:9537:24:41:72:371:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:intuitive setting in which to analyze questions of this sort.
6:120:9598:41:24:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Each individualjin the populationJis characterized by covariatesxj∈Xand response

6:122:9755:24:23:71:540:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcomesyj(t)∈Y.  The treatment is dichotomous:  being convicted of a crime or not.  Each
6:123:9844:23:24:71:539:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individualjhas a realized treatmentzj∈Tand a realized outcomeyj≡yj(zj) which are
6:124:9924:24:24:71:539:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:both observed.  Latent outcomesyj(t),t6=zjare not observed.  Treatment effect is defined
6:125:10012:24:41:71:146:287:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:asy(1)−y(0).
6:126:10024:41:43:71:510:246:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A distributional characteristic of usual interest is the average treatment effect (ATE):
6:127:10112:43:44:180:540:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ATE =E[y(1)−y(0)|x] =E[y(1)|x]−E[y(0)|x].(1)
6:128:10156:44:24:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The ATE is defined as the expected treatment effect if treatment were randomly assigned
6:129:10243:24:24:72:539:135:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to the population.  If interest is in the ATE, what is problematic is that neitherE[y(1)|x]
6:130:10334:24:24:72:539:111:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:norE[y(0)|x]  is  observed,  but  ratherE[y(1)|x,z=  1]  andE[y(0)|x,z=  0].   Given  that
6:131:10424:24:24:72:540:87:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individuals self-select into criminal activities, and that these individuals are likely to exhibit
6:132:10522:24:0:72:540:63:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other unobserved characteristics which also affect their labor market outcomes, one is likely
7:133:10616:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to  be  reluctant  to  assumeE[y(t)|x,z=t]  =E[y(t)|x].   This  is  simply  the  endogeneity
7:134:10708:24:41:71:333:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:problem stated in a potential outcomes framework.
7:135:10757:41:24:71:539:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:To see where further assumptions are necessary for identification, we can rewriteE[y(t)|x]
7:136:10847:24:43:72:268:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:using the law of iterated expectations:
7:137:10886:43:44:126:540:564:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:E[y(t)|x]   =E[y(t)|x,z=t]P(z=t|x) +E[y(t)|x,z=t′]P(z=t′|x).(2)
7:138:10949:44:24:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The data identify sample analogues of all of the right hand side quantities except the counter-
7:139:11044:24:24:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:factualE[y(t)|x,z=t′].  This might represent expected income under a conviction treatment
7:140:11133:24:24:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for those who actually received the non-conviction treatment.  The data bring us part of the
7:141:11225:24:24:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:way towards identifying the ATE, but the remaining distance must be covered by credible
7:142:11312:24:40:72:138:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:assumptions.
7:143:11324:40:24:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Rather than resting on assumptions strong enough to point identify the ATE, this paper uses
7:144:11415:24:24:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:several assumptions to partially identify the ATE. The main results of this paper emerge
7:145:11503:24:24:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:from the imposition of three assumptions:  mean monotone treatment response (MMTR),
7:146:11586:24:24:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:monotone  treatment  selection  (MTS),  and  monotone  instrumental  variable  (MIV).  These
7:147:11678:24:63:72:375:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:assumptions are explained in full in the following sections2.
7:148:11739:63:48:72:254:225:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:2.2Worst Case Bounds
7:149:11759:48:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Even if a researcher is not willing to impose any assumptions on the response function or
7:150:11848:24:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:selection mechanism, it is still possible to bound the treatment effect if the support of the
7:151:11941:24:24:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcome variable is bounded (Manski, 1989).  Though the counterfactuals in Equation (2)
7:152:12028:24:18:72:539:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are not observed, they can be bounded ifYhas a bounded outcome space.  LetE[y(t)|x,z=
7:153:12113:18:16:85:539:87:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f10:2What  follows  is  by  no  means  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  bounding  literature  which  is  a  vast  and
7:154:12228:16:0:72:497:71:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:growing field.  Rather what follows is a brief explanation of the assumptions used in this analysis.
8:155:12329:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(t′)]∈[Kl,Ku]. Note that whenYis binary, these expectations can be viewed as probabilities
8:156:12419:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:which  necessarily  lie  between  0  and  1  implying  the  natural  valuesKl=  0  andKu=  1.
8:157:12512:24:24:71:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:WhenYis continuous, the researcher may choose finite values for these parameters based,
8:158:12599:24:24:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for  example,  on  the  range  of  the  data  or  relevant  prior  knowledge.   Imposing  a  bounded
8:159:12699:24:44:71:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:outcome space on the counterfactuals leads toworst case boundson the unknownsE[y(t)|x]:
8:160:12786:44:43:246:540:556:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:LBt≤E[y(t)|x]≤UBt(3)
8:161:12806:43:44:71:101:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:where
8:162:12811:44:27:171:436:469:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:LBt=E[y(t)|x,z=t]P(z=t|x) +KlP(z=t′|x)
8:163:12849:27:60:170:441:442:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:UBt=E[y(t)|x,z=t]P(z=t|x) +KuP(z=t′|x).
8:164:12888:60:24:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Applying these results to Equations (1) and (2) lead to worst case bounds on the average
8:165:12976:24:24:71:156:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:treatment effect:
8:166:12993:24:35:216:540:334:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:LB1−UB0≤ATE≤UB1−LB0.(4)
8:167:13016:35:24:71:539:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Worst case bounds tend to be limited in the information they convey because they necessarily
8:168:13108:24:63:71:483:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:include zero.  More informative bounds on the ATE require further assumptions.
8:169:13186:63:48:71:330:212:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:2.3Monotone Treatment Selection
8:170:13217:48:24:71:539:164:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:As previously noted, exogenous selection is unlikely to be a credible assumption in the current
8:171:13312:24:24:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:setting.  However, a weaker Monotone Treatment Selection assumption (Manski and Pepper
8:172:13398:24:40:71:240:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2000) seems much more realistic:
8:173:13430:40:0:71:538:76:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f14:MTS Assumption:LetTbe ordered. For eacht∈T, eachx∈Xand all(u0,u1)∈T×T
9:174:13500:0:24:72:165:696:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:such thatu1≥u0,
9:175:13515:24:35:212:540:672:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:E[y(t)|x,z=u1]≥E[y(t)|x,z=u0].(5)
9:176:13548:35:24:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:MTS  assumes  a  characteristic  concerning  the  relationship  between  the  selection  process
9:177:13644:24:24:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and the outcome process (in this context one should view the self-selected treatment as its
9:178:13735:24:24:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:own realized covariate).  Specifically, MTS presumes, for example, that those with a ‘lower’
9:179:13827:24:24:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:realized treatment (z = criminal conviction) exhibit other unobserved characteristics that
9:180:13917:24:23:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:would lead them to have no greater expected incomes under either potential treatment than
9:181:14006:23:24:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:those with a ‘higher’ realized treatment (z = not convicted).  This is precisely why one might
9:182:14100:24:24:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:find standard regression methods unappealing in the current setting.  One would likely be
9:183:14189:24:24:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:skeptical of inferring a causal interpretation of the coefficient on criminal convictions in a
9:184:14283:24:24:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:standard regression due to concerns over correlation between the regressor and the error term.
9:185:14377:24:63:72:531:422:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The MTS assumption turns this concern into an assumption to be used for identification.
9:186:14464:63:48:72:332:359:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:2.4Monotone Treatment Response
9:187:14494:48:24:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The Monotone Treatment Response (Manski 1997) assumption specifies a relationship be-
9:188:14579:24:24:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tweeny(1) andy(0).  It maintains that if treatments have some natural ordering then out-
9:189:14667:24:41:72:264:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:comes vary monotonically with them.
9:190:14702:41:43:72:354:222:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f14:MTR Assumption:Let T be ordered. For eachj∈J
9:191:14746:43:44:242:540:179:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:t1≥t0⇒yj(t1)≥yj(t0).(6)
9:192:14769:44:24:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In  the  present  study,  this  assumption  implies,  for  example,  that  yearly  income  for  each
9:193:14869:24:24:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individual will be no greater if convicted of a crime than if not convicted.  MTR also implies
9:194:14963:24:0:72:159:87:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a weaker variant:
10:195:14981:0:24:72:205:696:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Mean MTR (MMTR):
10:196:14997:24:35:238:540:672:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:E[y(1)|x,z]≥E[y(0)|x,z].(7)
10:197:15024:35:24:71:539:637:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This follows from MTR by definition of the expectation function.  Under this assumption,
10:198:15112:24:24:71:539:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:expected incomes would be no greater for the population under a conviction treatment than
10:199:15201:24:24:71:539:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:under  a  non-conviction  treatment.   This,  though  admittedly  a  strong  assumption,  seems
10:200:15296:24:24:71:539:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reasonable in the current setting and in accordance with previous literature.  Furthermore,
10:201:15387:24:23:71:539:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:as the goal is to identify a region of consensus as to the magnitude of the treatment effects,
10:202:15481:23:24:71:539:518:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:results stemming from a relaxation of this assumption are given in the sensitivity analysis
10:203:15572:24:41:71:109:494:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:section.
10:204:15580:41:24:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Though the worst case bounds depend on the imposed bounded support on expected out-
10:205:15663:24:24:71:540:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:comes (Kl,Ku), bounds stemming from the imposition of MMTR and MTS do not.  The
10:206:15742:24:24:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:imposition  of  the  joint  MMTR  and  MTS  assumptions  can  have  significant  identification
10:207:15837:24:23:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:power  and  directly  relate  to  the  response  and  selection  process.   In  what  follows,  mono-
10:208:15938:23:24:71:539:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tone instrumental variables (MIV) brings to bear a different type of assumption that, when
10:209:16028:24:63:71:495:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:invoked along with MMTR and MTS, can further tighten the identification region.
10:210:16107:63:49:71:353:271:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:2.5Monotone Instrumental Variables
10:211:16141:49:23:71:539:222:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The method of instrumental variables is widely used in the evaluation of treatment effects
10:212:16231:23:24:71:539:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:when endogeneity is a concern.  Though standard IV assumptions can aid greatly in iden-
10:213:16318:24:24:71:539:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tification,  the  credibility  of  the  instrument  is  often  a  matter  of  disagreement,  specifically
10:214:16423:24:24:71:539:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:whether the exclusion restriction is a valid assumption.  This provides motivation for con-
10:215:16514:24:24:71:539:127:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sidering weaker, and thus more credible, assumptions to aid identification.  First, consider a
10:216:16608:24:41:71:352:103:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f7:mean independenceform of the standard IV condition:

11:225:17113:61:23:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The instrument used in this analysis is the respondents’ test scores from the Armed Services

11:227:17291:24:24:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of 1998.  In treating this variable as an MIV, it is assumed that under either treatment, those
11:228:17386:24:24:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with lower instrument levels (low test score) have expected outcomes no better than those
11:229:17475:24:24:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with higher instrument levels (high test scores).  This assumption stems from the belief that
11:230:17568:24:24:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:standardized test scores are likely correlated with some level of innate ability or intelligence

12:235:17836:49:24:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The data used in this study come from the 1997 cohort of the NLSY. The 1997 NSLY is a
12:236:17921:24:23:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:nationally representative sample of nearly 9,000 youths born between 1980 and 1984 with an
12:237:18011:23:24:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:over-sample of minorities.  This paper’s population of interest is black and white men with at
12:238:18105:24:24:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:most a high school diploma who are not enrolled in school (thus, in the above notation,xis
12:239:18195:24:24:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:defined over gender, race, education and enrollment status).  The income variable is reported
12:240:18288:24:24:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:income earned from an outside employer for 2006.  If self reported income is not available
12:241:18378:24:24:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:but an income range is, then the mean of that range is used for yearly income.  The hourly
12:242:18468:24:24:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:wage variable is a weighted average of all wages earned from an outside employer, excluding
12:243:18559:24:24:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:military, in 2006, where the weights used are hours employed.  Weeks worked is the number
12:244:18648:24:24:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of weeks for which an individual reported having gainful employment.  For yearly income I
12:245:18737:24:24:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:restrict the sample to those reporting at least $5,000.  For hourly wages responses less than
12:246:18830:24:24:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:$5 an hour or above $50 an hour are not included.  For weeks worked I restrict the sample
12:247:18919:24:23:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:used to those working at least 1 week in the year.  The conviction variable is based on self
12:248:19011:23:24:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reported  criminal  convictions  not  settled  in  juvenile  court  prior  to  2006.   Incarceration  is
12:249:19115:24:24:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:measured as if an individual spent time in jail during any week prior to 2006.  There is a
12:250:19205:24:24:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:potential concern regarding measurement error given that conviction status is self reported.
12:251:19297:24:24:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Though one is partially reassured noting that the frequency of ‘refusal to answer’ sensitive
12:252:19389:24:24:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:questions in the NLSY questionnaire considerably declines in the latter years of the survey
12:253:19480:24:24:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:compared to initial years, and that many refused questions are subsequently asked again and
12:254:19571:24:24:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:answered in later years, the issue cannot be fully dismissed.  While this issue is noted as a
12:255:19664:24:24:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:potential concern, I do not directly address a solution.  For a recent paper addressing such
12:256:19756:24:0:72:419:87:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:concerns in a similar bounding framework see Kreider et al.  (2012).

13:258:19921:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:covering the non-convicted individuals, convicted individuals, as well as convicted individ-
13:259:20013:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:uals who where never incarcerated.  Due to different restrictions regarding inclusion in the
13:260:20105:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:analysis, these sample sizes differ.  When looking at the full NLSY sample of white men there
13:261:20198:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is a conviction rate of 17.1%, of which 36% spent time in jail, for an ever-incarcerated rate of
13:262:20294:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:6.2%.  For black males there is a conviction rate of 21.7%, of which 59% spent time in jail, for
13:263:20390:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:an ever-incarcerated rate of 12.8%.  When looking at these percentages for the samples used
13:264:20481:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in this study they vary due to individuals going to college or not being present for the study
13:265:20575:24:24:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:or not being in the labor market.  For example, of white men present in the 2007 wave and
13:266:20664:24:23:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:valid for the study 24% were convicted of crimes verses 21.5% for black men.  While attrition
13:267:20757:23:24:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:rates  are  similar  for  the  two  groups  (16.1%  of  black  men  are  absent  from  2007  wave  and
13:268:20859:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:17.6% of white men), college rates differ markedly for the two groups within the reporting
13:269:20949:24:24:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:population (24% for whites and 9.5% for blacks).  Furthermore, valid ‘participation’ in the
13:270:21040:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:labor  markets  vary  greatly  between  the  groups  as  well  with  participation  generally  being
13:271:21140:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:higher for white men.  One should note that some who were not present in the 2007 wave
13:272:21226:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:nonetheless have 2006 data available due to data being collected in subsequent years.  This
13:273:21317:24:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is why, for example, there are more white men used in the weeks worked analysis then were
13:274:21406:24:40:72:202:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:present in the 2007 wave.

13:276:21525:24:24:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:differences between convicted and non-convicted respondents.  When looking at differences
13:277:21614:24:24:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in white men between convicted and never convicted individuals there are clear differences
13:278:21704:24:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with  non-convicted  individuals  having  higher  incomes,  wages,  and  weeks  worked.   When
13:279:21798:24:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:comparing non-convicted individuals to those convicted but who never spent time in jail, the
13:280:21890:24:24:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:differences still persist, though not always at the 5% confidence level (though well within the
13:281:21985:24:24:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:10% confidence level).  For black men, though the difference is present and significant when
13:282:22077:24:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:comparing  yearly  income  between  non-convicted  and  convicted  individuals,  it  disappears
14:283:22174:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:completely when the treatment group is those convicted but who never spent time in jail.
14:284:22262:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:No differences appear at all in hourly wages for either comparison group, though differences
14:285:22354:24:63:72:362:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:persist regardless of comparison group for weeks worked.
14:286:22410:63:48:72:292:585:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:3.2Estimation and Inference
14:287:22437:48:24:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Estimated  bounds  are  functions  of  expected  wages,  probabilities  of  being  convicted,  and
14:288:22535:24:24:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:probabilities of realized instrument values, all of which can easily be computed nonparamet-
14:289:22627:24:24:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:rically.  For worst case bounds and bounds under MMTR/MTS, these values are calculated
14:290:22713:24:24:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:by sample analogs.  For bounds under the test score MIV, expectations and probabilities are
14:291:22804:24:24:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:estimated via smoothing splines (penalized least squares) using generalized cross validation
14:292:22896:24:24:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for the degrees of freedom selection.  Although nonparametric estimators allow researchers
14:293:22986:24:24:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to  estimate  free  of  functional  form,  they  are  limited  by  the  number  of  conditioning  vari-
14:294:23089:24:24:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ables.  The estimates in this paper condition on gender, race, education, enrollment status
14:295:23180:24:24:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and relevant instrument where an MIV is utilized.  But this limited number of conditioning
14:296:23270:24:23:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:variables should not affect the consistency of the results as long as the assumptions defined
14:297:23363:23:24:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:above hold.  Due to data limitations an increase in the number of control variables is not
14:298:23453:24:41:72:113:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:feasible.
14:299:23462:41:24:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:An important concern when estimating bounds with MIVs is that analog estimates of such
14:300:23548:24:24:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bounds exhibit finite-sample bias which lead the bounds to be narrower (more optimistic)
14:301:23636:24:24:72:539:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:than  the  true  bounds.   By  Jensen’s  Inequality,  the  estimated  lower  bound  onE[y(t)|x]  is
14:302:23735:24:23:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:biased upwards because of the maxima operator and the estimated upper bound is biased
14:303:23820:23:24:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:downward because of the minima operator.  To counter this bias, I implement a correction
14:304:23908:24:24:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:proposed  by  Kreider  and  Pepper  (2007).   The  approach  is  to  estimate  the  bias  by  using
14:305:24007:24:24:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the  bootstrap  distribution  and  then  adjust  the  analogue  estimate  in  accordance  with  the
14:306:24106:24:0:72:540:66:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:estimated bias.  For a random sample of sizeN, letLBNbe the analogue estimate of the
15:307:24192:0:24:72:539:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:lower bound in question, and letEb(LBN) be the mean of the estimate from the bootstrap
15:308:24278:24:24:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:distribution (a parallel procedure is used for an upper bound).  The bias is then estimated as
15:309:24372:24:0:71:384:648:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f16:Eb(LBN)−LBN.  The bias-corrected estimate is thenLBN−
15:310:24425:0:9:386:391:657:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f19:[
15:311:24426:9:0:391:476:648:12:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f15:Eb(LBN)−LBN
15:312:24437:0:9:477:482:657:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f19:]
15:313:24438:9:24:485:539:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f16:= 2LBN−
15:314:24445:24:24:72:539:624:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f7:Eb(LBN).  While heuristic and not derived from theory, this correction seems reasonable and
15:315:24536:24:41:71:430:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:performs well in Monte Carlo simulations (Manski and Pepper, 2009).
15:316:24603:41:23:71:539:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Statistical inference for partially identified parameters is somewhat more challenging than
15:317:24694:23:24:71:539:536:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:estimation itself and is the focus of a currently active literature.  A consensus on the ‘correct’
15:318:24792:24:24:71:539:512:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:type of confidence interval that should be reported is still evolving.  The results of partial
15:319:24886:24:24:71:539:488:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identification analysis are regions of identification defined by upper and lower bounds which
15:320:24979:24:24:71:539:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:contain the parameter of interest.  When considering confidence intervals in these settings,
15:321:25071:24:24:71:539:440:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the question arises of whether to construct intervals over the region of identification or over
15:322:25166:24:24:71:539:416:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the actual parameter of interest.  Intervals presented here cover the parameter of interest
15:323:25257:24:71:71:433:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with fixed probability and were derived by Imbens and Manski (2004).

15:327:25455:24:24:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.   Note  that  since  criminal  convictions  have  negative  impacts  on  outcomes,  the  largest
15:328:25554:24:24:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effect in magnitude is the lower bound.  Initial worst case bounds on the ATE of criminal
15:329:25643:24:24:71:539:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:convictions on yearly income are quite large and are not very informative.3They confine the
15:330:25734:24:24:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:identification region to a range of $20,000 and necessarily contain zero.  Once the MMTR
15:331:25822:24:17:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and MTS assumptions are imposed the bounds shrink dramatically.  For white men, when
15:332:25906:17:0:85:393:78:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f10:3To obtain these boundsKlis set to $15,000 andKuis set to $35,000.
16:333:25974:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:including the full convicted group as the treatment group, they span the general range of $0 to
16:334:26069:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:-$5,000; they then shrink to a lower bound of -$3,500 when the comparison group is convicted
16:335:26161:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individuals who never spent time in prison.  This is a similar range for black men when using
16:336:26254:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the entire convicted group as treatment group.  Adding the MIV assumption further tightens
16:337:26344:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the bounds on the ATE and signs the treatment effects away from zero.  For white mean the
16:338:26433:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effect of convictions lowers yearly wages by at least $390 to $277 depending on the treatment
16:339:26526:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:group and at most between about $2,500 and $3,500.  However, once the bias correction is
16:340:26614:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:implemented the bounds can no longer exclude a zero effect.  For black men, when using the
16:341:26704:24:24:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:entire convicted population as the treatment group, the joint MIV/MMTR/MTS bounds on
16:342:26788:24:23:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the effect on yearly income range from -$2,064 to -$433, this larger effect being about an 8%
16:343:26881:23:24:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reduction.  However, again once the bias correction is included these bounds cannot exclude
16:344:26972:24:41:72:137:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a zero effect.
16:345:26986:41:24:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:These finding are well in line with the results found by Grogger (1995).  His results, after
16:346:27078:24:24:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:adjusting for inflation, amount to about a $320 to $1,000 decline in yearly earnings due to
16:347:27169:24:24:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:arrests.  The results found by Allgood, Mustard and Warren (2003) and Finlay (2009) are
16:348:27256:24:40:72:270:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:also well within the ranges found here.
16:349:27295:40:24:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Initial worst case bounds on the ATE on hourly wages span a range of $20 and necessarily
16:350:27383:24:24:72:539:256:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:contain zero.4Bounds under the joint MMTR-MTS assumptions significantly reduce this
16:351:27466:24:24:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:range.  The lower bound for white men, when all those convicted are the treatment group,
16:352:27554:24:24:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is -$1.59, though it is slightly higher at -$1.28 when the treatment group is focused only on
16:353:27647:24:24:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:those who never spent time in jail.  In this case the MIV, though cannot bound the ATE
16:354:27733:24:24:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:away from zero, does tighten the bounds when the treatment group is the never incarcerated
16:355:27823:24:23:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:group to a lower bound of -$0.58, though again this is gain is lost once the bias correction is
16:356:27918:23:24:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:added.  The analysis is not done for black men as convicted and non-convicted individuals
16:357:28007:24:18:72:300:89:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:do not show significantly different outcomes.
16:358:28052:18:0:85:352:71:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f10:4To obtain these boundsKlis set to $5 andKuis set to $25.
17:359:28111:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Worst case bounds on the ATE on weeks worked span a range of 38 weeks and by definition
17:360:28198:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:contain zero.5The joint MMTR-MTS assumptions significantly tighten these bounds to a
17:361:28282:24:24:71:539:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:range of less than 2 weeks for white men under either treatment group and about 4 weeks
17:362:28369:24:24:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for  black  men  under  either  treatment  group.   The  addition  of  the  MIV  then  bounds  the
17:363:28467:24:24:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:treatment effect away for black men away from zero and cuts the maximum magnitude of
17:364:28551:24:24:71:539:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the effect on black men to almost 3 weeks when using men who were never incarcerated as
17:365:28638:24:24:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the treatment group.  However, once the bias correction is accounted for none of these upper
17:366:28730:24:24:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bounds are significantly different than zero and the gain from the MIV is lost.  Nonetheless
17:367:28822:24:24:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the upper bounds on the magnitudes of these effects are much smaller than those found by
17:368:28910:24:40:71:526:480:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Freeman (1991), though his focus is on having spent time in jail rather than convictions.
17:369:28999:40:24:71:539:440:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It is worth noting the differences in the effects for white and black men on wages, income
17:370:29089:24:24:71:539:416:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and  weeks  worked  when  the  treatment  group  is  changed  from  all  those  convicted  to  only
17:371:29188:24:24:71:539:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:those convicted but who never spent time in jail.  For white men, the bounds of the effect
17:372:29278:24:24:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of convictions tend to be similar regardless of the definition of the treatment group (though
17:373:29371:24:24:71:539:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:slightly smaller when the treatment group is those who were never incarcerated, as one might
17:374:29463:24:23:71:539:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:expect).  This implies the pure stigma from having a conviction likely causes losses(since the
17:375:29557:23:24:71:539:297:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:one treatment group was convicted but spent no time in jail and thus there is no direct loss
17:376:29649:24:24:71:539:273:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of experience).  Yet for black men, though the effect of convictions on income can only be
17:377:29739:24:24:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bound when using all those convicted as the treatment group, when those who spent time in
17:378:29828:24:24:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:jail are removed from the treatment group, those convicted and those not convicted do not
17:379:29917:24:24:71:539:201:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:even have significantly different incomes.  Also, under neither treatment group do convicted
17:380:30009:24:24:71:539:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:vs.   non-convicted  black  men  exhibit  significantly  different  hourly  wages.   Only  in  weeks
17:381:30109:24:24:71:539:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:worked do black and white men exhibit similar causal effects of criminal convictions, in that
17:382:30202:24:24:71:539:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:it reduces weeks worked under either treatment group definition.  One might speculate that
17:383:30292:24:24:71:539:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:this is due to black men already facing dimmer job prospects, so wages have less downward
17:384:30381:24:18:71:539:81:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:mobility then white men, while it may still be harder to actually find work, thus the effect
17:385:30473:18:0:85:359:63:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f10:5These bounds are obtained by settingKlto 12 andKuto 50.
18:386:30531:0:63:72:417:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on weeks worked still comes through regardless of treatment group.
18:387:30597:63:49:72:250:633:14:g_d0_f11:14:g_d0_f13:4.2Sensitivity Analysis
18:388:30620:49:23:72:553:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:One interesting question is how sensitive the estimated bounds are to a relaxation/strengthening
18:389:30716:23:24:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the MMTR and MTS assumptions. Assuming MMTR imposes ex ante a non-positive ATE
18:390:30797:24:24:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:while MTS imposes the direction of the selection mechanism, both of which can be strength-
18:391:30887:24:41:72:165:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ened or weakened.
18:392:30904:41:43:72:362:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Take the following modification of the MTS assumption:
18:393:30958:43:44:191:540:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(1 +α)·E[y(t)|x,z=u1]≥E[y(t)|x,z=u0](8)
18:394:30997:44:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and allowαto vary.  Settingα= 0.05 implies, for example, expected earnings under either
18:395:31084:24:24:72:539:361:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:potential  treatment  for  those  convicted  of  a  crime  are  at  most  5%greaterthan  expected
18:396:31181:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:earnings under the same potential treatment for those not convicted of a crime (a weakening
18:397:31272:24:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the MTS assumption),  while settingα=−0.05 implies expected earnings under either
18:398:31356:24:24:72:539:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:potential treatment for those convicted of a crime are at most 5%lessthan expected earnings
18:399:31447:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:under the same potential treatment for those not convicted of a crime (a strengthening of the
18:400:31540:24:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:MTS assumption).  A parallel modification to the MMTR assumption is straightforward.  A
18:401:31627:23:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:graphical depiction of this analysis for bounds when using the full sample is given in Figures
18:402:31721:24:41:72:95:194:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:1-56.
18:403:31726:41:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:When looking at the lower bounds on the treatment effects (stemming from MTS and MIV)
18:404:31811:24:18:72:539:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:one can see that even strengthening the MTS assumption by settingα=−0.1 still leaves
18:405:31895:18:15:85:539:111:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f10:6Because the current application’s treatment of interest is binary only the MMTR assumption applies to
18:406:31997:15:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:the upper bound and only the MTS assumption applies to the lower.  If one were to apply this analysis to
18:407:32101:12:12:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:the case of a multi-valued treatment one would need to take care and note that in general both the MMTR
18:408:32204:12:0:72:344:72:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:and MTS assumptions apply to both upper and lower bounds.
19:409:32263:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the possibility of a fairly large causal effect on all outcomes, and in some cases, such as the
19:410:32358:24:24:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effect of convictions on income, even settingα=−0.15 still leaves room for very large causal
19:411:32450:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effects.  This implies that if one is willing go beyond simply assuming the direction of the
19:412:32542:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:selection mechanism and even enforce a large impact on the outcome of interest from the
19:413:32629:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:selection mechanism, a causal effect from criminal convictions still cannot be ruled out.  The
19:414:32723:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effect of a weakening of the MMTR assumption results in trivial results due to the fact that
19:415:32815:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in the current application the MIV does not lend any identifying power beyond the MMTR
19:416:32901:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:assumption  on  the  upper  bound  (all  figures  are  graphed  post  bias  correction),  though  in
19:417:33001:24:24:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other  settings  where  identifying  power  is  gained  by  the  MIV  beyond  that  of  MMTR  this
19:418:33099:24:70:72:301:480:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:analysis is likely to reveal interesting results.
19:419:33148:70:53:72:194:410:17:g_d0_f11:17:g_d0_f11:5    Conclusion
19:420:33163:53:24:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This paper investigates the causal effects of criminal convictions on yearly income, hourly
19:421:33254:24:24:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:wages, and weeks worked.  Unlike previous research in this area which relies on assumptions
19:422:33345:24:23:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:strong enough to yield point identification, this paper focuses on weaker assumptions that
19:423:33435:23:24:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:yield tight bounds on the ATE. Imposing two relatively innocuous restrictions (MMTR and
19:424:33522:24:24:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:MTS) stemming from economic theory regarding the response and selection mechanism are
19:425:33607:24:24:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sufficient  to  provide  informative  identification  regions  of  the  average  treatment  effects  of
19:426:33710:24:24:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:criminal convictions on labor market outcomes.  Furthermore, using a plausible monotone
19:427:33797:24:24:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:instrumental variable, standardized test scores, in many cases further narrows the bounds
19:428:33886:24:24:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on the average treatment effect and in some cases signs the ATE away from zero, though
19:429:33972:24:40:72:357:142:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:after a correction for finite sample bias this gain is lost.
19:430:34032:40:24:72:540:102:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The bounds on the effect of criminal convictions on early incomes found here align well with
19:431:34124:24:0:72:540:78:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:results found in previous studies. However the bounds on the effect on weeks worked resulting
20:432:34219:0:24:72:540:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:from this analysis rule out the estimated effect found by Freeman (1991), though estimated
20:433:34309:24:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:confidence intervals cannot rule out his estimates.  Interestingly, when those who have spent
20:434:34402:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:time  in  jail  are  eliminated  from  the  conviction  treatment  group  for  black  men,  there  is
20:435:34503:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:no  longer  a  significant  difference  in  yearly  earnings  when  compared  to  the  control  group,
20:436:34605:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:though the bounds on the effect on weeks worked are very similar under either specification.
20:437:34697:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Additionally  a  novel  sensitivity  analysis  is  conducted  to  test  how  the  estimated  bounds
20:438:34796:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:respond  to  a  weakening/strengthening  of  the  MMTR  and  MTS  assumptions.   I  find  that

20:443:35172:24:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:endogenous  selection  requires  the  researcher  to  make  explicit  assumptions  regarding  data
20:444:35270:24:24:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:generation.  This paper has studied the identifying power of various assumptions.  Assump-
20:445:35360:24:24:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tions  directly  related  to  the  selection  and  response  functions  have  substantial  identifying
20:446:35462:24:24:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:power.  The inclusion of a variant of the traditional instrumental variable assumption yields
20:447:35555:24:23:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:informative bounds on the ATEs but still fall short of being able to point identify the average
20:448:35650:23:24:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:treatment effects.  Stronger conclusions about treatment effects require stronger statistical
