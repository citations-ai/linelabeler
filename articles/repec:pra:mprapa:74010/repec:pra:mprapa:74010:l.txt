2:15:451:26:18:56:555:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This paper examines the effect of monetary policy on the liquidity premium, i.e., the market
2:16:543:18:18:56:555:446:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:value of the liquidity services that financial assets provide. To guide the empirical analysis, I
2:17:640:18:18:56:554:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:set up a monetary search model in which bonds provide liquidity services in addition to money.
2:18:734:18:18:56:555:410:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The theory predicts that money supply and the nominal interest rate are positively correlated
2:19:827:18:18:56:555:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with the liquidity premium, but the latter is negatively correlated with the bond supply. The
2:20:920:18:18:56:555:374:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:empirical analysis over the period from 1946 and 2008 confirms the theoretical findings. This
2:21:1013:18:17:56:555:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indicates that liquid bonds are substantive substitutes for money and the opportunity cost of
2:22:1106:17:18:56:554:339:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:holding money plays a key role in asset price determination.The model can rationalize the
2:23:1195:18:18:56:554:321:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:existence of negative nominal yields, when the nominal interest rate is low and liquid bond
2:24:1286:18:26:56:149:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply decreases.

3:33:1830:0:38:56:182:722:17:g_d0_f6:17:g_d0_f6:C:1  Introduction
3:34:1845:38:18:56:555:684:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Investors value financial assets not only for their intrinsic value, i.e., their expected dividend or
3:35:1946:18:18:56:555:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:payment stream, but also for their liquidity: their abilityto help agents facilitate transactions.
3:36:2044:18:18:56:555:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:For instance, U.S Treasuries are often used as collateral ina secured credit market through
3:37:2135:18:18:56:555:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:repurchase agreements, they are easily sold for cash in secondary asset markets, and, often-
3:38:2227:18:18:56:555:612:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:times, they are used directly as means of payment. Accordingly, many liquid financial assets
3:39:2319:18:18:56:555:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are priced above their respective fundamental value, and their prices are higher than those of
3:40:2413:18:18:56:554:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:illiquid assets with comparable safety and maturity characteristics. Also, the liquidity premia
3:41:2508:18:18:56:555:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:account for a large part of the variation in the liquid asset prices observed in financial markets.
3:42:2607:18:17:74:555:540:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The objective of this paper is to examine the determinants ofsuch liquidity premia. First,
3:43:2697:17:18:56:555:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:I set up a monetary search model and use it as a guide to my empirical exercise. My model
3:44:2786:18:18:56:555:505:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:builds upon Lagos and Wright (2005), but I extend the baseline framework in order to include
3:45:2878:18:18:56:554:487:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a risk-free government bond in addition to fiat money. The government bond is liquid in the
3:46:2969:18:18:56:555:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sense that it is useful in the exchange process, which is explicitly incorporated into the model.
3:47:3066:18:18:56:554:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Due to its liquidity, its equilibrium price exceeds the fundamental value, and its supply affects
3:48:3163:18:18:56:555:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the price (or the yield) through changing the liquidity premium. The ability of the bond to
3:49:3254:18:18:56:554:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:facilitate trade in a goods market characterized by frictions (such as anonymity and limited
3:50:3346:18:18:56:555:397:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commitment) makes it a substitute for money to some degree, so that money supply, and not
3:51:3435:18:18:56:555:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:only bond supply, affects the liquidity premium and, consequently, the bond’s price. The key
3:52:3527:18:18:56:554:361:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mechanism that links money supply and the liquidity premiumis the opportunity cost of hold-
3:53:3618:18:18:56:555:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ing money. An increase in money supply raises the inflation rate and, hence, the cost of holding
3:54:3714:18:18:56:555:325:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money, implying a higher nominal interest rate through the Fisher effect. As a result, agents
3:55:3807:18:17:56:555:307:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:substitute the more costly fiat money with the liquid bond, which, in turn, leads to a higher
3:56:3900:17:18:56:554:290:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:liquidity premium and, ultimately, a higher bond price. In the extreme case in which the nom-
3:57:3993:18:18:56:555:272:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:inal interest rate (on an illiquid bond) is close to zero, andthe supply of liquid assets is scarce,
3:58:4093:18:18:56:555:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the model predicts the existence of a very high liquidity premium, and a potentially negative
3:59:4186:18:18:56:555:236:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nominal yield on the liquid asset. Hence, my model can help usunderstand the emergence of
3:60:4275:18:18:56:555:218:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:negative yields could in several developed countries, suchas Switzerland, the United States,
3:61:4367:18:18:56:190:200:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Germany, since 2008.
3:62:4391:18:18:74:555:182:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, I move on to the empirical exercise that tests the primary results of the theoretical
3:63:4482:18:18:56:555:164:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model. In particular, I test whether money supply is positively correlated with the liquidity
3:64:4575:18:18:56:555:146:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium on liquid bonds, and whether the latter is negatively correlated with bond supply.
3:65:4665:18:18:56:554:128:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In addition, I examine empirically whether the existence ofliquidity premia can be an impor-
3:66:4757:18:18:56:555:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tant factor in explaining the aforementioned negative yields on liquid bonds. In my empirical
3:67:4850:18:18:56:554:92:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exercise, I use US Treasuries to capture the liquid bonds introduced in the model. To guaran-
3:68:4943:18:18:56:555:74:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tee robustness of the empirical analysis, I employ various measures of the liquidity premia for
3:69:5038:18:0:56:555:56:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these bonds: the spread of AAA-rated corporate bonds against the long term Treasury bonds,
4:70:5129:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the TED spread, and the spreads of AA-rated Commercial Papers and Federal Deposit Insur-
4:71:5217:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ance Corporation (FDIC) insured Certificates of deposits against Treasury bills.1The choice of
4:72:5311:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these financial assets is justified by the fact that they are comparably safe but not as liquid as
4:73:5409:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Treasury bonds of similar maturities; therefore one can reasonably argue that any spread be-
4:74:5501:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tween the yield on these assets and Treasury bonds (of similar maturities) reflects differences
4:75:5596:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in liquidity premia. Next, I use a monetary aggregate, Narrow Money, as a proxy of money be-
4:76:5688:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cause it only includes components which can be used as a direct medium of exchange implied
4:77:5778:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by the theory unlike other broader monetary aggregates suchas M1 and M2. Furthermore, its
4:78:5867:18:18:56:555:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand is stable against its holding cost, or nominal interest rates in that it displays a down-
4:79:5963:18:17:56:432:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ward sloping curve over the sample period as the theory presents later.
4:80:6034:17:18:74:555:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The theoretical and empirical analysis can explain the emergence of negative nominal yields.
4:81:6126:18:18:56:555:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:According to the theory, a reduction in bond supply can drivedown its yield into the negative
4:82:6219:18:18:56:555:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:territory, in situations where the monetary authority is setting a low (slightly above or around
4:83:6315:18:18:56:554:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:zero) nominal interest rate, as has been the case recently inSwitzerland and in the United States.
4:84:6413:18:18:56:555:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The empirical exercise confirms that a reduction in the bond supply increases the liquidity pre-
4:85:6509:18:18:56:555:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mium, and decreases the yield. In fact, a big drop in the supply of liquid government bonds
4:86:6600:18:18:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:was markedly observed in Switzerland during the financial crisis, starting in the last quarter of
4:87:6697:18:18:56:555:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2008. It should be pointed out that the existence of negativenominal yields is often considered
4:88:6792:18:18:56:555:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:anomalous, because it is hard to reconcile through the lens of traditional monetary models.
4:89:6883:18:18:56:457:382:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:B:However, my model of asset liquidity can help rationalize this observation.2
4:90:6959:18:18:74:554:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:From the theoretic point of view, a large money search literature presents that the liquidity
4:91:7052:18:18:56:555:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium is a primary factor of variation in the prices of liquid financial assets, and that its sup-
4:92:7152:18:17:56:555:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ply is negatively correlated with the liquidity premium, whereas money supply is positively.
4:93:7244:17:18:56:555:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Similarly, the key mechanism in the literature is the opportunity cost of holding money. As a
4:94:7337:18:18:56:554:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pioneer theoretical paper, Geromichalos, Licari, and Suarez-Lledo (2007) set up a Lagos-Wright
4:95:7431:18:18:56:555:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:type of money search framework with a real asset, and theoretically present that the money
4:96:7521:18:18:56:555:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth rate increases the liquidity premium in the economy where neither money nor assets
4:97:7610:18:18:56:555:239:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are plentiful. They derive this result from the model where assets are a perfect substitute to
4:98:7704:18:18:56:555:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money in transactions in a decentralized market, and money supply leads to an increase in the
4:99:7797:18:18:56:555:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:opportunity cost of holding money. Similarly, several papers with this substitution relationship
4:100:7893:18:18:56:555:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between money and financial assets in the literature deliverthe more or less similar results. Ex-

4:103:8175:17:16:70:554:132:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:1I choose the measures which Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) use in their paper for comparison
4:104:8280:16:12:56:554:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:as well as an additional measure such as the TED spread. Also,the quarterly data are used here, unlike the yearly
4:105:8393:12:8:56:520:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:data are used in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) to increase the sample size of the measures.
4:106:8497:8:16:70:555:96:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:2One of the important lessons we’ve learned from asset liquidity is that it can shed light on existing asset-related
4:107:8613:16:12:56:555:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:puzzles from a new perspective and provide a liquidity-based theory of asset pricing. Examples include Lagos

5:111:8929:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Oikawa (2016). Also, Aruoba, Waller, and Wright (2011) calibrate money search models
5:112:9017:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to examine how money supply affect capital formation. However, the literature has not tested

5:114:9201:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the negative yields on liquid assets, either. Of course, it is worth noticing that this type of
5:115:9296:18:18:56:554:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money search model is well fitted into the study mentioned above because it can delivers sharp
5:116:9390:18:18:56:554:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:predictions for the effects of money and bond supply on the liquidity premium. For example,
5:117:9481:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:one time injection of money does not affect the liquidity premium, but its growth does. Hence,
5:118:9575:18:18:56:555:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money is neutral but not superneutral. Unlike money, one time injection of bonds has a sub-
5:119:9666:18:17:56:555:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stantial impact.3A model without money, or without explicit exchange processes would not
5:120:9754:17:18:56:213:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:deliver these results precisely.
5:121:9786:18:18:74:555:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:To my best knowledge, while the results about the effects of money and bond supply on the
5:122:9875:18:18:56:555:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:liquidity premium has not been tested empirically yet in themoney search literature, there are
5:123:9969:18:18:56:555:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a few papers in the finance literature which study the supply effect on the liquidity premium
5:124:10062:18:18:56:555:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:so as to present that bond supply has a negative impacts on theliquidity premium, or the
5:125:10150:18:18:56:555:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:convenience yield.4For example, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) show a strong
5:126:10238:18:18:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:negative relationship between the U.S. Treasury supply andits convenience yield. Greenwood,
5:127:10329:18:18:56:555:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Hanson, and Stein (2015) show that the T-bill supply has a negative impact on its liquid pre-
5:128:10422:18:18:56:554:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mium. Longstaff (2004), Vayanos (2004), Brunnermeier (2009) and Krishnamurthy (2010) inves-
5:129:10513:18:18:56:554:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tigate liquidity premia, but focus on the short time period such as financial crises. They all set
5:130:10611:18:18:56:554:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:up the models without money; therefore, money supply does not affect liquidity premia at all
5:131:10703:18:18:56:555:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:even if liquid bonds play a role as substitutes with money in reality, and the opportunity cost
5:132:10798:18:17:56:354:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of holding money does not work to account for it, either.
5:133:10855:17:18:74:555:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Nagel (2014) shows how this substitution relationship between money and liquid bonds af-
5:134:10943:18:18:56:555:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fect the liquidity premium through variation in the opportunity cost of holding money, which
5:135:11035:18:18:56:555:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is represented by the federal funds rate. The paper shows that federal funds rate is positively
5:136:11130:18:18:56:555:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:correlated with the liquidity premium. Then, it concludes that bond supply does not have a
5:137:11220:18:18:56:554:239:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:‘persistent’ effect on the liquidity premium unlike Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)
5:138:11314:18:18:56:554:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein (2015). However, this result is derived from the fact that
5:139:11405:18:18:56:555:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:changes in the federal funds rate are involved with changes in supply in the Treasury supply,
5:140:11498:18:18:56:555:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:because the open market operation by the Federal Reserve is associated with the buying of sell-
5:141:11593:18:18:56:555:167:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ing of the Treasuries in the open market, even though it does not account for all the changes in
5:142:11689:18:18:56:554:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the Treasury supply. Also, it does not allow to distinguish the effect of bond supply from that
5:143:11784:18:18:56:554:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of money supply, to the effect of changes in money growth fromchanges in money level, or to
5:144:11875:18:17:56:554:113:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:study specific reasons why the negative yields have been observed in the situation where the
5:145:11967:17:16:70:555:96:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:3Rocheteau, Wright, and Xiao (2016) argue, for the first time in the literature, that this is why the open market
5:146:12080:16:8:56:356:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:operations by the fed have effects on the interest rates in the market.
5:147:12151:8:16:70:554:72:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:4The convenience yield counts for the premia from both safetyand liquidity attributes of a financial assets such
5:148:12263:16:0:56:152:56:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:as the U.S. Treasuries.
6:149:12287:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nominal interest rate is hovering around zero. Importantly, the money search model I set up
6:150:12378:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:allows me to separate these effects theoretically, and to provide a guidance to analyze why the
6:151:12473:18:18:56:458:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:negative yields on liquid bonds can emerge in the aforementioned situation.
6:152:12548:18:18:74:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section2lays out a theoretic model to be tested
6:153:12642:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in Section3. In Section3, I provide a description of the data which are used in the empirical
6:154:12735:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:work and test the results from the theory. In Section4, I discuss negative yields on liquid bonds
6:155:12832:18:54:56:528:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with the theoretical and empirical results from the previous sections. Section5concludes.

6:158:12954:34:18:56:555:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Time is discrete and continues forever. There is a discount factor between periodsβ∈(0,1).
6:159:13044:18:18:56:554:466:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Each period is divided into two sub-periods. A decentralized market (henceforceDM) with
6:160:13131:18:18:56:555:448:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:frictions opens in the second sub-period, and a perfectly competitive or centralized market
6:161:13222:18:18:56:555:430:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(henceforthCM) follows. The frictions are characterized by anonymity among agents and bi-
6:162:13311:18:18:56:555:412:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:lateral bargaining trade. As a result, unsecured credit is not allowed in transactions, and ex-

6:164:13496:18:18:56:555:376:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption goods: goods produced and consumed in the CM (henceforthCM goods) and spe-
6:165:13582:18:18:56:555:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cial goods in the DM (henceforthDM goods). There are two types of agents; buyers and sellers,
6:166:13675:18:18:56:555:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:whose measures are normalized to the unit, respectively. They live forever. Their identities
6:167:13767:18:17:56:555:322:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are determined by the roles which they play in the DM and permanent. While sellers produce,
6:168:13858:17:18:56:555:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sell and do not consume DM goods, buyers consume and do not produce. Their preferences in

6:176:14382:18:18:56:514:128:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the DM. Also, assume that there existsx∗∈(0,∞)such thatU′(x∗) = 1andU(x∗)> x∗.
6:177:14460:18:17:74:555:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:There are two types of assets; fiat money and a 1-period real government bond. They are
6:178:14547:17:18:56:555:93:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:perfectly divisible and storable. Agents can purchase any amount of money and government
6:179:14635:18:18:56:555:75:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bonds at the ongoing priceφtandψtin the CM, respectively. Money grows at the rate ofμ:
6:180:14721:18:0:56:555:57:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:Mt+1= (1+μ)Mt. I assume thatμ > β−1, but also consider the limit case whereμ→β−1, i.e.,
7:181:14809:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the case where the money growth rate approaches closely the Friedman rule. Ifμis positive, it
7:182:14902:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:implies that new money is injected, but ifμnegative, withdrawn through lump-sump transfers
7:183:14992:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to buyers in the CM. A government bond issued in periodtdelivers one unit of CM good in
7:184:15079:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:periodt+1, and its supply in periodtisAt. Since we focus on stationarity equilibria,Atis fixed
7:185:15173:18:33:56:413:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:atA. The government (a consolidate authority) budget constraint is

7:189:15408:18:18:74:555:550:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Now, I describe more details about activities which occur ineach sub-period. First, I start
7:190:15499:18:18:56:554:532:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with the description of the second sub-period, where a CM opens. Both buyers and sellers
7:191:15587:18:18:56:555:514:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consume and produce a CM good. They work or use their assets, money (m) and government
7:192:15673:18:18:56:555:496:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bonds (a), which they are holding from the previous period in order toconsume, so as to pay
7:193:15764:18:18:56:555:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:back the credit made in the previous period and to adjust their portfolios which they will bring
7:194:15860:18:18:56:554:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to the next DM. They have access to technology that turns one unit of labor into one unit of
7:195:15952:18:18:56:555:442:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:general goods. Also, they trade money, and bonds among all agents to re-balance their portfolio
7:196:16047:18:18:56:234:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:they will bring to the next period.
7:197:16082:18:18:74:555:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, a DM opens in the first sub-period. All of the buyers are matched with a seller in
7:198:16170:18:17:56:555:388:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a bilateral fashion and vice versa. Buyers make a take-it–or-leave-it (henceforthTIOLI) offer
7:199:16263:17:18:56:555:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to a seller to determine the terms of trade.5Since buyers are anonymous and have limited
7:200:16351:18:18:56:554:353:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commitment, a medium of exchange (henceforthMOE) is required in their transactions. Both
7:201:16439:18:18:56:554:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money and government bonds can serve as media of exchange. Specifically, the DM is divided
7:202:16529:18:18:56:555:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:into two sub-markets, DM1 and DM2, depending on what type of medium of exchange can be
7:203:16615:18:18:56:555:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:used. In the DM1, sellers accept only a direct medium of exchange. Both assets are used as a
7:204:16707:18:18:56:555:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:direct medium of exchange, but, unlike money, only a fractiong∈(0,1)of bonds can serve as
7:205:16796:18:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a direct medium of exchange.gis an illiquidity parameter of government bonds, and reflects
7:206:16886:18:18:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the fact that the government bonds are not as liquid as money as a direct medium of exchange.
7:207:16979:18:18:56:555:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Intuitively speaking, it can take time and cost in playing a role as money do in exchange in the
7:208:17075:18:18:56:555:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:DM1. On the other hand, in the DM2, sellers accpet only collateralized credit (or loans), i.e.,
7:209:17170:18:18:56:555:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:secured credit as a MOE, and bonds are used as collateral for credit. The credit is repaid back
7:210:17265:18:18:56:555:173:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in CM goods in the forthcoming CM. Also, a portionh∈(0,1)of bonds can only be used as
7:211:17350:18:18:56:555:155:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:collateral; therefore, buyers always have incentives to pay back their credits. This is so-called
7:212:17447:18:17:56:555:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the Loan to Value (henceforth LTV) ratio, and also is relatedto the haircut since it is defined by
7:213:17545:17:19:56:554:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1 minus the LTV, following the standard approach in finance. The model will focus on cases of
7:214:17638:19:16:70:555:101:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:5I could assume that they negotiate the terms of trade througha Kalai bargaining protocol, where the buyers’
7:215:17746:16:12:56:555:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:bargaining power is less than one. However, since the bargaining protocol is not critical to derive most of interest-
7:216:17863:12:12:56:555:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ing results of the paper, I use the simplest setup here by assuming that buyers make a TIOLI offer to their trading

9:259:19614:17:18:56:555:601:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Since the seller does not consume any good in the DM, there is no incentive to bring money

9:292:20782:34:18:56:555:157:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:There are two sub-markets in the DM: DM1 and DM2, depending onwhat type of means of
9:293:20865:18:18:56:555:139:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:payment can be used in transactions. First, consider a meeting in the DM1 where a buyer with
9:294:20957:18:17:56:555:121:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:portfoliowtmeets with a seller. Sellers accept both money and bonds as a medium of exchange.
9:295:21049:17:18:56:555:104:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:However, a fractiongof bonds can only be accepted. The terms of trade is determined by
9:296:21135:18:19:56:555:86:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the proportional bargaining over the quantity of DM goods, and a total payment of money
9:297:21222:19:0:70:371:67:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:6See Rocheteau and Wright (2005b) for the precise and carefulproof.
10:298:21290:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and bonds exchanged between them. A buyer makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to a seller to
10:299:21380:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:maximize her surplus under the seller’s participation constraint and her budget constraint.
10:300:21471:18:33:56:297:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Then, the bargaining problem is expressed by

11:375:23356:45:34:56:181:494:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f7:B:Proof.See the appendix
11:376:23378:34:18:74:554:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Since buyers make a TIOLI offer, i.e., they take all the bargaining power, the solution is
11:377:23468:18:18:56:555:442:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:straightforward. The main variables to determine the levelof DM goods produced are the real
11:378:23559:18:18:56:555:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:balances, or the bond holdings of buyers in each transaction. For example, if the real balances
11:379:23654:18:18:56:555:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are enough to get the optimal consumption levelq∗, i.e., ifz(wt)≥z∗, then the optimalq∗level
11:380:23746:18:18:56:555:388:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:will be exchanged with the corresponding payment,z∗, which can be less thanz(wt). On the
11:381:23834:18:18:56:555:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:other hand, if the real balances are not enough in the same sense, then the buyers will hand
11:382:23926:18:18:56:555:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:over all of their real balances to sellers to purchase as manyDM goods as possible. The sellers
11:383:24021:18:18:56:554:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:will produce the quantity that her participation constraint implies. The similar interpretation
11:384:24116:18:48:56:198:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can be applied to the DM2.

11:386:24170:34:18:56:555:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Now, I describe the objective function which a buyer maximizes by choosing money and bonds

11:388:24355:18:37:56:464:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:using linearity of the value functions yield the following objective functionJ.

12:425:24915:35:18:74:555:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The left-hand side on each Euler equation presents the marginal cost of buying a unit of
12:426:25003:18:18:56:555:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money or government bond. It is equal to its price to be paid when a buyer purchase it in the
12:427:25096:18:18:56:554:571:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:CM. On the other hand, the right-hand side is the marginal benefit from holding it in the DM.
12:428:25189:18:18:56:555:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Buyers can use them as a medium of exchange to purchase DM goods produced by sellers. If
12:429:25277:18:18:56:555:535:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:they are used in the DM, i.e., ifu′is zero on the right-hand side, its price should be equal to its
12:430:25376:18:18:56:287:517:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fundamental value,βφt+1orβ, respectively.
12:431:25417:18:18:74:555:499:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Figure2presents the continuous and decreasing money demand against the cost of holding
12:432:25503:18:18:56:555:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money captured byφt/(φt+1β), which comes from equation (13). Similarly, inserting equation
12:433:25593:18:18:56:555:463:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(13) into (14) shows the inverse bond demand curve against its price. Their inverse relationship
12:434:25689:18:18:56:554:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:makes sense because the bond price implies the cost of holding the bonds, given the fixed
12:435:25778:18:18:56:555:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dividend in the forthcoming CM. Also, the bond demand curve depends on the cost of holding
12:436:25868:18:18:56:555:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money. It is easily found that the curve shifts out (in) as themoney holding cost increases
12:437:25959:18:17:56:555:391:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(decreases) as in Figure3. This relationship is intuitively straightforward to understand. If
12:438:26052:17:18:56:555:374:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the money holding cost increases, agents become less willing to hold money, i.e., the money
12:439:26143:18:18:56:554:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand will decrease. However, since the government bonds can also play a role in relaxing
12:440:26233:18:18:56:555:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the liquidity constraint in the DM to some extent as money does, even if not perfectly, the
12:441:26324:18:18:56:555:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand on the government bonds will increase. Notice that both demand curves are flat in the
12:442:26416:18:18:56:554:302:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regions wherem > m∗andhat> q∗, respectively. This is because one extra unit of money or
12:443:26503:18:18:56:555:284:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government bond is not useful in the DM transactions any more. In these territories, buyers
12:444:26594:18:48:56:336:266:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:already hold money or bonds enough to purchaseq∗.

12:446:26680:34:18:56:555:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:I focus on stationarity equilibria, in which both real moneyand bond balances are constant over
12:447:26775:18:18:56:554:166:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:time. It implies thatφtMt=φt+1Mt+1andAt=A. Then, the money growth rate is equal to the
12:448:26861:18:28:56:334:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:inflation rate in the CM, i.e.,1 +μ=φt/φt+1= 1 +π.

13:504:28108:34:18:74:555:126:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:It is straightforward to understand the definition of equilibrium.  The fact that the real

14:536:29034:17:18:56:555:459:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:equation is obtained by the Fisher equation, becauseμ=πin the stationary equilibrium and
14:537:29122:18:18:56:555:441:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:B:1/β= 1+rwhenrstands for the yield on a real bond which is not useful in the DMexchange in
14:538:29211:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the sense that it is not accepted by sellers. Hence,irepresents a nominal interest rate of a totally
14:539:29311:18:18:56:554:405:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:illiquid real bond. Its real price (β), which is the inverse of the real interest rate1/β, is exactly
14:540:29412:18:18:56:555:387:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:equal to asset prices which are derived in the traditional asset pricing models where assets are
14:541:29508:18:18:56:555:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:only used as a store of value: the asset prices equal the present discount value of their future
14:542:29604:18:18:56:555:351:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stream of consumption dividends. Second, the price of a liquid bond (ψ) is always higher than
14:543:29697:18:18:56:555:333:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that of a illiquid bond (β) when the asset supply is not high enough in the sense thathA < q∗,
14:544:29791:18:18:56:555:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:i.e.,u′( ̃za)>1. In other words, the rate of return on a liquid bond (ρ) is lower than that on an
14:545:29888:18:18:56:555:297:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:illiquid (i).7Hence, the difference between them can be used to measure themarket price of
14:546:29978:18:18:56:555:279:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the liquidity service that the liquid bond provides, i.e., the liquidity premium. Lastly, the zero
14:547:30076:18:18:56:555:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:net nominal interest rate (i= 0) implies that the money growth equals the Friedman rule, i.e.,
14:548:30170:18:17:56:110:243:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:μ=β−1.
14:549:30176:17:18:74:555:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:More importantly, the equations, (17) and (18), present that not only bond supply but also
14:550:30266:18:18:56:555:208:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money supply determine the equilibrium bond price togetherwith the bond demand when
14:551:30349:18:18:56:554:190:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:B:0< g <1, i.e., when they are substitutes to some extent in the sense that bonds help to relax
14:552:30442:18:18:56:555:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the liquidity constraint in the DM1. This implies that the demands on money and bonds are
14:553:30531:18:18:56:555:154:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interconnected because both of them are useful in exchange process, to a greater and lesser ex-
14:554:30626:18:18:56:554:136:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tent, as in the papers in the money search literature such as Geromichalos, Licari, and Suarez-
14:555:30721:18:18:56:555:118:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Lledo (2007) in which money and real assets are perfect substitutes, and Lester, Postlewaite,
14:556:30814:18:18:56:554:100:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Wright (2012) in which the illiquid parametergis endogenized. In this case, the price of
14:557:30906:18:19:56:555:82:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the illiquid bond is fixed atβover time, whereas the price of the liquid bond is affected byboth
14:558:31002:19:0:70:505:63:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:7To distinguish nominal yields between an illiquid bond and an liquid bond, letρdenote the latter.
15:559:31102:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money and bond supply. Hence, the price variation of the liquid bond is equal to the variation
15:560:31196:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of the liquidity premium, and the two words can be used interchangeably here when the bond
15:561:31286:18:18:56:247:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:price exceed the fundamental value.
15:562:31321:18:18:74:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, consider that not allμ∈(β−1,∞)are consistent with a monetary equilibrium. In fact,
15:563:31409:18:18:56:594:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a monetary equilibrium is supported for the range of(β−1, ̄μ), where ̄μ≡{μ:μ=β[1 +θ[u′( ̃za)−1]]}.
15:564:31507:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:If we allow for the case whereμ=β−1, it implies ̃z≥q∗, and so will be the lower bound for
15:565:31596:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a monetary equilibrium. In this case, the marginal change inmoney supply never affect the
15:566:31685:18:18:56:555:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:liquidity premium of a liquid bond. On the other hand, the upper bound ̄μdecreases in bond
15:567:31775:18:18:56:555:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supplyA. It implies that agents are less patient with high inflation,so that less willing to hold
15:568:31872:18:17:56:410:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money given the supply of money, as the supply of bond increases.
15:569:31937:17:18:74:555:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The following proposition describes how the real equilibrium bond price, or the liquidity
15:570:32026:18:18:56:555:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium, is associated with money and bond supply. As mentioned in the introduction, we
15:571:32113:18:28:56:344:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:focus on the monetary equilibria, whereμ∈(β−1, ̄μ).
15:572:32164:28:18:56:555:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f23:C:Proposition 1.The real bond price exceeds the fundamental value, i.e,ψ > β, and is increasing inμ.
15:573:32262:18:18:56:81:462:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:C:Also,
15:574:32267:18:20:68:459:444:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:C:(i) if ̃za≥q∗,ψ=ψ(μ), i.e., the bond price is only affected by the money supply.
15:575:32347:20:18:65:555:424:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:C:(ii) if ̃za< q∗,ψ=ψ(μ,A), i.e., the bond price is affected by both money and bond supply. In addition,
15:576:32449:18:35:85:261:406:12:g_d0_f23:12:g_d0_f23:C:it is decreasing inA, i.e.,ψ′(A)<0.
15:577:32484:35:18:74:555:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The proof is straightforward. Notice in Proposition1thatμis also replaced withibecause
15:578:32570:18:18:56:555:353:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:they are linear by the definition as in equation (18). The real bond price exceeds its fundamen-
15:579:32666:18:18:56:555:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tal value because a liquid bond plays a role in facilitating transactions in the DM; otherwise
15:580:32760:18:18:56:555:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:would not occur. Hence, the liquid bond bears a liquidity premium. If ̃za> q∗, i.e., the bond
15:581:32853:18:18:56:555:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply is plentiful in that it allows agents to purchase the optimal quantity,q∗, in the DM2. The
15:582:32950:18:18:56:555:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:marginal increase in the bond supply does not allow buyers topurchase additional goods in
15:583:33039:18:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the DM anymore. In other words, changing the bond supply doesnot affect transactions in the
15:584:33130:18:18:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:DM2; therefore it does not affect the liquidity premium. However, money supply changes the
15:585:33220:18:18:56:555:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:liquidity premium. For example, increasingμraises up the opportunity cost of holding money,
15:586:33311:18:18:56:555:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:so that it increases the demand on bonds and lowers the rate ofreturn on bonds. On the other
15:587:33403:18:17:56:555:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hand, if ̃za< q∗, i.e., the bond supply is scarce, not only money supply but also bond supply
15:588:33496:17:18:56:555:174:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:affect the liquidity premium. This is because the marginal change in the bond supply has an
15:589:33587:18:18:56:391:156:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:impact on relaxing the liquidity constraint in the DM exchange.
15:590:33650:18:18:74:555:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, consider now some extreme cases where money and bonds are perfect substitutes or
15:591:33736:18:18:56:555:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not substitutes at all so as to understand intuitively how the parameters,gand1−θ, can affect
15:592:33829:18:18:56:555:102:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bond prices, or the liquidity premium. Moreover, I will empirically test which case is well sup-
15:593:33925:18:18:56:555:84:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ported by the U.S. data in Section3. As mentioned in subsection2.1,gis an illiquid parameter,
15:594:34018:18:0:56:555:66:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:implying how liquid bonds are, comparing with money in DM transactions. This parameter
16:595:34106:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can be interpreted as a parameter of how well developed or howliquid a secondary asset mar-
16:596:34197:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ket is, where bonds are exchanged for money. Less friction inthe secondary market implies
16:597:34286:18:18:56:554:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:highergbecause less friction means that bonds are more easily converted to money, vice versa.
16:598:34379:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:For example, if there are more investors or buyers for bonds due to the developed institution,
16:599:34473:18:18:56:554:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:including high-quality trading platform technology, in the secondary market, assets are more
16:600:34565:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:likely to be liquidated easily, and so to provide liquidity services easily. On the other hand, the
16:601:34664:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:parameter1−θcan be interpreted as how well the collateralized credit market functions when
16:602:34754:18:18:56:548:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money is scarce. More collateralized transactions in the financial market implies higher1−θ.
16:603:34846:18:18:74:555:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Now, consider the four cases as follows, depending on the different combinations ofgand
16:604:34933:18:17:56:398:561:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:θ(or 1-θ). All the results are delivered by equations (17) and (18).
16:605:35001:17:18:74:555:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:(Case 1: Perfectly illiquid bonds) Bonds are totally illiquid in the sense that they are useless
16:606:35097:18:18:56:554:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the DM exchange, i.e.,g→0andθ→1. This is the case where the bonds only function
16:607:35179:18:18:56:555:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:as a store of value. Hence, the real bond priceψis equal to the fundamental value,β, i.e., the
16:608:35273:18:18:56:555:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:present value of the dividend that the bonds deliver next period, and so they do not carry the
16:609:35367:18:18:56:517:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:liquidity premium at all. As a result, it is not affected by money and bond supply at all.
16:610:35457:18:18:74:555:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:(Case 2: Perfect substitutes to money) Bonds are perfect substitutes to money, i.e.,g→1and
16:611:35547:18:35:56:461:436:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:θ→1. The bond prices are equal to1 +μ. Then its nominal yieldρis give by
16:612:35619:35:0:196:275:401:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:1 +ρ= (1 +π)
16:613:35631:0:16:277:283:409:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:1
16:614:35632:16:0:276:284:393:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:ψ
16:615:35633:0:35:288:555:401:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:A:=φt/φt+1×φt+1/φt= 1.(19)
16:616:35657:35:18:56:555:366:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f23:B:The gross nominal interest rate(1 +ρ)equals 1 and the net nominal interest rate equalszero
16:617:35747:18:18:56:554:348:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:all the times. In this case, since the bonds are identical with money in terms of ability of facil-
16:618:35846:18:18:56:554:330:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:itating transactions in the DM and also deliver dividends, their real prices are higher than the
16:619:35942:18:18:56:555:312:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fundamental valueβ. Moreover, an increase (a decrease) in money supply raises (lowers) the
16:620:36032:18:18:56:239:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:real prices, or the liquidity premia.
16:621:36069:18:18:74:555:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:(Case 3: Liquid bonds but not substitutes to money) Bonds are liquid in the DM, but not substi-
16:622:36164:18:18:56:555:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tutes to money at all, i.e.,g→0and0< θ <1. This is the case where the bonds are perfectly
16:623:36253:18:18:56:555:240:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:illiquid in the DM1, and so the two decentralized markets aretotally separated. Hence, the
16:624:36343:18:18:56:554:222:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply of each does not affect each other, so that the liquidity premia which the bonds carry is
16:625:36439:18:18:56:327:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:only affected by their supply, not by money supply.
16:626:36490:18:18:74:555:186:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:(Case 4: Liquid bonds and perfect substitutes) Bonds are liquid in the DM2 and also perfect
16:627:36581:18:17:56:555:168:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:substitutes to money in the DM1, i.e.,g→1and0< θ <1. They hold extra values in exchange
16:628:36668:17:37:56:445:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:process. Then, equation (17) yield the net nominal interest rate as follows.
16:629:36744:37:0:207:226:114:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f10:C:ρ=

16:631:36766:16:0:230:403:106:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:(1 +μ) +β(1−θ)h[u′(hA))−1)]

16:635:36816:16:0:230:363:74:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f10:C:i+ (1−θ)h[u′(hA))−1)]
16:636:36837:0:0:367:555:82:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:A:<0(21)
17:637:36845:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In this case, the numerator is always negative only ifu′(hA)>1, i.e., only if bond supply is
17:638:36937:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:scarce. Also, the liquidity premium is affected by both money and asset supply. The nomi-
17:639:37026:18:18:56:554:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nal rate of return on a liquid bond is negative, irrespectiveof money and bond supply, or the
17:640:37119:18:18:56:554:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nominal rate of return on a illiquid bondi. It implies that lenders are willing to pay interests
17:641:37215:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:even though they lend money, because the bonds provide extraliquidity services in transac-
17:642:37305:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tions. I will discuss more details about under what conditions negative interest rates emerge in
17:643:37401:18:54:56:331:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a generic case, unlike this extreme case, in Section4.
17:644:37455:54:39:56:297:561:17:g_d0_f6:17:g_d0_f6:C:3  Data and Empirical Results
17:645:37484:39:18:56:555:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The theory in the previous section predicts that the real price of a liquid bond, or the liquidity
17:646:37582:18:18:56:555:504:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium is affected by both money and bond supply in a generalcase where0< g,θ <1,
17:647:37664:18:18:56:555:486:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:whereas that of an illiquid bond is unaffected, as summarized in Proposition1. In this section,
17:648:37759:18:18:56:554:468:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:I test the predictions of the theory here with the U.S. data: whether the liquidity premium is
17:649:37853:18:17:56:555:450:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:positively associated with the rate of money supply, but negatively with bond supply in reality.
17:650:37949:17:49:56:471:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Basically, equations (22) and (23) are used as a guide for the empirical analysis.
17:651:38031:49:34:56:119:384:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:3.1  Data
17:652:38040:34:18:56:555:350:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:First of all, it is important to discuss how to measure all of the variables mentioned in the theory
17:653:38140:18:18:56:555:332:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:such as the liquidity premium, money supply (or, the nominalinterest rate of an illiquid bond),
17:654:38235:18:18:56:555:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and bond supply from the data before we move on to the empirical results. As well known,
17:655:38323:18:17:56:554:296:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the real rates of return are not observed in reality. Also, there exist various types of monetary
17:656:38420:17:18:56:555:279:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:aggregates, such as Monetary Base, Narrow Money, M1, and M2,which we can use to measure
17:657:38507:18:18:56:528:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money supply, and several types of government bonds are traded in the financial market.
17:658:38594:18:18:74:554:243:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:First, I describe how to measure the liquidity premium. As the theory presents in the pre-
17:659:38684:18:18:56:555:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:vious section, a change in the real yield on a liquid bond is equal to a change in the liquidity
17:660:38780:18:18:56:555:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium which the bond carries, only if the bond is default-free, except for some extreme cases.
17:661:38876:18:18:56:555:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The problem is that neither the real yield nor the liquidity premium is observable as an index.
17:662:38971:18:18:56:555:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Only the nominal yield is observable. For this reason, I use the yield spread between a liquid
17:663:39065:18:18:56:555:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bond and an illiquid bond as a proxy of the liquidity premium as in the relevant literature.
17:664:39157:18:18:56:555:135:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This measure is not only measurable, but also consistent with the theory. The theory presents
17:665:39250:18:0:56:555:117:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the nominal yield of an illiquid real bond, a liquid real bond, and the spread between them as
18:666:39346:0:33:56:98:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:follows.

18:682:39478:33:18:56:554:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:whererstands for the real yield on an illiquid bond, andρon a liquid bond. As we used in
18:683:39566:18:18:56:554:549:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:deriving equation (17), the first two equations present the nominal yields of an illiquid bond
18:684:39660:18:18:56:554:531:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and a liquid bond by the Fisher equation. Then, subtracting the latter from the former delivers
18:685:39755:18:17:56:555:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the approximate yield spread between them, which is given byequations (22) and (23). This
18:686:39844:17:18:56:555:496:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:subtraction eliminates the effect of the inflation on the nominal yields of both bonds at the
18:687:39937:18:18:56:555:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:same time and, therefore, isolates the liquidity premium alone from other components such as
18:688:40029:18:18:56:554:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the risk premium and the term premium in bond prices in the case where both bonds have the
18:689:40119:18:18:56:555:442:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:same maturity and default risk. As a result, this spread can be used as a measure of the liquid-
18:690:40215:18:18:56:555:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ity premium meant in the theory. Also, it is important that itcan be easily computable as the
18:691:40308:18:18:56:555:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:yield spread of two different bonds in terms of liquidity. Ofcourse, it should be emphasized
18:692:40400:18:18:56:452:388:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that they should have same or, at least, similar maturities and default risks.
18:693:40478:18:18:74:555:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Then, what should liquid and illiquid bonds be in reality? First, when it comes to a liquid
18:694:40569:18:18:56:555:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bond, we define a liquid bond in the model as a bond which is useful in exchange process.
18:695:40658:18:18:56:555:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In reality, it implies that the liquid bond should be easy to be sold for cash in the secondary
18:696:40753:18:18:56:555:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market, to be accepted directly as a medium of exchange, or tobe used for credit (or loans) in
18:697:40847:18:18:56:555:298:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the credit market such as the Repurchase Agreement market (or REPO in short) and the federal
18:698:40939:18:17:56:555:280:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:funds market. Moreover, it should be safe in the sense that itis sure to deliver its dividend at
18:699:41035:17:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:maturity, i.e., there is no probability to default until maturity. For this reason, here, I use the
18:700:41134:18:18:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:yields of all types of Treasuries such as Treasury bonds, notes and bills, as the nominal yields
18:701:41230:18:18:56:263:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of the liquid bond meant by the model.
18:702:41268:18:18:74:554:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:On the other hand, an illiquid bond in the model implies a bondwhich can not be used in
18:703:41355:18:18:56:555:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exchange, and its holder should keep it in his hand until maturity for cash unless he accepts a
18:704:41450:18:18:56:554:173:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:huge discount for the secondary trade. Hence, it is inferiorto the liquid bond only in terms of
18:705:41545:18:18:56:555:155:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:being liquidating. Of course, they should be exactly or, at least, similarly as safe as the liquid
18:706:41643:18:18:56:555:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bond to avoid the case where their yield difference includesthe risk premium. In the case where
18:707:41738:18:18:56:555:119:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:there is only a small difference in terms of the default risk,it can be controlled in regressions
18:708:41835:18:0:56:555:101:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by adding variables to explain it. Similarly, the maturities should be the same for both bonds.
19:709:41932:0:22:56:555:727:8:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:8Taking all of these into account, I use the yields of Aaa-rated corporate bonds, 3-month Com-
19:710:42026:22:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mercial Papers, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured Certificates of deposits
19:711:42119:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(henceforth FDIC CDs) as measures of the yields of illiquid bonds. All of these are available in
19:712:42215:18:18:56:554:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)9. I will match each of those yields with Treasuries
19:713:42309:18:18:56:546:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with consideration for maturity in order to compute the liquidity premium on each maturity.
19:714:42400:18:18:74:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Lastly, I also use the TED spread as a measure of the liquiditypremium on three-month
19:715:42485:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Treasury bills, which is the difference between three-month LIBOR based on US dollars and
19:716:42574:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:three-month Treasury bill. It is true that 3-month LIBOR based on US dollars bears the risk
19:717:42665:18:18:56:554:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium, because the contracts between banks are not default free. However, it is also true
19:718:42756:18:17:56:555:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that it is small, and so it can be controlled and absorbed by a variable to represent default risk
19:719:42854:17:18:56:146:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the regression.
19:720:42872:18:18:74:555:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, consider which of monetary aggregates should be used to measure money supply
19:721:42954:18:18:56:555:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the data. As mentioned above, there are several monetary aggregates which are complied
19:722:43043:18:18:56:555:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by the Fed: Monetary Base, Narrow Money, M1, M2, and M3. Thereare two criteria to think
19:723:43130:18:18:56:555:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:about which one among them is appropriate. First, what the theory regards as money is per-
19:724:43220:18:18:56:554:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fectly liquid in exchange process, or it is a perfect medium of exchange, comparing to bonds.
19:725:43313:18:18:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Hence, the monetary aggregate meant by the theory should notinclude any type of illiquid
19:726:43401:18:18:56:554:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:financial assets such as savings deposits including money market deposit accounts and small-
19:727:43493:18:18:56:555:400:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:B:denomination time deposits, which is precisely time deposits in amounts of less than$100,000.10
19:728:43588:18:18:56:555:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Then, this criterion excludes M2, and also broader monetaryaggregates such as M3. Secondly,
19:729:43679:18:18:56:555:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:its demand against the opportunity cost of holding it, represented by the nominal interest rate
19:730:43774:18:18:56:555:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(or the inflation rate), should be stable. If it is not, the mechanism through which the theory
19:731:43869:18:17:56:554:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:works can not be applied to explain the relationship betweenmoney supply and the liquidity
19:732:43959:17:18:56:555:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium. Specifically, it should be true that, when the opportunity cost of holding money rises
19:733:44054:18:18:56:555:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:up, the demand declines. Otherwise, it will never lead to an increase in the demand on liquid
19:734:44147:18:18:56:555:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bonds as a substitute to money, and neither does the liquidity premium the bonds bear in the
19:735:44239:18:18:56:555:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:end. However, the demand on M1 against the nominal interest rate has not been stable, so that
19:736:44332:18:18:56:307:239:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:B:M1 is excluded in the regressions shown later.11
19:737:44380:18:18:74:555:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Based on the aforementioned criteria, I use Narrow Money as ameasure of money. Narrow
19:738:44465:18:19:56:554:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Money is well suited to the theory in the sense that it is absolutely used as a medium of ex-
19:739:44558:19:16:70:555:184:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:8In reality, since there exist secondary trade markets for almost all of bonds only if sellers of bonds accept more
19:740:44673:16:11:56:554:168:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:or less, or even considerable losses, there would not exist aperfectly illiquid bond. In other words, it is hard to
19:741:44788:11:12:56:554:157:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:find totally illiquid bonds, even if they are almost as safe asTreasuries and have the same or similar maturities.
19:742:44902:12:9:56:516:145:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:However, it can not be denied that the yield spread reflects the liquidity premium, even if we consider it.
19:743:45009:9:15:70:555:136:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:9I updated the yields of Aaa-rated corporate bonds and 3-month Commercial Papers in their dataset by using
19:744:45115:15:9:56:511:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the data FRED Economic Data (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) provides because some values are revised.

20:750:45622:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to 2008. In addition, notice that I use the Federal Funds rateas a proxy of the nominal interest
20:751:45718:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rate on illiquid financial bonds. I could use other interest rates such as 3 month commercial
20:752:45811:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:paper rate, but they deliver the same relationship because they show the strong co-movement
20:753:45902:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:historically. Figure4displays the ratio of Narrow Money to nominal GDP against itshold-

20:756:46166:18:27:56:441:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:plentiful, it can be re-expressed to present the money demand as follows.

20:834:47144:32:18:74:555:216:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Also, notice that money growth rate has a one to one relationship with the nominal yield
20:835:47232:18:18:56:555:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of an illiquid bond in the stationary equilibrium, which is implied by the Fisher equation, i.e.,
20:836:47329:18:18:56:554:180:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:B:1+i= (1+π)(1+r) = (1+μ)/β, as seen in Equations (22) and (23). They theoretically stand for
20:837:47420:18:18:56:555:162:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the same economic notion: the opportunity cost of holding money. The theory does not distin-
20:838:47512:18:18:56:555:144:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:guish between them. The empirical result can show which variable is more suitable to explain
20:839:47604:18:18:56:555:126:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:changes in the liquidity premium. The nominal interest rateas an index of the opportunity cost

20:841:47804:16:12:56:555:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:serves Banks, and reserve adjustment magnitude, which is“adjustments made to the monetary base due to changes
20:842:47913:12:12:56:555:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in the statutory reserve requirements”. See http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/03/09/0309ra.xls

20:844:48041:8:0:67:375:60:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:13Since ̃zt=  ̃zt+1in stationary equilibria, the time subscript is omitted.
21:845:48118:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of money holding has a positive impact on the liquidity premium through the same mechanism
21:846:48208:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in which money growth works. In reality, there are a variety of interest rates in the financial
21:847:48303:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market, and it is also difficult to find the yields of totally illiquid bonds. However, as well
21:848:48398:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:known, they have the strong co-movement relationship amongthem. Here, I use the Federal
21:849:48485:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Funds rate as a proxy of the nominal interest rate which the model presents. The Federal Funds
21:850:48579:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rate can reflect the money holding cost better than any other,because it is highly correlated
21:851:48672:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with other short term interest rates which agents in an economy can consider as substitutes for
21:852:48767:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cash, even if it is not perfectly substitutes. Moreover, since it is the policy interest rate which
21:853:48866:18:18:56:467:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the Fed has been using, it is comparable to money supply as a policy variable.
21:854:48944:18:17:74:555:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:When it comes to bond supply, I use the ratio of the outstanding stock of the public debt
21:855:49033:17:18:56:555:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to the nominal GDP for the liquid bond supply meant by the theory, as in Krishnamurthy and
21:856:49123:18:18:56:555:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Vissing-Jorgensen (2012). The ratio of debt to GDP is measured as the market value of the pub-
21:857:49217:18:18:56:555:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:lic debt at the end of a fiscal year divided by the GDP of the sameyear.14Using the same data
21:858:49310:18:18:56:554:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:as in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and Nagel(2014) allows for comparison of
21:859:49399:18:18:56:336:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:my empirical results with the results in the literature.
21:860:49455:18:18:74:554:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Last but not least, Figure5looks at the bond demand against the yield spread between the
21:861:49543:18:18:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Aaa-rated corporate bond and the long term Treasury bond. Notice that, as Krishnamurthy and
21:862:49634:18:18:56:555:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) points out, it is the bond demand for not only liquidity but also safety,
21:863:49732:18:18:56:555:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:but it is mainly driven by the demand for the liquidity services Treasuries provide. It had been
21:864:49828:18:18:56:555:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stable up until 2008 in the sense that it is an unambiguous downward sloping curve. However,
21:865:49920:18:18:56:554:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:after 2009, the demand seems to shift out after the recent financial crisis. This is similar to the
21:866:50019:18:48:56:528:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money demand. For this reason, I only use the data over the period from 1945 up to 2008.
21:867:50107:48:34:56:204:298:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:3.2  Empirical Results
21:868:50129:34:18:56:555:264:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Now, I describe the details about the empirical test for the theoretical predictions. As men-
21:869:50222:18:18:56:555:246:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tioned in the previous section, I first compute several different yield spreads between them and
21:870:50318:18:18:56:555:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Treasuries, depending on maturities: the yield spreads between Aaa-rated corporate bonds and
21:871:50410:18:18:56:554:210:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the long term Treasuries, between Aa-rated commercial papers and 3-month Treasury bills, and
21:872:50502:18:18:56:555:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between 6-month FDIC insured Certificates of Deposit (henceforth CD) and 6-month Treasury
21:873:50591:18:17:56:554:174:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bills, which are short-term bonds because their maturitiesare shorter than one year.15Each of
21:874:50684:17:18:56:555:157:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the spreads stands for the liquidity premium which each of different maturities of Treasuries
21:875:50777:18:18:56:555:139:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bears. In other words, all of those spreads reflect the marketvalues for the liquidity services
21:876:50872:18:19:56:555:121:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the Treasuries provide, but different in the sense that the former is the liquidity premium on
21:877:50966:19:12:67:451:102:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:14See Henning Bohn’s website for more details: http://econ.ucsb.edu/ bohn/data.html
21:878:51049:12:16:67:555:90:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:15I use the spreads which are used in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) but slightly different because
21:879:51160:16:0:56:242:74:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:they are updated from the original source.
22:880:51204:0:18:56:419:723:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:B:the long term Treasuries and the latter on the short term Treasuries.16
22:881:51275:18:18:74:555:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, it is important that I use the growth rate of Narrow Money for money supply in the
22:882:51363:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regressions. As seen in Equation (15), what affects liquidity premia is the growth rate of money
22:883:51459:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply, not the absolute level of money supply. The theory predicts that one-time change in
22:884:51550:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money supply does not affect the liquidity premia and other real variables such as real bal-
22:885:51642:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ances, quantities traded in the DM, but its growth rate does.The theory delivers that money
22:886:51733:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply is not super-neutral but neutral. A one-time injection or withdraw of money to an econ-
22:887:51827:18:18:56:554:597:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:omy is ineffective because its relative price is adjusted tokeep the real variables unchanged.
22:888:51921:18:18:56:554:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:On the other hand, I use the level of the debt to the nominal GDPratio for bond supply in the
22:889:52014:18:17:56:555:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regressions, because it is not neutral unlike money. Even one-time change in the case of bond
22:890:52107:17:18:56:226:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply affects the real variables.
22:891:52141:18:18:74:554:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Also, in order to control the risk premium, associated with default risks, which can be in-
22:892:52232:18:18:56:554:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cluded in the yield spreads, a stock market volatility indexis used as a default control variable
22:893:52329:18:18:56:555:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which is used in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012).17Including this measure in
22:894:52416:18:18:56:555:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the regressions makes sure that changes in the yield spreadsare driven mainly by changes in
22:895:52507:18:18:56:554:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the liquidity premia, given the low default rate on Aaa-rated corporate bonds and Aa-rated
22:896:52597:18:18:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Commercial Papers.18However, unlike these two securities, FDIC insured CDs are as safe as
22:897:52686:18:18:56:555:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Treasuries, given FDIC insurance, so that its spread against the same maturities of Treasuries
22:898:52780:18:18:56:342:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can be used as a good proxy of the liquidity premium.
22:899:52833:18:18:74:555:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Before the regressions, I graphically look at how money growth rate had evolved with the
22:900:52921:18:18:56:555:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:different measures of the liquidity premium over the sampleperiod from Figures6and7, and
22:901:53009:18:18:56:554:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:it is consistent with the predictions from the theory. The figures show that the movement of
22:902:53101:18:17:56:555:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:money growth is almost positively related to the liquidity premium, and their variations are
22:903:53193:17:18:56:293:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also similar in terms of frequency and width.
22:904:53238:18:18:74:555:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Now, let’s move onto the empirical results from the regressions. Table1presents the impacts
22:905:53329:18:18:56:555:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of money growth, bond supply, and the Federal Funds rate on the liquidity premium, which is
22:906:53420:18:18:56:555:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:measured by the yield spread between Aaa-rated corporate bond and the long term Treasury
22:907:53508:18:18:56:554:239:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bond. Specifically, Regressions (1) to (3) look at the impactof money growth with bond sup-
22:908:53599:18:17:56:554:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ply on the liquidity premium which the long-term Treasuriescarry. In particular, Regression (2)
22:909:53694:17:16:67:555:204:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:16Notice that there are two indexes which represents the opportunity cost of holding money meant by the the-
22:910:53802:16:12:56:555:188:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ory: money growth rate and nominal interest rates. Even though they are theoretically equivalent by the Fisher

22:912:54023:12:12:56:555:164:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:them significantly affect long or short term liquidity premia in the data. In fact, Nagel (2014) only presents the
22:913:54137:12:12:56:555:152:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:cases where the Federal Funds rate has a positive effect on the liquidity premia, which are measured monthly only
22:914:54250:12:12:56:555:140:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:by some short term bonds. However, here I show the liquidity premia are also affected by money growth. and
22:915:54356:12:8:56:501:128:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:also how it is robust to the liquidity premium of the long termbond such as the long term Treasuries.
22:916:54457:8:16:67:555:120:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:17See Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) for the details about why this measure can be a proxy for
22:917:54563:16:12:56:554:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:default risk. In short, they argues that this measure have a high correlation with another default risk measure such
22:918:54679:12:8:56:419:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:as the median expected default frequency credit measure from Moody’s Analytics.

22:920:54863:16:12:56:555:68:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:default on high-grade CP.” Also, they use the spread of Aaa-rated bonds against Treasuries to estimate the market
22:921:54976:12:0:56:476:56:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:value of the liquidity convenience, assuming that the default risk of the Aaa-rated bonds is low.

23:931:55462:18:18:56:554:479:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:if they are not substitutes, money growth does not affect theliquidity premium of Treasuries
23:932:55554:18:18:56:555:461:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:at all, because the money-traded market are totally separate from the bond-collaterlized mar-
23:933:55647:18:18:56:555:443:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ket. However, the regression results deliver that money growth has a significant and positive
23:934:55740:18:17:56:555:425:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:impact on the liquidity premium. Also, bond supply is negatively correlated with the liquidity
23:935:55834:17:18:56:555:408:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium. An increase in bond supply reduces its market pricefor the liquidity services which
23:936:55926:18:18:56:555:390:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the bonds provide. All of these results imply that Treasury bonds are substantive substitutes
23:937:56019:18:18:56:555:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with money to some degree in that they provide liquidity services like money does. The nega-
23:938:56111:18:18:56:555:354:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tive effect of bond supply is consistent with Krishnamurthyand Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) even
23:939:56203:18:18:56:555:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:without the log specification19, and also is robust to default risk. A control variable for de-
23:940:56298:18:18:56:555:318:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fault risk is included as an explanatory variable in Regression (3), and the coefficients of money
23:941:56396:18:18:56:555:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth and bond supply are still significant. This implies that changes in the spread, or the
23:942:56489:18:18:56:555:282:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:liquidity premium, are significantly affected by both of them even if money and bonds are not
23:943:56582:18:18:56:555:264:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:perfectly substitutes. The coefficient of the risk premium control variable is also significant. On
23:944:56681:18:18:56:555:246:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the other hand, Regression (4) to (6) show the impact of the Federal Funds rate on the liquidity
23:945:56777:18:18:56:555:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premium. Unlike money supply, its impact on the liquidity premium is not significant in the
23:946:56868:18:18:56:214:210:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regressions with bond supply.
23:947:56897:18:18:74:555:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, Table2uses different measures of the liquidity premia: the yield spread of AA-rated
23:948:56986:18:17:56:555:174:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Commercial Papers, and FDIC CDs against Treasury Bills, andthe TED spread. All the regres-
23:949:57076:17:18:56:554:157:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sions present that the impact of money growth is significantly positive and is robust with bond
23:950:57171:18:18:56:555:139:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply and default risk controls. Also, these results strongly support the theoretical predic-
23:951:57265:18:19:56:555:121:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tion that Treasury Bills are substitutes with money like Treasury bonds, again.20Notice that
23:952:57357:19:16:67:555:102:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:19They use the log specification in their regressions because it provides a good fit and there is only one parameter
23:953:57473:16:8:56:151:86:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:they are interested in.
23:954:57496:8:16:67:555:78:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:20The regressions with the quarterly data over the same periodpresent the similar result. See AppendixBfor

24:989:59798:18:18:74:555:183:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:To summarize, money growth has a significant and positive impact on the liquidity premia,

24:994:60282:15:12:56:555:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of the bond supply on the liquidity premium. However, it doesnot look at the measures of the liquidity premium
24:995:60392:12:12:56:555:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:which are used here: the AAA cor. - Treasury bond spread, and the 6-month FDIC CDs - Treasury Bill spread.
24:996:60498:12:0:56:276:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:even though they also reflect the liquidity premia.
25:997:60551:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:data. For example, this difference may come from the fact that short and long term bonds are
25:998:60643:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:traded in different institutions, by different agents, or different regulations, even though they
25:999:60740:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are similar in terms of liquidity. However, notice that thisdoes not change the economic mech-
25:1000:60834:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:anism of how money or nominal interest rates affect the liquidity premia which liquid bonds
25:1001:60925:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:carry in the financial market. All the results provide strongsupport the theoretical predictions:
25:1002:61022:18:18:56:554:633:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bond prices bear the liquidity premium, bonds are substantive substitutes with money even if
25:1003:61114:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not perfect, and the money holding cost is a primary factor inthe mechanism which deliver the

27:1005:62775:0:39:56:380:723:17:g_d0_f6:17:g_d0_f6:C:4  Discussion on Negative Interest Rates
27:1006:62815:39:18:56:555:684:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Negative interest rates have been observed in some countries such as the United States, Switzer-
27:1007:62911:18:18:56:555:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:land, Japan and Germany, in particular, for the recent yearsafter 2008. For example, in Switzer-
27:1008:63007:18:18:56:555:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:land, the yields of almost all the government bonds have beennegative after 2008. In addition,
27:1009:63101:18:18:56:554:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the yield of 3 month Treasury Bills in the United States had been negative during several days
27:1010:63195:18:17:56:432:612:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in September, 2015, even if the federal fund rates were slightly positive.
27:1011:63269:17:18:74:555:595:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The negative yields, or interest rates imply that lenders pay borrowers interests on their bor-
27:1012:63364:18:18:56:555:577:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rowings. It wouldn’t make sense if interest rates were considered as the risk premium which
27:1013:63455:18:18:56:555:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is compensated for borrowers’ default risk, because it is the lenders that take the default risk
27:1014:63551:18:18:56:555:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of the loans. Since cash is unambiguously as safe as any othergovernment bonds, the lenders
27:1015:63642:18:18:56:555:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:could hoard physical cash in their safes, whose interest rate is0%, i.e., can never be negative.
27:1016:63738:18:18:56:555:505:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Then, why have we observed the negative interest rates in reality? Or, why do not investors in

27:1018:63906:18:18:74:554:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:First, consider a financial market where investors are always willing to pay for the liquidity
27:1019:64000:18:18:56:555:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:service the governments bonds provide. For example, in somefinancial markets such as Re-
27:1020:64088:18:18:56:555:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:purchase Agreement markets and the collateralized federalfunds market, liquid bonds such
27:1021:64176:18:18:56:555:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:as the government bonds are necessary as collateral in transactions. Theoretically, this can be

27:1023:64360:18:45:56:315:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:yield of a liquid bond from the model is given by

27:1037:64527:35:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The theory predicts that there is a high chance that the negative yield would emerge, in partic-
27:1038:64623:18:18:56:555:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ular, when bond supply decreases, and the nominal interest rate is low: money is not in short.
27:1039:64717:18:18:56:555:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This is because the liquidity services which liquid bonds provide are valued high relatively
27:1040:64809:18:18:56:555:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:when the money holding cost is low. It implies that the bond buyers would be willing to accept
27:1041:64903:18:18:56:554:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the negative yields of the bonds to hold them in their portfolios for transactions. In fact, it is
27:1042:65001:18:18:56:555:173:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supported by the comments from the market participants during the periods of the low nomi-
27:1043:65091:18:18:56:555:155:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nal interest rate. For example, according toBloomberg(September 25, 2015), Kenneth Silliman,

28:1051:65751:24:18:74:554:681:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:To summarize in brief, this article says that the main factors which drove down the negative
28:1052:65843:18:17:56:555:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interest rate below zero were ‘an influx of cash and a cut in bill supply.’ Also, remember that
28:1053:65938:17:18:56:555:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the policy rate of the Fed, has been hovering around zero for more than 7 years since 2008. In
28:1054:66032:18:18:56:555:628:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:other words, when the negative interest rate occurred, the money holding cost was low, and
28:1055:66122:18:18:56:555:610:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also the bill supply was expected to decrease. However, there have existed strong demand on
28:1056:66213:18:18:56:554:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the government bonds. Both factors were at work together in the direction to raise up the liq-
28:1057:66307:18:18:56:555:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:uidity premium of liquid bonds such as Treasury bills, so that the interest rate seemed to fall
28:1058:66402:18:18:56:217:556:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:down to the negative territory.
28:1059:66433:18:18:74:555:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Interestingly, this negative yield can also be explained by‘an influx of cash’ in addition to
28:1060:66526:18:18:56:555:520:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:‘a cut in bill supply’. As shown theoretically and empirically in the previous sections, money
28:1061:66620:18:18:56:555:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supply (or growth) increases the liquidity premium, whereas bond supply decreases it. Hence,
28:1062:66712:18:18:56:555:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with a slight abuse of the theory, this fall of the yield to thenegative territory can be interpreted
28:1063:66813:18:18:56:449:466:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:as an increase in the liquidity premium which the governmentbonds bear.
28:1064:66884:18:18:74:555:448:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Moreover, we can find another example which the theory can be applied to in Switzerland.
28:1065:66972:18:17:56:555:430:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:As shown in Figure8, the negative yields on government bonds have been observedfor a sub-
28:1066:67061:17:18:56:555:413:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stantial period of time since 2008. Also, it looks at how money and the government bond sup-
28:1067:67153:18:18:56:555:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ply have been evolving. The ratio of the government bond supply relative to GDP shrank from
28:1068:67244:18:18:56:555:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:around 50%to around 30%, whereas the money supply, measured by M124, relatively increased
28:1069:67333:18:18:56:554:359:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:more than twice during the same period. If we apply the empirical result to this example, it
28:1070:67425:18:18:56:555:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is highly likely that the relative scarcity of the liquid government bonds against money in the
28:1071:67520:18:18:56:554:323:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market have led to an increase in the high liquidity premia onthe government bonds. More-
28:1072:67609:18:18:56:555:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:over, the interest target range of the Swiss National Bank was 0-1.00%at then end of 200825,
28:1073:67701:18:18:56:555:287:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and, after then, continued to decrease, and fell into the negative target. Accordingly, it can be
28:1074:67798:18:18:56:555:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:inferred that the main factor for the negative interest rates is the high liquidity premia on the
28:1075:67895:18:19:56:335:251:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:B:liquid government bonds due to their short supply.26

28:1089:69129:12:0:56:514:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:there are higher possibility that their yields would be negative in the case where liquid bonds are scarce.

29:1092:69319:38:18:56:555:378:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This paper explores the effects of money and bond supply on the liquidity premia in the prices
29:1093:69413:18:18:56:554:360:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of liquid financial assets such as government bonds. The theory delivers elaborate predictions
29:1094:69507:18:18:56:555:342:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:about under which conditions money supply can affect the liquidity premia. For example,
29:1095:69594:18:18:56:555:324:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:it has a positive impact on them by changing the opportunity cost of holding money and so
29:1096:69683:18:18:56:554:306:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:affecting the demand on liquid bonds only when liquid bonds are substitutes with money, even
29:1097:69775:18:18:56:555:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:if partial. Moreover, if they are perfectly substitutes, the negative yields on liquid bonds can
29:1098:69871:18:18:56:555:270:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:appear in the equilibrium. On the other hand, the bond supplyalso directly affects the liquidity
29:1099:69967:18:18:56:555:252:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:premia by changing relative scarcity of the bonds. Lastly, the empirical analysis presents a
29:1100:70059:18:18:56:554:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:strong support for the theoretical findings. The US data display that money supply as a proxy
29:1101:70152:18:18:56:555:216:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of the money holding cost has a positive impact on the liquidity premium, whereas bond supply
29:1102:70245:18:17:56:554:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:has a negative impact. Also, it describes how the liquidity premia are associated with negative
29:1103:70340:17:0:56:477:181:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:nominal yield on liquid bonds which were observed in the US and Switzerland.

32:1162:74207:18:18:74:555:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:First, consider Lemma1. Substitutingφtptinto the objective function in Equation6re-

32:1169:74510:18:18:56:555:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:budget constraint is binding. Accordingly, the buyer will give up all her real balances in order
32:1170:74606:18:18:56:554:527:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to purchase as many as possible. Then, the optimal choice ofqwill be the same as her real

32:1172:74782:18:35:56:318:491:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for proof. Since it is straightforward, it is omitted.

32:1174:74857:17:18:74:555:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:First, consider whether the real balances are as a direct medium of exchange or as collateral

32:1177:75103:18:18:56:554:385:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Then, plugging these result into the first order conditions (??) and (??) for the maximum of
