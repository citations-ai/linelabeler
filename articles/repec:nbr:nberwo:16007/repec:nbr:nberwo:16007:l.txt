2:26:1067:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Mortgage loans are leading examples of transactions where experts on one side of the market take
2:27:1163:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:advantage of consumers' lack of knowledge and experience. We study the compensation that borrowers
2:28:1261:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:pay to mortgage brokers for assistance from application to closing. Two findings support the conclusion
2:29:1364:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:that confused borrowers overpay for brokers' services: (1) A model of effective shopping shows that
2:30:1463:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:borrowers sacrifice at least $1,000 by shopping from too few brokers. (2) Borrowers who compensate
2:31:1561:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:their brokers with both cash and a commission from the lender pay twice as much as similar borrowers
2:32:1661:14:42:72:155:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:who pay no cash.

3:46:1956:0:30:72:208:725:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:47:1971:30:18:72:540:695:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Consumers often transact with imperfect information about the best price available for a
3:48:2059:18:18:72:540:677:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:product.  Some examples are mundane—a shopper does not know the price of kleenex at
3:49:2142:18:18:72:540:659:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:every nearby store.  Others are more substantial, such as the best available price for a new
3:50:2234:18:18:72:540:641:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Ford Focus or the best expense ratio for an S&P 500-indexed mutual fund.  We study a
3:51:2318:18:18:72:540:623:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:large expenditure that the majority of consumers make only a few times in their lives, the
3:52:2408:18:18:72:540:605:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:payment for mortgage origination services.  These payments range from zero to $30,000 for
3:53:2497:18:18:72:540:587:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages of normal size. The payments are described as “origination fees,” “points,” and a
3:54:2588:18:18:72:540:569:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:myriad of other terms; frequently the borrower pays for a dozen or more different categories
3:55:2680:18:17:72:540:551:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of origination services.  On average among the loans we study, about half of the value that
3:56:2771:17:18:72:540:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the borrower transfers to the broker takes the form of a payment by the wholesale lender
3:57:2859:18:18:72:540:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the mortgage broker.  The borrower bears the burden of this part of the payment in the
3:58:2948:18:18:72:286:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:form of a higher interest rate on the loan.
3:59:2991:18:18:89:540:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:These payments are compensation to mortgage brokers for their services in arranging
3:60:3074:18:18:72:540:462:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the origination of a mortgage.  Because consumers enter the mortgage market infrequently
3:61:3162:18:18:72:540:444:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and because of features of the market that make it difficult to learn the best price, mortgage
3:62:3256:18:18:72:540:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:origination pricing is a leading example of a market where one suspects that many consumers
3:63:3347:18:18:72:450:408:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:pay well above the best price. Our results confirm this suspicion strongly.
3:64:3422:18:18:89:540:390:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We stress that this paper is about how much borrowers pay their brokers for origination
3:65:3509:18:18:72:540:372:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:services. The broker is an administrator of the process of loan origination. The broker bears
3:66:3602:18:18:72:540:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:none of the risk of default on the mortgage, so that risk is not a determinant of the broker’s
3:67:3696:18:18:72:145:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:compensation.
3:68:3709:18:18:89:540:318:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We reach our conclusion by studying the distribution of origination charges for a large
3:69:3796:18:18:72:540:300:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:sample of mortgages involving brokers, where federally mandated disclosure documents re-
3:70:3884:18:17:72:540:282:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:port the entire amount of the broker’s revenue, including both the total charges imposed on
3:71:3975:17:18:72:540:265:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the borrower and the additional amount the lender pays the broker.  We consider a mini-
3:72:4062:18:18:72:540:247:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mal shopping strategy that borrowers might pursue in trying to find the best price—getting
3:73:4152:18:18:72:540:229:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:quotes from two brokers, asking the one with the higher proposed price to beat the lower
3:74:4240:18:18:72:540:211:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:price of the opponent, and continuing this process until one broker is unwilling to improve
3:75:4331:18:18:72:540:193:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:on the other’s best proposal.  This process is an English auction, in which the lower-cost
3:76:4421:18:18:72:540:175:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker gets the business and the charge equals the cost of the losing broker, according to
3:77:4511:18:18:72:215:157:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:standard auction principles.
3:78:4539:18:18:89:539:139:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:It’s a standard statistical exercise to find the distribution of a variable from the distribu-
3:79:4633:18:18:72:540:121:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tion of the larger of a pair of draws from the variable. We perform that exercise to calculate
3:80:4727:18:18:72:540:103:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the distribution of broker cost.  We find that the implied cost is generally quite high, but
3:81:4819:18:18:72:540:85:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:more important, the upper tail of the cost distribution is thick—a significant fraction of
3:82:4909:18:0:72:540:67:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages appear to cost the broker more than $5,000 to originate.  When we repeat the
4:83:4996:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:exercise for shopping among three and four brokers, we find that the implied distribution of
4:84:5088:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cost is completely implausible, with an even larger fraction implied to cost more than $5,000.
4:85:5182:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The distribution has an implausible shape as well.  We conclude that among our shopping
4:86:5269:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:models, only the one where borrowers shop from just a pair of brokers is close to reasonable.
4:87:5362:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Our conclusion that borrowers consider no more than two mortgages draws support from
4:88:5446:18:18:72:261:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:surveys of borrower behavior as well.
4:89:5483:18:18:89:539:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Given this conclusion, we ask what benefit a borrower who shopped from only two brokers
4:90:5570:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:passed up by not shopping from three or four. The answers are so large that we believe that
4:91:5661:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:many of the borrowers must have been unaware of the likely benefits of more shopping.
4:92:5746:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:For example, for a mortgage with $100,000 principal, a borrower would save a median of
4:93:5832:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:$981 by adding one more broker to the mix and $1,393 by adding two.  And with $200,000
4:94:5918:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:principal, the savings are $1,866 and $2,664 .  Because we do not believe that borrowers
4:95:6006:18:17:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:would intentionally pass up such large benefits just to avoid talking to another broker, we
4:96:6097:17:18:72:532:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:conclude that confusion about how this market works caused borrowers to shop too little.
4:97:6185:18:18:89:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Our second approach to studying confusion among mortgage borrowers is to compare (1)
4:98:6269:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the total closing charges for loans where the borrower pays a higher interest rate to fund
4:99:6359:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the closing charge to (2) the total charges for loans where the borrower pays all of those
4:100:6449:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charges in cash. The first group pays somewhat lower total charges than the second, but the
4:101:6540:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:important finding is that both those groups pay far less than borrowers who use both types
4:102:6630:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of funding in roughly equal proportion. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that
4:103:6722:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers treat the two charges independently, failing to recognize that a borrower who pays
4:104:6814:18:18:72:377:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:more cash is entitled to a lower interest rate andvice versa.
4:105:6875:18:18:89:540:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Earlier research has shown that mortgage charges are higher for less-educated borrowers,
4:106:6963:18:18:72:540:312:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:members of minorities, borrowers who pay high interest rates, and those who borrow larger
4:107:7052:18:18:72:540:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:principal amounts—we review that research in the Appendix. We confirm these findings. The
4:108:7141:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:research has not shown whether the borrowers paying higher charges did so because arranging
4:109:7232:18:17:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage broker’s cost was higher or because those borrowers suffered exploitation due
4:110:7322:17:18:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to their lack of knowledge of the best available charge, which should be little higher than
4:111:7413:18:18:72:540:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cost.  Our results show that large fractions of the higher charges are the result of limited
4:112:7505:18:18:72:243:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:shopping rather than higher cost.
4:113:7538:18:18:89:539:187:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Our data come from a sample of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Admin-
4:114:7616:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:istration (FHA) during a six-week period in 2001.  The FHA insures mortgages of fairly
4:115:7702:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:creditworthy borrowers for modestly priced houses, up to loan limits that vary by geogra-
4:116:7791:18:18:72:540:133:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:phy. The data report the amount that the borrower paid for mortgage-related charges at the
4:117:7881:18:18:72:540:115:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:closing, the principal amount that the lender paid into the closing, the yield-spread premium,
4:118:7975:18:18:72:540:97:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and the interest rate for the mortgage.  All of these loans are 30-year fixed-rate mortgages
4:119:8067:18:18:72:214:79:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for the purchase of a house.
4:120:8095:18:0:89:539:61:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Our econometric approach is mainly non-parametric.  We represent the full distribution
5:121:8182:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of closing charges in terms of 299 quantiles,  conditional on observed borrower and loan
5:122:8270:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics.  From the quantiles, we make calculations of the distribution of broker cost

5:125:8519:40:30:72:411:631:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:2  Economics of Mortgage Originations
5:126:8556:30:18:72:540:601:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:A mortgage is a loan secured by a house.  The typical mortgage provides for monthly pay-
5:127:8644:18:18:72:539:583:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ments over a term of 30 years.  The amount of the loan, called the loanprincipal, transfers
5:128:8735:18:18:72:540:565:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the seller of the house at the moment when the borrower takes ownership of the house,
5:129:8823:18:18:72:540:547:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:called the loan closing. Our FHA sample contains only 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for the
5:130:8913:18:17:72:540:529:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:purchase of a home; there are no investor loans and no refinancings among them. The bor-
5:131:9001:17:18:72:540:512:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rower’scoupon rateis applied to the principal amount of the loan to calculate the borrower’s
5:132:9093:18:18:72:540:494:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:monthly payment. The loans are fully amortizing, so there is no final repayment of principal,
5:133:9186:18:18:72:540:476:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in contrast to the typical bond.  The borrower has the option to pay off a mortgage before
5:134:9276:18:18:72:540:458:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:30 years, subject to a pre-payment penalty, which is limited by law in all states.  Because
5:135:9367:18:18:72:540:440:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers sometimes move, change houses, extract appreciated equity, and take advantage
5:136:9454:18:18:72:540:422:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of lower interest rates to refinance, most mortgages pre-pay prior to their 30-year maturity.
5:137:9547:18:18:72:540:404:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Nonetheless, roughly 30 percent of owner-occupied homes have no mortgage, and nearly all
5:138:9635:18:35:72:498:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:got to this state by paying off a 30-year loan—see U.S. Census Department (2001).

5:140:9757:25:18:72:540:326:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Mortgage brokers perform the service oforiginatinga mortgage.  A broker matches a bor-
5:141:9843:18:18:72:540:308:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rower with a wholesale lender. The broker is not a party to the resulting financial contract
5:142:9935:18:18:72:540:290:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:between borrower and lender and thus bears none of the default risk of the mortgage. The
5:143:10023:18:18:72:540:272:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker helps the borrower prepare an application and arranges for the services of one or more
5:144:10116:18:18:72:540:254:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:appraisers and of an agent to close the transaction.  The broker serves lenders by finding
5:145:10206:18:18:72:540:236:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:potential borrowers and helping them complete the necessary paperwork. Most large lenders
5:146:10295:18:18:72:540:218:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:have retail origination operations and also use brokers as originating agents. A broker usually
5:147:10390:18:18:72:285:200:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:deals with a number of wholesale lenders.
5:148:10431:18:18:89:540:182:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The borrower deals with a broker under conditions comparable to a purchaser dealing
5:149:10514:18:18:72:540:164:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with a retailer of an expensive item. Like the retailer and purchaser, the broker and borrower
5:150:10608:18:18:72:540:146:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:negotiate the terms of the transaction without participation from the upstream wholesaler.
5:151:10698:18:18:72:540:128:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The wholesaler provides funds for the loan under quoted terms.  The borrower receives a
5:152:10785:18:17:72:540:110:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:specified amount of cash, the principal amount of the mortgage, delivered by the lender at
5:153:10875:17:18:72:540:93:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the time of the closing, in exchange for a mortgage at an interest rate resulting from the
5:154:10965:18:0:72:540:75:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:negotiation. The borrower may also pay the broker a negotiated amount at the closing; we
6:155:11054:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:call this thecash closing charge. Berndt, Hollifield and Sand ̊as (2009) discuss the bargaining
6:156:11149:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:problem between borrower and broker in the framework of the Nash bargain in its alternating
6:157:11240:18:18:72:125:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:offer form.
6:158:11251:18:18:89:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f3:A:The broker may also receive a payment from the lender called theyield-spread premium
6:159:11335:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:or YSP, which is often about half of the broker’s compensation.  The terms offered by the
6:160:11424:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:wholesale lender appear in arate sheet, a document the broker receives from the lender at
6:161:11513:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:least daily. The rate sheet shows the YSP the lender offers to pay the broker for originating
6:162:11606:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a mortgage. The YSP is an increasing function of the coupon rate and principal amount of
6:163:11694:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the loan, and decreasing in the term (15, 30, 45 or 60 days) for which the loan is locked (the
6:164:11788:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:length of time the broker and borrower have the option to complete the loan). The YSP rises
6:165:11879:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:as interest rates rise, but at a decreasing rate because higher rate loans are more likely to
6:166:11972:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:prepay than lower rate loans, so higher rates are generally earned for shorter periods. This
6:167:12064:18:17:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:function is determined by expectations about movements in interest rates in the competitive
6:168:12155:17:18:72:530:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:wholesale mortgage market and the refinancing choices of borrowers. We take it as given.
6:169:12243:18:18:89:539:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The following example,  representative of the transactions in our data,  illustrates the
6:170:12331:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:operation of the YSP: A borrower pays her broker $1,500 as a cash closing payment.  In
6:171:12417:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:addition, the lender pays the broker a YSP of $2,300.  The broker’s all-in cost, mainly the
6:172:12508:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:value of his time, is $2,400.  The borrower has paid $1,500 + $2,300 = $3,800 in closing
6:173:12596:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charges for a loan when she could have pressed the broker to do the loan for close to $2,400.
6:174:12689:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:A savvy borrower could have insisted that the broker charge her only $100 in cash, which,
6:175:12778:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:together with the yield-spread premium of $2,300, would have just covered his cost of $2,400.
6:176:12871:18:18:89:539:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 1 shows an example of an actual rate sheet.  The figures show the amount that
6:177:12955:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the lender will deliver at closing on behalf of the borrower (always taken to be 100) plus
6:178:13045:18:18:72:540:312:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the premium to be paid to the broker, such as 2.25 percent of the principal for a loan at
6:179:13134:18:18:72:540:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a coupon rate of 8 7/8 percent with a lock period of 30 days.  Notice that below the solid
6:180:13224:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:line, the YSP becomes negative. For loans at these low interest rates, the borrower (not the
6:181:13316:18:17:72:505:258:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker) pays the specified amount of cash into the closing to make up the difference.
6:182:13401:17:18:89:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The coupon rate that corresponds to a zero YSP is called theparrate and is a useful
6:183:13484:18:18:72:540:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:benchmark of mortgage interest rates. It corresponds to the row in the figure just below the

8:227:15896:18:18:72:355:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:coupon rateror, equivalently, choosing the YSP,Y(r).
8:228:15948:18:18:89:539:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Lenders solve a complicated problem in setting the rate sheets that determine the YSP
8:229:16033:18:18:72:539:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:as a function of the coupon rate,Y(r).  The central factor is that a higher coupon rate
8:230:16120:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:implies a higher present value of the payments, a benefit that the broker shares through the
8:231:16212:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:YSP. One important subsidiary factor is the likelihood of early payoff of the mortgage from
8:232:16303:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the sale of the house or refinancing.Payoffs tend to occur earlier for high-rate mortgages,
8:233:16394:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a factor the lender builds into the curvature of the YSP as a function of the coupon rate.
8:234:16484:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Because the present value of the payments on lower-coupon loans falls short of the amount
8:235:16573:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the principal, the YSP will be negative below some coupon rate.  Lenders also consider
8:236:16662:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:any market power they may have in the wholesale market, though we believe this factor
8:237:16747:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is not very important—brokers know the quoted terms of numerous lenders every day for
8:238:16832:18:17:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:identical mortgages,  so the wholesale market has close to perfect Bertrand competition.
8:239:16920:17:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Lenders adjust their YSPs daily or even more often to modulate their lending flows and
8:240:17006:18:18:72:232:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:reflect changes in market rates.
8:241:17038:18:18:89:540:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Our best source of information about the YSP is a group of rate sheets from a dozen
8:242:17121:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:large lenders for May 31, 2000. Figure 2 gives averages for May 31, 2000, for a 30-day lock
8:243:17212:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:period, with a cost to the broker,k= $2500, which we believe is reasonable. The error bars
8:244:17302:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:are one standard error—they become larger at both ends of the line because fewer lenders
8:245:17390:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:quoted premiums so far from the popular interest rates. The figure shows the benefit of the
8:246:17481:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:loan to a hypothetical borrower with a discount rate of 9 percent per year, from equation
8:247:17570:18:18:72:539:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:(1). The benefits are based on a time to payoff ofT∗= 7 years, which we believe is typical.
8:248:17661:18:18:89:539:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 2 shows how the joint surplus varies with the coupon interest rate.   For the
8:249:17745:18:18:72:540:312:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:case shown, it is clear that the efficient loan would have the lowest interest rate the lender
8:250:17839:18:18:72:540:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:offers and thus the most negative YSP. The YSPs lenders offer plainly undercompensates a
8:251:17927:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrower for the higher payment of a loan with a positive YSP, if the borrower’s discount
8:252:18016:18:18:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate is not too much higher than the coupon rate.  A borrower who had enough cash in an
8:253:18103:18:17:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:investment of equal risk to a mortgage, paying less than 10 percent per year, could use cash
8:254:18195:17:18:72:540:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:withdrawn from that account to induce a broker to originate a loan with a large negative
8:255:18283:18:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:YSP and come out ahead—the interest rate implicit in the YSP, under the assumptions of
8:256:18369:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:these calculations, is higher than 10 percent.  If the borrower expects to repay the loan in
8:257:18461:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:much less than seven years, the opposite conclusion follows; the maximum surplus occurs
8:258:18548:18:18:72:304:151:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with a large YSP and no cash closing charge.
8:259:18592:18:18:89:539:133:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 3 considers the relation between the coupon rate and the joint surplus for borrowers
8:260:18683:18:18:72:540:115:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:at three coupon rates, with expected time to payoff of 7 years.  At the bottom is the same
8:261:18773:18:18:72:540:97:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:surplus as in Figure 2. This borrower gains relatively little from the loan transaction, given
8:262:18867:18:18:72:540:79:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that the borrower’s discount rate is close to the rate of a mortgage that has zero YSP. This
8:263:18959:18:0:72:540:61:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrower-broker pair is best off by choosing the lowest available coupon interest rate offered

9:284:19472:34:18:72:540:404:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:by the lender and using some of the resulting benefit to the borrower to pay the lender the
9:285:19563:18:18:72:219:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding negative YSP.
9:286:19590:18:18:89:540:368:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The middle line in Figure 3 shows the surplus to the pairing of a broker with a borrower
9:287:19678:18:18:72:540:350:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:whose discount rate is 15 percent.  The surplus is substantial—because the discounted cost
9:288:19768:18:18:72:540:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the borrower of repaying the loan is less than the principal—but is essentially flat across
9:289:19862:18:17:72:540:314:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the interest rates. Thus the provisions of the rate sheet achieve close to indifference in this
9:290:19957:17:18:72:540:297:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:case, with the loan expected to last for 7 years and the borrower’s discount rate somewhat
9:291:20047:18:18:72:540:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:above the par rate. The top line in the figure shows that, when the borrower has a discount
9:292:20138:18:18:72:540:261:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate of 20 percent, the surplus is even higher and reaches a vaguely defined maximum at 8
9:293:20227:18:18:72:134:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:5/8 percent.
9:294:20239:18:18:89:539:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 4 shows the same three lines for borrowers who plan to pay the loan off in 4 years.
9:295:20329:18:18:72:540:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:In these cases, the surplus rises with the interest rates to maximums at 9 1/4 percent for the
9:296:20423:18:18:72:540:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:low-discount borrower and 9 1/2 percent for the two higher-discount borrowers. It pays the
9:297:20513:18:18:72:540:171:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker-borrower pair to take advantage of the higher YSP that goes with the higher coupon
9:298:20602:18:18:72:401:153:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate, because the borrower only pays the higher rate for 4 years.
9:299:20667:18:18:89:539:135:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The basic message of the investigation of the joint surplus as a function of the interest
9:300:20756:18:18:72:540:117:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate and resulting YSP is that lenders offer YSP schedules in their rate sheets that make the
9:301:20849:18:18:72:540:99:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker-borrower pair close to indifferent to the interest rate if they plan to pay the loan off
9:302:20944:18:18:72:540:81:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in seven years.  No compelling economic force tells the pair what rate to pick in that case.
9:303:21036:18:0:72:540:63:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Our data show fairly wide dispersion across rate categories, consistent with the lack of such

11:342:21774:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a compelling force.  Maximization of the joint surplus would push the terms toward higher
11:343:21863:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:YSPs and lower cash closing charges if the borrower expects to repay in less than seven years
11:344:21956:18:18:72:272:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:or has an unusually high discount rate.
11:345:21995:18:18:89:539:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The YSP lets the home-buyer borrow the funds to compensate the broker, provided the
11:346:22078:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrower can qualify for a higher interest rate.  The value flowing from the borrower to
11:347:22166:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the broker is the cash closing charges plus the YSP. For the broker, the mix of the two
11:348:22253:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:components is immaterial, as the broker receives both the cash closing charge and the YSP
11:349:22342:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:as cash at the same time.  A borrower who is cash-constrained and knows she is likely to
11:350:22430:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:pay off the mortgage fairly soon will see the cost of the borrowed component resulting from
11:351:22521:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a higher interest as less than what the broker receives as YSP, so their efficient bargain
11:352:22611:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:should pay the broker entirely with the YSP and the closing charge should be zero (or even
11:353:22701:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:negative, which occurs in a small fraction of our sample).  Similarly, a borrower with a low
11:354:22793:18:17:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:discount rate (and or expecting to be in the house for a long time) may see the cost of the
11:355:22884:17:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowed component as greater than the YSP and then the efficient deal with the broker
11:356:22970:18:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:will not involve borrowing any of the broker’s compensation; rather, the borrower will pay
11:357:23060:18:35:72:451:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:it in cash, and even pay a negative YSP to lower the interest rate further.
11:358:23135:35:26:72:316:421:206:g_d0_f1:206:g_d0_f1:C:2.3  Potential consumer confusion
11:359:23168:26:18:72:540:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Our predictions about the efficient deal between borrower and broker rest on the assumption
11:360:23259:18:17:72:540:377:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that the borrower is able to recognize that she is paying a higher interest rate and thus
11:361:23348:17:18:72:540:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:creating value that could be used to pay the broker in place of a cash closing charge.  An
11:362:23438:18:18:72:540:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:alternative model holds that some borrowers are unable to spot when an interest rate is high
11:363:23530:18:18:72:540:324:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enough to deserve a reduction in the closing charge and thus wind up paying both normal
11:364:23617:18:18:72:540:306:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:closing charges and giving the brokers handsome YSPs as well. The value-maximizing broker
11:365:23706:18:18:72:540:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:will try to keep borrowers uninformed about the availability of mortgages at lower interest
11:366:23797:18:18:72:440:270:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rates, in the hope of earning high compensation from both components.
11:367:23866:18:18:89:540:252:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The borrower’s information about the mortgage market is often incomplete.  For mort-
11:368:23950:18:18:72:540:234:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:gages on newly purchased homes, the buyer’s real-estate broker often refers the purchaser to
11:369:24042:18:18:72:540:216:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a mortgage broker, who explains that he has access to mortgages from dozens of competing
11:370:24130:18:18:72:540:198:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lenders and that he can help the borrower choose the one with the best terms. He does not
11:371:24219:18:18:72:540:180:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mention that each of these lenders offers a link between the interest rate and the YSP that
11:372:24310:18:18:72:540:162:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:he will receive. He proposes one or more mortgages, each with a rate that includes as big a
11:373:24401:18:18:72:540:144:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:YSP as he thinks the borrower will accept. He pairs the rate proposal with a proposal for a
11:374:24492:18:18:72:540:126:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash closing charge. His judgment on this question will turn on how careful and informed a
11:375:24582:18:17:72:255:108:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:shopper he believes the borrower is.
11:376:24618:17:18:89:540:91:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Mortgage law requires that the broker provide the borrower at this stage in the process
11:377:24705:18:0:72:540:73:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a good-faith estimate of the closing charge, but not of the YSP. Thus the borrower does not
12:378:24798:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:know prior to making a deal with a mortgage broker how much the broker will earn in total
12:379:24887:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:fees.  The borrower may eventually learn the amount of the YSP, in principle, because the
12:380:24976:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:law requires its disclosure at the time of the closing, on the HUD-1 form that is part of the
12:381:25069:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:closing document package.  The terminology of the disclosure and the location of the YSP
12:382:25157:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:entry on the form may inhibit many borrowers from understanding the YSP, and, in any
12:383:25241:18:35:72:413:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:case, the information arrives long after the mortgage deal is made.
12:384:25308:35:25:72:153:600:206:g_d0_f1:206:g_d0_f1:C:2.4  Points
12:385:25319:25:18:72:540:575:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:One important source of confusion among borrowers is the labeling of parts of cash closing
12:386:25409:18:18:72:540:557:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charges as “points.” A point is a component of the broker’s closing charge calculated as a
12:387:25499:18:18:72:540:539:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:percent of the principal amount of the loan.  From the perspective of the economics of a
12:388:25587:18:18:72:540:521:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage origination, a charge for points is just part of the total that the borrower pays
12:389:25677:18:18:72:540:503:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the broker. Borrowers may believe that paying points “buys down” the interest rate. In
12:390:25766:18:18:72:540:485:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:principle, this should be true. If a broker receives part of his cash closing charge as points,
12:391:25861:18:18:72:540:467:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:just as in any other form, the borrower should be able to bargain for a lower YSP and thus a
12:392:25953:18:18:72:540:449:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lower interest rate. But this only happens if the borrower uses the added bargaining power
12:393:26043:18:18:72:540:431:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that paying more cash to the broker ought to give the borrower.  Nothing stops the broker
12:394:26132:18:18:72:540:413:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from offering an interest rate that earns him a handsome YSP and also including a charge
12:395:26220:18:18:72:540:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for points as part of the pricing of the origination. In our sample, charges for points on loans
12:396:26316:18:17:72:420:377:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:were present on roughly 30 percent of the loans with positive YSPs.
12:397:26383:17:18:89:539:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:When the coupon rate is sufficiently low that the YSP is negative, the borrower will face
12:398:26472:18:18:72:540:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a charge for points that goes to the lender.  If the charge for points is the amount on the
12:399:26563:18:18:72:540:324:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate sheet for the negative YSP (below the horizontal line in Figure 1), the charge genuinely
12:400:26656:18:18:72:540:306:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:brings a lower interest rate.  But here too, the broker may charge more for points than the
12:401:26747:18:18:72:540:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lender receives—nothing stops the broker from charging more for the negative YSP than
12:402:26832:18:18:72:495:270:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:appears on the rate sheet and keeping the excess as part of his own compensation.
12:403:26913:18:18:89:539:252:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The borrower’s understanding of the cash closing charge may also be limited by the
12:404:26995:18:18:72:540:234:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:practice of dividing the charge into many elements. Figure 5 is an example containing terms
12:405:27086:18:18:72:540:216:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:found frequently in our data on mortgages. The good-faith disclosure form prevailing when
12:406:27175:18:18:72:540:198:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:these loans were written did not require brokers to state the sum of the charges (new rules
12:407:27266:18:18:72:540:180:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:do require disclosure of the sum), so comparison of loans was challenging.   Some of the
12:408:27354:18:18:72:540:162:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:challenge remains, because the disclosure law perversely allows for points to be separated
12:409:27444:18:18:72:540:144:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from other closing charges, suggesting that even the regulators fail to understand that points
12:410:27538:18:18:72:540:126:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:are just another name for broker or lender charges. Borrowers may not recognize that only
12:411:27627:18:17:72:540:108:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the sum—including points—is meaningful.  Lacko and Pappalardo (2007) found that few
12:412:27710:17:18:72:540:91:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers had any idea what the term “discount points” means, and worse, that one-third
12:413:27797:18:0:72:513:73:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:believed it was a discount they were receiving instead of an amount they were paying.

13:431:28388:26:18:72:540:442:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Our findings later in the paper demonstrate that an important fraction of borrowers leave a
13:432:28479:18:18:72:540:424:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lot of money on the table for their brokers. As we demonstrate later in the paper, the upper
13:433:28571:18:18:72:540:406:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tail of the distribution of origination charges brokers receive contains some astonishingly
13:434:28662:18:18:72:539:388:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:large values.  We use the termmarginto mean the difference between the revenue from
13:435:28745:18:18:72:540:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:originating a mortgage and the cost of executing the transaction. Here we include only costs
13:436:28837:18:18:72:540:352:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:incurred after the broker meets the borrower and strikes a deal. The margin is the amount
13:437:28926:18:18:72:540:334:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:at issue when the broker bargains with the borrower over the charge. Thus we believe that
13:438:29015:18:18:72:540:316:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage brokers earn substantial margins from many but not all of their origination efforts.
13:439:29108:18:17:89:540:298:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Mortgage brokerage involves only small out-of-pocket costs for the broker.  A mortgage
13:440:29194:17:18:72:540:281:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker does not usually outsource any of the origination process to other professionals. Fur-
13:441:29287:18:18:72:540:263:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ther, though charges labeled “origination fee,” “funding fee,” and “commitment fee” sound
13:442:29376:18:18:72:540:245:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:as if they flowed through to the lender, they remain firmly in the broker’s pocket. Thus the
13:443:29468:18:18:72:400:227:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:costs we have in mind are largely the value of the broker’s time.
13:444:29533:18:18:89:539:209:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The equilibrium we describe is inefficient.   We do not believe that mortgage brokers

13:446:29706:18:18:72:540:173:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is close to free.  Most states license mortgage brokers or require them to have licenses as
13:447:29797:18:18:72:540:155:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:real-estate agents, but these licenses are not difficult to obtain. Mortgage brokers dissipate
13:448:29891:18:18:72:540:137:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the anticipated margin from originating mortgages for borrowers who fail to shop carefully
13:449:29981:18:18:72:540:119:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:by spending effort and other resources trying to find these customers.  Because borrowers
13:450:30070:18:18:72:540:101:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:seldom seek out several brokers to compete for the borrower’s business, brokers have to work
13:451:30162:18:18:72:540:83:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:hard to find brokerage customers.  In Lacko and Pappalardo (2007), the modal number of
13:452:30248:18:0:72:540:65:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:loans considered by borrowers was two. In Federal Reserve Board (2009), more than half of
14:453:30339:0:18:72:313:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:all borrowers looked seriously at only one loan.
14:454:30387:18:18:89:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We noted earlier that mortgage brokers often receive referrals from real-estate brokers and
14:455:30478:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that it appears that many borrowers accept a proposal from such a mortgage broker without
14:456:30567:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:further shopping. Hence the referrals are valuable and mortgage brokers cultivate real-estate
14:457:30660:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:brokers hoping to receive their referrals. Federal law—the Real Estate Settlement Practices
14:458:30751:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Act—prohibits mortgage brokers from paying referral fees, but little is known about the
14:459:30838:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:effectiveness or enforcement of that prohibition. In any case, we believe that the mortgage-
14:460:30930:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:brokerage business is generally in a zero-profit equilibrium, where a new entrant perceives
14:461:31021:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:zero net payoff, given the costs of finding prospective customers.  But once found, some of
14:462:31112:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the customers are very profitable.  The resources dissipated by brokers in their search for
14:463:31203:18:40:72:465:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:overpaying customers is, from a social point of view, mostly economic waste.

14:465:31313:29:26:72:313:476:206:g_d0_f1:206:g_d0_f1:C:3.1  Description of the FHA data
14:466:31345:26:18:72:540:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Table 1 describes the relevant variables in our sample of 1,525 FHA brokered loans.  We
14:467:31432:18:18:72:540:432:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:excluded loans with rates below 7 percent and those with interest rates not at 1/8 point ticks
14:468:31526:18:18:72:540:414:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:as presumptively subsidized. Interest rates are fairly tightly clustered around 7 1/2 percent.
14:469:31620:18:18:72:540:396:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:All the loans were made at essentially the same time, so the variation arises in the cross
14:470:31710:18:18:72:540:378:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:section of borrowers and not from changes in credit markets. The total closing charges—cash
14:471:31801:18:18:72:540:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:closing charge plus yield-spread premium—average $4,111, but have substantial dispersion.
14:472:31890:18:18:72:540:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The cash component is typically a little under half of the total charge and the YSP a little
14:473:31982:18:17:72:540:324:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:more than half. The principal is generally around $100,000 and rarely exceeds $200,000. The
14:474:32073:17:18:72:540:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:average credit score of the borrower is 659, which is just below the median of the national
14:475:32164:18:18:72:540:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:distribution of scores.  The fractions of the borrowers who are members of minorities are
14:476:32253:18:18:72:540:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:close to the U.S. average in the population, at 11 percent African-American and 14 percent
14:477:32343:18:18:72:540:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Latino.  The last statistic is the fraction of the adult population in the borrower’s census
14:478:32435:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tract who hold a BA degree—its average level is 21 percent.  We have no measure of the
14:479:32521:18:18:72:540:217:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:education of individual borrowers, but are able to measure the education of their neighbors
14:480:32612:18:18:72:321:199:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:because we know the addresses of the borrowers.
14:481:32659:18:18:89:539:181:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Table 2 shows the distribution of the loans by interest rate. The 7 1/2 percent loan is by
14:482:32749:18:35:72:181:163:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:far the most popular.

14:484:32799:25:18:72:540:103:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:As we discussed in the previous section, the YSP is a payment from the wholesale lender to
14:485:32889:18:18:72:540:85:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the broker based on the coupon rate for the mortgage and on the amount of the principal.
14:486:32977:18:0:72:540:67:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The lender pays the premium to the broker outside the closing.  Earlier we reviewed what

16:522:33815:35:18:72:540:502:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we believe is highly reliable evidence about the formula for the YSP from rate sheets. Here
16:523:33906:18:18:72:540:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we examine the information in the FHA data on the YSP, which provides a different view
16:524:33992:18:17:72:540:466:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the formula. The source of the FHA broker compensation data is the HUD-1 settlement
16:525:34078:17:18:72:540:449:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:statement, required by RESPA. This source is potentially imperfect, because there seems to
16:526:34168:18:18:72:540:431:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:be relatively little monitoring of the accuracy of a broker’s disclosure and the broker may
16:527:34259:18:18:72:540:413:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:try to conceal a large premium from a borrower.  Table 3 shows the average yield-spread
16:528:34346:18:18:72:396:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:premium for the brokered loans in our sample, by interest rate.
16:529:34409:18:18:89:539:377:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 6 compares the relation between the coupon rate and the YSP in the FHA loans

16:531:34583:18:18:72:540:341:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:average in each category (hardly visible for the FHA data because of the large number of
16:532:34671:18:18:72:540:323:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:observations).   The curve for the rate sheets lies to the right of the curve for the FHA
16:533:34760:18:18:72:540:305:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:data because mortgage rates were higher in general in 2000 than in 2001.  The slope of
16:534:34846:18:18:72:540:287:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the premium is generally lower in the FHA data.  The difference in the slope could reflect
16:535:34936:18:18:72:540:269:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:changes in expectations about pre-payments and changes in the slope of the yield curve
16:536:35022:18:18:72:540:251:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:between 2000 and 2001.  It could also reflect some tendency for brokers to understate their
16:537:35113:18:18:72:540:233:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:actual premiums when they are high.  Because the yield-spread premiums reported in the
16:538:35199:18:18:72:540:215:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:FHA data are not obviously at odds with those in the rate sheets, and because we are unable
16:539:35290:18:17:72:540:197:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to adjust the curve from 2000 to improve measurement of the premiums actually paid for
16:540:35376:17:18:72:516:180:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the FHA mortgages, we will accept the reported premiums for the rest of our analysis.
16:541:35461:18:18:89:539:162:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Table 5 describes five cases that we use to illustrate the implications of the results of

17:564:36158:18:18:72:539:333:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:surely unconcerned about the mix between the cash from the borrower,L, and the cash
17:565:36241:18:18:72:540:315:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from the lender,Y(r), and that the typical borrower should be close to indifferent about the
17:566:36333:18:18:72:486:297:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mix as well. The near-indifference suggests we should start by studying the sum.
17:567:36413:18:18:89:539:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:All earlier research on mortgage terms has examined the expectation ofτor its compo-
17:568:36497:18:18:72:540:261:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:nents conditional on a vector of observed characteristics, via regression. Our interest extends
17:569:36592:18:18:72:539:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the entire distribution ofτconditional on characteristics, a vastly more complicated ob-
17:570:36683:18:18:72:539:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ject than the expectation. Our approach is to estimate the quantilesτi(x) of the distribution
17:571:36776:18:18:72:539:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:as functions of the observed characteristicsx.  The quantile gives the value ofτsuch that
17:572:36865:18:18:72:540:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the probability thatτis no greater thanτi(x) has a designated value,qi. It is the inverse of
17:573:36957:18:30:72:289:171:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the cumulative distribution functionF(τ):

18:605:37678:18:18:71:539:387:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:quantiles.  Our use of quantile estimation is only to transform the data into a form that
18:606:37767:18:18:71:539:369:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is useful for further analysis.  The transformation has the same kind of role that a Fourier
18:607:37859:18:17:71:321:351:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:transform of the data has in time-series analysis.
18:608:37909:17:18:89:539:334:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Table 4 shows the equation for the median (i=  150) of the closing charges for the
18:609:37991:18:18:71:539:316:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages in the FHA data, using the variables from Table 1.  The median rises sharply
18:610:38077:18:18:71:539:298:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with the amount of the principal.  The median charge is $2,842 higher for a mortgage with
18:611:38166:18:18:71:539:280:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a principal of $200,000 compared to one with a principal of $100,000.  African-American
18:612:38253:18:18:71:539:262:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers pay median closing charges that are $939 above those of otherwise similar white
18:613:38342:18:18:71:539:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers and Latino borrowers pay $912 higher more than white borrowers.  Borrowers
18:614:38426:18:18:71:539:226:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from census tracts with higher educational attainment pay smaller total closing charges—an
18:615:38516:18:18:71:539:208:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:increase of one standard deviation (12 percentage points) lowers the median cost by $300.
18:616:38605:18:18:71:539:190:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, the borrower’s credit score has a small negative relation to the median—100 extra
18:617:38695:18:18:71:539:172:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:points lowers the median charge by $55.  The last result is consistent with our observation
18:618:38786:18:18:71:539:154:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:earlier that the broker has no stake in the mortgage itself. The results in this table are similar
18:619:38884:18:18:71:539:136:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to those found in earlier work in the regression framework. We estimated the standard errors
18:620:38976:18:18:71:309:118:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in this and all subsequent tables by bootstrap.

20:686:41197:34:18:71:539:419:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in the raw density.  It is a well-known statistical problem that the estimate of a density at
20:687:41290:18:18:71:539:401:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a point is not consistent.  But a kernel smoother of a density is consistent.  Figure 8 shows
20:688:41383:18:18:71:539:383:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the standard kernel smoother of the raw density.  Then looking back at Figure 7, one can
20:689:41471:18:18:71:539:365:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:see that applying the smoother does little to alter the shape of the cumulative distribution.
20:690:41564:18:18:89:539:347:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 9 shows the smoothed densities that the descriptive model implies for the base
20:691:41649:18:18:71:539:329:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:case in Table 5, along with the smoothed density for the actual distribution of total closing
20:692:41742:18:18:71:539:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charges in the FHA data.  The model pictures the actual distribution as the mixture of
20:693:41828:18:18:71:539:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the distributions conditional on thex-characteristics. These distributions gain their shapes
20:694:41920:18:18:71:540:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:almost entirely from the underlying data. Our fitted model, with 299×6=1,794 estimated
20:695:42006:18:18:71:539:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients, is hardly restrictive. The actual distribution has a bulge around $6,000 relative
20:696:42101:18:18:71:539:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the distribution for the base case, reflecting the presence of loans with higher principal
20:697:42194:18:18:71:500:221:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and other factors associated with higher total closing charges than in the base case.
20:698:42279:18:18:89:540:203:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 10 compares the distribution for African-American borrowers to the distribution
20:699:42365:18:17:71:539:185:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for the base case.  The mode for the African-Americans is only about $700 higher than for
20:700:42454:17:18:71:539:168:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the white borrowers with otherwise similar characteristics in the base case, but the upper
20:701:42544:18:18:71:539:150:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tail is much thicker for the African-Americans. Their density is more than double that of the
20:702:42637:18:18:71:539:132:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:base-case borrowers at a total closing charge of $6,000, a great deal of money for originating
20:703:42731:18:18:71:172:114:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a loan for $100,000.

20:705:42834:18:18:71:539:78:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the distribution for the base case. These borrowers have a substantial advantage over those

22:751:43739:17:18:72:540:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:may also confer an advantage because the environment contains more people who grasp the

22:753:43918:18:18:72:540:353:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:has a very much lower density than does the base case for the range from $5,000 to $7,000.
22:754:44008:18:18:72:540:335:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Even among those with educated neighbors, a significant minority pay what appear to be

22:756:44124:18:18:89:540:299:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 12 compares the distribution for loans with high principal ($200,000) to the dis-
22:757:44212:18:18:72:540:281:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tribution for the base case ($100,000).  The distribution for the larger mortgages lies far to
22:758:44306:18:18:72:540:263:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the right of the distribution for the base case.  The powerful relationship with the amount
22:759:44397:18:18:72:540:245:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the transaction is a puzzling feature of many financial services.  Little of the work of a
22:760:44490:18:18:72:540:227:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage broker scales with the amount of the principal, but the modal and median charge
22:761:44578:18:18:72:540:209:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for a $200,000 mortgage is about double that of a $100,000 mortgage. The upper tail for the
22:762:44669:18:18:72:540:191:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bigger principal is quite thick—a few people pay astronomical closing charges for the larger
22:763:44761:18:18:72:127:173:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages.

22:765:44857:18:17:72:540:137:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 13, is instructive. For all but the high values of the closing charge, the two densities
22:766:44952:17:18:72:540:120:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:are similar, reaching peaks at about the same value, but with lower probability for all of the
22:767:45046:18:18:72:540:102:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lower values in the case of the higher credit score. All of the difference is at the upper end,
22:768:45141:18:18:72:539:84:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:where the base case has much more probability aboveτ=$7,000.  Apparently borrowers
22:769:45223:18:0:71:539:66:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with better credit scores are able to avoid the mistake of agreeing to such high charges. FHA

24:818:45978:34:18:72:540:419:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:underwriting works mainly with a cutoff credit score, which the base case satisfies. Perhaps
24:819:46070:18:18:72:540:401:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers with credit scores close to the minimum acceptable score are less willing to shop,
24:820:46162:18:40:72:478:383:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:because they do not realize that their scores are acceptable to all FHA lenders.
24:821:46242:40:30:72:278:343:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:4  Consumer Confusion
24:822:46263:30:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:We believe that our results reveal substantial consumer confusion, in the sense that the
24:823:46351:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:process of obtaining a mortgage through a broker results in many borrowers paying far more
24:824:46441:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for the broker’s origination services than they would if they better understood how to shop
24:825:46532:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for a mortgage and if they understood that the broker was not doing their shopping for them.
24:826:46624:18:18:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Our first approach to supporting this conclusion is to fit a suitable model of optimal shopping
24:827:46719:18:18:72:540:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to our data and then observe that the payoff to more intensive shopping—specifically, the
24:828:46808:18:17:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:benefit of getting a quote from an additional broker—is far higher than seems reasonable.
24:829:46897:17:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Borrowers behave as if it costs over $1,000 to get a quote from another broker.  Of course,
24:830:46988:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we cannot rule out the alternative conclusion that shopping among brokers for the best deal
24:831:47079:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:has such a high psychic cost that the choice to limit shopping is a rational response to that
24:832:47172:18:0:72:121:134:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:high cost.

25:834:47239:26:18:72:540:699:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:A recent literature considers the econometric problem of inferring shopping costs from market
25:835:47332:18:18:72:540:681:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:data. Hong and Shum (2006) and Horta ̧csu and Syverson (2004) are notable contributions,
25:836:47420:18:18:72:540:663:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and Moraga-Gonz ́alez (2006) is a recent survey.  This literature considers posted prices—
25:837:47510:18:18:72:540:645:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:consumers visit stores and buy from the one with the best posted offering. We have not found
25:838:47602:18:18:72:540:627:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:any empirical model in that literature that would apply to the problem we consider here,
25:839:47690:18:18:72:540:609:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:even if we accepted the assumption of posted prices.  Hong and Shum follow Burdett and
25:840:47776:18:17:72:540:591:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Judd (1983) in assuming that all sellers have the same cost. That assumption is untenable in
25:841:47868:17:18:72:540:574:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:our data, because it implies that the common value of cost must be lower than the smallest
25:842:47958:18:18:72:540:556:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:observed price.  We find a tiny fraction of prices that are only a few hundred dollars.  We
25:843:48049:18:18:72:540:538:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:can only make sense out of the data under the assumption of fairly heterogeneous cost.  In
25:844:48139:18:18:72:540:520:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:any case, the heterogeneity of broker effort in the origination process, where some borrowers
25:845:48232:18:18:72:540:502:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:provide all the needed documents in proper form when first asked, while others need extensive
25:846:48325:18:18:72:540:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:help in preparing the documents, seems to preclude any assumption of equal cost for all
25:847:48412:18:18:72:135:466:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:originations.
25:848:48425:18:18:89:539:448:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:On the other hand, Horta ̧csu and Syverson’s 2004 study of mutual funds assumes het-
25:849:48509:18:18:72:540:430:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:erogeneity in both seller product cost and buyer cost of search, the case we believe describes
25:850:48603:18:18:72:540:412:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage market. Their results support the conclusion that consumers suffer confusion
25:851:48692:18:18:72:540:394:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in their choices of mutual funds by failing to shop hard enough for a low expense ratio. But
25:852:48784:18:18:72:540:376:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:they use the market shares of sellers to identify the two distributions, along with the observed
25:853:48880:18:18:72:540:358:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:distribution of posted prices (in their case, of mutual funds).  Their approach is suitable to
25:854:48974:18:18:72:540:340:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a market where each seller posts the same price for all buyers. Mortgage brokers tailor their
25:855:49067:18:17:72:540:322:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:proposals to individual borrowers, so the assumption fails in our case.  In addition, we lack
25:856:49160:17:18:72:267:305:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:data on origination volume by broker.
25:857:49197:18:18:89:540:287:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The assumption of posted prices seems out of place in the mortgage origination market.
25:858:49283:18:18:72:540:269:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The essence of a posted price is a commitment not to consider a counteroffer from a customer.
25:859:49376:18:18:72:540:251:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Posted prices make sense in Internet commerce, studied by Hong and Shum (2006) and many
25:860:49463:18:18:72:539:233:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:others, and in regulated mutual funds, studied by Horta ̧csu and Syverson (2004). Mortgage
25:861:49553:18:18:72:540:215:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:brokers, mostly working as individuals or in small groups, have no technology to commit
25:862:49640:18:18:72:540:197:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to a stated price.  If a borrower turns down an offer and makes a plausible case in favor of
25:863:49732:18:18:72:540:179:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a lower closing charge, the broker may well make a better offer rather than risk losing the
25:864:49823:18:18:72:526:161:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:business. For a discussion of this issue in the labor market, see Hall and Krueger (2010).
25:865:49913:18:18:89:540:143:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:As far as we know, there are no similar papers on negotiated prices. The theoretical study
25:866:50003:18:18:72:540:125:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:closest to the problem that a borrower faces in the mortgage origination market is McAfee
25:867:50092:18:18:72:540:107:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and McMillan (1988). That paper considers the optimal strategy for commercial procurement
25:868:50181:18:18:72:540:89:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from suppliers with heterogeneous costs. The optimal mechanism induces potential suppliers
25:869:50271:18:0:72:540:71:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to reveal their costs; the buyer continues to play the revelation game with additional potential
26:870:50369:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:suppliers until the benefit from adding another falls short of the cost of playing the game
26:871:50460:18:18:72:103:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:again.
26:872:50466:18:18:89:539:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We take a view that is a simplification of McAfee and McMillan (1988) suited to the
26:873:50549:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:case where the buyer is a borrower seeking origination services from a broker. Rather than
26:874:50639:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:inducing the revelation of cost, which would require a strong commitment to a sealed-bid
26:875:50727:18:18:72:539:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:second-price auction setup, we suppose that the borrower seeks initial quotes fromNbrokers,
26:876:50818:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:uses the quotes to extract better proposals, until the process ends with one quote that no
26:877:50908:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:other broker is willing to beat. This process is an English or Vickrey or second-price auction.
26:878:51003:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Modeling of markets based on these auctions is made easier by the fact that bidding behavior
26:879:51095:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is non-strategic. By standard auction principles, the best ultimate bid is the reservation value
26:880:51191:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:(cost) of the second-lowest-cost bidder. Because the winning bidder does not reveal cost, the
26:881:51284:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bidder is protected from opportunistic action by the borrower based on a departure from the
26:882:51375:18:17:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:McAfee-McMillan commitment, by making a counteroffer to that bidder at a charge lower
26:883:51460:17:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:than the second-lowest but above the winner’s cost. We also believe that borrowers who get
26:884:51550:18:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the best deals on mortgage origination actually do their shopping the way that we model
26:885:51637:18:18:72:132:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the process.
26:886:51649:18:18:89:540:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Notice that we are making an assumption of commitment by the borrower to decline to
26:887:51732:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:engage in further bargaining with the sole remaining bidder once the second-place broker
26:888:51820:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:has dropped out. The borrower accepts the last offer from the winner rather than making a
26:889:51909:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:counteroffer. We believe this assumption is generally realistic and it has the further advantage
26:890:52005:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of leading to a simple and clean way to interpret the observed distribution of closing charges.
26:891:52100:18:18:89:539:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:In this view of shopping, there is all the difference in the world between shopping from a
26:892:52190:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:single broker and from two. The model holds that the broker can extract all of the surplus in

26:894:52374:18:18:72:540:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bid. In the case of a single bid, the outside option is no mortgage, meaning that the broker
26:895:52466:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:can extract the entire surplus from the purchase of a house or the refinance of a mortgage.
26:896:52557:18:17:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Because we have no way to measure that surplus, we consider only the cases of two or more

27:923:53706:29:18:89:539:347:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We find theBdistribution in the following way:  On a grid of values ofBin [0,1], we
27:924:53789:18:18:72:540:329:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:evaluate the right-hand side of equation (8) and associate it with the value ofτwhereH(τ)
27:925:53878:18:18:71:539:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is closest to that value. We take that value ofBandk=τto be a point on the distribution
27:926:53965:18:18:71:540:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of broker cost,B(k).  The set of values ofkthat emerges from this process is a resampling
27:927:54054:18:18:71:540:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the original set of values ofτsuch that the values appear according to the distribution of
27:928:54147:18:18:71:539:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker cost rather than the original distribution of closing charges.  Every borrower pays a
27:929:54239:18:18:71:539:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charge that is equal to some broker’s cost—that broker was the runner-up in the negotiation.
27:930:54331:18:18:71:539:221:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:That is why we relabelτask.  We use a standard kernel smoothing density estimator on

27:934:54650:17:18:71:539:150:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to cost, the distributions for higher numbers of brokers involve generally higher costs, so

28:960:55476:34:18:72:540:404:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:only two brokers.  The distribution for the high-principal loans lies far to the right—if it is
28:961:55571:18:18:72:540:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:true that borrowers only shop from two brokers, the cost of originating loans with principals

28:963:55755:18:18:72:540:350:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:alternative interpretation is that borrowers seeking bigger loans often shop from only one
28:964:55845:18:18:72:540:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker, who is able to capture some part of the surplus that the borrower enjoys from buying
28:965:55937:18:17:72:540:314:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the house, which will generally be larger for more expensive houses. A borrower dealing with
28:966:56029:17:18:72:540:297:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:only one broker faces an outside option in the bargain of not buying the house at all, while the
28:967:56125:18:18:72:540:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:shopper who knows to go to at least one other broker has the outside option of dealing with
28:968:56216:18:18:72:540:261:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that broker.  The tendency for consumers to leave more on the table for large transactions
28:969:56306:18:35:72:405:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:has been widely reported in the literature on consumer behavior.

28:973:56530:18:18:72:540:147:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a lot of money by shopping harder, from more brokers.  Based on our results above on the

28:976:56803:18:18:72:540:93:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:huge and implausible implied extra broker cost of high-principal mortgages, that borrowers

29:1006:58550:18:18:72:540:139:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to shop more effectively than other groups, or who perhaps seem more savvy to brokers and
29:1007:58639:18:18:72:540:121:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:consequently get better quotes from them) to a colossal $1,866 for the borrowers seeking a
29:1008:58729:18:18:72:540:103:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:high-principal loan.  These gains rise to $1,197 and $2,664 for adding a fourth broker.  We
29:1009:58820:18:18:72:540:85:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:conclude that borrowers are failing to use a simple method to obtain better deals on their
29:1010:58910:18:0:72:540:67:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:closing charges. While one might consider the possibility that most people are so averse to

30:1036:59694:18:18:72:540:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:explanation.  Brokers seem to have mastered the art of dissuading their customers from
30:1037:59780:18:35:72:477:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:doing the kind of shopping that comes naturally for other expensive purchases.

30:1039:59898:26:18:72:540:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Under our conclusion that mortgage customers shop from only two brokers, we can calculate
30:1040:59987:18:18:72:540:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the distribution of the broker’s margin—the amount that borrowers leave on the table, in
30:1041:60075:18:17:72:540:318:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the sense that they pay more than the broker’s reservation price, which is his cost.  The
30:1042:60164:17:18:72:540:301:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:margin is the difference between the actual charge, the cost of the broker with the higher of
30:1043:60257:18:18:72:540:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the two costs, and the broker’s own cost, the lower of the two costs. The Appendix explains
30:1044:60348:18:18:72:540:265:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:how we calculate this distribution.  Figure 17 shows the distribution of the margin, along
30:1045:60438:18:18:72:540:247:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with the distributions of the broker’s cost by loan, and the distribution of the total closing
30:1046:60532:18:18:72:540:229:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charge.  Note that the distribution of broker cost by loan lies to the left of the distribution
30:1047:60627:18:18:72:540:211:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of cost by broker, shown in Figure 14, because the shopping process gives more business
30:1048:60714:18:18:72:540:193:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the lower-cost brokers.  The low-cost brokers appear more often among loans than their
30:1049:60803:18:18:72:540:175:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:share of the broker population.  The distribution of cost by loan is somewhat irregular in
30:1050:60893:18:18:72:540:157:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:comparison to the other distributions shown in this paper, because the minimum function
30:1051:60980:18:18:72:540:139:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:gives high weight to the shape of the distribution of cost for fairly low cost. The irregularity
30:1052:61076:18:18:72:466:121:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is a feature of the underlying data, not an artifact of our calculation process.
30:1053:61156:18:18:89:540:103:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Note that the distribution of broker margin in Figure 17 is not terribly different from the
30:1054:61247:18:18:72:540:85:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:exponential that Berndt et al. (2009) assume in their approach to measuring the distribution
30:1055:61339:18:0:72:540:67:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of broker cost.  But they also assume that cost is normally distributed, an assumption less

31:1072:61853:22:30:101:211:339:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:and the YSP
31:1073:61864:30:18:72:540:309:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Earlier we noted that the function governing the YSP, as revealed in our data from actual rate
31:1074:61958:18:18:72:540:291:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:sheets, has a shape that makes some borrower-broker pairs essentially indifferent between
31:1075:62047:18:18:72:540:273:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:using the borrower’s cash to pay the broker and borrowing the funds to pay the broker.
31:1076:62133:18:18:72:540:255:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Given that conclusion, we have studied the total payment.  In this section, we explore the
31:1077:62223:18:18:72:352:237:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:division of the total payment between the two sources.
31:1078:62277:18:18:89:540:219:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We construct the variables=LL+Yfor each loan, the fraction of the total closing cost
31:1079:62361:18:17:72:539:201:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:paid in cash. Thus a “no-cost” loan, where the broker receives only the YSP, hass= 0, while
31:1080:62452:17:18:71:539:184:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a loan at the par coupon rate, with zero YSP, hass= 1.  Figure 18 shows the distribution
31:1081:62540:18:18:71:539:166:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ofsamong the loans in the FHA sample.  The modal loan’s total closing cost is around
31:1082:62624:18:18:72:540:148:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:half cash and half YSP. Loans with closing costs paid mostly in cash—the right side of the
31:1083:62714:18:18:72:540:130:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:distribution—are relatively rare. Loans with closing costs paid mostly through the YSP are
31:1084:62804:18:18:72:336:112:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:not common, but constitute an important minority.

32:1105:63589:18:18:71:539:347:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:negative YSP, which are included in the first and last bins) into ten equal bins and introduce

33:1148:66383:18:18:72:540:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:percent in cash relative to the total closing charge paid by those using 30 to 40 percent cash

33:1154:66907:18:18:72:540:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the borrowers in the lowest-cash category pay a total closing charge at the high level of

33:1156:67087:18:18:72:540:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and the mean, in this group, the total closing payment keeps rising with the cash share up
33:1157:67177:18:18:72:540:171:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to 70 percent cash, where the total payment is $8,460, an astronomical amount to pay for
33:1158:67265:18:18:72:300:153:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:origination services for a $100,000 mortgage.
33:1159:67310:18:18:89:540:135:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude that all borrowers who opt to rely on the YSP to fund their origination
33:1160:67393:18:18:72:503:117:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:costs rather than paying a mixture of YSP and cash are likely to make better deals.
33:1161:67476:18:28:89:465:99:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:To interpret the findings in Table 7, we consider a number of hypotheses:
33:1162:67549:28:0:89:539:71:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•Baseline:  The borrower has a givens.  The borrower and broker negotiate a total
34:1163:67632:0:18:101:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:closing chargeτthat is uncorrelated withs.  The two components of the payment to
34:1164:67712:18:28:101:439:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:the broker are the cash chargeL=sτand the YSPY=(1−s)τ.
34:1165:67766:28:18:89:539:679:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•High-discount disadvantage:  High-discount borrowers are more costly for the broker
34:1166:67850:18:18:101:540:661:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:to serve and place lower value on the deferred payments to finance the yield-spread
34:1167:67933:18:17:101:539:643:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:premiumY, so on both accounts the total origination chargeτis higher for the low-
34:1168:68014:17:18:101:540:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f2:A:sborrowers who rely on the yield-spread premium to save themselves scarce current
34:1169:68095:18:28:101:126:608:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:cash.
34:1170:68100:28:18:89:540:580:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•Marginal home purchasers:  Some borrowers are only barely able to manage the pur-
34:1171:68182:18:18:101:540:562:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:chase of the house they are trying to finance. Not only are they short of cash to pay the
34:1172:68271:18:18:101:540:544:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f4:A:broker, but they have hardly enough income to qualify for the loan. They need a lows
34:1173:68355:18:18:101:540:526:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:because of their cash shortage, but cannot qualify for much of a yield-spread premium.
34:1174:68441:18:18:101:540:508:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Because they have a credible threat not to complete the purchase, the broker is forced
34:1175:68527:18:27:101:349:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:to offer a total closing chargeτclose to his cost.
34:1176:68577:27:18:89:540:463:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•Single-dimension shopping advantage:  Borrowers who elect no-cost loans (s=0) or
34:1177:68658:18:18:101:540:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:those with low cash charges can shop for the lowest coupon rate without having to
34:1178:68739:18:18:101:540:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:balance the cash charge against the coupon rate; they have no trouble determining
34:1179:68820:18:18:101:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:the best deal among a set of proposed mortgages. Similarly, those who elect no yield-
34:1180:68905:18:18:101:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:spread premium and thus to pay the par coupon rate can shop for the lowest cash
34:1181:68984:18:18:101:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:charge.  A third possibility for no-cost loans is that setting the broker’s expectations
34:1182:69072:18:18:101:540:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:that no cash will be paid by the borrower at closing precludes the broker from nibbling
34:1183:69159:18:26:101:429:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:by adding on additional smaller fees, such as fax or courier fees.
34:1184:69225:26:18:89:539:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The results refute the baseline hypothesis.  Under that hypothesis, conditioning on the
34:1185:69312:18:18:71:540:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash shareswould not change the distribution of the total origination chargeτ.  Table 7
34:1186:69399:18:18:71:539:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:shows a strong tendency for the borrowers who contribute less cash, with low values ofs,
34:1187:69487:18:18:71:539:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to pay substantially less by all four measures.  The results plainly establish an interaction
34:1188:69580:18:18:71:292:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:betweensand the total origination charge.
34:1189:69621:18:18:89:539:221:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The results also refute the hypothesis of a high-discount disadvantage.  The view seems
34:1190:69708:18:18:71:539:203:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:plausible that these borrowers are more costly to serve, because the same factors that cause
34:1191:69800:18:18:71:539:185:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:them to have high discounts also means that they have trouble finding the needed documents,
34:1192:69891:18:17:71:539:167:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:filling out applications, and performing the other steps in the application process.  Brokers
34:1193:69984:17:18:71:539:150:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:probably do more hand-holding for high-discount borrowers. By definition, these borrowers
34:1194:70073:18:18:71:539:132:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:place a lower discounted value on the future coupon payments that fund the yield-spread
34:1195:70160:18:18:71:539:114:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:premium, another factor that would help the broker extract a high total closing charge. Our
34:1196:70251:18:18:71:539:96:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:earlier analysis showed that high-discount borrowers will opt for low-sloans. High-discount
34:1197:70342:18:18:72:540:78:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers will more often lack the cash to pay the broker up front.  All of these plausible
34:1198:70433:18:0:72:540:60:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:considerations point towardhighertotal broker charges for the low-sborrowers.  But the
35:1199:70521:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f4:B:evidence in Table 7 is that these borrowers pay thousands of dollarslessthan those withs
35:1200:70609:18:18:72:130:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:around 0.5.
35:1201:70620:18:18:89:539:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Table 7 supports the hypothesis that marginal home purchasers get better deals from
35:1202:70703:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:their brokers. They benefit in the same way that the shabby buyer in the souk who turns his
35:1203:70794:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:pockets inside out to show that he has only $3 to buy the fez is likely to get the fez for that
35:1204:70889:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:price, while a normal tourist can’t get it for less than $10.  The marginal home purchaser
35:1205:70979:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:can’t pay the broker much in cash and can’t qualify for a mortgage with a high enough
35:1206:71064:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:coupon to support much of a yield-spread premium, so the broker has the choice between
35:1207:71150:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:doing origination for only a small profit or not doing it at all. The marginal home purchaser
35:1208:71243:18:18:72:335:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:gets a low-price origination without shopping hard.
35:1209:71294:18:18:89:539:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the results in Table 7 support the hypothesis that consumers shop better when
35:1210:71380:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the price has a single dimension. This hypothesis helps explain why the borrowers with high
35:1211:71471:18:17:72:539:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:values ofsdo somewhat better, as well as explaining the striking advantage of the more
35:1212:71557:17:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:common single-dimension shopping strategy based on the no-cost loan. The borrowers with

35:1216:71897:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:not both—incur only half the total cost of those who pay with both. Borrowers behave as if
35:1217:71987:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:they are unaware that incurring a higher YSP should entitle them to a lower cash payment.
35:1218:72076:18:18:89:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude that, among the four hypotheses, the data plainly support those relating to
35:1219:72163:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:marginal house purchasers and single-dimension shopping strategies, while the data refute
35:1220:72252:18:40:72:531:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the baseline hypothesis and the hypothesis of a disadvantage for high-discount borrowers.
35:1221:72341:40:30:72:278:308:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:6  Concluding Remarks
35:1222:72362:30:18:72:540:278:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Untrained, inexperienced borrowers interact with specialist mortgage brokers in an impor-
35:1223:72451:18:17:72:540:260:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tant segment of the mortgage origination market. Brokers earn two kinds of compensation,
35:1224:72539:17:18:72:540:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:explicit charges the borrower pays in cash at the closing and a commission the lender pays
35:1225:72629:18:18:72:540:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:based on the spread between the coupon rate the borrower agrees to and the par mortgage
35:1226:72716:18:18:72:540:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate. Both types of broker compensation seem to generate confusion. The fee to the
35:1227:72807:18:18:72:540:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker at closing is not called “broker’s fees” or anything like that.  Rather, it is a confus-
35:1228:72902:18:18:72:540:171:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ing array of charges, each seeming to cover some aspect of origination costs, together with,
35:1229:72994:18:18:72:540:153:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in many cases, a charge for “points”.  Almost everybody, including regulators and many
35:1230:73080:18:18:72:540:135:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:economists, seem to believe that points have a mechanical relation to a reduced interest
35:1231:73168:18:18:72:540:117:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate, when in fact the term points is nothing more than another category for the broker’s
35:1232:73257:18:18:72:108:99:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charge.
35:1233:73264:18:18:89:540:81:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:When interpreted in the context of a minimal amount of shopping among borrowers for
35:1234:73347:18:0:72:540:63:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker services—shopping from a pair of brokers—the data support the proposition that
36:1235:73434:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a substantial fraction of borrowers would benefit substantially by shopping from additional
36:1236:73525:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:brokers. The data also suggest that simplifying shopping by considering only loans where the
36:1237:73617:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:broker receives all his compensation from the lender and the borrower pays no cash closing
36:1238:73707:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charge results in substantially better terms for borrowers.  The borrowers who receive the
36:1239:73797:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:worst terms tend to pay both large cash charges and to agree to high interest rates that give
36:1240:73890:18:18:72:496:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the broker large additional compensation in the form of the yield-spread premium.
36:1241:73971:18:18:89:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Although brokers tend to make large margins over cost in each origination, we do not
36:1242:74055:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:believe that they earn incomes above those available from other lines of work. Rather, they
36:1243:74146:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:dissipate the margin by putting extra effort into getting in touch with prospective borrowers.
36:1244:74240:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Equilibrium in the broker origination market appears to be inefficient.  If borrowers spent
36:1245:74331:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:more effort getting in touch with more brokers—which is easy—brokers would earn less
36:1246:74415:18:18:72:427:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:margin and would dissipate less effort trying to locate shy borrowers.
36:1247:74485:18:17:89:539:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:With respect to policy changes that might help achieve the more efficient equilibrium,
36:1248:74571:17:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we believe in evidence-based design.  Disclosure law has historically been in the hands of
36:1249:74661:18:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lawyers, who design dense forms that may help absolve their clients of blame for consumer
36:1250:74750:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:error, but which do little to help consumers find better deals.  A new movement to design
36:1251:74839:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:disclosures that are proven to be helpful, through field experiments, may result in some
36:1252:74927:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:progress. We are inclined to believe that simple admonitions, such as “mortgage brokers are
36:1253:75018:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:salesmen and the only way to get a good deal is to shop and bargain” and “you are more
36:1254:75104:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:likely to get a good deal if you shop for no-cost loans” are more likely to yield improvements
36:1255:75198:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:than, for example, trying to teach borrowers enough financial economics to understand the
36:1256:75287:18:0:72:295:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tradeoff between cash and the interest rate.

39:1320:79289:40:30:72:246:684:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:A  Earlier Research
39:1321:79308:30:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:We review earlier research on mortgage closing charges, along with research on mortgage
39:1322:79395:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:interest rates,  non-real-estate consumer lending,  and car-buying,  that is relevant to this
39:1323:79488:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:study.   The auto and auto-lending markets are similar to the mortgage market in that
39:1324:79573:18:34:72:394:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:transactions have large dollar values and prices are negotiated.
39:1325:79637:34:26:72:309:566:206:g_d0_f1:206:g_d0_f1:C:A.1  Research on mortgage costs
39:1326:79668:26:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Woodward (2003) studied complete mortgage terms—loan rate plus lender/broker upfront
39:1327:79752:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charges, the YSP, and charges for other settlement services.  She investigated the relation
39:1328:79843:18:18:72:540:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:between the closing charges that borrowers pay directly and those they pay indirectly through
39:1329:79936:18:18:72:540:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the YSP, finding that a dollar of added YSP is associated with only a 55-cent decline in direct
39:1330:80031:18:18:72:540:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:charges.  This finding suggests that borrowers may not be aware that a higher mortgage
39:1331:80117:18:18:72:540:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate puts cash in the broker’s pocket that the borrower should be able to extract
39:1332:80207:18:18:72:383:432:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from the broker by insisting on a lower direct closing charge.
39:1333:80269:18:18:89:540:414:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Another finding in Woodward’s study was that borrowers who rolled all closing costs into
39:1334:80357:18:17:72:540:396:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the rate on their loan, by negotiating a direct charge of zero, paid total closing costs that
39:1335:80450:17:18:72:540:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:were $1,500 lower than those of other borrowers, other things equal. Borrowers who shop on
39:1336:80540:18:18:72:540:361:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate alone may be financially more savvy than other borrowers, or may simply benefit from
39:1337:80629:18:18:72:540:343:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a shopping strategy that allows them to compare loans with only a single number, rate, and
39:1338:80719:18:18:72:383:325:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:liberate themselves from attempting the rate-point trade-off.
39:1339:80780:18:18:89:540:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Courchane and Nickerson (1997) studied the interest rates and the charges labeled as
39:1340:80864:18:18:72:540:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:points, but not other cash charges, on loans from retail bank lenders.  Direct lenders have
39:1341:80955:18:18:72:540:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:internal rate sheets.   Some borrowers are quoted a standard rate,  and some are quoted
39:1342:81042:18:18:72:540:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from other cells having higher interest rates on the rate sheet.  When a borrower pays an
39:1343:81131:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate higher than the standard rate, the difference is called an “overage”.  Overages
39:1344:81224:18:18:72:540:217:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:are economically equivalent to yield-spread premiums.  Courchane and Nickerson find that
39:1345:81312:18:18:72:540:199:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:minorities on average pay more in overages than do other borrowers.  Studying a different
39:1346:81401:18:18:72:540:181:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:set of lenders, Black, Boehm and DeGennaro (2001) also found that minorities pay higher
39:1347:81488:18:18:72:540:163:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:overages.  Neither of these studies has data on cash fees charged to borrowers, so they are
39:1348:81579:18:18:72:540:145:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:not conclusive about loan terms for minorities. Woodward (2003), using data reporting both
39:1349:81669:18:17:72:516:127:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate and closing fees, did find that minority borrowers pay more than other borrowers.
39:1350:81755:17:18:89:539:110:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:As we noted in the body of the paper, borrowers receive a disclosure form called a Good
39:1351:81842:18:18:72:540:92:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Faith Estimate (GFE) prior to committing to a mortgage. Shroder (2007) compared GFEs
39:1352:81926:18:0:72:540:74:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the HUD-1 settlement statements giving the actual terms for 146 FHA loans.  He found
40:1353:82015:0:18:72:540:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that most GFEs overestimate borrowers’ ultimate cash closing charges by a small amount,
40:1354:82102:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:but that for a minority, the GFE under-estimates by a large amount. He also finds that when
40:1355:82193:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lender/broker charges are higher, so are the charges for title services, a finding consistent
40:1356:82286:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with the findings in Woodward (2008) and Woodward (2003).  He hypothesizes that this is
40:1357:82373:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the ”sheep-shearing” view of the market: borrowers vulnerable to over-charge
40:1358:82465:18:18:72:515:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in one category are vulnerable in others also. The sheep can be sheared on both sides.
40:1359:82551:18:18:89:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Shroder gave special attention to whether transactions showed evidence of uproar (divorce
40:1360:82640:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:or unusual delinquency in property taxes) in transactors’ lives.  Such uproar could raise
40:1361:82729:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:transaction costs by increasing the complexity of the transaction, raising the time pressure
40:1362:82821:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to get the deal closed, or reducing the seller’s or buyer’s resistance to agent opportunism.
40:1363:82913:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:He found that transactions with indications of trouble had total lender or broker and title
40:1364:83004:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash fees that were higher by $1,050, other things equal, in a set where the average was
40:1365:83092:18:17:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:$2,060.  He finds it implausible that a divorce or delinquent property taxes could so inflate
40:1366:83185:17:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:transaction costs. He concludes that the present disclosure rules do not sufficiently improve
40:1367:83278:18:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the negotiating position of buyers and sellers relative to service providers to prevent personal
40:1368:83374:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:difficulties from influencing the fees they pay.  His evidence is less than conclusive because
40:1369:83468:18:18:72:477:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:he did not include the charges labeled as points in his measure of closing costs.
40:1370:83549:18:18:89:539:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Subprime mortgages are intended for borrowers with higher default risks; their higher
40:1371:83634:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:interest rates compensate the lender for that risk.   Courchane,  Surette and Zorn (2003)
40:1372:83723:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:find that a significant fraction of borrowers eligible for prime loans actually take out more
40:1373:83816:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:expensive subprime loans. The authors find that the standard predictors of default—credit
40:1374:83905:18:18:72:540:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:scores, assets, and load-to-value ratio—explain much of the difference in what type of loan
40:1375:83996:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers get, but other factors also matter, including shopping behavior (do borrowers
40:1376:84083:18:18:72:540:312:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:search for best rates and affordable monthly payments?  Are they familiar with mortgage
40:1377:84170:18:18:72:540:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:market terms?), adverse life events (divorce, illness, unemployment, large drop in income),
40:1378:84261:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:channel (borrowers using brokers are more likely to get subprime loans than those who use
40:1379:84350:18:17:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lenders, other things equal), and age (older borrowers are more likely to have subprime loans,
40:1380:84444:17:18:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:other things equal). After taking account of these factors, they found no meaningfully higher
40:1381:84537:18:18:72:366:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood that minorities would take out subprime loans.
40:1382:84594:18:18:89:540:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Minority borrowers’ loan applications are rejected more often than are the applications of
40:1383:84684:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:white borrowers. LaCour-Little (1999) reviews this literature. Higher rejection rates may be
40:1384:84776:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a factor in the reluctance of minority borrowers to shop aggressively for the best mortgage
40:1385:84867:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:terms.  Research on differences in rejection rates is inconclusive on the question of whether
40:1386:84960:18:18:72:540:133:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:higher rates for minorities are the result of discrimination or a lower fraction of qualified
40:1387:85053:18:18:72:340:115:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers among minority applicants for mortgages.
40:1388:85103:18:18:89:540:97:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Cohen (2006), for car loans, and Woodward (2003), for mortgages, find that African-
40:1389:85186:18:18:72:540:79:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:American borrowers pay their loan brokers roughly $500 more than do other borrowers. The
40:1390:85274:18:0:72:517:61:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:differential for car loans is, of course, a much larger fraction of the amount of the loan.
41:1391:85367:0:18:89:539:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The race differences in broker closing charges result from some combination of taste-based
41:1392:85457:18:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:pure racial discrimination,  as described by Becker (1957),  differences in costs of serving
41:1393:85549:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:customers not reflected in explanatory variables but correlated with race, and differences
41:1394:85639:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in shopping behavior, possibly the result of racial differences in the way that shoppers are
41:1395:85731:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:treated by mortgage brokers and direct lenders. Less effective shopping and higher rejection
41:1396:85823:18:35:72:260:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rates may arise from related sources.
41:1397:85860:35:25:72:378:600:206:g_d0_f1:206:g_d0_f1:C:A.2  Findings from the Auto-Loan Market
41:1398:85899:25:18:72:540:575:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The institutional arrangements of the market for auto loans closely parallel those of the
41:1399:85988:18:18:72:540:557:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:home mortgage market.  Car buyers can get a loan from their local bank or credit union,
41:1400:86075:18:18:72:540:539:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:or they can arrange financing at the point-of-sale with the auto dealer who sells them a
41:1401:86163:18:18:72:540:521:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:car.  The loan broker, usually a separate individual within a dealer’s facility, operates with
41:1402:86257:18:18:72:540:503:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a rate sheet similar to the rate sheet of the mortgage broker,  but simpler.   Car lenders
41:1403:86347:18:18:72:540:485:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:make finer distinctions on credit quality than do mortgage lenders. The car loan rate sheets
41:1404:86439:18:18:72:540:467:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:generally have five credit-quality categories, with lower rates for better credit.  As with the
41:1405:86534:18:18:72:540:449:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage rate sheet, the lender pays the dealer more for making loans at higher rates, and
41:1406:86624:18:18:72:540:431:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:this amount is exactly analogous to a yield-spread premium.  Cohen (2006) reports that
41:1407:86710:18:18:72:540:413:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:on average, minority car buyers/borrowers agree to higher rates that result in additional
41:1408:86799:18:18:72:540:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:payment from the wholesale lender to the car dealer of about $500 per loan on new cars
41:1409:86885:18:17:72:540:377:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:averaging $25,000 in value. One feature of the auto loan market not found in the mortgage
41:1410:86974:17:18:72:540:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:market is that wholesale auto lenders put a ceiling on the upward adjustment of interest
41:1411:87062:18:18:72:540:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate for the two highest credit-quality buckets, but not for the lower-quality buckets. Cohen
41:1412:87155:18:18:72:540:324:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:found that to evade these caps, auto loan brokers sometimes moved borrowers to a lower
41:1413:87241:18:18:72:540:306:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:quality credit bucket than they merited (based on their credit scores) so as to quote them
41:1414:87331:18:35:72:397:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:higher rates, which were sometimes accepted by the car buyers.

41:1416:87425:26:17:72:540:227:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Beyond mortgage lending there is considerable research that can help interpret the findings
41:1417:87516:17:18:72:540:210:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in this study.  In particular, the research on the purchase terms for cars, which are sold in
41:1418:87609:18:18:72:540:192:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:markets where price is negotiated, is relevant.  The relevant facts and principles found in
41:1419:87700:18:28:72:308:174:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:this work, discussed in more detail below, are:

42:1426:88122:28:18:86:540:697:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:3.  Consumers capture a smaller share of the potential gains from trade when they do not
42:1427:88210:18:27:101:297:679:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:know the size of the potential surplus.
42:1428:88249:27:18:89:540:652:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Ayres and Siegelman (1995) found that minorities and women pay more for new cars
42:1429:88329:18:18:72:540:634:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:than do white men. Scott-Morton, Zettelmeyer and Silva-Risso (2007) investigated the role
42:1430:88418:18:18:72:540:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of shopping strategy in these differentials.  They find that success in shopping depends on
42:1431:88509:18:18:72:540:598:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge of dealer invoice price, visits to additional dealers, patience, and taste or distaste
42:1432:88605:18:18:72:540:580:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for bargaining and shopping. The best deals arise from a combination of market knowledge
42:1433:88693:18:18:72:218:562:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and willingness to negotiate.
42:1434:88722:18:18:89:540:544:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Scott-Morton, Zettelmeyer and Silva-Risso (2003) examined auto purchases on and off
42:1435:88805:18:18:72:540:526:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the internet.  Offline, women pay 0.5 percent more and minorities an extra 2 percent ($500
42:1436:88895:18:18:72:540:508:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:again), compared to white men, for equivalent cars.  Sixty percent of this price differential

42:1438:89079:18:18:72:540:472:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:costs lower) and taste for shopping. For online car purchases, where customers also negotiate
42:1439:89172:18:18:72:351:454:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:price, there are no race or sex differences in car prices.
42:1440:89230:18:18:89:540:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Aguiar and Hurst (2007) demonstrate the general importance of shopping and comparing
42:1441:89314:18:17:72:540:418:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:prices, in markets with posted prices, in their study of expenditure, consumption, and time
42:1442:89405:17:18:72:540:401:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:spent shopping. At retirement, households spend more time shopping and find better prices.
42:1443:89495:18:18:89:539:383:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Ayres (2001) explores four possible explanations for why minorities and women pay more
42:1444:89581:18:18:72:540:365:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for cars. The first two are Becker-type discrimination, involving a dislike of the buyer by the
42:1445:89676:18:18:72:540:347:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:seller.  Ayers leans against these sources of differential treatment because dealerships hire
42:1446:89769:18:18:72:540:329:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:substantial numbers of minority salespeople and some dealerships are minority-owned, but
42:1447:89857:18:18:72:540:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:nonetheless behave like other dealerships.  He then considers the possibility that minority
42:1448:89948:18:18:72:540:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:buyers might have more distaste for bargaining or be more inelastic demanders because they
42:1449:90038:18:18:72:540:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:have less knowledge of market prices.  The Scott-Mortonet al.studies confirm both as
42:1450:90122:18:18:72:223:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:sources of differential pricing.
42:1451:90154:18:18:89:539:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Busse, Silva-Risso and Zettelmeyer (2006) study two different types of auto sales promo-
42:1452:90242:18:18:72:540:221:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tions. In one, a car maker offered car buyers a $1,000 cash rebate. In another, the car maker
42:1453:90335:18:18:72:540:203:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:offered $1,000 to dealers who sell such a car. Standard economic analysis suggests that the
42:1454:90426:18:18:72:540:185:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:two different promotions should have identical impacts on price paid and the number of
42:1455:90512:18:17:72:540:167:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cars sold.  In fact, the two promotions had very different results.  When the buyers collect
42:1456:90604:17:18:72:540:150:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the rebate, both buyer and car salesman know of the existence of the promotion.  When
42:1457:90689:18:18:72:540:132:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the seller gets the bonus, only the sellers, not the car buyers, know of its existence.  When
42:1458:90782:18:18:72:540:114:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:car buyers get the rebate, consumers get 70 to 90 percent of the benefit of it—their total
42:1459:90872:18:18:72:540:96:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:price net of the rebate is about $800 lower than with no promotion. When car makers do a
42:1460:90960:18:18:72:540:78:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:promotion to dealers, consumer benefit is only 30 to 40 percent of the surplus amount. The
42:1461:91050:18:0:72:540:60:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:promotions direct to consumers were much more successful in selling additional cars than
43:1462:91140:0:18:72:371:725:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:were the relatively concealed promotions to salesmen only.
43:1463:91198:18:18:89:540:707:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The parallel between the auto dealer promotions and the mortgage market is that the
43:1464:91281:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lender payments to brokers are well understood by the mortgage brokers, but perhaps not by
43:1465:91371:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:consumers. But the parallel is not perfect. An important difference is that the YSP is not a
43:1466:91463:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:temporary promotion by lenders, but now a permanent part of how lenders distribute their
43:1467:91551:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:wholesale terms to mortgage brokers. Despite the permanence of the wholesale arrangements,
43:1468:91641:18:40:72:311:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:it seems that few consumers understand them.

43:1473:91938:18:18:71:540:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:distribution.  Over a meshPi=i/M, the quantiles of the distributionF(x) , sayxi, with

43:1475:92109:18:18:72:539:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:probability.  Thus the application of the kernel smoother toxiyields the smoothed density
