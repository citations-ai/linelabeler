2:25:536:14:14:72:526:494:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The  treatment  of  undesirable  outputs  in  Data  Envelopment  Analysis  (DEA)  has  received 
2:26:632:14:13:72:527:480:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:great research attention recently. As such and as are presented in this work, there are four 
2:27:725:13:14:72:525:467:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:possible options to deal with those: first ignoring them from the production function; second 
2:28:819:14:14:72:527:453:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:treating them as regular inputs; third treating them as normal outputs and fourth performing 
2:29:912:14:14:72:527:439:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:necessary transformations to take them into account. Also new model propositions for their 
2:30:1003:14:14:72:526:425:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:treatment are  being presented. Each  method brings with  it,  benefits and drawbacks which 
2:31:1095:14:13:72:527:411:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:each researcher should take into account at every stage of their research and assess which 
2:32:1186:13:14:72:265:398:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:method is more appropriate to be used.

3:55:1473:0:27:93:176:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:1. Introduction 
3:56:1487:27:28:93:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric approach applied to assess the 
3:57:1570:28:27:72:527:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:efficiency  of  Decision  Making  Units  (DMUs)  into  consideration  with  the  use  of  linear 
3:58:1667:27:28:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:programming techniques (Boussofiane et al., 1991). Efficiency is the ratio of output per input 
3:59:1762:28:27:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and usually the inputs include production elements, such as labour, capital, land, materials, 
3:60:1856:27:28:72:526:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:fuel,  machinery,  and  equipment  whereas  the  outputs  consist  of  production  volume, 
3:61:1947:28:28:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:production value, sales, value-added, and GDP (Tamaki et al., 2016). DEA models are either 
3:62:2038:28:27:72:526:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:input-oriented  minimising  inputs  or  output-oriented  models maximizing  outputs  without 
3:63:2131:27:28:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:requiring more inputs and there should also be no obvious linear relationship among inputs 
3:64:2222:28:27:72:297:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and outputs in DEA models (Wu et al., 2013).  
3:65:2267:27:28:93:526:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:A common issue that has occurred in DEA is how to account for undesirable outputs in 
3:66:2352:28:28:72:526:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the production process. The current understanding is that researchers should praise DMUs for 
3:67:2445:28:27:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:their provision of desirable or marketable outputs and penalise them for their provision of 
3:68:2537:27:28:72:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable  outputs  (Yang  and  Pollitt,  2010). If  inefficiency  exists  in  the  production,  the 
3:69:2640:28:27:72:526:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable pollu1tants should be reduced to improve the inefficiency and should be treated 
3:70:2732:27:28:72:250:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:differently (Seiford and Zhu, 2001).  
3:71:2769:28:28:93:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Many approaches have been put forward to account for this which are divided into direct 
3:72:2857:28:27:72:526:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and indirect ones; direct approaches refer to approaches that treat the undesirable output in its 
3:73:2955:27:28:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:original  form  such  as  parametric  output  and  input  distance  functions  (Fare  et  al.,  1993;

4:82:3603:0:28:93:526:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:On  the  other  hand  indirect  approaches  refer  to  treating  the  undesirable  output  as  a 
4:83:3700:28:28:72:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:classical input, whereas the undesirable output is moved to the input side of the model after 
4:84:3794:28:27:72:527:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:some transformation and treated as one of the inputs (Mohd et al., 2015), as both inputs and 
4:85:3887:27:28:72:527:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable outputs are the values that need to be minimised and therefore it is acceptable to 
4:86:3982:28:27:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:treat both in the same manner. However, Seiford and Zhu (2001) highlighted that treating 
4:87:4071:27:28:72:527:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable outputs as inputs will distort the actual production process since the relationship 
4:88:4167:28:28:72:427:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:between inputs and outputs in the actual production process will be lost.

4:100:5061:27:28:93:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Dealing with undesirable outputs will ultimately affect DMUs' efficiencies. A production 
4:101:5150:28:27:72:527:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:function  shows  strong  disposability  of  undesirable  outputs  if  these  are  freely  disposable; 
4:102:5252:27:28:72:526:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:whereas weak disposability  links pollutants' reductions with  lower production of desirable 
4:103:5345:28:28:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:outputs,  such  as  for  instance  CO2  emissions  which  cannot  be  reduced  using  the  existing 
4:104:5445:28:27:72:527:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:available technologies (Halkos and Polemis, 2018). The most common methods for treating 
4:105:5533:27:0:72:491:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable outputs in DEA and the relevant production function are presented below.  
5:106:5619:0:28:72:232:759:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:2.1 Ignoring undesirable outputs 
5:107:5651:28:28:93:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:The  first  option  to  treat  undesirable  outputs  is  to  simply  disregard  them  from  the 
5:108:5747:28:27:72:527:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:production  function.  Ignoring  the  undesirable  implies  that  they  have  no  value  in  the  final 
5:109:5851:27:28:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:evaluation and may thus provide misleading results (Yang and Pollitt, 2009). Environmental 
5:110:5942:28:27:72:527:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable outputs cannot be separated from the associated desirable output and a reduction 
5:111:6035:27:28:72:527:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:in an undesirable output brings also a reduction in the relevant desirable outputs (Halkos and 
5:112:6130:28:28:72:150:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Polemis, 2018).

5:114:6145:27:28:72:281:538:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:2.2 Treating undesirable outputs as inputs  
5:115:6188:28:27:93:526:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Another  option  is  to  treat  undesirable  outputs  as  normal  inputs  in  the  production 
5:116:6282:27:28:72:526:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:function.  For  example  Korhonen  and  Luptacik  (2004)  measured  the  eco-efficiency  of  24 
5:117:6378:28:28:72:526:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:coal-fired power plants in a European country and their modelling methods resembled those 
5:118:6468:28:27:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:used in Tyteca (1996, 1997) who treated emissions directly as inputs in the sense that both 
5:119:6560:27:28:72:327:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:inputs and undesirable outputs should be decreased.  
5:120:6612:28:27:96:526:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:In  addition  Reinhard  et  al.  (2000)  calculated  the  environmental  efficiency  for  Dutch 
5:121:6708:27:28:75:526:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:dairy farms in the presence of multiple environmentally damaging inputs and compared two 
5:122:6797:28:28:75:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:methods  of  Stochastic  Frontier  Analysis  (SFA)  and  DEA.  Furthermore  this  approach  has 
5:123:6893:28:27:75:525:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:been used for Canadian pulp and paper industry (Hailu and Veeman, 2001), Dutch sugar beet 
5:124:6983:27:28:75:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:growers  (De  Koeijer  et  al.  2002)  and  greenhouse  firms  in  the  Netherlands  (Lansink  and 
5:125:7082:28:27:75:526:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Bezlepkin,  2003).  The  extent  of  Japanese  banking  inefficiency  and  the  shadow  price  of 
5:126:7180:27:28:75:525:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:problem loans were studied by Hirofumi and William (2008) in which case they modelled 
5:127:7266:28:28:75:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:those  loans  as  a  jointly  produced  undesirable  by-product  of  the  loan  production  process. 
5:128:7367:28:27:75:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Yang  and  Michael  (2010)  stressed  that  these  approaches  inevitably  assume  undesirable 
5:129:7462:27:0:75:233:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:outputs are strongly disposable.  
6:130:7496:0:28:93:526:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Amirteimoori et al. (2006) extended the standard CCR (Charnes et al., 1978) model to a 
6:131:7583:28:28:72:527:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:DEA  like  model dealing with the relative efficiency  via  increasing undesirable  inputs and 
6:132:7678:28:27:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:decreasing  undesirable  outputs.  Also  Jahanshahloo  et  al.  (2005)  presented  an  approach  to 
6:133:7778:27:28:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:treat both undesirable inputs and outputs at the same time in non-radial DEA models. More 
6:134:7868:28:27:72:527:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:recently Farzipoor Saen (2010) proposed a model for supplier selection in the presence of 
6:135:7958:27:28:72:292:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:both undesirable outputs and imprecise data.

6:138:8063:27:28:93:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:A  further  approach  simply  treats the  undesirable  outputs  as outputs  in  the  production 
6:139:8159:28:27:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:function. Fare et al. (1989) applied the nonparametric approach on a 1976 data set of 30 US 
6:140:8251:27:28:72:526:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:mills which use pulp and three other inputs in order to produce paper and four pollutants, 
6:141:8342:28:28:72:527:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:whereas they assumed weak disposability for undesirable outputs. Their results showed that 
6:142:8433:28:27:72:527:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:depending on the use or not of undesirable outputs, the performance rankings of the DMUs 
6:143:8522:27:28:72:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:were quite sensitive. Therefore traditional DEA models might show a biased indication of the 
6:144:8615:28:27:72:526:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:current situation. Other studies present similar results (Pittman, 1983; Tyteca, 1996, 1997). 
6:145:8709:27:28:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:All these studies employ a direct approach in which both desirable and undesirable outputs 
6:146:8800:28:28:72:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:are  treated  in  their  actual  format.  In  those  cases  it  is  assumed  that  desirable  outputs  are 
6:147:8907:28:27:72:527:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:strongly  disposable,  while  the  undesirable  outputs  are  assumed  to  be  weakly  disposable 
6:148:9005:27:28:72:527:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:because  their  values  cannot  be  augmented  without  affecting  the  values  of  other  desirable 
6:149:9106:28:27:72:202:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:outputs (Fare et al., 1989). 
6:150:9134:27:28:93:526:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Chung et al. (1997) and Ball et al. (2004) extended the idea of Fare et al. (1989) and 
6:151:9221:28:28:72:527:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:proposed the  use  of  directional  distance  functions  (DDF)  to  evaluate  efficiency  of  DMUs 
6:152:9320:28:27:72:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:when the production function also produces some undesirable outputs. In this approach the 
6:153:9410:27:28:72:527:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:desirable outputs can be expanded and the desirable inputs and undesirable outputs can be 
6:154:9500:28:0:72:377:96:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:reduced based on a given direction vector (Chung et al., 1997). 
7:155:9564:0:28:93:525:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:The directional output distance function which aims to increase the desirable outputs and 
7:156:9654:28:34:72:489:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:decrease the undesirable ones and the inputs directionally, is defined as shown below:  
7:157:9741:34:24:350:353:697:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A: 
7:158:9741:24:29:93:525:673:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:where  inputs  are  represented  as ,  good  outputs as   and  bad  outputs  as 
7:159:9821:29:29:106:116:644:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:.  
7:160:9823:29:28:93:526:615:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Many  researchers  have  pointed  that  a  directional  distance  function  (DDF)  approach 
7:161:9915:28:27:72:527:587:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(suggested by Fare and Grosskopf, 2004) is the best solution as it allows for simultaneous 
7:162:10006:27:28:72:491:560:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:increase in desirable outputs and reduction of undesirable outputs (Mohd et al., 2015).  
7:163:10094:28:28:93:454:532:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Some examples of this use of undesirable outputs are presented in table 1.  
7:164:10169:28:27:93:526:504:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Moreover following those lines Haynes et al. (1993) measured the relative efficiency in 
7:165:10257:27:28:72:527:477:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:pollution prevention activities. By assuming free disposability of all inputs and outputs they 
7:166:10352:28:27:72:526:449:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:used chemicals and chemical residues as inputs and outputs along with traditional inputs and 
7:167:10445:27:28:72:526:422:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:outputs and  measured technical efficiency (Halkos and Tzeremes, 2009; 2013a,b,c; 2014). 
7:168:10534:28:28:72:527:394:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Yaisawarng and Klein (1994) followed Fare et al. (1989) modelling strategy and examined

7:173:10926:28:28:72:527:256:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Kordrostami and Amirteimoori (2005) consider a multistage system and take into account the

9:226:13531:28:28:72:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:with the incorporation of undesirable outputs. This model is an extension of Tone’s (2001) 
9:227:13622:28:27:72:527:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:original SBM model and uses a ratio approach to strike a balance between undesirable output 
9:228:13714:27:28:72:527:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:reduction  and  desirable  output  increase.  It  combines  environmental  and  economic 
9:229:13803:28:27:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:inefficiencies  and  provides  a  composite  index  for  modeling  economic  environmental 
9:230:13894:27:28:72:527:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:performance. Skevas et al. (2012; 2014) used DDF approach to propose a risk adjusted DEA 
9:231:13983:28:28:72:527:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:model  to  determine  the  efficiency  of  Dutch  arable  farmers  in  the  presence  of  undesirable 
9:232:14085:28:27:72:116:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:outputs.  
9:233:14093:27:28:93:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Moreover Sueyoshi and Goto (2012 a; b) introduce the concept of natural and managerial 
9:234:14180:28:27:72:527:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:disposability in DEA analysis. Natural disposability shows that firms reduce their inputs in 
9:235:14273:27:28:72:526:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:order to reduce their undesirable outputs, whereas managerial disposability shows that a firm 
9:236:14367:28:28:72:527:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:increases its inputs in order to take advantage of the business opportunity after a change in 
9:237:14461:28:27:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:environmental regulation. Finally Guo and Wu (2013) also treat the undesirable outputs as 
9:238:14551:27:28:72:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:inputs, as from the perspective of profit, more undesirable outputs usually mean more inputs 
9:239:14644:28:27:72:201:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:consumed and more costs. 
9:240:14668:27:28:93:96:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A: 
9:241:14668:28:28:72:266:317:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:2.4 Applying necessary transformations 
9:242:14706:28:27:93:526:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Another approach is to apply a monotone decreasing transformation. Koopmans (1951) 
9:243:14789:27:28:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:mentioned that some undesirable outputs like pollutant emissions and waste disposal affect 
9:244:14880:28:27:72:527:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:negatively the environment and should be reduced. As such a first reaction is to apply some 
9:245:14972:27:28:72:247:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:transformations as presented below: 
9:246:15007:28:28:93:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:a. (U)=−U; the so called the ADD approach suggested by Koopmans (1951), in which 
9:247:15087:28:27:72:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:case the undesirable inputs or outputs will become desirable. Though then some data may 
9:248:15175:27:0:72:511:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:become negative and it is not straightforward to define efficiency scores for negative data.  
10:249:15269:0:28:93:526:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:b. (U)=−U + β is another option (Ali and Seiford, 1990; Scheel, 2001; Seiford and Zhu, 
10:250:15355:28:28:72:302:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:2001), but this classification may depend on β.  
10:251:15403:28:27:93:518:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:c. The multiplicative inverse: f (U) = 1/U (Golany and Roll, 1989; Lovell et al., 1995).  
10:252:15491:27:28:93:526:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Related to ADD, there are several recent works dealing with negative data (but desirable) 
10:253:15581:28:27:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:with directional distance functions, such as Fare and Grosskopf (2004), Silva Portela et al. 
10:254:15674:27:28:72:526:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(2004) and Yu (2004). Those approaches are related to the weighted additive models so it is 
10:255:15766:28:28:72:527:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:important to realise that the additive models are able to handle negative data (Seiford and 
10:256:15858:28:27:72:131:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Zhu, 2005). 
10:257:15869:27:28:93:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:In  addition  to  the  above  mentioned  approaches  Cherchye  et  al.  (2011)  perform  a 
10:258:15960:28:27:72:527:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:transformation in the measurement scale based on a normalisation procedure, which can be 
10:259:16049:27:28:72:527:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:applied both to desirable and undesirable outputs. This procedure provides indicators between 
10:260:16143:28:28:72:526:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:0 and 1. As data normalisation can lead to loss of information, this method is not commonly 
10:261:16235:28:27:72:256:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:used in DEA studies (Zanella, 2004).  
10:262:16272:27:28:93:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Halkos and Papageorgiou (2014, 2016) cover the gap in literature by providing a typical 
10:263:16360:28:27:72:526:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:radial  DEA  model  in  three  different  settings in  order  to  model  regional  environmental 
10:264:16457:27:28:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:efficiency.  More  analytically  based  on  Seiford  and  Zhu  (2001,  2005)  they  use  a  linear 
10:265:16556:28:28:72:527:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:transformation of bad output in order to model the pollutant as a regular output in a DEA 
10:266:16646:28:27:72:526:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:formulation  setting.  Secondly  it  follows  several  other  studies  (Pittman  1981;  Cropper  and 
10:267:16747:27:28:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Oates  1992;  Reinhard  et  al.  2000;  Dyckhoff  and  Allen  2001;  Hailu  and  Veeman  2001; 
10:268:16842:28:27:72:527:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Korhonen and  Luptacik 2003;  Mandal and  Madheswaran 2010) treating the pollutant as a 
10:269:16930:27:28:72:526:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:regular input. Finally the study uses the DEA formulation as proposed by Kuosmanen and 
10:270:17017:28:28:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Kortelainen  (2005)  and  Kortlainen  (2008)  and  the  notion  of  eco-efficiency,  therefore 
10:271:17112:28:27:72:432:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:measuring regions’ eco-efficiency levels in municipality waste generation.

11:273:17188:0:28:72:151:759:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:B:2.5 New models 
11:274:17202:28:28:93:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Recently some new models for treating undesirable outputs have come forward. Gomes 
11:275:17285:28:27:72:527:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and Lins (2008) propose a new approach to modelling undesirable outputs, based on the zero 
11:276:17376:27:28:72:525:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:sum  gains  DEA  models  (ZSG-DEA).  These  models  consider  the  production  dependence 
11:277:17466:28:27:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:among the DMUs (Gomes, 2003; Gomes et al, 2003, 2005; Lins et al, 2003) including as an 
11:278:17554:27:28:72:527:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:additional restriction, the zero sum game property, in which whatever lost (or gained) by one 
11:279:17648:28:28:72:529:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:of the players must be gained (or lost) by the others, that is the net sum of gains must be zero.  
11:280:17747:28:27:72:526:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:This means that any DMU that wants to reach the efficient frontier by increasing the output 
11:281:17839:27:28:72:527:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(or  decreasing  the  input)  will  make  the  others  reduce  (or  increase)  their  values  by  this 
11:282:17942:28:27:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:amount, in order not to change the total. In the case of pollutants, ZSGDEA models can be 
11:283:18032:27:28:72:310:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:useful for the ecological economy (Sachs, 2000). 
11:284:18080:28:28:93:526:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Huang et al. (2014) propose a model named US-SBM which combines super efficiency, 
11:285:18162:28:27:72:525:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable outputs and slacks-based measure (SBM) together. Fukuyama and Weber (2010) 
11:286:18249:27:28:72:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:propose  a  slacks-based  inefficiency  measure  for a  two-stage  system  with  bad  outputs  and 
11:287:18348:28:27:72:484:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:analyse the source of inefficiency, which also does not consider the super efficiency.  
11:288:18435:27:28:93:526:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Mohd et al. (2015) proposed an enhanced risk adjusted efficiency model based on the 
11:289:18519:28:28:72:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:DDF DEA approach developed by Skevas et al. (2014) that also includes climatic variability 
11:290:18610:28:27:72:527:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and used interval data approach to represent uncertainty data will be developed, called “Risk 
11:291:18704:27:28:72:527:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Adjusted  Interval  DEA  Model  with  Undesirable  Outputs  and  Climatic  Variability 
11:292:18791:28:27:72:139:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Conditions”.  
11:293:18804:27:28:93:526:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Furthermore through using an environmental intensity index, the economy can expand 
11:294:18887:28:28:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:without  compromising  the  environment  (Wursthorn  et  al.  2011).  The  general  concept  of 
11:295:18983:28:27:72:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Halkos  et  al.  (2015)  model  is  similar  to  Zaim’s  (2004)  who  applied  directional  distance 
11:296:19084:27:28:72:526:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:functions and constructed two indices. The first index is an economic one in which inputs are 
11:297:19178:28:0:72:527:96:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:used  to  produce  economic  outputs  while  the  second  environmental  index  uses  economic 
12:298:19275:0:28:72:525:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:output to produce undesirable environmental outputs. The ratio of these two indices is used in 
12:299:19370:28:28:72:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:order  to  acquire  the  pollution  intensity  index.  Chen  et  al.  (2012)  also  constructed  a 
12:300:19469:28:27:72:527:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:sustainability index consisting of ‘industrial design module’ and ‘bio design module’ in their

12:303:19628:28:27:72:164:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:3. Discussion 
12:304:19640:27:28:93:526:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:As described in the previous section, researchers have widely focused on how they can 
12:305:19726:28:27:72:526:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:treat undesirable outputs in DEA in order to take them into consideration in the production 
12:306:19818:27:28:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:function. The methods presented above show that researchers are divided in their approaches 
12:307:19910:28:27:72:527:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and under different scenarios different techniques might seem more appropriate than others. 
12:308:20002:27:28:72:527:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The first approach of simply ignoring undesirable outputs is disregarded by most authors as it 
12:309:20097:28:28:72:421:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:does not make sense to simply ignore those and pretend they don't exist. 
12:310:20169:28:27:93:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:The second approach of treating undesirable outputs as inputs which  has been widely 
12:311:20254:27:28:72:527:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:used in research. Even so these perspectives have been criticised by academics (Hailu and 
12:312:20344:28:27:72:526:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Veeman, 2001; Fare and Grosskopf, 2003; Hailu, 2003). The central theme of this critique is 
12:313:20436:27:28:72:527:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the ‘operationalization of weak disposability in empirical production analysis’ (Kuosmanen, 
12:314:20528:28:28:72:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:2005).  In  those  regards  Kuosmanen  (2005)  pointed  out  that  the  common  specification  of 
12:315:20626:28:27:72:526:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:weak  disposability  implicitly  assumes  that  all  DMUs  in  the  sample  apply  a  uniform 
12:316:20720:27:28:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:abatement factor. Moreover Fare and Grosskopf (2003) mention some drawbacks but at the 
12:317:20807:28:27:72:527:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:same time acknowledge that this approach is quite appealing and useful. The first is the free 
12:318:20901:27:28:72:525:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:disposability assumption, since in reality unlimited increases in an undesirable output are not 
12:319:20997:28:28:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:technically  possible.  Secondly  when  assessing  power  plants  or  energy  sectors  from  a 
12:320:21092:28:27:72:527:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:microeconomic perspective, the linkage between fuels, power and emissions should hold, as 
12:321:21182:27:0:72:281:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:emphasised by Fare and Grosskopf (2005). 
13:322:21224:0:28:93:526:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:A  further  approach  is  treating  those  undesirable  outputs  as  normal  outputs  in  the 
13:323:21318:28:28:72:527:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:production function. In those regards a direct approach is applied whereas both desirable and 
13:324:21412:28:27:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable outputs are treated in their actual format. With the use of DDF it is possible to 
13:325:21506:27:28:72:525:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:reduce the undesirable outputs based on a given direction vector (Chung et al., 1997). This 
13:326:21598:28:27:72:527:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:type  of  DEA  approaches  has  been  widely  used  in  environmental  efficiency  assessments

13:328:21750:28:28:93:526:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:There have been some objections to the weak disposability model such as those raised by 
13:329:21838:28:27:72:527:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Hailu  and  Veeman  (2001)  that  “the  weakly  disposable  approach  leaves  the  impact  of 
13:330:21932:27:28:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:undesirable  outputs  on  efficiency undetermined”,  whereas  Fare  and  Grosskopf  (2003) 
13:331:22023:28:27:72:527:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:responded that they disagree as the weakly disposable DEA model is consistent with physical 
13:332:22115:27:28:72:527:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:laws  and  it  allows  the  treatment  of  undesirable  outputs  showing  the  opportunity  cost  of 
13:333:22216:28:28:72:149:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:reducing them.  
13:334:22231:28:27:93:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Finally another option is to transform the undesirable outputs and several methods to do 
13:335:22320:27:28:72:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:this  have  been  presented  in  section  2.4.  By  using  the  outputs’  reciprocals  another 
13:336:22415:28:27:72:527:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:transformation is possible as suggested by Lovell et al. (1995). This approach has also been 
13:337:22508:27:28:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:used  by  Ramanathan  (2006)  who  used  the  reciprocal  of  the  CO2  outputs  in  his  study.  A 
13:338:22608:28:28:72:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:further transformation has been proposed by Seiford and Zhu (2001, 2005) which assumes 
13:339:22695:28:27:72:527:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:strong disposability for all the variables including the transformed undesirable outputs. Data 
13:340:22790:27:28:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:translation has also been used by Lu and Lo (2007) in their study of regional development in 
13:341:22883:28:27:72:526:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:China and by Wang et al. (2014) for the needs of their two-stage DEA model. New models 
13:342:22970:27:28:72:527:207:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:have  also  been  put  forward  recently  in  treating  undesirable  outputs.  These  have  not  been 
13:343:23072:28:28:72:372:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:widely tested yet, so it is not possible to ascertain their value.  
13:344:23139:28:27:93:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:As  it  has  come  forward  from  the  previous  analysis  the  decision  to  use  each  method 
13:345:23235:27:0:72:527:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:depends on the user and each analysis he/she intends to perform. There is no straightforward 
14:346:23330:0:28:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:answer in which method to use as each one has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore 
14:347:23420:28:28:72:501:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:every researchers should consider first what he/she wants to achieve from their analysis.

14:349:23510:27:28:72:168:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:4. Conclusion 
14:350:23522:28:27:93:527:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Treating  undesirable  outputs  has  been  proven  to  be  quite  a  challenge  for  researchers 
14:351:23619:27:28:72:526:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:working on DEA. Four possible options have been presented in the previous sections along 
14:352:23708:28:28:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:with  some  new  model  propositions  that  could  be  of  use.  To  conclude  the  four  most 
14:353:23803:28:27:72:388:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:commonly used methods in treating undesirable outputs include:  
14:354:23866:27:28:93:324:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:1. ignoring them from the production function,  
14:355:23913:28:27:93:260:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:2. treating them as regular inputs,  
14:356:23949:27:28:93:284:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:3. treating them as normal outputs and  
14:357:23988:28:28:93:420:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:4. performing necessary transformations to take them into account.  
14:358:24055:28:27:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:As such each method has its benefits and drawbacks which each researcher should take into 
14:359:24144:27:28:72:526:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:account at every stage of their research and assess which method is more appropriate to be
