2:26:1286:28:28:306:339:616:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:27:1294:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We use a new firm level data set that establishes the location, ownership, and activity of 650,000 multinational
2:28:1406:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:subsidiaries -- close to a comprehensive picture of global multinational activity. A number of patterns
2:29:1509:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:emerge from the data. Most foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs between rich countries. The share
2:30:1608:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:of vertical FDI (subsidiaries which provide inputs to their parent firms) is larger than commonly thought,
2:31:1714:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:even within developed countries. More than half of all vertical subsidiaries are only observable at
2:32:1813:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:the four-digit level because the inputs they are supplying are so proximate to their parent firms' final
2:33:1917:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:good that they appear identical at the two-digit level. We call these proximate subsidiaries 'intra-industry'
2:34:2026:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:vertical FDI and find that their location and activity are significantly different to the inter-industry
2:35:2130:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:vertical FDI visible at the two-digit level. These subsidiaries are not readily explained by the comparative
2:36:2238:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:advantage considerations in traditional models, where firms locate their low skill production stages
2:37:2338:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:abroad in low skill countries to take advantage of factor cost differences. We find that overwhelmingly,
2:38:2442:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:multinationals tend to own the stages of production proximate to their final production giving rise
2:39:2541:14:28:72:311:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:to a class of high-skill intra-industry vertical FDI.

3:52:2795:0:23:93:167:714:107:Times:107:Times:C:1   Introduction  
3:53:2813:23:18:127:521:691:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:In this paper we use a unique firm-level data set to analyze one of the enduring puzzles of the 
3:54:2909:18:18:93:521:673:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:literature  on  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI).  Traditionally,  the  literature  has  distinguished  between  
3:55:3024:18:18:93:522:655:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:two  forms  of—and  motivations  for—multinational  firms  to  locate  their  activities  abroad.    Whereas  
3:56:3134:18:18:93:521:637:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:“horizontal” FDI is understood as locating production to be closer to customers and avoid trade costs 
3:57:3236:18:17:93:522:619:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(Markusen,  1984;  Brainard,  1993),  “vertical”  FDI  represents  firms'  attempts  to  take  advantage  of  
3:58:3346:17:18:93:521:602:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:cross-border  factor  cost  differences  (Helpman,  1984;  Helpman  and  Krugman,  1985).    Most  research  
3:59:3455:18:18:93:522:584:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:has  found  that  the  bulk  of  FDI  is  horizontal.  Our  results  suggest  that,  due  to  data  limitations,  the  
3:60:3574:18:18:93:522:566:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:literature  has  systematically  under-estimated  vertical  FDI,  which,  with  our  dataset,  emerges  as  far  
3:61:3687:18:18:93:264:548:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:more prevalent than previously thought.  
3:62:3728:18:18:127:524:530:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  build  on  other  recent  findings  that  challenge  the  conventional  wisdom  about  the  
3:63:3824:18:17:93:521:512:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:dominance of horizontal FDI. Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2001, 2005) and Yeaple (2003), using 
3:64:3922:17:18:93:520:495:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:data on U.S. multinational activities, find strong evidence of vertical FDI. Moreover, using firm level 
3:65:4026:18:18:93:521:477:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:trade data for the U.S., Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006) find the proportion of intra-firm trade to be 
3:66:4132:18:18:93:522:459:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:higher  between  rich  countries  than  between  rich  and  poor  countries,  further  evidence  of  important  
3:67:4244:18:18:93:317:441:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:multinational vertical activity between rich countries. 
3:68:4300:18:18:127:522:423:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The  central  challenge  to  date  for  the  literature  has  been  the  absence  of  firm-level  data  to  
3:69:4408:18:18:93:522:405:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:distinguish  properly  among  the  types  of  and  motivations  for  FDI.  The  ideal  data  to  examine  these  
3:70:4521:18:17:93:520:387:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:theories would consist of detailed plant level information about the location, ownership and intra-firm 
3:71:4625:17:18:93:521:370:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:trading status of multinational enterprises.1 Researchers have instead used aggregate FDI flows from 
3:72:4726:18:18:93:520:352:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:balance-of-payments statistics as a proxy for MNC activity. A consistent finding based on such data is 
3:73:4829:18:18:93:521:334:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:that models assuming low transport costs and comparative advantage are rejected in favor of models 
3:74:4928:18:18:93:521:316:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:in  which  market  access  issues  arise  (see  Carr,  Markusen,  and  Maskus  (2001,  2003),  Markusen  and  
3:75:5038:18:18:93:447:298:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Maskus, (2001, 2002), Blonigen, Davies, and Head  (2003),  Brainard (1993, 1997)). 
3:76:5121:18:18:127:521:280:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:With a new firm-level dataset provided by Dun & Bradstreet, however, we are able to present 
3:77:5213:18:17:93:518:262:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:a much more comprehensive and nuanced picture of global multinational activity.  In fact, with firm-
3:78:5313:17:18:93:521:245:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:level data on more than 650,000 multinational subsidiaries in 90 countries and 400 industries, we can 
3:79:5415:18:18:93:523:227:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:identify  the  location,  ownership,  and  product  (at  the  four  digit  level)  for  each  subsidiary.    This  
3:80:5530:18:18:93:523:209:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:remarkably  detailed  picture  of  global  investment  patterns  is,  to  our  knowledge,  the  first  detailed  
3:81:5643:18:18:93:521:191:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:characterization of global firm-level multinational activity. The limitation of our dataset is that we do 
3:82:5749:18:28:93:521:173:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:not observe inter-plant trade within multinational firms. Instead we distinguish horizontal and vertical 
3:83:5854:28:7:93:232:145:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
3:84:5902:7:15:93:520:138:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:1 From this data, horizontal FDI could be identified as those establishments that are owned by a foreign parent, 
3:85:6015:15:10:93:522:123:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:produce  the  same  products  as  that  parent,  but  sell  them  in  their  local  market,  while  vertical  FDI  could  be  
3:86:6141:10:11:93:521:113:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:identified  as  establishments  that  are  owned  by  a  foreign  parent,  produce  products  that  are  intermediate  inputs  
3:87:6268:11:11:93:520:102:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:into the parent’s production, and exports those inputs to the parent country.  This is a big ask of any dataset, but 
3:88:6385:11:11:93:520:91:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:is especially difficult in the context of multinational firms. While there are several national databases of inward 
3:89:6501:11:11:93:521:80:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:and  outward  foreign  investment  at  the  firm  level,  there  is  little  in  the  way  of  a  global  source  of  information  
3:90:6632:11:0:93:351:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:which includes multinational corporations of multiple nationalities.  
4:91:6701:0:18:93:521:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:FDI using a combination of product information and input-output matrices.  We classify a horizontal 
4:92:6801:18:18:93:522:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiary  as  a  plant  owned  by  a  foreign  parent  in  the  same  product  code  as  that  parent,  while  a  
4:93:6917:18:17:93:522:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical  subsidiary  is  a  plant  owned  by  a  foreign  parent  producing  products  that  are  inputs  into  the  
4:94:7035:17:18:93:418:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:parent's product.  The accuracy of this method is verified in a variety of ways. 
4:95:7116:18:18:127:523:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Some  of  our  plant–level  findings  require  significant  reconsideration  of  the  conventional  
4:96:7216:18:18:93:522:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:wisdom.  First,  consistent  with  the  existing  literature,  we  find  that  the  bulk  of  multinational  activity  
4:97:7335:18:18:93:523:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:occurs  between  the  rich  nations  of  the  world.  Second,  at  the  2  digit  industry  level  we  observe  
4:98:7447:18:18:93:521:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:considerably more horizontal FDI (subsidiaries in the same industry as their parent) than vertical FDI 
4:99:7550:18:18:93:521:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(subsidiaries which supply their parent with inputs). However, after disaggregating to the 4 digit level 
4:100:7655:18:17:93:521:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:it is clear that many of the foreign subsidiaries in the same 2 digit industry as their parent are in fact 
4:101:7762:17:18:93:520:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:producing highly specialized inputs into their parents’ production, namely, most of vertical activity is 
4:102:7867:18:18:93:521:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:in sectors close to the parent firm. That is, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find the number 
4:103:7969:18:18:93:521:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:of vertical multinational (MNC) subsidiaries to be larger than commonly thought. We find important 
4:104:8068:18:18:93:523:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical  activity  in  terms  of  both  the  number  of  subsidiaries  (112,939  vertical  versus  104,057  
4:105:8177:18:18:93:523:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:horizontal  subsidiaries)  and  the  number  of  employees  (15.8  million  versus  11.9  million).2  These  
4:106:8286:18:18:93:301:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:patterns prevail even within developed countries.  
4:107:8337:18:17:127:520:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The most striking empirical finding is that a significant amount of vertical FDI may have been 
4:108:8432:17:18:93:518:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:previously  misclassified  as  horizontal FDI for three reasons. First, since much vertical FDI is north-
4:109:8537:18:18:93:521:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:north,  it  has  been  assumed  to  be  market  seeking  (horizontal)  when  in  fact,  firm  level  data  indicates  
4:110:8655:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:that  these  are  vertical  relationships,  i.e.,  parent  firms  sourcing  inputs  from  their  subsidiaries  in  other  
4:111:8777:18:18:93:521:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:developed countries. Second, skill differences between parent and subsidiaries are small (even within 
4:112:8879:18:18:93:521:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical FDI) which also lends support to horizontal motivations of foreign activity.3 Third, we show 
4:113:8981:18:17:93:521:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:that  the  vertical  nature  of  these  relationships  is  missed  at  the  2  digit  level  (and  visible  only  at  the  4  
4:114:9107:17:18:93:521:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:digit  level  for  example)  since  many  subsidiaries  are  supplying  goods  to  their  parents  where  both  the

4:116:9284:18:18:127:521:268:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We call these subsidiaries unveiled at higher levels of disaggregation ‘intra-industry  vertical

4:118:9495:18:18:93:522:232:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:industry  codes  (‘inter-industry  vertical  FDI’).  In  particular,  intra-industry  vertical  subsidiaries  are  
4:119:9610:18:18:93:522:214:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:generally  supplying  their  parent  firms  with  high-skill  products  and  a  large  proportion  of  them  are  
4:120:9724:18:17:93:521:196:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:located in high-skill countries. Both inter- and intra-industry subsidiaries are vertical in the sense that 
4:121:9832:17:18:93:521:179:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:they are providing inputs to their parent firms, but intra-industry FDI is much harder to explain with

5:132:10936:18:18:93:520:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the two digit level we find strong evidence that vertical FDI is driven by comparative advantage, i.e., 
5:133:11040:18:17:93:520:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:low skill activities tend to be located in low skill countries. However, when we move to the four digit 
5:134:11144:17:18:93:518:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:level to examine those ‘intra-industry’ foreign-owned subsidiaries that are in the same two and three-
5:135:11246:18:18:93:523:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:digit  industry  as  their  parents,  but  in  a  four  digit  industry  which  is  an  input  into  their  parents’  
5:136:11364:18:18:93:512:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:production, we find significantly less evidence that vertical FDI is driven by comparative advantage. 
5:137:11466:18:18:127:522:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The  example  of  the  General  Motors  Corporation  highlights  the  usefulness  of  distinguishing

5:139:11670:18:18:93:520:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:our data we observe that General Motors Corporation has 2,248 entities which report it as their ‘global

5:149:12742:18:18:93:521:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:France. The average skill intensity of the industries of GM subsidiaries is not significantly different in 
5:150:12849:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:rich  and  poor  countries.7  Strikingly,  the  set  of  GM’s  foreign  subsidiaries  does  not  include  any  firms  
5:151:12967:18:18:93:523:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:producing  what  might  be  called  the  ‘raw  materials’  or  ‘low  skill  inputs’  into  the  production  of  
5:152:13079:18:18:93:522:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:automobiles.  That  is  not  to  say  that  these  inputs  are  not  produced,  but  rather  that  they  are  produced  
5:153:13199:18:17:93:520:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:outside the boundaries of GM’s multinational network. If the production of automobiles is fragmented 
5:154:13300:17:18:93:522:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:into  ‘stages  of  production’  from  raw  materials  to  intermediate  inputs  to  final  goods,  then  GM’s  
5:155:13411:18:18:93:446:286:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:‘vertical FDI’ is focussed on the penultimate stages in the vertical production chain.  
5:156:13499:18:18:127:521:268:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Finally,  these  empirical  findings  serve  as  the  inspiration  for  a  novel  explanation  for  patterns  
5:157:13609:18:18:93:525:250:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:of   FDI   that   have,   before   the   availability   of   these   data,   been   misclassified   and   therefore   
5:158:13727:18:18:93:522:232:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:mischaracterized.    We  argue  that  multinational  firms  have  tended  to  embrace  vertical  FDI  for  high  
5:159:13840:18:18:93:521:214:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:skill and later stages of production and arms-length transactions for lower-skill inputs and processes. 
5:160:13944:18:17:93:520:196:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Vertical FDI is the result of a combination of two decisions by a parent firm: to source an input from 
5:161:14047:17:18:93:521:179:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:abroad and to source it from within the boundaries of the firm (rather than to purchase them from an 
5:162:14148:18:26:93:521:161:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:unaffiliated foreign firm). Recent contributions to the theory of outsourcing have suggested that these

5:164:14300:7:15:93:521:128:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:4 The Dun and Bradstreet data has detailed ownership information. Each firm reports a local owner (‘domestic 
5:165:14409:15:7:93:516:113:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:ultimate’) as well as a global parent (‘global ultimate’) which is the highest entity in the multinational network.  
5:166:14526:7:11:93:462:106:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:5 The non-manufacturing subsidiaries are primarily dealerships, credit, and insurance institutions. 
5:167:14626:11:11:93:346:95:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:6 And other parts of the world. Note this information is as of 1999. 
5:168:14695:11:15:93:520:84:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:7 Skill intensity is measures as the ratio of non-production to production workers: 0.17 and 0.16 in rich and poor 
5:169:14810:15:0:93:493:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:countries (defined as countries with GPD per capital of less than ten thousand U.S. dollars) respectively.   
6:170:14920:0:18:93:520:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:decisions relate to the characteristics of the two countries and the characteristics of the products being 
6:171:15027:18:18:93:521:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:produced.8  Our  strongest  stylized  fact  is  that  parent  firms  choose  to  own  the  stage  in  the  production  
6:172:15146:18:17:93:523:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:process  which  is  closest  to  their  own.  We  argue  that  a  coexistent  and  correlated  motivation  for  
6:173:15258:17:18:93:523:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:bringing  an  input  inside  the  boundary  of  the  firm  relates  not  only  to  its  characteristics  or  the  
6:174:15372:18:18:93:494:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:Times:B:characteristics of the country in which it is produced, but to its position in the production chain.  
6:175:15473:18:18:127:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Although  our  data  does  not  allow  for  a  complete  analysis  of  a  firm’s  decision  to  undertake  
6:176:15580:18:18:93:524:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:arm-length  transactions  via  (outsourcing)  versus  FDI,  our  evidence—together  with  that  of  the  
6:177:15685:18:18:93:523:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:literature’s—suggests  that  early  stages  of  production  associated  with  raw/unskilled  produces  are  
6:178:15793:18:18:93:521:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:undertaken via trade (see Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006)). As mentioned, the activities of parents 
6:179:15896:18:17:93:521:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:are closely related to the activities of their children (i.e., most parents and children share the same 2

6:181:16120:18:18:93:523:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:suggest  that  parents  choose  to  own  those  of  their  suppliers  which  conduct  proximate  stages  of  
6:182:16229:18:18:93:522:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:production  rather  than  earlier  stages  or  the  production  of  raw  materials.  Different  rationales  may  
6:183:16342:18:18:93:521:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:explain  why  firms  choose  to  own  these  proximate  stages  of  production.9  Given the data limitations, 
6:184:16452:18:18:93:521:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:fully explaining why firms choose to own the proximate stages of production is beyond the scope of 
6:185:16551:18:18:93:522:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:this  paper.10    However,  we  present  evidence  that  the  patterns  of  vertical  foreign  direct  investment  
6:186:16666:18:17:93:523:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(FDI)  may  relate  to  the  position  of  various  inputs  in  the  production  process.  We  construct  a  new  
6:187:16780:17:18:93:523:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:variable  which  captures  the  proximity  of  two  products  in  a  vertical  production  chain  using  the  
6:188:16890:18:18:93:521:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:proportion  of  the  intermediate  product  used  directly  in  the  final  good  (i.e.,  raw  materials  have  low  
6:189:17007:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:proximity  variables).  We  find  that  the  average  proximity  between  two  industries  is  higher  for  parent  
6:190:17123:18:18:93:521:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiary  pairs  indicating  that  parents  are  more  likely  to  own  their  proximate  inputs.  We  also  show  
6:191:17240:18:18:93:521:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:that the position of intermediate inputs in the chain of production explains the pattern of intra-industry 
6:192:17347:18:17:93:521:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:FDI  with  goods  closer  to  raw  materials  being  less  likely  to  be  the  subject  of  FDI  than  intermediate  
6:193:17465:17:18:93:284:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:goods which are proximate to the final good.  
6:194:17511:18:18:127:524:286:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Our   results   have   several   important   implications.   One   is   associated   with   the   level   of   
6:195:17622:18:18:93:521:268:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:aggregation.  Important  elements  of  the  pattern  of  foreign  direct  investment  are  missed  at  the  2  digit

6:199:18014:7:15:93:520:203:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:8 Grossman and Helpman (2003, 2005) emphasize the role of the contract enforcement in the country; Bernard, 
6:200:18122:15:10:93:523:188:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:Jensen,  and  Schott  (2006)  use  a  measure  of  contractibility;  in  Antras  (2003),  product  capital  intensity  and  
6:201:18246:10:7:93:350:178:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:country capital abundance are positively related to intra-firm trade.  
6:202:18317:7:15:93:521:171:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:9 The activities involved in producing proximate inputs have more in common with the production of the final 
6:203:18426:15:11:93:520:156:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:good than do the activities involved in the production of raw materials due to information advantages associated 
6:204:18539:11:11:93:520:145:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:with the co-ownership of these later stages. In addition, firms may worry about their intellectual property when 
6:205:18652:11:11:93:520:134:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:the good is closer to their final good or parent firms may wish to “own” the penultimate stages of the production 
6:206:18766:11:10:93:522:123:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:process  because  it  gives  them  a  monitoring  advantage  over  arms  length  transactions.  Bernard,  Redding,  and

7:213:19524:18:18:93:521:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:more  disaggregated  data  to  understand  firm’s  location  decisions.  Second,  our  analysis  suggests  that  
7:214:19637:18:17:93:521:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:intrafirm trade and foreign investment activity may be better explained by more complex production 
7:215:19736:17:18:93:522:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:processes  involving  several  stages  and  decisions  about  not  only  where  to  source  inputs  but  also  
7:216:19847:18:18:93:386:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:whether to source them from inside or outside the firms boundaries.11  
7:217:19918:18:18:127:523:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Firms’  motivations  to  undertake  multinational  activity  have  long  been  recognized  to  be  
7:218:20017:18:18:93:521:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:complex.  This debate matters as the different motivations differ on how multinational activity affects 
7:219:20121:18:18:93:521:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:factor  incomes  within  and  across  countries.    If  FDI  is  sensitive  to  relative  factor  prices  it  could  put  
7:220:20243:18:18:93:522:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:downward  pressures  on  wages.  That  is,  vertical  FDI  operates  as  a  complement  to  trade  and  hence  
7:221:20354:18:17:93:520:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:multinational activity may reduce absolute wage differences across countries and alter relative wages 
7:222:20456:17:18:93:522:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:within  countries.  Horizontal  FDI,  on  the  other  hand,  substitutes  for  trade  and  hence  multinational  
7:223:20569:18:18:93:521:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:activity may raise income in each country without necessarily changing its distribution.  Our findings 
7:224:20672:18:18:93:521:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:suggest that intra-industry FDI could also have small effects on income distribution, as it seems to be 
7:225:20776:18:18:93:480:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:driven primarily by proximity considerations rather than cross-border factor cost differences. 
7:226:20871:18:18:127:521:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents 
7:227:20967:18:18:93:522:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  patterns  of  vertical  and  horizontal  FDI  in  the  data.  Section  4  investigates  the  determinants  of

7:230:21188:29:18:127:524:365:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  use  data  from  WorldBase,  a  database  containing  more  than  43  million  firm  level  
7:231:21284:18:18:93:521:347:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:observations  in  more  than  213  countries  and  territories  compiled  by  Dun  and  Bradstreet  for  2005.12 
7:232:21396:18:18:93:523:329:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:WorldBase  is  the  core  database  with  which  Dun  and  Bradstreet  populates  its  commercial  data

7:244:22630:11:11:93:522:91:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:activities  being  more  skill  intensive  and  others  more  labor  intensities;  see  Hanson,  Mataloni,  and  Slaugther

8:249:23034:18:17:127:522:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Importantly,  the  unit  of  observation  in  WorldBase  is  the  establishment  rather  than  the  firm.  
8:250:23141:17:18:93:522:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Establishments  like  firms  have  their  own  addresses,  business  names,  and  managers,  but  might  be

8:267:24562:29:18:127:521:318:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We describe an establishment as foreign owned if it satisfies two criteria: it must report to a 
8:268:24658:18:18:93:521:300:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:global parent firm and that parent firm must be in a different country. Parents are defined in the data 
8:269:24762:18:18:93:521:282:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:as entities which have legal and financial responsibility for another firm. Combining the location and 
8:270:24865:18:18:93:521:264:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:ownership information, it is possible to identify 72,978 parent firms which have 625,427 affiliates in

8:284:26149:11:0:99:291:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F: This data comes primarily from national sources.  
9:285:26201:0:18:93:521:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:several differences between our data and the UNCTAD data. First, our data is at the plant level, while 
9:286:26304:18:18:93:520:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:their data is at the firm level. Thus we have a similar number of firms as they do in the US, but more 
9:287:26407:18:17:93:521:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:plants.  The  analysis  we  undertake  requires  plant  level  data.    Second,  UNCTAD  data  is  inflated  by  a  
9:288:26523:17:18:93:521:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:huge number of Chinese observations (424 196). This represents all approved FDI projects registered 
9:289:26623:18:18:93:417:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:by the Chinese, but is an overestimate of the number of actual foreign firms.   
9:290:26703:18:18:127:522:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  also  compare  the  U.S.  owned  subsidiaries  in  the  WorldBase  data  with  information  on

9:295:27220:17:18:93:521:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:data indicates that the sum of all sales (employment) by foreign establishments reporting U.S. parents 
9:296:27323:18:18:93:522:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:was  $2,795b  (10.07  million  employees).  Not  only  is  the  total  similar,  but  the  distribution  across  
9:297:27436:18:18:93:520:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:countries is also consistent. Figure 1a plots the total sales (by country) of the foreign affiliates of U.S.

11:443:31743:18:18:93:521:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:contrast,  firms  engage  in  vertical  FDI  (VDFDI)  when  production  is  by  function—that  is,  when  they  
11:444:31855:18:17:93:522:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:break  the  value  added  chain.  Vertical  multinational  are  firms  that  geographically  separate  various  
11:445:31967:17:18:93:522:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:stages  of  production.  As  an  example,  a  firm  may  decide  to  put  all  of  its  production  of  a  particular  
11:446:32086:18:18:93:522:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:component  part  in  a  separate  foreign  plant.  Such  fragmentation  of  the  production  process  may  be  
11:447:32197:18:18:93:394:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:motivated by cost considerations arising from factor cost differences.22   
11:448:32272:18:18:127:521:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:In terms of studying the determinants of FDI, ideally one would like to separate the data into 
11:449:32367:18:18:93:522:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:horizontal  and  vertical  activities.  However,  this  is  difficult  as  the  distinction  is  not  always  clear-cut  
11:450:32488:18:18:93:521:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(not  all  division  of  production  can  be  neatly  packaged  as  horizontal  and  vertical)  and  the  exercise  is  
11:451:32608:18:17:93:520:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:practically very demanding of the data. In order to neatly divide the data, one would require firm-level 
11:452:32713:17:18:93:522:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:information  on  the  sales  and  on  the  purchases  of  inputs  by  foreign  subsidiaries.  Sales  need  to  be  
11:453:32828:18:18:93:520:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:classified according to their destination (sales to the local market, export to the home country, export 
11:454:32933:18:18:93:520:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:to other countries), and inputs according to whether they are used for further reprocessing or for resale 
11:455:33039:18:18:93:385:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:in the local market. Such data are generally not directly available.23     
11:456:33114:18:18:127:521:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001) describe a concept of vertical specialization which captures a 
11:457:33207:18:18:93:523:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:country’s  role  in  the  fragmentation  of  production  into  multiple  stages  involving  value  added  in  
11:458:33317:18:17:93:521:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:multiple  locations.  They  use  input-output  tables  to  measure  a  country’s  vertical  specialization  as  its  
11:459:33434:17:18:93:521:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:exports weighted by the share of imported inputs in its total output. Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter 
11:460:33536:18:18:93:522:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(2001,  2005)  analyze  vertical  production  using  firm  level  data  from  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Economic  
11:461:33647:18:18:93:522:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Analysis (BEA). The BEA records information  about  subsidiaries  of  U.S.  parent  firms  including  the  
11:462:33754:18:18:93:521:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:volume  of  intermediate  goods  imported  from  their  parents.  They  characterize  vertical  production  as  
11:463:33866:18:18:93:520:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:intra-firm flows of inputs which they observe flowing from parents in the U.S. to subsidiaries in other 
11:464:33970:18:17:93:431:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:countries. This enables them to observe one-way U.S. bilateral intra firm trade.    
11:465:34054:17:18:93:523:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:  We  combine  elements  of  both  of  these  definitions  and  calculate  bilateral  horizontal  and  
11:466:34157:18:18:93:521:286:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical FDI using firm ownership data and an input output matrix. For the purposes of analyzing the 
11:467:34258:18:18:93:521:268:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:D&B dataset, we define horizontal FDI as the activity of those foreign owned subsidiaries in the same 
11:468:34360:18:18:93:521:250:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:industry as their parent. Vertical FDI is the activity of foreign owned subsidiaries in industries which

11:473:34757:11:10:99:521:188:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:  Helpman  (1984)  and  Helpman  and  Krugman  (1985),  for  example,  model  multinational  firms  that  maintain  
11:474:34873:10:11:93:522:178:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:their  headquarters  in  one  country  but  manufacture  elsewhere  so  as  to  exploit  factor-price  differences  and

11:476:35025:7:15:93:520:160:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:23 As Barba Navaretti and Venables (2004) note, detailed firm level data with which to analyze the activities of 
11:477:35138:15:11:93:520:145:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:multinational corporations are not widely available, restricting firm level analyses to a few countries such as the 
11:478:35254:11:11:93:520:134:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:U.S. The BEA data on U.S. multinationals reports the extent to which subsidiaries export back to the U.S. It can 
11:479:35367:11:10:93:520:123:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:be reasonable assumed that plants exporting a large share of their output back to the U.S. are VFDI, while those 
11:480:35480:10:11:93:522:113:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:selling  locally  or  exporting  to  their  countries  are  HFDI.  Note,  however,  that  the  BEA  data  do  not  track  
11:481:35602:11:11:93:518:102:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:transactions  between  foreign  affiliates  of  a  given  parent  or  production  networks  involving  arm’s–length  inter-
11:482:35725:11:11:93:522:91:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:firm  transactions.  Thus,  the  data  do  not  allow  observing  the  processing  trade  between  foreign  affiliates  or  
11:483:35849:11:11:93:521:80:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:between U.S. parents and foreign entities that they do not own.  This implies that the data is not well suited to 
11:484:35963:11:0:93:428:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:examine production networks in their entirety or questions of optimal firm boundaries.    
12:485:36055:0:18:93:521:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:are upstream from their parent’s industry (according to the U.S. input output matrix). Foreign owned 
12:486:36156:18:18:93:523:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiaries  are  neither  vertical  nor  horizontal  if  they  satisfy  neither  of  these  criteria,  and  if  they  
12:487:36276:18:17:93:262:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:satisfy both we call them complex FDI.

12:494:36412:18:17:93:521:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:SIC codes of the subsidiary, and let P be the set of SIC codes of the parent. We use notation x → z  to 
12:495:36516:17:18:93:520:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:denote any element x being an input into an element z where x Є S and z Є P.  We define x → z if the 
12:496:36617:18:18:93:521:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:input output coefficient from the U.S. input output matrix is greater than a threshold level which we 
12:497:36719:18:21:93:278:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vary. We define an owned establishment as: 
12:498:36762:21:20:97:520:479:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:i. Horizontal if S and P share any element (if     x│x Є S ٧ x Є P) or if the sets are identical (if S=P)  
12:499:36868:20:18:94:521:459:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:ii. Vertical if any element of S is an input into any element of P (     x│ x → z  where x Є S and z Є 
12:500:36969:18:21:111:287:441:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:P) and if the sets are not identical (if S≠P) 
12:501:37015:21:18:97:521:420:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:i. Complex if they share any element (if     x│ x Є S ٧ x Є P) and if any element of S is an input into 
12:502:37118:18:20:111:513:402:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:any element of P (     x│ x → z  where x Є S and z Є P) and if the sets are not identical (if S≠P).  
12:503:37219:20:21:94:287:382:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:ii. Neither if none of these connections exist. 
12:504:37266:21:18:127:521:361:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Our methodology to identify vertical FDI (subsidiaries which provide inputs to their parents) 
12:505:37360:18:18:93:522:343:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:suffers  from  the  data  limitation  that  we  do  not  observe  intra  firm  trade.  Instead  we  infer  it  from  
12:506:37477:18:18:93:518:325:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:information  about  the  goods  produced  in  each  of  the  firm’s  establishments  and  the  aggregate  input-

12:508:37700:18:17:93:521:289:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:amount  of  data  for  many  countries  and  industries  and  we  do  not  have  to  worry  about  the  value  of

12:513:38249:18:18:93:523:200:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:of  assumptions.  First  we  use  an  input  output  matrix  to  determine  related  industries.  Given  the

13:528:39588:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:use  a  threshold  of  0.05  for  the  ‘total  requirements’  coefficient  (i.e.,  the  use  of  a  commodity  directly  
13:529:39709:18:18:93:521:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:and indirectly by an industry). We vary this between 0.01 and 0.1 and find that our results are robust.

13:537:40502:18:18:93:521:436:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:there  are  50,000  “complex”  subsidiaries.28  Careful  analysis  of  the  results  of  our  horiztonal  and  our  
13:538:40618:18:18:93:521:418:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical classification gives us considerable comfort that the methodology is capturing a supply chain

13:540:40769:18:17:127:521:382:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Appendix Table 1 shows that the most common horizontal pairs are Motor Vehicle Parts and

13:542:40957:18:18:93:523:347:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:and  Accessories.  Similarly,  Appendix  Table  2  reports  the  most  common  vertical  industry  pairs  
13:543:41063:18:18:93:521:329:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:identified by our methodology. The most common vertical industry pair is 122 Medicinal Chemicals 
13:544:41160:18:18:93:524:311:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:and  Botanical  Products  firms  (SIC  2833)  being  supplied  by  475  of  their  foreign  subsidiaries  
13:545:41266:18:18:93:522:293:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:producing  Pharmaceutical  Preparations  (subsidiary  industry  SIC  2834);  the  second  most  common  is  
13:546:41374:18:17:93:521:275:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:79 Speciality Cleaning, Polishing, and Sanitary Preparations firms (SIC 2834) being supplied by 278 
13:547:41474:17:18:93:521:258:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:of their owned foreign subsidiaries producing Soaps and Other Detergents, Except Speciality Cleaners

13:549:41686:18:18:93:521:222:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:without exception, clearly suppliers of inputs to the industries that our methodology pairs them with. 
13:550:41789:18:48:93:496:204:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:This gives us some initial comfort that our methodology is capturing supply chain relationships.

13:554:42100:11:10:99:521:123:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:  Here  and  henceforth  we  focus  on  the  manufacturing  subsidiaries  in  order  to  compare  our  findings  to  the  
13:555:42222:10:11:93:520:113:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:existing literature. We have also excluded “neither” subsidiaries from the analysis. There were 21725 “neither”

13:559:42537:11:0:99:424:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:  We exclude complex subsidiaries in the analysis that describes motives behind FDI.  
14:560:42625:0:18:93:523:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:  In  addition,  we  looked  at  our  results  at  the  firm  level  for  several  families  of  firms.  For  
14:561:42735:18:18:93:520:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:example, General Motors Corporation has 123 subsidiaries outside the United States in manufacturing 
14:562:42835:18:17:93:521:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:industries.29 Of these foreign manufacturing subsidiaries, 68 are ‘horizontal’ subsidiaries according to 
14:563:42940:17:18:93:521:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:our classification, (i.e., in the same primary 4 digit SIC code as their parent firm, GM SIC 3711 Motor 
14:564:43044:18:18:93:521:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Vehicles  and  Passenger  Car  Bodies)  and  using  the  U.S.  input  output  matrix  we  classify  another  42  
14:565:43157:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiaries  as  being  ‘vertical’  FDI  (i.e.,  in  industries  which  are  inputs  in  to  the  parent  industry).  In

14:567:43384:18:18:93:521:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:were:  Specialized  Auto  Parts  (SIC  3714),  e.g.,  GM  Strasbourg  which  produces  carburetors,  pistons,  
14:568:43495:18:18:93:520:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:rings, and valves in France; Vehicle engines (SIC 3519), e.g.,  Powertrain-Kaiserslautern in Germany; 
14:569:43597:18:17:93:520:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Electrical Equipment for Internal Combustion Engines (SIC 3694), e.g.,  Hughes Network Systems in 
14:570:43695:17:18:93:522:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Germany;  Vehicular  Lighting  Equipment  (SIC  3647),  e.g.,    General  Motors  Do  Brasil  LTDA;  and  
14:571:43801:18:18:93:340:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Steel Springs, Except Wire (SIC 3493), e.g.,  GM Canada.  
14:572:43859:18:18:127:521:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:An important concern in our methodology is that affiliates may not be shipping their products 
14:573:43953:18:18:93:521:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:back  to  their  parents’  country  but  instead  to  another  plant  in  the  same  country  or  to  a  third  country.  
14:574:44075:18:18:93:521:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:There are reasons to include these “export platform” subsidiaries in a study of vertical FDI since they 
14:575:44179:18:18:93:521:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:are to some degree motivated by the same comparative advantage considerations. However, they are 
14:576:44276:18:17:93:522:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:not  strictly  vertical  FDI  and  our  methodology  would  over-estimate  vertical  activity  if  we  did  not  
14:577:44389:17:18:93:522:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:exclude  them.  To  address  this  concern  we  performed  several  additional  exercises.  In  particular  we  
14:578:44501:18:18:93:521:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:eliminate any subsidiary which satisfies the definition of vertical FDI above, if the product produced 
14:579:44604:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:by that subsidiary is an input into any product produced by another subsidiary of the same parent firm 
14:580:44707:18:18:93:521:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:in  the  same  host  country.  For  example,  if  a  GM  subsidiary  is  producing  specialised  auto  parts  (SIC  
14:581:44823:18:18:93:521:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:3714) in Germany, and there is also a GM assembly factory in Germany (SIC 3711) then we exclude 
14:582:44919:18:17:93:521:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  parts  maker  from  our  vertical  sample,  on  the  assumption  that  it  may  be  providing  inputs  to  the  
14:583:45036:17:18:93:521:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:German assembler rather than shipping its output back to the United States. This process causes us to 
14:584:45138:18:18:93:445:286:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:eliminate just 4,378 vertical subsidiaries and does not materially change our results.  
14:585:45226:18:18:127:522:268:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:  Finally,  we  compared  the  patterns  of  vertical  and horizontal activity of U.S. affiliates in the 
14:586:45331:18:18:93:521:250:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:DNB  data  against  patterns  of  trade  and  related  party  trade  from  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau.30  Figure  4  
14:587:45447:18:18:93:521:232:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:below supports our contention that there is a large share of vertical FDI between rich countries. There 
14:588:45551:18:18:93:521:214:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:is a positive relationship between the level of development of each country and the proportion of the 
14:589:45653:18:17:93:447:196:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:goods exported to the United States in the form of intra-firm (or related party) trade.  
14:590:45742:17:18:127:520:179:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We also use the U.S. Census Bureau Data as a cross check on the DNB data. We find that the

14:594:46102:7:11:93:463:106:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:29 The non-manufacturing subsidiaries are primarily dealerships, credit, and insurance institutions 
14:595:46202:11:15:93:520:95:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:30 Related-party trade includes import transactions between parties with various types of relationships including

15:598:46534:0:18:93:522:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  two  data  sources  are  similar.  In  order  to  control  for  size  effects,  we  also  calculated  the  ratio  of  
15:599:46657:18:18:93:521:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical and horizontal sales of U.S. parents in the DNB data versus the ratio of related party imports

15:616:47081:29:18:127:523:353:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:A  consistent  finding  in  the  literature  is  that  models  assuming  low  transports  costs  and  
15:617:47183:18:17:93:520:335:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:comparative advantage (consistent with vertical models) are rejected by the data in favor of models in 
15:618:47286:17:18:93:521:318:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:which  market  access  issues  arise  (consistent  with  horizontal  models).31 Although recent evidence by

15:620:47503:18:18:93:521:282:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:that  MNCs  location  decisions  are  affected  by  comparative  advantage  considerations,  that  is,  by  the  
15:621:47616:18:18:93:521:264:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:desire  to  shift  production  activities  to  countries  in  which  factors  are  relatively  cheap,  there  has  been  
15:622:47737:18:18:93:522:246:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:consensus  that  the  overwhelming  proportion  of  FDI  is  horizontal.32  Markusen  and  Maskus  (2002)

15:627:48205:15:11:93:521:167:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:way  that  suggests  that  firms  are  exploiting  comparative  advantage.  Instead,  she  finds  that  that  FDI  is  high  in

16:722:49685:0:18:127:522:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  explain  the  discrepancy  between  our  results  and  the  previous  literature  by  showing  that  
16:723:49790:18:18:93:521:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the previous literature has misclassified a significant amount of vertical FDI as horizontal FDI. There 
16:724:49894:18:17:93:522:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:are  two  reasons  for  this.  First,  since  much  vertical  FDI  is  north-north,  it  has  been  assumed  to  be  
16:725:50011:17:18:93:521:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:market seeking (horizontal) when in fact, firm level data indicates that these are vertical relationships, 
16:726:50118:18:18:93:520:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:i.e., parent firms sourcing inputs from their subsidiaries in other northern countries. A large number of 
16:727:50224:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:our  vertical  FDIs  are  located  in  high-income  countries.  Just  9%  of  vertical  FDIs  are  located  in  poor  
16:728:50342:18:18:93:216:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:countries as seen in Table 1.  
16:729:50372:18:18:93:522:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:  Second,  the  vertical  nature  of  these  relationships  is  missed  at  the  2  digit  level  since  many  
16:730:50483:18:18:93:522:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiaries  are  supplying  goods  to  their  parents  where  both  the  input  and  the  final  good  are  in  the  
16:731:50602:18:17:93:522:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:same  2  digit  SIC  code.33  Many  of  these  vertical  firms  are  only  visible  at  the  4-digit  SIC  level.  The  
16:732:50722:17:18:93:521:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical nature of the ownership relationship is only apparent at low levels of industry disaggregation, 
16:733:50827:18:18:93:521:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:and would be missed at higher levels. Figure 5 shows that at two digits much of the vertical FDI we 
16:734:50927:18:18:93:523:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:observe  appears  to  be  horizontal  FDI  as  it  is  in  the  same  2-digit  industry  code  as  its  parent  and  
16:735:51044:18:18:93:521:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:highlights the number of observations lost when observing at smaller levels of aggregation. Figure 5 
16:736:51145:18:18:93:520:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:also indicates that about half of the vertical FDI we observe are not visible at the 2 digit level because 
16:737:51252:18:18:93:522:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:only  at  finer  levels  of  disaggregation  is  it  clear  that  these  subsidiearies  produce  inputs  for  their  
16:738:51369:18:17:93:522:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:parents’  products.  It  is  important  to  note  that  at  finer  levels  of  disaggregation  some  of  the  FDI  we  
16:739:51488:17:18:93:521:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:label Horizontal at the 4 digit level, may in fact be vertical. For this reason we think of our results as 
16:740:51595:18:18:93:521:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:an upper bound on the number of horizontal subsidiaries. We argue that the distinction between those 
16:741:51696:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical  investments  visible  at  the  2  and  4  digit  level  is  more  than  one  of  labelling—they  are  in  fact  
16:742:51818:18:29:93:476:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:different products where one is an input into the other (as evidenced by Appendix Table 1).

17:769:53324:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:as  a  whole,  it  is  striking  how  much  vertical  FDI  is  characterised  by  parents  and  subsidiaries  in  very

17:771:53548:18:18:93:521:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiaries are, by construction, bunched close to the 45 degree line but not on it while inter-industry 
17:772:53654:18:29:93:231:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:FDI is more widely distributed.

18:802:54527:30:17:127:521:388:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The  pattern  of  intra-industry  vertical  FDI  resolves  a  hitherto  puzzling  contradiction  between  
18:803:54633:17:18:93:521:371:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the FDI literature and the recent trade literature. The FDI literature has established that multinational 
18:804:54739:18:18:93:521:353:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiaries which supply their parents with intermediate goods will be located in poorer countries for 
18:805:54843:18:18:93:521:335:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  purpose  of  taking  advantage  of  low  factor  costs.  This  is  supported  by  empirical  evidence  in  the  
18:806:54960:18:18:93:521:317:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:FDI  literature  by  Yeaple  (2003)  and  Hanson,  Mataloni,  and  Slaughter  (2001,  2005)  who  find  that  
18:807:55070:18:18:93:524:299:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:MNCs’  vertical  location  decisions  are  affected  by  comparative  advantage  considerations.  The  
18:808:55173:18:18:93:522:281:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:empirical  implication  is  that  most  subsidiaries  providing  inputs  for  their  parents  will  be  located  in  
18:809:55290:18:17:93:522:263:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:poorer  countries  and  hence  intra-firm  trade  will  be  higher  between  rich  and  poor  countries  than  
18:810:55401:17:18:93:192:246:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:between rich countries. 
18:811:55425:18:18:127:521:228:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:This  conclusion  is  inconsistent  with  recent  findings  in  the  trade  literature.  Bernard,  Jensen,  
18:812:55533:18:18:93:521:210:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:and Schott (2006) find that in general, low income countries have low shares of intra-firm exports to 
18:813:55634:18:18:93:521:192:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the US, while high income countries generally report above average intra-firm imports to the U.S. (as 
18:814:55736:18:18:93:520:174:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:seen also in Figure 4). The authors report, for example, that imports from China are largely conducted 
18:815:55839:18:18:93:522:156:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:at  arms-length.  The  implication  of  their  results  from  intra-firm  trade  data  is  that  there  is  a  lot  of  
18:816:55959:18:17:93:521:138:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical FDI between rich countries. The conclusion of the trade literature is that across industries, low 
18:817:56066:17:18:93:522:121:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:shares  of  intra-firm  imports  are  associated  with  raw  materials,  early  stages  of  products  or  labor  
18:818:56179:18:0:93:521:103:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:intensive goods such as apparel and footwear. High shares of intra-firm imports are reported in capital 
19:819:56285:0:18:93:524:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:and  technology  intensive  industries  such  as  nuclear  reactors,  electrical  machinery  and  organic

19:824:56726:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:engaging in inter-industry FDI are more likely to be sourcing low skill inputs from low skill countries,

19:828:57150:18:17:93:522:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:across  industries,  low  share  of  intra-firm  imports  are  associated  with  raw  materials,  early  sages  of

19:835:57725:18:18:93:505:400:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:with several elements of the conventional wisdom regarding the patterns and determinants of FDI.  
19:836:57823:18:17:127:524:382:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The  horizontal  model  does  not  account  for  the  more  than  50  percent  of  multinational  
19:837:57921:17:18:93:521:365:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:subsidiaries which are in different industries to their parents and appear to be supplying their parents 
19:838:58026:18:18:93:521:347:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:with inputs. The standard vertical explanation, at least the established models of Helpman (1984) and 
19:839:58128:18:18:93:522:329:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Helpman  and  Krugman  (1985),  has  trouble  accounting  for  most  of  these  subsidiaries.  Because  so  
19:840:58236:18:18:93:522:311:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:many  of  them  are  in  rich  countries  and  high  skill  industries—their  location  does  not  seem  to  be  
19:841:58349:18:18:93:287:293:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:determined by the search for low factor costs.  
19:842:58397:18:17:127:518:275:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The  argument  that  we  present  in  the  next  subsection  is  that  the  pattern  of  north-north  intra-
19:843:58505:17:18:93:524:258:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:industry  vertical  FDI  is  explained  by  the  decision  to  source  certain  types  of  inputs  through  
19:844:58613:18:18:93:521:240:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:outsourcing and others through FDI. Using the findings of the trade data, we argue that, on average, 
19:845:58714:18:18:93:521:222:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:low skill inputs in poor countries are more likely to be outsourced, leaving us to observe FDI in high 
19:846:58817:18:18:93:521:204:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:skill countries where multinational firms have sought to access their high skill inputs from within the 
19:847:58921:18:18:93:521:186:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:firm.  As a conceptual point, vertical FDI is the result of a combination of two decisions by a parent 
19:848:59024:18:18:93:521:168:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:firm:  to  source  an  input  from  abroad  and  to  source  it  from  within  the  boundaries  of  the  firm  (rather  
19:849:59144:18:17:93:521:150:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:than  to  purchase  them  from  an  unaffiliated  foreign  firm).  Recent  literature  has  suggested  that  these  
19:850:59260:17:18:93:520:133:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:decisions relate to the characteristics of the two countries and the characteristics of the products being 
19:851:59367:18:18:93:521:115:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:produced. In terms of the arm-length versus in-sourcing decision/trade-off, the literature analyzing the 
19:852:59472:18:18:93:521:97:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:ability/capacity of firms to write contracts has focused on the characteristics of the specialized inputs 
19:853:59578:18:0:93:520:79:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(contractibility, capital intensity) and the characteristics of the country (capital abundance, capacity to 
20:854:59688:0:18:93:523:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:enforce).34  Our  observation  of  significant  intra-industry  vertical  FDI  is  also  consistent  with  these  
20:855:59802:18:18:93:521:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:recent  developments  in  the  literature  on  outsourcing.    One  reason  for  the  predominance  of  vertical  
20:856:59916:18:17:93:522:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:FDI  in  rich  countries  is  that  parent  firms  are  seeking  to  own  the  inputs  which  come  from  capital  
20:857:60031:17:18:93:501:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:abundent countries but they outsource their supply of inputs from less capital abundant countries.  
20:858:60131:18:18:127:521:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  argue  that  a  coexistent  motivation  for  bringing  an  input  inside  the  boundary  of  the  firm  
20:859:60239:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:relates not to its characteristics or the characteristics of the country in which it is produced, but to its 
20:860:60348:18:18:93:521:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:position in the production chain.  A strong stylised fact in our data is that parent firms choose to own 
20:861:60453:18:18:93:522:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  stage  in  the  production  process  which  is  closest  to  their  own.  As  mentioned,  the  activities  of  
20:862:60569:18:18:93:522:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:parents  are  closely  related  to  the  activities  of  their  children,  i.e.,  most  parents  and  subsidiaries  share  
20:863:60692:18:17:93:521:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  same  2  digit  and  even  3  digit  industry  codes.  Second,  the  differences  between  parent  and  child  
20:864:60808:17:18:93:521:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:skill levels are small. These two pieces of evidence suggest that parents choose to own those of their 
20:865:60911:18:18:93:521:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:suppliers which conduct proximate stages of production rather than earlier stages or the production of

20:868:61133:18:18:93:522:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:stages  of  production.  The  activities  involved  in  producing  proximate  inputs  have  more  in  common  
20:869:61243:18:18:93:523:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:with  the  production  of  the  final  good  than  do  the  activities  involved  in  the  production  of  raw  
20:870:61355:18:17:93:521:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:materials, so there are information advantages associated with the co-ownership of these later stages.35 
20:871:61459:17:18:93:521:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:In  addition,  firms  may  be  more  worried  about  their  intellectual  property  when  the  good  is  closer  to  
20:872:61576:18:18:93:522:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:their  final  good.  Also  parent  firms  may  wish  to  “own”  the  penultimate  stages  of  the  production  
20:873:61687:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:process because it gives them a monitoring advantage over arms length transactions. If firms are more 
20:874:61788:18:18:93:522:357:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:concerned  to  control  the  quality  of  their  intermediate  inputs  than  the  quality  of  their  raw  materials  
20:875:61906:18:18:93:523:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:which  will  be  further  transformed  in  later  stages,  then  they  may  choose  to  own  later  stages  of  
20:876:62018:18:17:93:270:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:production to maximize quality control.36  
20:877:62061:17:18:127:521:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We test both the importance of comparative advantage considerations in the determination of

20:887:62858:10:11:93:521:113:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:firm-product-level  “expertise.”  The  authors  find  that  in  liberalization  pressures  firms  to  focus  on  their  “core

20:889:63035:7:15:93:520:95:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:36 This argument relies on the assumption that low quality in a previous stage is more costly than low quality in 
20:890:63149:15:11:93:521:80:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:the later stage. More generally, the argument relates to the proximate process in the last stages of productions. 
20:891:63263:11:0:93:370:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:As mentioned, data by on intra-firm trade is consistent with our findings.

21:907:64907:18:18:127:523:444:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  follow  Yeaple  (2003)  and  focus  on  the  interaction  between  the  relative  skilled-labor

21:914:65566:29:18:127:521:291:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A: Table 3 presents the main results following equation (1), where we use a Tobit regression to 
21:915:65660:18:18:93:521:273:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:account  for  the  bilateral  country-industry  observations  where  no  FDI  is  observed.  In  Column  (1)  we

21:924:66607:7:15:93:520:117:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:37 Given our sample of countries, it is difficult to find industry trade costs by bilateral pair (as those used in the 
21:925:66726:15:11:93:520:102:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:literature using U.S data). Our objective is to present evidence of the facts we uncovered, not to undertake a full 
21:926:66842:11:7:93:266:91:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:fledged analysis of the determinants of FDI.   
21:927:66889:7:15:93:523:84:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:38  There  results  should  be  taken  with  caution  as  there  are  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  reduced-form  
21:928:67008:15:0:93:515:69:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:specifications. We use this methodology in order to compare our results to previous findings in the literature.

22:931:67332:18:17:93:523:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:dependent  variables,  respectively.  In  all  cases  we  obtain  similar  results.  The  interaction  term  of  
22:932:67445:17:18:93:523:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:country  skill  abundance  and  industry  skill  intensity  is  positive  and  significant.    In  terms  of  the

22:937:68022:18:18:93:522:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:equivalent  to  32%  of  the  mean  number  of  subsidiaries.  An  increase  in  the  subsidiary  country  skill

22:948:69098:18:18:93:521:375:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the fact that most FDI is in rich countries.  However, the interaction term is no longer significant. Is

22:950:69319:18:18:93:522:339:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:seems  to  suggest?  At  the  2  digit  level  (inter-industry  vertical  FDI)  we  find  similar  results  as  Yeaple  
22:951:69439:18:17:93:522:321:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:(2003),  that  is,  at  2  digits,  there  is  an  important  component  of  FDI  that  is  driven  by  comparative  
22:952:69556:17:18:93:521:304:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:advantage.  But  the  effect  is  much  weaker  at  the  4  digit level (where firms are sourcing intermediate 
22:953:69667:18:18:93:522:286:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:inputs).  When  we  replicate  the  analysis  at  the  4  digit  level,  we  find  that  the  comparative  advantage  
22:954:69785:18:18:93:522:268:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:variables  become  insignificant.  This  is  because  the  4-digit  FDI  is  more  proximate  (therefore  higher  
22:955:69899:18:18:93:521:250:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:skill and in richer countries). At 4 digits, we find that the FDI that is misclassified is not being driven 
22:956:70007:18:35:93:272:232:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:by comparative advantage considerations.

22:961:70371:18:18:93:521:115:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:two  different  input-output  coefficients:  both  the  Direct  Requirements  Coefficient  i.e.,  the  amount  of  
22:962:70486:18:18:93:524:97:107:g_d0_f1:107:Times:B:the  output  of  industry  i used  directly  as  an  input  into  industry  j  and  the  Total  Requirements  
22:963:70596:18:0:93:522:79:107:Times:107:g_d0_f1:B:Coefficient,  i.e,  the  total  amount  of  industry  i  used  either  directly  or  indirectly  in  the  production  of  
23:964:70720:0:18:93:521:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:industry j. Our measure of proximity is the ratio of direct/total requirements coefficients. The more of 
23:965:70825:18:18:93:522:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the  intermediate  product  used  directly  in  the  final  good  the  higher  the  proximity  variable,  i.e.,  raw  
23:966:70943:18:17:93:522:678:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:materials  have  low  proximity  variables.  This  variable  may  not  effectively  distinguish  between  two  
23:967:71054:17:18:93:521:661:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:early  stages  of  production  if  neither  of  them  produce  any  direct  inputs  into  the  final  good  (i.e.,  the  
23:968:71175:18:18:93:521:643:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:proximity  of  both  will  be  zero).  For  this  reason  we  also  create  an  alternative  variable  which  we  call  
23:969:71295:18:18:93:521:625:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:‘closeness.’  This  variable  is  simply  the  absolute  difference  between  the  four  digit  SIC  codes  of  the  
23:970:71412:18:18:93:520:607:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:two products. For example Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies (SIC 3711) has a closeness of 3 
23:971:71510:18:18:93:522:589:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:from  Motor  vehicle  parts  and  accessories  (SIC  3714)  and  a  closeness  of  246  from  Stamped  Body  
23:972:71619:18:18:93:521:571:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Parts  for  Passenger  Cars  (SIC  3465).  This  closeness  variable merely takes advantage of the fact that 
23:973:71728:18:17:93:443:553:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) groups similar industries together. 
23:974:71814:17:18:127:521:536:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We test whether the average proximity variable is higher for parent subsidiary pairs. As seen 
23:975:71908:18:18:93:521:518:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:in Table 4, we find that the average proximity between two industries is higher for parent subsidiary 
23:976:72010:18:18:93:521:500:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:pairs: on average across all industries the ratio is 0.06 and for the average parent-subsidiary pair it is 
23:977:72117:18:18:93:521:482:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:0.58  indicating  that  parents  are  more  likely  to  own  their  proximate  inputs.  We  also  find  a  positive  
23:978:72234:18:18:93:522:464:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:correlation  between  the  proximity  variable  and  the  skill  level  of  the  industry  (0.25)  suggesting,  as  
23:979:72350:18:18:93:523:446:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:expected,  that  raw  materials  have  lower  skill  levels  on  average.  We  also  find  that  the  average  
23:980:72461:18:17:93:521:428:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:proximity variable of subsidiaries in rich countries is higher than in poor countries, suggesting, again 
23:981:72566:17:18:93:467:411:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:as expected, that rich countries specialise in intermediate inputs relative to raw materials.  
23:982:72661:18:18:127:521:393:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We repeated the previous exercise at the 4 digit level adding in proximity variables and run an

23:987:73080:18:18:93:520:291:107:g_d0_f1:107:Times:B:of   the   subsidiary   and   parent.   We   used   as   proximity   variables   both   the   ratio   of   Direct 
23:988:73194:18:17:93:522:273:107:Times:107:g_d0_f1:B:Requirements/Total  Requirements  and  the  absolute  difference  in  the  4  digit  SIC  code  between  the  
23:989:73304:17:18:93:522:256:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:parent  and  the  subsidiary  (closeness).  Table  3  Columns  (8)  to  (12)  present  the  main  results.  The  
23:990:73417:18:18:93:523:238:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:proximity  variables  are  highly  positive  and  significant.  The  market  access  and  distance  variable  
23:991:73527:18:18:93:522:220:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:remain  significant  with  the  expected  sign.  We  find  that  proximity  is  a  significant  determinant  of  
23:992:73640:18:18:93:521:202:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical FDI. Multinational firms are more likely to own the stages of production closest to their final 
23:993:73745:18:18:93:521:184:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:good.    In  terms  of  the  economic  significance,  estimates  in  column  (8)  imply  that  an    increase  in  the  
23:994:73865:18:18:93:522:166:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:ratio  of  direct  to  total  IO  coefficients  between  two  industries  has  a  positive  effect  on  the  level  of  
23:995:73985:18:17:93:524:148:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical   multinational   activity   observed   between   those   industries;   a   movement   from   the   25th   
23:996:74101:17:18:93:521:131:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:percentile  to  the  75%  percentile  of  the  distribution  of  ratios  of  IO  coefficients  is  associated  with  an  
23:997:74222:18:18:93:522:113:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:increase  in  the  number  of  vertical  subsidiaries  between  those  industries  equivalent  to  36%  of  the  
23:998:74335:18:18:93:521:95:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:number of subsidiaries in the average industry pair.   When measuring proximity as the difference in 
23:999:74436:18:0:93:522:77:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:SIC  code,  estimates  in  column  (9)  imply  that  the  further  apart  two  SIC  codes  are,  the  less  vertical

24:1003:74797:34:29:93:159:644:107:Times:107:Times:C:5. Conclusions 
24:1004:74812:29:18:127:523:615:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:The  firm  level  data  in  this  paper  gives  close  to  a  comprehensive  picture  of  the  location,  
24:1005:74918:18:18:93:522:597:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:ownership,  and  activity  of  global  multinational  subsidiaries.    A  number  of  patterns  emerge  from  the  
24:1006:75033:18:18:93:522:579:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:data.  Most  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  occurs  between  rich  countries.  In  contrast  to  the  existing  
24:1007:75150:18:18:93:522:561:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:FDI  literature  we  find  that  the  share  of  vertical  FDI  is  larger  than  commonly  thought,  even  within  
24:1008:75266:18:18:93:184:543:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:developed countries.  
24:1009:75288:18:18:127:521:525:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We explain the discrepancy between our results and the previous literature by showing that a 
24:1010:75381:18:17:93:518:507:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:significant  amount  of  vertical  FDI  was  misclassified  as  horizontal  FDI  because  much  of  it  is  north-
24:1011:75495:17:18:93:521:490:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:north FDI between parent and subsidiaries in similarly skilled activities, and since more than half of 
24:1012:75598:18:18:93:523:472:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:all  vertical  subsidiaries  are  only  observable  at  the  four-digit  level  because  the  inputs  they  are  
24:1013:75711:18:18:93:521:454:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:supplying are so proximate to their parent firm’s final good that they appear identical at the two-digit 
24:1014:75816:18:18:93:523:436:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:level.  These  ‘intra-industry’  vertical  subsidiaries  are  qualitatively  different  to  the  inter-industry  
24:1015:75929:18:18:93:521:418:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical FDI visible at the two-digit level. Intra-industry vertical subsidiaries are generally producing 
24:1016:76035:18:18:93:521:400:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:inputs  which  are  of  similar  skill  intensity  to  the  final  goods  produced  by  their  parents  and  they  are  
24:1017:76155:18:17:93:522:382:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:overwhelmingly  producing  them  in  high  skill  countries,  i.e.,  their  production  and  location  are  not  
24:1018:76268:17:18:93:514:365:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:readily explained by the comparative advantage considerations in traditional models of vertical FDI.  
24:1019:76370:18:18:127:522:347:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:We  argue  this  pattern  of  intra-industry  north-north  vertical  FDI  reflect  firms’  decision  to  
24:1020:76475:18:18:93:521:329:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:outsource  versus  own  the  production  of  intermediate  inputs.  Overwhelmingly,  multinationals  source  
24:1021:76584:18:18:93:520:311:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:raw materials and inputs in early stages of production from outside the firm but tend to own the stages 
24:1022:76688:18:18:93:522:293:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:of  production  proximate  to  their  final  production  giving  rise  to  a  class  of  high-skill  intra-industry  
24:1023:76805:18:35:93:148:275:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:vertical FDI. 
24:1024:76819:35:29:93:370:240:107:Times:107:g_d0_f1:B:Appendix A: Sensitivity of Results to the I-O Methodology       
24:1025:76883:29:17:127:520:211:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:How sensitive are these results to the IO methodology? We initially use a coefficient cutoff of 
24:1026:76979:17:18:93:521:194:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:0.05  and  vary  this  to  test  the  robustness  of  our  results  to  different  coefficients.  If  we  raise  the  cutoff  
24:1027:77105:18:18:93:522:176:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:coefficient  to  0.075,  we  lose  only  one  of  the  top  10  vertical  pairs  in  Appendix  Table  1.  All  of  the  
24:1028:77225:18:18:93:521:158:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:others  have  coefficients  greater  than  0.075.  The  pair  we  lose  is  the  parent  firms  in  the  Orthopedic,  
24:1029:77343:18:18:93:522:140:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Prosthetic,  and  Surgical  Appliances  and  Supplies  (SIC  3842)  and  the  subsidiaries  in  Surgical  and  
24:1030:77454:18:18:93:521:122:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:Medical  Instruments  and  Apparatus  (SIC  3841).  The  IO  coefficient  is  0.063  and  there  are  201  such  
24:1031:77567:18:0:93:492:104:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:pairs. We are reluctant to cut this pair because it appears to be a bone-fide vertical relationship.  
25:1032:77671:0:18:127:521:714:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:A:Indeed altering the cutoff coefficient in this way leads us to only lose three pairs in the top 50 
25:1033:77770:18:18:93:523:696:107:g_d0_f1:107:g_d0_f1:B:most  frequent  parent-subsidiary  industry  combinations.  Furthermore  each  of  those  industry  pairs
