2:16:421:21:14:99:528:476:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:Regression Discontinuity (RD) models identify local treatment effects by associating a discrete
2:17:516:14:13:83:528:462:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:change in an outcome with a corresponding discrete change in the probability of treatment at a known
2:18:616:13:14:83:528:449:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:threshold of a running variable. This paper shows that it is possible to identify RD model treatment ef-
2:19:720:14:13:83:528:435:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:fects without a discontinuity. The intuition is that identi-cation can come from a slope change (a kink)
2:20:824:13:14:83:528:422:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:instead of a discrete level change (a jump) in the treatment probability. Formally this can be shown
2:21:924:14:13:83:528:408:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:using L'hopital's rule. I also interpret the identi-cation results intuitively using instrumental variable
2:22:1030:13:14:83:528:395:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:models. Estimators are proposed that can be applied in the presence or absence of a discontinuity, by
2:23:1131:14:27:83:232:381:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:exploiting either a jump or a kink.

2:30:1507:14:15:54:557:217:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:or academic performance, and letXbe a so-called running or forcing variable that affects bothTand
2:31:1604:15:14:54:557:202:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:Y. For example,Xcould be the income level that affects eligibility for a social program, or an exam
2:32:1703:14:14:53:557:188:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:score affecting a grade retention decision. In the standard Regression Discontinuity (RD) framework, the

2:34:1896:15:14:53:557:159:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Under general conditions, this discontinuity or jump inf.x/, along with any observed corresponding

2:40:2460:12:0:71:554:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:The author would like to thank Arthur Lewbel for many very helpful comments and suggestions. Any errors are my own.

3:42:2673:15:14:54:474:711:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:below the threshold can serve as valid counterfactuals for treated individuals just above.
3:43:2763:14:15:71:557:697:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In this paper I show that the RD local average treatment effect that is usually identi-ed by a discon-
3:44:2865:15:14:54:558:682:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tinuity can still be identi-ed even if there is no discontinuity or jump in the treatment probabilityf.x/,
3:45:2971:14:15:54:557:668:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:given that there is a kink, i.e., a discrete change in slope inf.x/atxDc. I also provide estimators for the
3:46:3078:15:14:54:558:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:local average treatment effect that can be used regardless of whether identi-cation comes from a jump, a
3:47:3182:14:15:54:486:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:kink, or both. The identi-cation results are further intuitively interpreted using IV models.
3:48:3275:15:14:71:557:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:This paper's results could be applied in situations where the compliance rate changes less dramatically
3:49:3378:14:14:54:558:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:than required by the standard RD. For example, in applications where there is inertia or delay in taking
3:50:3482:14:15:54:558:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:up treatment, the added probability of treatment associated with crossing a threshold may rise as one
3:51:3583:15:14:54:558:581:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:gets further away from the threshold rather than jumping the moment the threshold is crossed. In this
3:52:3684:14:15:54:558:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:case, treatment effects based on standard RD estimators would either be weakly identi-ed, if the jump
3:53:3785:15:14:54:558:552:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is small, or unidenti-ed if the jump is zero, regardless of how much the slope changes. In contrast, the
3:54:3889:14:15:54:558:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimators proposed in this paper make use of any changes in either the intercept or the slope of the
3:55:3990:15:14:54:245:523:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:treatment probability at the pointxDc.
3:56:4028:14:15:71:557:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:For example, Jacob and Lefgren (2004) examine the treatment effect of remedial eduction programs,
3:57:4125:15:14:54:558:494:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:including grade retention, on later academic performance, where the retention treatment is incurred by
3:58:4227:14:14:54:558:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:failing summer school tests. They note that "the probability of retention does not drop sharply (discontin-
3:59:4334:14:15:54:558:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:uously) at the exact point of the cutoff , ...it rapidly decreases over a narrow range of values just below the
3:60:4445:15:14:54:558:451:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cutoff." Indeed, their Figure 6 (reproduced in Figure 1 here) shows a dramatic slope change instead of a
3:61:4549:14:15:54:558:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:discontinuity in the retention probability at the cutoff (normalized to zero). In this case, the standard RD
3:62:4657:15:14:54:558:422:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimation based on a discrete change in the treatment probability is not suitable, whereas the estimators
3:63:4763:14:302:54:232:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:proposed in this paper can still apply.

3:65:4873:38:14:71:557:68:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In some potential applications of RD models, there is debate about whether the probability of treatment
3:66:4976:14:0:54:558:54:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:actually jumps at a threshold. When a discrete change is small, it could be indistinguishable from a kink
4:67:5082:0:15:54:558:726:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:visually. An example is Figure 2, which reproduces Figure 4 from Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (2008),
4:68:5180:15:14:54:558:711:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:showing the probability of retirement in the US by age. It is dif-cult to determine whether a small jump
4:69:5284:14:15:54:558:697:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:appears in this probability at age 65, the eligibility age for full social security bene-ts, but there is an
4:70:5392:15:14:54:558:682:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:obvious difference in slopes above and below this threshold. The estimators proposed in this paper might
4:71:5496:14:15:54:558:668:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:then be used to identify the impact of retirement on outcomes like consumption or time use, based just on
4:72:5601:15:277:54:416:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the knowledge that the propensity to retire has either a jump or a kink at 65.

4:74:5751:40:14:71:557:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:For simplicity, this paper will mostly not deal with covariates other than the running variableXin
4:75:5849:14:15:54:558:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the analysis. The standard RD argument applies that covariates are generally not needed for consistency,
4:76:5953:15:14:54:558:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:though they may be useful for ef-ciency or for testing continuity assumptions. However, if desired, addi-
4:77:6058:14:15:54:557:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tional covariatesZcould be included in the analysis by letting all the assumptions hold conditional upon
4:78:6162:15:14:54:558:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the valuesZmay take on. In applications, one could either partial out these covariates prior to analysis,
4:79:6267:14:14:54:314:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:or include them in the models as additional regressors.
4:80:6322:14:15:71:557:250:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the main identi-cation results. Section
4:81:6427:15:14:54:558:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:3 gives an instrumental variables interpretation of the identi-cation. Section 4 discusses some extensions,
4:82:6534:14:15:54:558:221:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:including possible identi-cation based on higher order derivatives. Section 5 provides associated estima-
4:83:6639:15:40:54:197:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tors, and Section 6 concludes.
4:84:6669:40:27:54:421:166:17:g_d0_f8:17:g_d0_f8:C:2  RD Treatment Effects without A Discontinuity
4:85:6716:27:15:54:557:139:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:I will use Rubin's (1974) potential outcome notation. LetY.1/andY.0/denote an individual's po-
4:86:6810:15:14:54:558:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tential outcomes from being treated or not, respectively.  The observed outcome can then be written
4:87:6909:14:15:54:557:110:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:asYDY.1/TCY.0/.1-T/. As in the introduction, de-neg.x/DE.YjXDx/andf.x/D
4:88:6980:15:14:54:557:95:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:E.TjXDx/, sog.x/andf.x/are the expected outcome and expected probability of treatment when
4:89:7070:14:15:54:557:81:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:B:the running or forcing variableXDx. In the standard RD model one would expect bothf.x/andg.x/
4:90:7163:15:0:54:231:66:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:have a jump (discontinuity) atxDc.
5:91:7198:0:15:71:557:726:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:LetT-be a dummy for crossing the -xed thresholdc, i.e.,T-DI.X-c/, soT-is one for individuals
5:92:7290:15:14:54:557:711:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:who haveXabove the threshold and zero otherwise. An individual is de-ned to be a complier if he has
5:93:7389:14:15:54:557:697:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:TDT-. LetD-DI.TDT-/be a binary indicator for compliers, i.e., those whose treatment is
5:94:7475:15:14:54:558:682:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:determined or induced just by crossing the -xed threshold.E.D-jXDx/then equals the compliance
5:95:7568:14:15:54:558:668:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rate (percentage of compliers) atXDx, i.e., the change in the treatment probability atXDx. We do not
5:96:7668:15:14:54:300:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:observeD-and so do not know who are compliers.
5:97:7714:14:15:71:557:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The standard RD model requiresE.D-jXDc/6D0, i.e., a discontinuity atc. The sharp design RD
5:98:7804:15:26:54:432:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:model is the special case whereE.D-jXDc/D1 so everyone is a complier.
5:99:7873:26:14:71:558:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:ASSUMPTION A1: Assume that for each unit (individual)iwe observeYi,Ti, andXi. The threshold
5:100:7964:14:15:54:558:584:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:cis a known constant. The conditional meansE.Y.t/jXDx;D-Dd/fortD0;1, anddD0;1,
5:101:8042:15:14:54:558:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as well asE.TjXDx;D-D0/andE.D-jXDx/are continuously differentiable for allxin a
5:102:8121:14:26:54:167:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:neighborhood ofxDc.
5:103:8140:26:15:71:544:529:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:For ease of notation I will drop theisubscript when referring to the random variablesY,T, andX.
5:104:8235:15:14:71:558:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:It follows from Assumption 1 thatE.Y.t/jXDx/fortD0;1 are continuously differentiable in
5:105:8322:14:15:54:557:500:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the neighborhood ofxDc. Assumption A1 differs from standard RD assumptions in requiring more
5:106:8414:15:14:54:558:485:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:smoothness. Speci-cally, standard RD models require only continuity of the conditional mean potential
5:107:8515:14:15:54:558:471:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes rather than continuous differentiability for identi-cation. This paper requires this additional
5:108:8619:15:14:54:558:456:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:smoothness to rule out not only jumps but also kinks (formally de-ned below) caused by factors other
5:109:8719:14:15:54:557:442:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:than changes in the treatment probability at the thresholdxDc. In practice, estimators of standard
5:110:8817:15:14:54:558:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:RD models generally impose at least as much smoothness as Assumption A1. For example, asymptotic

6:160:11321:14:14:71:557:498:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:I now consider identifying the RD model treatment effect under alternative assumptions. In particular,
6:161:11423:14:15:54:558:484:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:I consider: What if there is no jump in the treatment probability? Can we still identify the RD model

6:170:11910:52:15:71:558:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:First note that Assumption A1 suf-ces to guarantee that the one-sided derivativesg0C.x/,g0-.x/,

6:173:12198:15:14:53:557:272:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:intuition is that iff.x/does not have a jump, then both the denominator and the numerator (equations 1
6:174:12300:14:15:53:558:258:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and 2) of the standard RD estimator given by equation (4) will equal zero asxgoes toc. In that case, by
6:175:12403:15:14:54:558:243:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:L'hopital's rule, that ratio will equal the ratio of derivatives of the numerator and denominator, given that
6:176:12512:14:15:54:161:229:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:these derivatives exist.
6:177:12536:15:14:71:557:214:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Theorem 1 requires that the slope of the treatment probability changes at the threshold, which provides
6:178:12639:14:14:54:557:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:additional identi-cation. So unlike in the standard RD model where the treatment effect-.c/is identi-ed

6:180:12815:15:14:71:557:171:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In practice, just as a jump in the density ofXor other baseline covariates at the threshold would cast
6:181:12917:14:15:54:558:157:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:doubt on the validity of the smoothness assumption in standard RD models, a kink in the density ofXor
6:182:13018:15:14:54:558:142:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:other baseline covariates at the threshold would cast doubt on the validity of the smoothness assumption
6:183:13122:14:15:54:558:128:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in A1 and hence the identi-ed-.c/may not be interpreted as a causal effect. To address this concern, one
6:184:13226:15:14:54:558:113:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:can search for any unusual jumps or kinks in the density ofXor other covariates using methods suggested
6:185:13329:14:15:54:349:99:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and Lee and Lemieux (2010).
6:186:13385:15:14:71:557:84:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In particular, one could draw a histogram ofXbased on a -xed number of bins at each side of the
6:187:13480:14:14:54:558:70:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cutoff. The overall shape of the distribution can provide a sense whether there is an ususal jump or kink
6:188:13585:14:0:54:558:56:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:at the cutoff. A more formal test of a discontinuity in the density can be found in McCrary (2008). For
7:189:13689:0:15:54:557:726:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:other covariates, their conditional means conditional onXwill need to be continuously differentiable
7:190:13789:15:14:54:558:711:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the neighborhood ofc, so one can parametrically regress these covariates onT-and.X-c/T-or

7:193:14082:14:15:54:557:668:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:corresponds to using a -xed number of bins at each side ofXDcand graphing the mean value of each

7:195:14236:14:26:71:398:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Combining Lemma 1 with Theorem 1 gives the following Corollary.

7:222:15457:15:14:71:557:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:When there may be both a jump and a kink, Theorem 2 shows that information in both the jump and the
7:223:15556:14:15:54:558:310:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:kink can be used to estimate the treatment effect-.c/, given-0.c/D0, as in the case where the treatment
7:224:15659:15:14:54:557:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect is locally constant. However, note that-0.c/D0 is a strictly weaker condition than assuming a
7:225:15759:14:15:54:557:281:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:locally constant treatment effect, because the latter would imply that all derivatives of-.c/were zero, not
7:226:15866:15:14:54:557:266:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:just the -rst derivative-0.c/. I will discuss the interpretation of this restriction in more detail in Section 3,
7:227:15979:14:14:54:557:252:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and provide an extension to Theorem 2 in Section 4. This extension will permit-0.c/to be non-zero. Note
7:228:16082:14:15:54:558:238:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:also that when it is not clear whether there is a jump, a kink, or both, the above estimator can be used as
7:229:16189:15:14:54:355:223:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:long as-0.c/D0 holds, which might be appealing empirically.

8:254:17580:14:15:53:557:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:versus Theorem 2 is that asymptotically Corollary 2 sets-.c/equal to-1when there is a jump, regardless

8:274:18487:14:14:54:558:410:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:observe that one could directly construct nonparametric estimators ofgC.c/andg0C.c/as the intercept

8:280:18935:26:15:54:558:285:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:In this section I provide an instrumental variables interpretation for the identi-cation results of the previous
8:281:19047:15:14:54:558:270:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:section. I will also show how instrumental variables methods can be used to construct simple estimators
8:282:19150:14:15:54:161:256:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:based on these results.
8:283:19173:15:26:71:416:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Suppose that for some constants-,\f, and-one has the outcome model

8:287:19446:14:15:54:558:160:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:required in an ordinary IV model. Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw (2001) show that the standard fuzzy
8:288:19546:15:14:54:558:145:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:design RD estimator given by equation (4) is numerically equivalent to the IV estimator of-in equation
8:289:19648:14:15:54:557:131:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(8), using.X-c/andT-as instruments for any -xed", even if the IV assumption is violated. Instead,

8:291:19841:14:15:54:366:102:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:n!1establishes the consistency of the standard RD estimator.
8:292:19901:15:14:71:557:87:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:For the above model, one could assume that for a small positive"neighborhood ofxDc,Xand
8:293:19988:14:0:54:558:73:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:henceT-are independent ofeas"!0. Then for compliers, their treatment is determined only byT-,
9:294:20082:0:15:54:557:726:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and hence is independent ofe, i.e.,T?ejD-D1;XDxforc-"-x-cC"as"!0.1This
9:295:20152:15:14:53:557:711:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in practice could hold if individuals, in particular compliers, can not precisely manipulate the running
9:296:20256:14:15:53:557:697:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:variableX, which immediately means that they will be randomly above or below the threshold. Thus,
9:297:20353:15:14:53:557:682:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:treatment will be randomly assigned among compliers. (See details regarding this assignment mechanism
9:298:20454:14:15:53:558:668:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in Lemieux, 2008). For example, letTbe a grade retention treatment andXbe negative test score, socis
9:299:20554:15:14:53:557:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:then the negative threshold score andT-indicates whether one fails the test or not.Ycould then be later

9:301:20757:15:14:54:557:624:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:T-. Individuals may try to be just below the threshold score and hence avoid the treatment; however,
9:302:20857:14:14:53:557:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:depending on whether or not they are lucky on the test day, they will be randomly below or above the
9:303:20957:14:15:53:408:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:threshold, which implies a local independence ofX(and henceT-) ande.
9:304:21025:15:14:71:557:581:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:One can take Equation (8) as a parametric functional form that holds for some small -xed", which
9:305:21121:14:15:53:557:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:then requires independence ofX(and henceT-/fromeforc-"-X-cC". In this case, equation (8)
9:306:21209:15:14:53:557:552:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:assumes a constant local average treatment effect. One could relax the constant local average treatment
9:307:21312:14:15:53:557:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect assumption by adding interaction terms like.X-c/Tand.X-c/2T, etc., to the model; however,
9:308:21408:15:14:53:558:523:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in this case one would still be imposing some parametric functional form on-.c/. In the extension section
9:309:21513:14:15:53:327:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:I will consider this type of generalization of equation (8).
9:310:21573:15:14:71:557:494:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Instead of assuming a parametric model, one could alternatively take equation (8) as one that only
9:311:21671:14:14:53:557:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:holds in the limit as"!0. In this case the model would not be placing any functional restrictions on
9:312:21771:14:15:53:556:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f10:B:the function-.x/, since if the true model contained any interaction terms like.X-c/Tand.X-c/2T
9:313:21865:15:14:53:558:451:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that were omitted from equation (8), those terms would converge to zero as"!0. Similarly, in this case
9:314:21967:14:15:53:558:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:even if misspeci-cation of equation (8) causedeto be correlated with any function ofXwhen">0, that
9:315:22065:15:14:53:558:422:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:correlation would go to zero as"!0, because in the limitXwould no longer be a random variable, but
9:316:22163:14:15:53:546:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:would just converge to the constantc. Note however thatecould still be correlated withTin this limit.
9:317:22264:15:14:71:558:393:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Correlation ofewithTmeans that the assignment to treatment could be related to the outcome through
9:318:22362:14:15:53:557:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:factors other thanX. For example, if the treatment is grade retention and the decision of who to retain is
9:319:22468:15:14:53:558:364:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:based both on whether test scoreXis below a threshold and on teachers' judgments of who would bene-t
9:320:22568:14:14:53:550:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the most from being retained, then that judgement criterion could induce a correlation betweenTande.
9:321:22668:14:15:71:557:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Now considerT-DI.X-c/. If the treatment probabilityf.x/has a jump atxDc, which means
9:322:22752:15:14:53:558:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:it will depend onT-, thenT-will be a valid instrument forTin equation (8). One could then estimate
9:323:22850:14:15:53:411:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equation (8) using two stage least squares, with instrumentsX-candT-.
9:324:22919:15:14:71:558:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Similar to how a jump inf.x/atxDcimplies thatT-is a valid instrument, a kink inf.x/at the
9:325:23008:14:15:53:557:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:threshold implies that the interaction term.X-c/T-would also be a valid instrument forT. So if there
9:326:23108:15:14:53:557:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is no jump but a kink in the treatment probability, one would still be able to use this kink, the slope change

11:409:26788:14:15:71:557:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Note that the local linear 2SLS estimator that has a variable bandwidth (i.e.,"!0 as the sample size

11:414:27274:14:15:53:557:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:goes to zero. So with the local 2SLS if there is a jump, i.e.,pDfC.c/-f-.c/6D0, the 2SLS weight

11:427:27588:27:14:53:557:436:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The previously described estimator in Theorem 2 uses either just a jump, or just a kink, or both, but

11:429:27794:14:15:53:558:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:0 in Theorem 2. Having-0.c/D0 means that the treatment effect does not vary linearly withX. For

11:435:28354:14:15:53:557:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on the pre-treatment test score, and in this case one still could use both jump and kink information to

12:462:29776:15:14:71:558:682:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Analogous to Theorem 2, the assumption for Theorem 3 that-00.c/D0 will hold if the treatment
12:463:29868:14:15:53:557:668:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect is locally linear or locally constant. However, while a locally linear or constant treatment effect is
12:464:29977:15:14:53:557:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:suf-cient for-00.c/D0, it is stronger than necessary, because it implies that all derivatives higher than
12:465:30082:14:15:53:558:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the -rst are zero, instead of just the second derivative being zero. With the assumption-00.c/D0, the
12:466:30183:15:14:53:558:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimator does not allow the treatment effect to be quadratic in.X-c/. So for example, in the parametric

12:468:30366:14:15:71:557:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Similar to the estimator in Theorem 2, when there is no jump, i.e.,pD0 andBD0, then the above
12:469:30459:15:14:53:557:581:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimator reduces toC=q, which is the estimator in Theorem 1. So when one is sure there is no jump, it
12:470:30561:14:15:53:557:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is more ef-cient to use the estimator in Theorem 1. Otherwise if one assumes that the treatment effect is
12:471:30666:15:14:53:557:552:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:locally linear or locally constant, then this estimator works regardless of whether there is a jump, a kink,
12:472:30774:14:15:53:442:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:or both, and exploits the identi-cation information in both when both are present.

12:486:31377:14:15:53:557:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:locally constant, the above estimator takes into account this local linear effect, while the estimator in

12:494:31742:15:14:71:557:300:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Note that the above estimator exploits possible higher order derivative changes for identi-cation. For
12:495:31844:14:15:54:557:286:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f10:B:example, in the absence of both a jump and a kink, the above estimator reduces toD=r. Similar toC=q

12:498:32151:15:14:54:558:242:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a possible disadvantage of using Corollary 3 for estimation instead of Corollary 2 is that Corollary 3
12:499:32253:14:15:54:558:228:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:requires estimation of higher order derivatives (second instead of -rst), which in practice might be very
12:500:32358:15:14:54:162:213:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:imprecisely estimated.
12:501:32380:14:14:71:557:199:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:So far, all the estimators have been discussed without other covariates except forX. Sometimes it
12:502:32477:14:15:54:558:185:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:may be desirable to include covariates in the RD model, for example, treatment effects could vary with
12:503:32579:15:14:54:558:170:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the other covariates. In that case, additional covariatesZcould be included by letting all the assumptions
12:504:32685:14:15:54:557:156:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:hold conditional upon the valuesZmay take on. The treatment effect estimators are then all conditional
12:505:32787:15:14:54:558:141:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on the speci-c value ofZ. For estimation, one could directly includeZ, possibly interacted withTandX,
12:506:32888:14:15:54:558:127:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as additional regressors in the local polynomial or IV regressions. Then by averaging the estimates over
12:507:32992:15:14:54:557:112:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:all possible values ofZone could get unconditional RD model treatment effects. Alternatively, one could
12:508:33095:14:15:54:558:98:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partial covariates out by -rst regressingYandTon covariates both above and below the threshold, and
12:509:33194:15:0:54:432:83:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:then use the residuals from those regressions in place ofYandTin estimation.

13:547:35155:15:14:54:557:270:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as instruments.X-c/,T-, and.X-c/T-. The resulting estimated weights will then be as described in
13:548:35251:14:15:54:102:256:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Section 3.
13:549:35261:15:14:71:557:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:For all the estimators in the above, one could use the Delta method to calculate standard errors. Al-
13:550:35362:14:15:54:558:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ternatively, parametric IV estimation provides standard errors directly along with the point estimate of the
13:551:35470:15:14:54:172:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:average treatment effect.
13:552:35495:14:14:71:557:198:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:These estimators can be interpreted as a special case of nonparametric local linear based estimation,
13:553:35596:14:15:54:558:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:using a uniform kernel. The bandwidth might be chosen using cross validation or other methods as de-
13:554:35696:15:14:54:558:169:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:scribed in, e.g., Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2009) or Lee and Lemieux (2010) and references therein. Just
13:555:35799:14:15:54:558:155:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as Porter (2003) recommends using local linear estimation to reduce boundary bias in the constant terms
13:556:35902:15:14:54:558:140:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of these regressions, it might be advisable to use local quadratic rather than local linear estimation for
13:557:36008:14:15:54:296:126:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:reducing boundary bias in the derivative estimates.
13:558:36059:15:14:71:558:111:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:To apply the estimator proposed in Theorem 3, where the treatment effect is allowed to vary withX,
13:559:36157:14:15:53:557:97:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:one would need to estimate local quadratic or higher-order polynomial regressions to obtain the second or
13:560:36262:15:14:53:557:82:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:higher-order derivatives involved in those estimators. Similarly, IV estimation can be implemented using
13:561:36366:14:14:53:557:68:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the higher-order interaction terms as additional instruments. Since these extensions are straightforward, I
13:562:36473:14:0:53:251:54:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:do not explicitly give their formulas here.
14:563:36518:0:27:54:169:726:17:g_d0_f8:17:g_d0_f8:C:6  Conclusions
14:564:36532:27:15:54:558:699:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Regression discontinuity models identify local treatment effects by associating a discrete change (a jump)
14:565:36638:15:14:54:558:684:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the mean outcome with a corresponding jump in the probability of treatment at a -xed threshold value of
14:566:36744:14:15:54:558:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the running variable. Lack of discontinuity would make the standard RD estimator inapplicable. However,
14:567:36847:15:14:54:558:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:this paper shows that it is possible to identify the RD model treatment effect from a slope change (a kink)
14:568:36954:14:15:54:558:641:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rather than, or in addition to, a jump in the probability of treatment. The intuition for identi-cation off a
14:569:37063:15:14:54:330:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:kink in the absence of a jump is based on L'hopital's rule.
14:570:37122:14:14:71:557:612:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:I propose extensions of the usual RD estimator that can be used regardless of whether the source of
14:571:37221:14:15:54:558:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:identi-cation is a jump or a kink. This is empirically appealing because in some potential applications
14:572:37324:15:14:54:558:583:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of RD models, it is hard to determine whether the probability of treatment actually jumps or just have a
14:573:37428:14:15:54:558:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:kink at the threshold. In these cases, treatment effects based on standard RD estimators would either be
14:574:37532:15:14:54:558:554:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:weakly identi-ed, if the jump is small, or unidenti-ed if the jump is zero, regardless of how much the
14:575:37634:14:15:54:558:540:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:slope changes. In contrast, this paper's estimators make use of any changes in either the intercept (a jump)
14:576:37742:15:14:54:467:525:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:or the slope (a kink) of the treatment probability at a threshold of the running variable.
14:577:37832:14:15:71:557:511:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The identi-cation results in this paper can be intuitively interpreted using IV models. I show that a
14:578:37933:15:14:54:558:496:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:kink in the treatment probability provides an additional valid instrument that one can use to identify the
14:579:38039:14:14:54:558:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:same RD treatment effect as a jump. Speci-cally, similar to a jump in the treatment probability at the
14:580:38141:14:15:54:558:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:threshold implying that the binary indicator for crossing the threshold is a valid instrument, a kink at the
14:581:38249:15:14:54:558:453:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:threshold implies that the interaction term between this binary indicator and the running variable could
14:582:38353:14:15:54:558:439:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:also be a valid instrument for the treatment. So if there is no jump but a kink in the treatment probability,
14:583:38462:15:14:54:558:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:one would still be able to use this kink, or the slope change in the treatment probability, to identify the RD
14:584:38572:14:15:54:558:410:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:model treatment effect. I also show that in some cases (e.g., when the treatment effect is locally constant
14:585:38679:15:14:54:558:395:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the neighborhood of the threshold), one can use the information in both the intercept change and the
14:586:38782:14:15:54:435:381:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:slope change, i.e., both the jump and a kink to estimate the RD treatment effect.
14:587:38863:15:14:71:557:366:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:All of the proposed estimators can be computed using just the estimated coef-cients from the same
14:588:38960:14:14:54:558:352:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:local linear or polynomial regressions that are typically used to estimate standard RD models, so no new
14:589:39064:14:15:54:558:338:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimation methods are required. As usual, one can alternatively do IV or 2SLS estimation using observa-
14:590:39168:15:14:54:558:323:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tions in the neighborhood of the threshold to obtain not only point estimates of the average treatment effect
14:591:39277:14:15:54:558:309:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:but also parametric standard errors, with an added advantage in this paper's context that 2SLS provides
14:592:39380:15:14:54:364:294:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the type of weights that some of the proposed estimators require.
14:593:39445:14:15:71:557:280:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Given our results, it would be useful to explore identi-cation and estimation of other treatment related
14:594:39549:15:14:54:558:265:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:parameters in the presence of kinks instead of jumps, such as the marginal policy effects of Carneiro,
14:595:39651:14:41:54:306:251:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010) and Heckman (2010).
