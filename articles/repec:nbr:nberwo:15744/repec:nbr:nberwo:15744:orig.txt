2:30:1491:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The extent of the demographic changes in Europe is dramatic and will deeply affect future labor, financial
2:31:1597:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:and goods markets. The expected strain on public budgets and especially social security has already
2:32:1696:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:received prominent attention, but aging poses many other economic challenges that threaten growth
2:33:1793:14:28:72:307:546:12:Times:12:Times:and living standards if they remain unaddressed. 
2:34:1842:28:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:This paper focuses on three large Continental European countries: France, Germany, and Italy. These
2:35:1941:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:countries have large pay-as-you-go pension systems and vulnerable labor markets. At the same time,
2:36:2039:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:they show remarkable resistance against pension and labor market reform. While there is no shortage
2:37:2138:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:of reform proposals to address population aging, most of those focused on pension and labor market
2:38:2236:14:28:72:393:462:12:Times:12:Times:reform, little is known about behavioral reactions to such reforms. 
2:39:2304:28:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:This paper therefore sheds light on the potential benefits of pension and labor market reform for growth
2:40:2408:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:and living standards, taking into account behavioral reactions to specific reforms. Which behavioral
2:41:2508:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:reactions will strengthen, which will weaken reform policies? Can Old Europe maintain its standard
2:42:2606:14:42:72:451:392:12:Times:12:Times:of living even if behavioral reactions offset some of the current reform efforts?

3:55:2914:0:29:70:164:758:195:Times:195:Times:1. Introduction 
3:56:2929:29:20:70:526:729:144:Times:144:Times:While aging is global, there are marked international differences in the speed and the extent of 
3:57:3026:20:21:70:528:709:144:Times:144:Times:the  aging  processes.  Even  within  the  industrialized  countries,  differences  are  large.  Europe  
3:58:3131:21:21:70:528:688:144:Times:144:Times:and Japan have already a much older population than North-America. Italy and Germany, in 
3:59:3220:21:20:70:527:667:144:Times:144:Times:turn, are aging faster than France and Great Britain. Italy and Germany are projected to shrink 
3:60:3316:20:21:70:528:647:144:Times:144:Times:in population size; even more dramatic is the shrinkage of the labor force between 2010 and 
3:61:3408:21:21:70:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:2035 when the German and Italian babyboom generations will retire. To the extent that labor 
3:62:3500:21:20:70:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:force  shrinkage  precedes  population  shrinkage,  these  countries  will  face  steeply  falling  sup-
3:63:3604:20:21:70:528:585:144:Times:144:Times:port  ratios  (workers  per  consumers).  One  likely  implication  is  slower  economic  growth  and,  
3:64:3708:21:21:70:527:564:144:Times:144:Times:in the worst case, stagnating or falling standards of living if the force of aging is stronger than 
3:65:3808:21:27:70:230:543:144:Times:144:Times:the force of productivity growth. 
3:66:3842:27:20:70:527:516:144:Times:144:Times:This paper has two broad aims. First, it shows that pension and labor market reforms have the 
3:67:3936:20:21:70:527:496:144:Times:144:Times:potential to mitigate much of the negative implications of population aging. Hence, there is a 
3:68:4031:21:21:70:524:475:144:Times:144:Times:good reason to bear the short-run costs of reforms in exchange for the long-run benefits. Sec-
3:69:4125:21:20:70:524:454:144:Times:144:Times:ond, the paper models potential backlashes to reform in order to provide a more realistic as-
3:70:4218:20:21:70:530:434:144:Times:144:Times:sessment  of  what  might  be  the  outcome  of  the  politically  complicated  reform  process  in  
3:71:4319:21:27:70:111:413:144:Times:144:Times:Europe. 
3:72:4327:27:20:70:527:386:144:Times:144:Times:The paper is part of a research agenda that analyzes the aging process and its macroeconomic 
3:73:4420:20:21:70:527:366:144:Times:144:Times:implications in Continental Europe, focusing on its three largest countries, France, Germany, 
3:74:4514:21:21:70:524:345:144:Times:144:Times:and Italy, the core of Old Europe. These countries have large public budgets and pay-as-you-
3:75:4606:21:21:70:529:324:144:Times:144:Times:go  financed  social  security  systems.  Their  unsustainability  has  already  received  prominent  
3:76:4708:21:20:70:529:303:144:Times:144:Times:attention.  In  addition,  these  countries  have  labor  markets  characterized  by  low  participation  
3:77:4814:20:21:70:527:283:144:Times:144:Times:rates, high unemployment, and high wages. They are particularly vulnerable to the challenges 
3:78:4907:21:21:70:528:262:144:Times:144:Times:of  globalization  due  to  the  high  tax  and  contribution  burden  in  total  labor  compensation.  In  
3:79:5015:21:20:70:528:241:144:Times:144:Times:spite  of  these  problems,  France,  Germany,  and  Italy  have  been  remarkably  resistant  to  labor  
3:80:5121:20:21:70:529:221:144:Times:144:Times:market  and  pension  reform.  If  governments  anyway  manage  to  push  such  reforms  through  
3:81:5219:21:21:70:528:200:144:Times:144:Times:parliament, workers may thus react adversely and undo at least some of the expected effects 
3:82:5311:21:20:70:528:179:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  reforms.  The  main  questions  posed  in  this  paper  are  therefore:  What  can  pension  and  
3:83:5418:20:21:70:524:159:144:Times:144:Times:labor market reforms ideally achieve? What are possible behavioral reactions to reform poli-
3:84:5510:21:21:70:527:138:144:Times:144:Times:cies? Which direction will they take and how large are they? And ultimately: Can Old Europe 
3:85:5602:21:21:70:524:117:144:Times:144:Times:maintain  its  high  living  standards  even  if  behavioral  reactions  offset  some  of  the  current  re-
3:86:5710:21:0:70:136:96:144:Times:144:Times:form efforts? 
4:87:5725:0:21:70:529:760:144:Times:144:Times:Some  behavioral  reactions  will  strengthen  reform.  A  good  example  is  raising  the  statutory  
4:88:5828:21:21:70:529:739:144:Times:144:Times:retirement  age.  It  has  direct  effects  on  the  labor  supply  by  bringing  older  individuals  to  the  
4:89:5939:21:21:70:529:718:144:Times:144:Times:labor  market.  Indirect  effects  emerge  from  endogenous  labor  supply  reactions,  e.g.,  through  
4:90:6043:21:20:70:528:697:144:Times:144:Times:incentive  effects  generated  by  the  tax  and  contribution  burden  that  actuarially  unfair  social  
4:91:6150:20:21:70:527:677:144:Times:144:Times:security systems impose on households. Raising the retirement age will lower social security 
4:92:6243:21:21:70:527:656:144:Times:144:Times:contributions in such pension systems. In response to rising net wages, labor supply may then 
4:93:6337:21:26:70:166:635:144:Times:144:Times:increase at all ages. 
4:94:6359:26:21:70:528:609:144:Times:144:Times:There are, however, also behavioral effects that weaken policy reforms. To take up the same 
4:95:6451:21:21:70:527:588:144:Times:144:Times:example, older workers, now forced to work longer, may exploit part-time opportunities given 
4:96:6544:21:20:70:527:567:144:Times:144:Times:by the pension system. In some countries (e.g., Finland and Germany) such opportunities led 
4:97:6636:20:21:70:528:547:144:Times:144:Times:to a very early transition to part time work with the perverse result that in some sectors hours 
4:98:6733:21:21:70:527:526:144:Times:144:Times:supplied actually decreased in response to pension reform. Along the same line, encouraging 
4:99:6825:21:20:70:528:505:144:Times:144:Times:female  labor  supply,  e.g.  through  public  provision  of  day  care  facilities,  may  precipitate  a  
4:100:6932:20:21:70:527:485:144:Times:144:Times:decrease in male labor supply. This within-household substitution would be perfectly rational 
4:101:7026:21:27:70:385:464:144:Times:144:Times:if households desire joint leisure and joint household production. 
4:102:7093:27:21:70:527:437:144:Times:144:Times:Little is known about these behavioral reactions. One of the key issues taken up in this paper 
4:103:7188:21:20:70:527:416:144:Times:144:Times:is therefore to model and calibrate behavioral reactions to reform. Which behavioral reactions 
4:104:7283:20:27:70:494:396:144:Times:144:Times:will strengthen, which will weaken reform policies? What are their quantitative effects? 
4:105:7372:27:21:70:524:369:144:Times:144:Times:We will build a simple model of reforms and reform backlashes into an overlapping genera-
4:106:7461:21:20:70:528:348:144:Times:144:Times:tions  model  of  the  Auerbach,  Kotlikoff  and  Skinner  (1983)/Auerbach  and  Kotlikoff  (1987)  
4:107:7561:20:21:70:528:328:144:Times:144:Times:type,  extended  to  a  multi-country  version  (Börsch-Supan,  Ludwig  and  Winter,  2007).1  As  a  
4:108:7663:21:21:70:528:307:144:Times:144:Times:particular feature of our model, we add to the model the distinction between exogenous labor 
4:109:7756:21:20:70:527:286:144:Times:144:Times:supply components (as key results of labor market and pension reform) and endogenous labor 
4:110:7847:20:21:70:529:266:144:Times:144:Times:supply  components  (in  order  to  represent  possible  reform  backlash).  To  keep  the  language  
4:111:7949:21:21:70:528:245:144:Times:144:Times:simple,  we  call  the  exogenous  labor  supply  component  “labor  force  participation”,  and  the  
4:112:8052:21:21:70:528:224:144:Times:144:Times:endogenous  labor  supply  component  “working  hours”.  This  language  is  metaphorical  as  we  
4:113:8151:21:20:70:527:203:144:Times:144:Times:are well aware that both labor force participation and working hours have endogenous as well 
4:114:8244:20:42:70:201:183:144:Times:144:Times:as exogenous components. 
4:115:8269:42:20:106:253:141:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
4:116:8317:20:16:70:517:121:42:Times:100:Times:1  Similar multi-country OLG models have been developed, among others, by Feroli (2002), Henriksen (2002), 
4:117:8424:16:12:79:494:105:100:Times:100:Times:Brooks (2003), Domeij and Floden (2006), Attanasio, Kitao and Violante (2006, 2007) and Krüger and 
4:118:8523:12:0:79:144:93:100:Times:100:Times:Ludwig (2007). 
5:119:8539:0:21:70:524:760:144:Times:144:Times:The metaphorical language chosen comes from our thinking of labor market and pension re-
5:120:8627:21:21:70:524:739:144:Times:144:Times:forms as lifting institutional constraints. Typical constraints are a minimum labor market en-
5:121:8721:21:21:70:530:718:144:Times:144:Times:try  age  generated  by  the  school  system,  constraining  the  labor  force  participation  of  the  
5:122:8825:21:20:70:523:697:144:Times:144:Times:young; an early labor market exit age generated by the pension system, effectively constrain-
5:123:8918:20:21:70:527:677:144:Times:144:Times:ing the labor force participation of the old; inflexible working hours and unavailable day care 
5:124:9014:21:21:70:524:656:144:Times:144:Times:facilities, constraining female labor force participation. This view of lifting restrictions moti-
5:125:9112:21:20:70:528:635:144:Times:144:Times:vates our modeling strategy and the language behind it: labor market and pension reforms are 
5:126:9205:20:21:70:529:615:144:Times:144:Times:represented  by  exogenous  changes  of  labor  supply  at  the  extensive  margin  (the  number  of  
5:127:9307:21:27:70:233:594:144:Times:144:Times:working persons in an economy). 
5:128:9339:27:20:70:528:567:144:Times:144:Times:Households  then  are  modeled  to  respond  to  the  changes  of  labor  supply  by  changing  their  
5:129:9442:20:21:70:524:547:144:Times:144:Times:working  hours  (the  intensive  margin  of  labor  supply).  Endogenous  hours’  supply  may  in-
5:130:9540:21:21:70:528:526:144:Times:144:Times:crease,  e.g.,  if  distorting  social  security  taxes  and  contributions  decline  as  an  implication  of  
5:131:9651:21:20:70:523:505:144:Times:144:Times:pension  reform.  The  opposite  reaction  is  also  possible:  endogenous  hours’  supply  may  de-
5:132:9751:20:21:70:524:485:144:Times:144:Times:crease in response to an exogenous change of the number of working persons if there is intra-
5:133:9844:21:21:70:527:464:144:Times:144:Times:household substitution between the number of persons working and the hours worked by each 
5:134:9934:21:27:70:108:443:144:Times:144:Times:person. 
5:135:9942:27:20:70:527:416:144:Times:144:Times:Another important feature of our model is its multi-country nature. No country in Continental 
5:136:10036:20:21:70:529:396:144:Times:144:Times:Europe  is  even  approximately  modeled  by  a  closed  economy.  France,  Germany,  and  Italy  
5:137:10134:21:21:70:528:375:144:Times:144:Times:have large export sectors and considerable foreign direct investments. These provide a second 
5:138:10228:21:20:70:528:354:144:Times:144:Times:source  of  opportunities  during  the  global  aging  process:  not  all  income  needs  to  come  from  
5:139:10334:20:21:70:528:334:144:Times:144:Times:domestic  production,  and  GNP  may  become  substantially  larger  than  GDP  if  foreign  direct  
5:140:10435:21:21:70:529:313:144:Times:144:Times:investments  create  large  returns.  We  complement  France,  Germany,  and  Italy  as  countries  
5:141:10535:21:20:70:528:292:144:Times:144:Times:which  save  more  than  they  invest  with  the  U.S.  representing  the  rest  of  the  world  currently  
5:142:10643:20:27:70:288:272:144:Times:144:Times:absorbing the Continental European savings. 
5:143:10687:27:21:70:528:245:144:Times:144:Times:While  this  feature  is  important  for  a  credible  quantification  of  our  pension  and  labor  market  
5:144:10796:21:21:70:524:224:144:Times:144:Times:reform  analysis,  it  is  not  the  main  focus  of  this  paper.  We  refer  to  a  sister  paper,  Börsch-
5:145:10905:21:20:70:528:203:144:Times:144:Times:Supan,  Ludwig  and  Winter  (2007),  which  analyzes  the  resulting  international  capital  flows  
5:146:11007:20:27:70:510:183:144:Times:144:Times:and the associated rate of return developments, including the “asset meltdown hypothesis”. 
5:147:11098:27:21:70:527:156:144:Times:144:Times:The key results of our paper rest on a set of three-way comparisons that are best imagined by 
5:148:11192:21:20:70:527:135:144:Times:144:Times:a two-by-two-by-two table. The first dimension reflects labor market policies. One extreme is 
5:149:11286:20:21:70:528:115:144:Times:144:Times:the complete failure to adapt those institutional restrictions that keep labor force participation 
5:150:11385:21:0:70:528:94:144:Times:144:Times:so low in France, Germany, and Italy. The result are unchanged low labor force participation 
6:151:11479:0:21:70:524:760:144:Times:144:Times:rates by age and gender also in the future. The polar case, for some an extreme, is the adapta-
6:152:11574:21:21:70:527:739:144:Times:144:Times:tion of all societal systems from kindergarten to retirement policies to increase age and gender 
6:153:11671:21:27:70:342:718:144:Times:144:Times:specific labor force participation rates across the board.  
6:154:11731:27:20:70:528:691:144:Times:144:Times:As a second dimension, we model two extreme positions of pension policy. One extreme is a 
6:155:11821:20:21:70:528:671:144:Times:144:Times:fully-funded, voluntary private accounts system with no distortions and perfect intertemporal 
6:156:11915:21:21:70:524:650:144:Times:144:Times:consumption smoothing. The other extreme is a pay-as-you-go pension system with flat bene-
6:157:12005:21:20:70:528:629:144:Times:144:Times:fits financed by a contribution that is perceived as a pure tax with the associated labor supply 
6:158:12102:20:27:70:127:609:144:Times:144:Times:distortions. 
6:159:12115:27:21:70:527:582:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, the third dimension in these comparisons isolates behavioral effects. One extreme is a 
6:160:12211:21:20:70:527:561:144:Times:144:Times:fixed hours’ supply by each working individual. As polar case, we derive a supply function of 
6:161:12305:20:21:70:524:541:144:Times:144:Times:working hours which is responsive to wages net of taxes and contributions, but also to house-
6:162:12398:21:27:70:189:520:144:Times:144:Times:hold labor participation. 
6:163:12424:27:20:70:524:493:144:Times:144:Times:Our paper shows that direct quantity and indirect behavioral effects are large. They both sig-
6:164:12518:20:21:70:524:473:144:Times:144:Times:nificantly  affect  economic  growth  and  living  standards.  Due  to  strong  interaction  effects  be-
6:165:12623:21:21:70:524:452:144:Times:144:Times:tween pension system and labor markets, a smart combination of pension policy and adapta-
6:166:12712:21:21:70:528:431:144:Times:144:Times:tion of institutions related to the labor market can do more than each policy in isolation. We 
6:167:12807:21:20:70:524:410:144:Times:144:Times:show that they can offset the effects of population aging on economic growth and living stan-
6:168:12900:20:21:70:528:390:144:Times:144:Times:dards.  On  balance,  however,  behavioral  effects  dampen  such  reform  efforts.  Taking  positive  
6:169:13003:21:21:70:524:369:144:Times:144:Times:and negative behavioral effects into account, a combination of many policy measures is nec-
6:170:13094:21:26:70:512:348:144:Times:144:Times:essary in order to keep per capita consumption from falling behind the secular growth path. 
6:171:13186:26:21:70:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:The  rest  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  2  briefly  sets  the  demographic  back-
6:172:13293:21:21:70:528:301:144:Times:144:Times:ground.  Section  3  describes  the  current  labor  market  situation  and  our  labor  market  reform  
6:173:13398:21:20:70:527:280:144:Times:144:Times:scenarios. Section 4 presents the multi-country computational general equilibrium model with 
6:174:13491:20:21:70:527:260:144:Times:144:Times:a combination of exogenous and endogenous labor supply components. Section 5 delivers our 
6:175:13581:21:21:70:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:main  results  in  the  two-by-two-by-two  table  set  up.  We  vary  the  institutional  framework  of  
6:176:13686:21:21:70:524:218:144:Times:144:Times:labor  markets  and  pensions  in  order  to  investigate  the  interactions  between  pension  and  em-
6:177:13790:21:20:70:529:197:144:Times:144:Times:ployment  policies  and  the  behavioral  reactions  to  pension  and  labor  market  reform.  Since  
6:178:13892:20:21:70:529:177:144:Times:144:Times:higher  old-age  labor  force  participation  raises  issues  of  age-specific  productivity,  they  are  
6:179:13998:21:0:70:321:156:144:Times:144:Times:briefly addressed in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.

7:181:14066:29:20:70:528:729:144:Times:144:Times:While the patterns of population aging are similar in most countries, timing and extent differ 
7:182:14161:20:21:70:529:709:144:Times:144:Times:substantially.  The  United  States  is  considerably  younger  and  will  age  later  and  to  a  slower  
7:183:14268:21:21:70:528:688:144:Times:144:Times:extent  than  the  EU,  especially  Germany  and  Italy.  This  is  most  graphically  depicted  in  the  
7:184:14374:21:38:70:503:667:144:Times:144:Times:changing population pyramids of our four countries between 2000 and 2050, see figure 1.

7:188:14653:38:20:70:528:330:144:Times:144:Times:The differences are startling. While the U.S. population pyramid in 2050 features the normal 
7:189:14746:20:21:70:524:310:144:Times:144:Times:large base, Germany and Italy have strongly inverted population pyramids. The French pyra-
7:190:14836:21:21:70:528:289:144:Times:144:Times:mids  change  only  little  between  2000  and  2050,  with  relatively  small  differences  in  cohort  
7:191:14941:21:20:70:529:268:144:Times:144:Times:sizes  up  to  age  70.  These  differences  can  largely  be  attributed  to  different  fertility  rates  
7:192:15049:20:21:70:529:248:144:Times:144:Times:(France  and  the  U.S.  have  fertility  rates  close  to  the  replacement  level,  see  table  1),  while  
7:193:15159:21:21:70:527:227:144:Times:144:Times:Germany and Italy loose about a third of their population from generation to generation due to 
7:194:15254:21:0:70:226:206:144:Times:144:Times:fertility rates that are below 1.4.

8:209:16202:37:21:70:527:588:144:Times:144:Times:Life expectancy also differs remarkably among the four countries. This is accentuated in the 
8:210:16295:21:21:70:524:567:144:Times:144:Times:healthy  life  expectancy,  a  measure  developed  by  WHO  based  on  functional  ability:  it  meas-
8:211:16397:21:20:70:527:546:144:Times:144:Times:ures the expected age without functional limitation as defined by a set of disability indicators. 
8:212:16495:20:21:70:528:526:144:Times:144:Times:Healthy  life  expectancy  in  France  is  almost  four  years  higher  than  in  the  U.S.  Note  that  in  
8:213:16604:21:21:70:524:505:144:Times:144:Times:Europe healthy life expectancy is about 10 years higher than the average retirement age, pro-
8:214:16697:21:26:70:389:484:144:Times:144:Times:viding some room for an increase in retirement age, see section 3. 
8:215:16764:26:21:70:529:458:144:Times:144:Times:We  compute  the  future  demography  of  the  four  countries  based  on  three  key  assumptions.  
8:216:16865:21:21:70:529:437:144:Times:144:Times:First,  we  provide  projections  of  mortality  based  on  a  Lee-Carter  decomposition,  using  past  
8:217:16969:21:20:70:527:416:144:Times:144:Times:mortality rate changes derived from the Human Mortality Database (2008). Table 1 shows the 
8:218:17060:20:21:70:527:396:144:Times:144:Times:resulting life expectancies in 2050 (column 5). They coincide with the current UN projections 
8:219:17154:21:21:70:524:375:144:Times:144:Times:for Germany and the U.S., but are slightly higher for France and Italy (UN has age 85 com-
8:220:17244:21:27:70:373:354:144:Times:144:Times:pared while our projections yield age 86 and 87, respectively). 
8:221:17308:27:20:70:527:327:144:Times:144:Times:Second, we assume that fertility rates are exogenous and remain constant as given by table 1. 
8:222:17402:20:21:70:527:307:144:Times:144:Times:Third and similarly, we assume constant and exogenous migration flows, based on the current 
8:223:17494:21:21:70:529:286:144:Times:144:Times:medium  variant  of  the  UN  projections  (France    100,000,  Germany  150,000,  Italy  135,000,  
8:224:17594:21:20:70:524:265:144:Times:144:Times:and U.S. 1,100,000 net migrants per year) which is about the long-term average. It is impor-
8:225:17686:20:21:70:524:245:144:Times:144:Times:tant to note that these migration flows are small relative to the decline in the labor force pro-
8:226:17783:21:27:70:163:224:144:Times:144:Times:jected in section 3. 
8:227:17804:27:20:70:524:197:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 2 shows the total population aged 15 years and over which will be the base of our pro-
8:228:17897:20:21:70:528:177:144:Times:144:Times:jections and simulations. It reflects the stark differences among the population pyramids that 
8:229:17992:21:21:70:524:156:144:Times:144:Times:we have seen in figure 1. There will be population growth in France and the U.S. but signifi-
8:230:18085:21:21:70:527:135:144:Times:144:Times:cant decline in Germany and a somewhat smaller decline in Italy after 2020, mainly due to the 
8:231:18179:21:0:70:524:114:144:Times:144:Times:higher  expected  migration  to  Italy.  The  fifth  line  represents  the  aggregate  of  France,  Ger-

9:252:18651:31:21:70:524:411:144:Times:144:Times:Truly remarkable is the decline of the working age population (age 20-64), see figure 3. Rela-
9:253:18745:21:21:70:527:390:144:Times:144:Times:tive to total population aged 15 and older, the U.S. will loose about 10% of their working age

10:273:19362:28:21:70:524:419:144:Times:144:Times:Working age population is not equal to employment. The demographic differences, in particu-
10:274:19453:21:21:70:529:398:144:Times:144:Times:lar  those  between  Italy  and  the  U.S.,  are  dramatically  amplified  by  the  differences  in  labor  
10:275:19561:21:20:70:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:force participation. Figure 4 shows the percentage of individuals employed in the population 
10:276:19654:20:21:70:527:357:144:Times:144:Times:aged 15 and older. This is a variant of the “support ratio” reflecting the number of workers per 
10:277:19751:21:21:70:528:336:144:Times:144:Times:adult consumer. U.S. support rates are much higher than the European ones. In Europe, Italy 
10:278:19843:21:21:70:527:315:144:Times:144:Times:stands out with the lowest support ratio. Unlike to its demographic position, France shares the

11:299:20426:21:20:70:529:435:144:Times:144:Times:tion  rates.  Given  this  assumption,  Germany  has  about  the  same  low  support  ratio  in  2005  
11:300:20529:20:21:70:527:415:144:Times:144:Times:which the U.S. will have after 2040. In this sense, Germany is one generation ahead of the US 
11:301:20623:21:21:70:524:394:144:Times:144:Times:when  it  concerns  the  macroeconomic  balance  between  individuals  in  production  and  indi-

11:303:20741:26:21:70:524:347:144:Times:144:Times:Figure  4  also  shows  that  the  decline  of  the  support  ratio,  given  the  assumption  of  no  behav-
11:304:20849:21:21:70:530:326:144:Times:144:Times:ioral  changes,  will  be  more  pronounced  in  the  three  European  countries  than  in  the  U.S.  
11:305:20952:21:20:70:527:305:144:Times:144:Times:(24.3% vs. 15.0% between 2005 and 2050), aggravating the current differences of the support 
11:306:21044:20:27:70:226:285:144:Times:144:Times:ratios among the four countries. 
11:307:21077:27:21:70:527:258:144:Times:144:Times:Aggregate employment is a results of labor market entry age, female labor force participation, 
11:308:21172:21:20:70:527:237:144:Times:144:Times:unemployment rates, and labor market exit age, to name the four most important parameters. 
11:309:21263:20:21:70:528:217:144:Times:144:Times:These parameters are strongly governed by institutional restrictions. Labor market entry age, 
11:310:21357:21:21:70:528:196:144:Times:144:Times:e.g.,  is  a  function  of  the  school  system.  Germany,  e.g.,  has  a  regulations  that  generate  late  
11:311:21467:21:21:70:527:175:144:Times:144:Times:entries into the school system, a long duration in high schools and universities, and thus a late 
11:312:21565:21:20:70:528:154:144:Times:144:Times:labor market entry age. Similarly, female labor force participation is a function of institutions 
11:313:21663:20:21:70:529:134:144:Times:144:Times:such  as  kindergarten  and  afternoon  school  which  tend  to  be  provided  by  public  entities  in  
11:314:21768:21:21:70:523:113:144:Times:144:Times:Europe.  Unemployment  is  a  function  of  the  duration  and  generosity  of  unemployment  com-
11:315:21866:21:0:70:524:92:144:Times:144:Times:pensation. Labor market exit, finally, is strongly  governed  by  pension  regulations  that  effec-
12:316:21968:0:21:70:528:760:144:Times:144:Times:tively  make  the  early  eligibility  age  also  the  effective  age  of  labor  market  withdrawal.  Our  
12:317:22076:21:21:70:528:739:144:Times:144:Times:main point is, that from an individual’s point of view, labor supply has important exogenous 
12:318:22169:21:27:70:416:718:144:Times:144:Times:components which restrict possible endogenous labor supply decisions. 
12:319:22239:27:18:70:524:691:144:Times:144:Times:It is unlikely that these exogenous components remain unchanged over the course of popula-
12:320:22329:18:19:70:528:673:144:Times:144:Times:tion aging and the general change of society over the next two decades. We therefore define 
12:321:22421:19:18:70:524:654:144:Times:144:Times:two polar scenarios representing the potential changes in the institutional framework restrict-
12:322:22516:18:26:70:266:636:144:Times:144:Times:ing households’ labor supply decisions:

12:325:22753:25:20:70:448:566:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:• The labor market reform scenario (LREFORM) includes four reform steps: 
12:326:22825:20:20:106:395:546:144:Courier:144:Times:o RETAGE: an increase in the retirement age by 2 years; 
12:327:22880:20:19:106:398:526:144:Courier:144:Times:o JOBENTRY: a decrease in the job entry age by 2 years; 
12:328:22935:19:20:106:520:507:144:Courier:144:Times:o FEMLFP: an adaptation of female labor force participation rates to those of men; 
12:329:23017:20:27:106:451:487:144:Courier:144:Times:o UNEMP: a reduction of unemployment to 40% of its current level. 
12:330:23082:27:21:70:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:The increments are motivated by actual policy proposals: in Germany, the statutory retirement 
12:331:23176:21:20:70:520:439:144:Times:144:Times:age has been raised from 65 to 67 years in a serious of transitions until about 2020; in France 
12:332:23272:20:21:70:519:419:144:Times:144:Times:and Italy, similar steps will follow with some delay. The change in the European high school 
12:333:23365:21:21:70:501:398:144:Times:144:Times:and university system (the so called Bologna process) is expected to decrease duration in 
12:334:23455:21:20:70:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:schooling by about 2 years. Finally, 40% of current unemployment represents the conven-
12:335:23542:20:27:70:342:357:144:Times:144:Times:tional estimate of the NAIRU (Ball and Mankiw, 2002). 
12:336:23596:27:21:70:515:330:144:Times:144:Times:These reform steps will be phased in linearly between 2010 and 2050. The increase in retire-
12:337:23688:21:21:70:514:309:144:Times:144:Times:ment age (the decrease in the job entry age) is modeled as a shift of the distribution of labor 
12:338:23784:21:20:70:510:288:144:Times:144:Times:force participation rates by age to the right (to the left, respectively), thereby increasing the 
12:339:23882:20:27:70:331:268:144:Times:144:Times:flat part of the distribution in the middle, see figure 5. 
12:340:23941:27:21:70:495:241:144:Times:144:Times:Overall, these reform steps do not appear to be overly radical; in fact, their combination 
12:341:24032:21:20:70:521:220:144:Times:144:Times:would lead in 2040 to labor force participation rates fairly similar to those in Denmark today. 
12:342:24128:20:21:70:509:200:144:Times:144:Times:Nevertheless, attempts to actually execute reforms with those goals have faced stiff opposi-
12:343:24220:21:0:70:518:179:144:Times:144:Times:tion in France and Italy, and more recently and to a somewhat lesser extent also in Germany.

13:358:24701:21:20:70:527:436:144:Times:144:Times:step is additive to the one before; hence, the trajectory labeled “UNEMP” corresponds to the 
13:359:24794:20:27:70:374:416:144:Times:144:Times:LREFORM scenario of all four reform elements implemented. 
13:360:24852:27:21:70:528:389:144:Times:144:Times:The trajectories are very different across countries. France can easily compensate the slightly 
13:361:24948:21:20:70:527:368:144:Times:144:Times:declining number of individuals of working age by a combination of two or three of the above 
13:362:25041:20:21:70:528:348:144:Times:144:Times:policy  changes,  while  Germany  has  no  chance  to  offset  the  loss  in  working  age  population  
13:363:25145:21:27:70:293:327:144:Times:144:Times:even with a combination of all four measures. 
13:364:25191:27:20:70:527:300:144:Times:144:Times:The three countries also differ in the efficacy of the four policy parameters. Note in particular 
13:365:25289:20:21:70:527:280:144:Times:144:Times:Italy with a large jump if female labor force participation adapts to that of men. This is due to 
13:366:25387:21:21:70:529:259:144:Times:144:Times:the  very  low  female  labor  force  participation  currently  in  Italy.  The  irony  is  of  course  that,  
13:367:25498:21:20:70:524:238:144:Times:144:Times:because Italy’s pool of hitherto unused labor capacity (in particular women) is so large, tap-
13:368:25592:20:21:70:528:218:144:Times:144:Times:ping  it  provides  a  very  large  opportunity  to  counteract  the  effects  of  population  aging.  Italy,  
13:369:25703:21:21:70:528:197:144:Times:144:Times:while aging more than Germany, is thus much better off than Germany which has less room 
13:370:25791:21:0:70:247:176:144:Times:144:Times:to increase labor force participation. 
14:371:25832:0:21:70:528:760:144:Times:144:Times:Lower  labor  input  as  indicated  in  these  figures  will  most  likely  slow  down  Germany’s  and  
14:372:25936:21:21:70:526:739:144:Times:144:Times:possibly also Italy’s GDP growth.2 However, since total population will also decline, this does 
14:373:26032:21:21:70:528:718:144:Times:144:Times:not necessarily imply that standards of living will fall. Figure 7 therefore divides the number 
14:374:26128:21:20:70:527:697:144:Times:144:Times:of working persons by the population aged 15 and older, our support ratio. The main message 
14:375:26220:20:21:70:524:677:144:Times:144:Times:is that a combination of the four policy scenarios can in all countries, more or less also in Ger-
14:376:26318:21:21:70:528:656:144:Times:144:Times:many and Italy, stabilize these countries’ support ratio. This is a first very important message: 
14:377:26416:21:20:70:527:635:144:Times:144:Times:lifting labor market constraints and tapping into the pool of currently unused labor can offset 
14:378:26512:20:486:70:337:615:144:Times:144:Times:the force of aging in the three countries of Old Europe.

14:380:26617:20:16:70:523:109:42:Times:100:Times:2  Given the large share of labor in output and the history of total factor productivity, it is unlikely that productiv-
14:381:26737:16:0:79:414:93:100:Times:100:Times:ity growth and capital accumulation can overcompensate the decline in labor force.

17:481:27958:25:28:70:371:733:195:Times:195:Times:force participation and endogenous hours’ supply 
17:482:28007:28:20:70:528:705:144:Times:144:Times:We now construct a dynamic open-economy macroeconomic model that allows us to analyze 
17:483:28093:20:21:70:524:685:144:Times:144:Times:the  effects  of  the  labor  market  reforms  described  in  the  previous  section  on  GDP  and  con-
17:484:28197:21:21:70:527:664:144:Times:144:Times:sumption per capita in an aging Europe. As described in the introduction, labor supply has an 
17:485:28291:21:20:70:524:643:144:Times:144:Times:endogenous and an exogenous component. While we treat the reforms and the resulting varia-
17:486:28381:20:21:70:529:623:144:Times:144:Times:tion  in  employment  numbers  as  exogenous,  households  in  our  model  endogenously  adjust  
17:487:28478:21:27:70:423:602:144:Times:144:Times:hours worked and may thus counteract parts of the labor market reforms. 
17:488:28550:27:21:70:530:575:144:Times:144:Times:Our  main  assumptions  on  this  interplay  between  the  exogenous  variation  of  employment  
17:489:28647:21:20:70:524:554:144:Times:144:Times:numbers and hours worked are as follows. We model the decision of a household with prefer-
17:490:28737:20:21:70:529:534:144:Times:144:Times:ences  over  consumption  and  leisure.  Total  labor  supply  of  a  household  of  age  j  as  derived  
17:491:28843:21:21:70:528:513:144:Times:144:Times:from  the  household’s  optimization  is  the  product  of  exogenous  employment  numbers  lj,  and  
17:492:28945:21:20:70:527:492:144:Times:144:Times:the endogenous decision on hours worked at age j, hj. The crucial difference between the two 
17:493:29038:20:21:70:528:472:144:Times:144:Times:labor  supply  components  is  that  hours  worked  may  not  exceed  the  time  endowment  (which  
17:494:29138:21:27:70:460:451:144:Times:144:Times:we normalize to one) while employment numbers lj, can take any positive value. 
17:495:29217:27:20:70:528:424:144:Times:144:Times:As  the  age-specific  employment  lj  is  exogenously  increased,  e.g.,  due  to  an  increase  in  the  
17:496:29324:20:21:70:527:404:144:Times:144:Times:retirement age, the household endogenously decreases hours worked, hj. In the absence of any 
17:497:29417:21:21:70:524:383:144:Times:144:Times:constraints,  the  two  components  of  labor  supply  are  perfect  substitutes  such  that  the  exoge-
17:498:29522:21:21:70:524:362:144:Times:144:Times:nous variation of lj leaves the labor supply of the household unaffected. However, the exoge-
17:499:29615:21:20:70:527:341:144:Times:144:Times:nous variation of lj affects total effective labor supply for those households for whom the time 
17:500:29712:20:21:70:528:321:144:Times:144:Times:endowment constraint is binding. As a consequence, the exogenous employment variation of 
17:501:29801:21:21:70:529:300:144:g_d0_f8:144:Times:lj  has  some  effect  on  aggregate  effective  labor  supply  but  the  overall  effect  is  substantially  
17:502:29911:21:20:70:528:279:144:Times:144:Times:smaller  than  in  an  alternative  specification  of  our  model  with  fully  exogenous  labor  supply  
17:503:30017:20:39:70:105:259:144:Times:144:Times:where

17:505:30039:24:20:70:519:196:144:Times:144:Times:Time in our model is discrete and extends from t=0,...,T. Each model period t reflects a time 
17:506:30133:20:21:70:517:176:144:Times:144:Times:interval of 5 years. Our demographic projections, however, are more detailed with an annual 
17:507:30225:21:21:70:504:155:144:Times:144:Times:periodicity. These detailed demographic projections form the background of our analysis. 
17:508:30314:21:21:70:519:134:144:Times:144:Times:Demography is taken as exogenous. It represents one of the main driving force of our simula-

21:698:36813:24:21:70:527:288:145:Times:145:Times:Our time line has four periods: a phase-in period, a calibration period, a projection period, and 
21:699:36911:21:20:70:528:267:145:Times:145:Times:a phase-out period. First, we start calculations 110 years before the calibration period begins 
21:700:37007:20:21:70:528:247:145:Times:145:Times:with  the  assumption  of  an  “artificial”  initial  steady  state  in  1850.  The  time  period  between  
21:701:37115:21:21:70:524:226:145:Times:145:Times:1960 and 2004 is then used as calibration period in order to determine the structural parame-
21:702:37208:21:20:70:528:205:145:Times:145:Times:ters  of  the  model.  Our  projections  run  from  2005  through  2100.4  The  phase-out  period  after  
21:703:37314:20:21:70:524:185:145:Times:145:Times:2100  has  two  parts:  a  transition  to  a  steady-state  population  in  2200  and  an  additional  100-
21:704:37421:21:46:70:456:164:145:Times:145:Times:year period until the macroeconomic model reaches a final steady state in 2300.

22:707:37643:0:21:70:524:760:145:Times:145:Times:We determine the equilibrium path of the overlapping generations model by using the modi-
22:708:37732:21:21:70:524:739:145:Times:145:Times:fied Gauss-Seidel iteration as described in Ludwig (2006). The algorithm searches for equilib-
22:709:37826:21:21:70:528:718:145:Times:145:Times:rium  paths  of  capital  to  output  ratios,  and,  in  case  there  are  social  security  systems,  pension  
22:710:37938:21:38:70:240:697:145:Times:145:Times:contribution rates in each country.

22:712:37991:24:21:70:528:635:145:Times:145:Times:The  current  version  of  the  paper  features  a  calibration  that  is  based  on  an  ad  hoc  choice  of  
22:713:38102:21:20:70:524:614:145:Times:145:Times:parameters by reference to other studies. In future versions of the paper we will specify cer-
22:714:38196:20:21:70:528:594:145:Times:145:Times:tain calibration targets and determine deep structural model parameters by minimum distance 
22:715:38288:21:21:70:528:573:145:Times:145:Times:methods. In particular, we will emphasize a careful calibration of the consumption weight in 
22:716:38381:21:20:70:529:552:145:Times:145:Times:the  utility  function,  φ,  that  determines  the  relative  preference  for  labor  versus  leisure  and  
22:717:38489:20:21:70:529:532:145:Times:145:Times:thereby  indirectly  the  number  of  households  at  the  constraint  with  hj=1.  We  currently  set  
22:718:38593:21:21:70:530:511:145:g_d0_f9:145:Times:φ=0.66  which  corresponds  with  the  value  determined  by  minimum  distance  methods  in  
22:719:38687:21:27:70:282:490:145:Times:145:Times:Börsch-Supan, Ludwig and Winter (2006).  
22:720:38728:27:20:70:528:463:145:Times:145:Times:The  structural  model  parameters  are  summarized  in  table  2.  These  parameter  values  refer  to

23:731:39169:29:27:70:519:729:145:Times:145:Times:We structure our results by investigating three dimensions, each with two polar assumptions: 
23:732:39262:27:21:70:527:702:144:g_d0_f5:145:Times:• Labor market reforms: no reform at all, resulting in future labor force participation rates

24:779:41408:21:28:70:416:739:145:Times:145:Times:model emerge from the three exogenous changes that drive our model:

25:818:43267:30:21:70:524:346:145:Times:145:Times:The STATQUO scenario is marked by blue diamonds. It shows a steady decline of the num-
25:819:43353:21:27:70:440:325:145:Times:145:Times:ber of employed persons. The decline is about 20% between 2005 and 2050. 
25:820:43426:27:20:70:527:298:145:Times:145:Times:This is very different from the LREFORM scenario (marked by red triangles). The increase in 
25:821:43518:20:21:70:527:278:145:Times:145:Times:labor force participation due to all four reform steps – earlier entry in, and later exit from, the 
25:822:43618:21:21:70:524:257:145:Times:145:Times:labor  market,  more  women  working  and  less  unemployed  –  more  or  less  stabilizes  employ-
25:823:43717:21:20:70:527:236:145:Times:145:Times:ment in the EU-3 area. Labor supply declines only slightly after 2015 but increases again after 
25:824:43813:20:21:70:527:216:145:Times:145:Times:2035, the peak of the ageing process in Continental Europe. Except for the time between 2015 
25:825:43906:21:21:70:524:195:145:Times:145:Times:and 2035, when the losses in employment created by the retirement of the babyboom genera-
25:826:43995:21:21:70:524:174:145:Times:145:Times:tion are very large, the effects of labor market reforms and migration just compensate the ag-
25:827:44089:21:0:70:126:153:145:Times:145:Times:ing effects. 
26:828:44104:0:26:70:461:759:144:Times:144:Times:7.2 Intensive margin: the supply of hours for given labor force participation 
26:829:44182:26:21:70:527:733:145:Times:145:Times:The supply of working hours now reacts to the exogenous change in labor force participation 
26:830:44274:21:21:70:524:712:145:Times:145:Times:according to the household’s maximization problem as specified in subsection 4.3. We distin-
26:831:44366:21:20:70:528:691:145:Times:145:Times:guish two cases: households which are constrained by the time endowment limit (equation 7 
26:832:44456:20:27:70:352:671:145:Times:145:Times:in section 4.3), and households which are not constrained. 
26:833:44515:27:21:70:530:644:145:Times:145:Times:Given  the  calibration  parameters,  about  58%  of  households  are  not  constrained  in  2005,  
26:834:44615:21:20:70:528:623:145:Times:145:Times:mainly  middle  aged  households.  The  difference  between  France  and  Germany  on  one  side,  
26:835:44714:20:21:70:528:603:145:Times:145:Times:and  Italy  on  the  other  side,  is  large:  in  France,  67%  of  all  households  are  unconstrained,  in  
26:836:44825:21:21:70:528:582:145:Times:145:Times:Germany  63%,  while  only  43%  of  Italian  households  can  work  as  much  as  they  would  like.  
26:837:44928:21:20:70:525:561:145:Times:145:Times:These households fully undo exogenous policy changes by adjusting their working hours in-
26:838:45017:20:21:70:524:541:145:Times:145:Times:versely, since for them hours h and persons l are perfect substitutes (equations 5 and 6 in sec-
26:839:45113:21:21:70:524:520:145:Times:145:Times:tion 4.3). One might think of these households as a couple. In the status-quo regime, one per-
26:840:45207:21:21:70:528:499:145:Times:145:Times:son  was  restricted  to  work  while  the  other  person  worked  as  much  as  the  household  needed  
26:841:45312:21:20:70:528:478:145:Times:145:Times:for consumption and saving. Once the restriction for the first person was lifted, however, the 
26:842:45407:20:21:70:529:458:145:Times:145:Times:couple  distributes  the  work  more  equally  between  the  two  persons  without  increasing  total  
26:843:45510:21:27:70:231:437:145:Times:145:Times:hours supplied by the household. 
26:844:45543:27:20:70:524:410:145:Times:145:Times:Figure 9 shows this from a microeconomic perspective, i.e., on the level of an individual rep-
26:845:45637:20:21:70:529:390:145:Times:145:Times:resentative  households  of  each  age  class,  separately  for  each  country.  For  unconstrained  
26:846:45738:21:21:70:528:369:145:Times:145:Times:households (hours less than one), the hours (marked by red squares) respond inversely to the 
26:847:45831:21:20:70:527:348:145:Times:145:Times:changes in participation (blue diamonds) when moving from the status quo (left panels) to the 
26:848:45925:20:27:70:236:328:145:Times:145:Times:LREFORM regime (right panels). 
26:849:45956:27:21:70:524:301:145:Times:145:Times:The  remaining  42%  of  households  have  been  constrained  under  the  labor  market  policy  re-
26:850:46056:21:21:70:528:280:145:Times:145:Times:gimes in 2005. This is the majority in Italy, where 57% of all households are constrained, and 
26:851:46151:21:20:70:527:259:145:Times:145:Times:roughly a third in France (33%) and Germany (37%). These households are shown in figure 9 
26:852:46241:20:21:70:528:239:145:Times:145:Times:as those households which have an hours supply of exactly one: the very young and the old. 
26:853:46332:21:21:70:527:218:145:Times:145:Times:Releasing these constraints generates more hours supply when the policies are phased in over 
26:854:46425:21:20:70:528:197:145:Times:145:Times:time. This is visible in the lower number of households on the hours=1 line in the LREFORM 
26:855:46516:20:27:70:481:177:145:Times:145:Times:scenarios (right panels) than under STATQUO labor force participation (left panels). 
26:856:46601:27:21:70:530:150:145:Times:145:Times:Taking  both  participation  and  hours  together  yields  total  labor  supply  of  the  household  
26:857:46702:21:20:70:528:129:145:Times:145:Times:(marked  by  yellow  triangles  in  figure  9).  It  is  much  higher  for  the  younger  and  older  age  
26:858:46809:20:0:70:524:109:145:Times:145:Times:groups in the LREFORM scenario as compared  to  the  STATQUO  scenario,  but  remains  un-
27:859:46901:0:21:70:529:760:145:Times:145:Times:changed  for  the  unconstrained  middle  aged  households  which  perfectly  substitute  between  
27:860:47000:21:33:70:222:739:145:Times:145:Times:participation and hours supply.

28:967:48300:33:21:70:527:697:145:Times:145:Times:20-64). Hours are normalized to 100% in 2005 within each scenario. Hence, they are adjusted 
28:968:48392:21:20:70:528:676:145:Times:145:Times:for any level effects generated by pension and labor market policies that create cross-country 
28:969:48487:20:27:70:207:656:145:Times:145:Times:differences already in 2005. 
28:970:48516:27:21:70:528:629:145:Times:145:Times:Figure  10  shows  the  hours  result  for  the  eight  scenarios  defined  in  table  3.  Population  aging  
28:971:48626:21:21:70:528:608:145:Times:145:Times:generates  declining  hours  in  all  scenarios.  There  is,  of  course,  no  difference  among  the  four  
28:972:48735:21:20:70:529:587:145:Times:145:Times:scenarios  with  exogenous  hours  supply  as  this  is  fixed  to  one.  It  can  be  interpreted  as  the  
28:973:48844:20:21:70:527:567:145:Times:145:Times:baseline which reflects the decline in working age population without any reaction in supplied 
28:974:48939:21:27:70:146:546:145:Times:145:Times:working hours. 
28:975:48954:27:20:70:528:519:145:Times:145:Times:The  reaction  of  the  endogenous  hours’  supply  differs  by  labor  market  and  pension  scenario.  
28:976:49059:20:21:70:528:499:145:Times:145:Times:Hours  are  much  lower  in  the  LREFORM  scenarios  (red  triangles)  than  under  constant  labor  
28:977:49161:21:27:70:333:478:145:Times:145:Times:force participation rates (STATQUO, blue diamonds). 
28:978:49213:27:20:70:529:451:145:Times:145:Times:There  are  interesting  interaction  effects  between  labor  market  and  pension  reform.  Without  
28:979:49316:20:21:70:528:431:145:Times:145:Times:labor market reform, hours’ supply is almost identical in the FLATSS and SAVING pension 
28:980:49404:21:21:70:527:410:145:Times:145:Times:scenarios; actually, hours supplied are a bit lower in the pension reform scenario. This relation 
28:981:49502:21:21:70:528:389:145:Times:145:Times:reverts  when  the  labor  reforms  are  put  in  place.  If  labor  market  and  pension  reform  concur,  
28:982:49610:21:20:70:528:368:145:Times:145:Times:hours’  supply  is  higher  than  in  the  case  when  labor  markets  are  reformed  without  a  pension  
28:983:49717:20:27:70:112:348:145:Times:145:Times:reform.  
28:984:49726:27:21:70:524:321:145:Times:145:Times:A microeconomic perspective of this interaction effect is given in figure 9 for the case of Ger-
28:985:49822:21:20:70:524:300:145:Times:145:Times:many. A comparison between the second and the third left panels shows that the hours reduc-
28:986:49913:20:21:70:527:280:145:Times:145:Times:tion is much smaller in a funded pension system than in a flat-benefits pay-as-you-go system. 
28:987:50007:21:21:70:524:259:145:Times:145:Times:This reflects the negative incentive effect of high distorting taxes. Under the LREFORM sce-
28:988:50099:21:20:70:528:238:145:Times:145:Times:nario  (right  panels)  fewer  households  are  constrained  by  labor  market  institutions.  More  age  
28:989:50205:20:21:70:524:218:145:Times:145:Times:groups therefore substitute hours for participation within a household. Since the hours reduc-
28:990:50299:21:0:70:476:197:145:Times:145:Times:tion is much smaller in the funded pension system, more total labor supply remains.

30:1065:51137:0:21:70:527:760:145:Times:145:Times:Another way to understand the interaction effects is taking first differences in the direction of 
30:1066:51235:21:21:70:528:739:145:Times:145:Times:each dimension of the two-by-two-by-two table 3. This is done in the three smaller panels of 
30:1067:51328:21:21:70:529:718:145:Times:145:Times:figure  10  labeled  “interaction  effects”.  The  first  panel  shows  the  impact  of  a  radical  social  
30:1068:51437:21:20:70:524:697:145:Times:145:Times:security  reform.  Hours  increase  under  a  funded  system  via-a-vis  the  pay-as-go  system  if  ex-
30:1069:51541:20:21:70:524:677:145:Times:145:Times:ogenous  labor  force  participation  also  increases.  The  difference  is  zero  if  hours  are  exoge-
30:1070:51646:21:27:70:474:656:145:Times:145:Times:nous, and very small, but negative if labor force participation remains at status quo. 
30:1071:51733:27:20:70:529:629:145:Times:145:Times:The  second  panel  displays  the  difference  between  higher  and  unchanged  exogenous  labor  
30:1072:51831:20:21:70:528:609:145:Times:145:Times:force  participation.  Hours  react  negatively  because  of  intra-household  substitution  between  
30:1073:51933:21:21:70:528:588:145:Times:145:Times:hours  and  labor  force  participation.  This  effect  offsets  some,  but  not  all  of  the  higher  labor  
30:1074:52044:21:20:70:527:567:145:Times:145:Times:force participation as we will see in the following subsection. The offsetting effect is higher in 
30:1075:52143:20:21:70:528:547:145:Times:145:Times:a  distorting  pay-as-you-go  system.  We  may  interpret  the  additional  difference  between  the  
30:1076:52245:21:21:70:528:526:145:Times:145:Times:two lines in the second interaction effect as an incentive effect due to distorting taxes, while 
30:1077:52342:21:21:70:524:505:145:Times:145:Times:the  difference  between  the  horizontal  axis  and  the  yellow  line  is  the  substitution  effect  be-
30:1078:52449:21:26:70:274:484:145:Times:145:Times:tween hours and labor force participation. 
30:1079:52492:26:21:70:528:458:145:Times:145:Times:The  third  panel  summarizes  these  effects  as  it  displays  the  difference  between  endogenous  
30:1080:52595:21:21:70:524:437:145:Times:145:Times:and  exogenous  hours’  supply  under  the  four  combinations  of  pension  and  labor  market  re-
30:1081:52695:21:20:70:529:416:145:Times:145:Times:gimes  while  the  two  former  graphs  can  be  interpreted  as  differences  in  differences.  Quite  
30:1082:52799:20:21:70:528:396:145:Times:145:Times:clearly, there is a strong and beneficial interaction between changing the pension system and 
30:1083:52893:21:33:70:419:375:145:Times:145:Times:lifting labor market restrictions. This is an important result of our paper.

33:1188:55285:26:21:70:524:733:145:Times:145:Times:The hourly wage rate is depicted in Figure 12. It more or less reflects the supply of total effec-

33:1191:55483:26:21:70:531:665:145:Times:145:Times:The   hourly   wage   increases   more   in   the   STATUSQUO   (blue   diamonds)   than   in   the

33:1193:55687:21:20:70:528:623:145:Times:145:Times:under  a  funded  system  (yellow  lines)  than  under  pay-as-you-go  (blue  lines).  The  additional  
33:1194:55791:20:21:70:528:603:145:Times:145:Times:capital  accumulation  lowers  interests  and  raises  labor  productivity,  thus  also  the  wage  rate.  
33:1195:55898:21:21:70:528:582:145:Times:145:Times:Finally, the wage rate increase more when hours are exogenous (dashed lines). This effect is 
33:1196:55991:21:20:70:524:561:145:Times:145:Times:very small when labor force participation rates do not change (STATQUO) but it is substan-
33:1197:56081:20:27:70:387:541:145:Times:145:Times:tial in the LREFORM scenario, when the hours’ reaction is large. 
33:1198:56146:27:21:70:527:514:145:Times:145:Times:Considering the massive decline in total labor supply,  the  hourly  wage  rate  reacts  somewhat

35:1277:57158:21:21:70:528:712:145:Times:145:Times:and  Italy.  As  expected,  capital  accumulation  is  much  higher  under  a  funded  pension  system  
35:1278:57262:21:20:70:527:691:145:Times:145:Times:than in a pay-as-you-go system as can be seen in the first panel of interactions. There is also 
35:1279:57358:20:21:70:532:671:145:Times:145:Times:substantially   more   capital   accumulation   in   the   high   labor   force   participation   scenario   
35:1280:57467:21:21:70:524:650:145:Times:145:Times:(LREFORM)  as  compared  to  constant  participation  (STATQUO).  This  is  visible  in  the  sec-
35:1281:57565:21:20:70:528:629:145:Times:145:Times:ond  panel  on  interaction  effects.  Finally,  the  third  panel  shows  that  capital  accumulation  is  
35:1282:57673:20:21:70:524:609:145:Times:145:Times:higher  if  endogenous  hours’  supply  is  not  dampening  the  effect  of  a  higher  labor  force  par-
35:1283:57779:21:27:70:122:588:145:Times:144:Times:ticipation.

35:1285:57895:20:21:70:529:541:145:Times:145:Times:highest  under  a  fully-funded  system  with  high  labor  force  participation  and  no  dampening  
35:1286:57997:21:21:70:524:520:145:Times:145:Times:effect  of  endogenous  hours  (SV-RF-EX). It is lowest in a pay-as-you-go  system  with  status-
35:1287:58094:21:0:70:502:499:145:Times:145:Times:quo labor force participation and the full force of negative incentive effects (FL-SQ-EN).

37:1362:58942:26:21:70:527:733:145:Times:145:Times:Our first target variable is economic growth, measured as the change in GDP per capita, net of 
37:1363:59037:21:21:70:530:712:145:Times:145:Times:exogenous  growth  in  total  factor  productivity.  This  is  displayed  in  figure  14.  Economic  
37:1364:59138:21:20:70:528:691:145:Times:145:Times:growth  relative  to  secular  productivity  growth  is  very  much  affected  by  the  combination  of  
37:1365:59243:20:21:70:524:671:145:Times:145:Times:pension and labor market policies. With exogenous hours, growth is highest and always posi-
37:1366:59334:21:21:70:528:650:145:Times:145:Times:tive when labor supply restrictions are released and pensions are financed by a funded system. 
37:1367:59429:21:20:70:528:629:145:Times:145:Times:In  turn,  growth  (after  adjusting  for  TFP  increases)  is  lowest  and  always  negative  under  the  
37:1368:59536:20:21:70:530:609:145:Times:145:Times:opposite  combination  of  policies.  This  is  a  strong  message:  in  spite  of  aging,  economic  
37:1369:59638:21:21:70:528:588:145:Times:145:Times:growth  can  be  as  high  as  historically  given  by  the  estimated  long-run  growth  of  total  factor  
37:1370:59747:21:20:70:528:567:145:Times:145:Times:productivity.  It  can  even  be  increased  by  a  smart  combination  of  pension  and  labor  market  
37:1371:59852:20:21:70:527:547:145:Times:145:Times:policies. However, it can also secularly decline behind the path which we have experienced in 
37:1372:59946:21:27:70:116:526:145:Times:145:Times:the past.  
37:1373:59957:27:21:70:528:499:145:Times:145:Times:The quantities are large: the difference between the best and the worst scenario is about 20% 
37:1374:60051:21:20:70:527:478:145:Times:145:Times:in 2040 and 30% in 2050. This must be seen in comparison to total factor productivity growth 
37:1375:60144:20:21:70:527:458:145:Times:145:Times:which is about 90% over the period from 2005 to 2050, almost doubling output.6 Remaining 
37:1376:60233:21:21:70:524:437:145:Times:145:Times:at  status  quo  in  terms  of  labor  market  and  pension  policy  will  “eat  up”  about  a  third  of  pro-
37:1377:60344:21:20:70:527:416:145:Times:145:Times:ductivity growth. Reform backlash is about half of this: it reduces the effect of labor market 
37:1378:60439:20:27:70:452:396:145:Times:145:Times:reform on GDP per capita to about half the size with unchanged hours’ supply. 
37:1379:60517:27:21:70:528:369:145:Times:145:Times:The eight output paths in figure 14 can be derived as a straightforward combination of labor 
37:1380:60610:21:20:70:527:348:145:Times:145:Times:and capital inputs displayed in figures 11 and 13. Output per capita is unequivocally higher in 
37:1381:60706:20:21:70:524:328:145:Times:145:Times:a  fully-funded  pension  system  without  distorting  taxes  as  compared  to  a  pay-as-you-go  pen-
37:1382:60808:21:21:70:527:307:145:Times:145:Times:sion system with flat benefits. Output per capita is similarly clearly higher when labor market 
37:1383:60904:21:21:70:527:286:145:Times:145:Times:restrictions are removed (LREFORM) than in the status-quo scenario. The latter two findings 
37:1384:60996:21:26:70:406:265:145:Times:145:Times:are clearly seen in the first two small panels below the large diagram. 
37:1385:61068:26:21:70:527:239:145:Times:145:Times:The third panel shows the interaction between pension and labor market policies in the case of

39:1464:62520:21:21:70:528:712:145:Times:145:Times:tion per capita. As we did it for output, we normalize consumption per capita by secular total 
39:1465:62615:21:20:70:528:691:145:Times:145:Times:productivity  growth.  The  evolution  of  living  standards  very  much  parallels  that  of  GDP  per  
39:1466:62720:20:21:70:528:671:145:Times:145:Times:capita;  there  are  no  major  deviations  in  the  growth  patterns  of  output  and  consumption  as  it  
39:1467:62829:21:27:70:322:650:145:Times:145:Times:concerns the relative position of the eight scenarios. 
39:1468:62884:27:20:70:527:623:145:Times:145:Times:Saving in young age and dissaving in old age, however, smoothes some of the effects that we 
39:1469:62976:20:21:70:524:603:145:Times:145:Times:have  seen  in  figure  14.  A  notable  example  is  the  evolution  of  living  standards  in  the  fully-
39:1470:63084:21:21:70:524:582:145:Times:145:Times:funded pensions, high labor force participation, and endogenous hours’ supply scenario (SV-
39:1471:63175:21:20:70:527:561:145:Times:145:Times:RF-EN). Living standards remain very close to the secular growth path (the horizontal line), 
39:1472:63268:20:21:70:528:541:145:Times:145:Times:while  the  associated  GDP  per  capita  exhibited  a  stronger  increase  until  2020  followed  by  a  
39:1473:63374:21:27:70:144:520:145:Times:145:Times:strong decline. 
39:1474:63390:27:21:70:528:493:145:Times:145:Times:This shows that a smart combination of labor market and pension policies can stabilize living 
39:1475:63484:21:20:70:523:472:145:Times:145:Times:standards in Continental Europe in spite of population aging and an adverse behavioral reac-
39:1476:63576:20:21:70:527:452:145:Times:145:Times:tion to the structural policy changes. In turn, this stabilization needs more than a half-hearted 
39:1477:63674:21:21:70:528:431:145:Times:145:Times:pension  reform  or  a  few  adjustments  in  labor  market  restrictions.  All  labor  market  policies  
39:1478:63780:21:20:70:524:410:145:Times:145:Times:described in section 3 are needed in addition to a secular pension reform; other policy scenar-
39:1479:63875:20:21:70:528:390:145:Times:145:Times:ios  imply  that  living  standards  in  Continental  Europe  will  grow  slower  than  what  we  have  
39:1480:63979:21:21:70:527:369:145:Times:145:Times:experienced in the past. Living standards will not decline because secular productivity growth 
39:1481:64074:21:20:70:524:348:145:Times:145:Times:is still stronger than aging. Living standards, however, will decline relative to all other coun-

41:1559:64968:29:20:70:529:729:145:Times:145:Times:If  labor  productivity  is  age  dependent,  a  shift  in  the  age  structure  will  also  bring  about  a  
41:1560:65078:20:21:70:529:709:145:Times:145:Times:change  in  aggregate  productivity,  even  if  age-specific  productivity  were  to  remain  constant.  
41:1561:65183:21:21:70:528:688:145:Times:145:Times:Moreover, if labor productivity declines strongly after, say, age 60, an increase in retirement 
41:1562:65279:21:20:70:523:667:145:Times:145:Times:age  will  not  have  much  effect  on  aggregate  output.  This  brief  section  provides  a  gross  esti-
41:1563:65386:20:27:70:311:647:145:Times:145:Times:mate of the approximate magnitude of this effect. 
41:1564:65436:27:21:70:528:620:145:Times:145:Times:This is not a simple task, however, as there is no reliable data available on age-specific labor 
41:1565:65533:21:20:70:527:599:145:Times:145:Times:productivity, see the review by Skirbekk (2004). Barth et al. (1993) conclude from a survey of 
41:1566:65628:20:21:70:528:579:145:Times:145:Times:human  resource  executives  in  406  organizations  that  “Older  workers  were  consistently  rated  
41:1567:65731:21:21:70:524:558:145:Times:145:Times:as having more positive attitudes being more reliable and possessing better skills than the av-
41:1568:65826:21:21:70:528:537:145:Times:145:Times:erage  worker;  they  were  rated  worse  than  the  average  worker  when  it  comes  to  health  care  
41:1569:65931:21:20:70:528:516:145:Times:145:Times:costs, flexibility in accepting new assignments, and suitability for training.” Hutchins (2001) 
41:1570:66027:20:21:70:524:496:145:Times:145:Times:questions the usefulness of such employer survey to address these issues because of justifica-
41:1571:66121:21:21:70:528:475:145:Times:145:Times:tion  bias.  Kotlikoff  and  Wise  (1989)  evaluate  confidential  data  originating  from  a  major  US  
41:1572:66227:21:20:70:529:454:145:Times:145:Times:American  service  enterprise  in  which  output  is  well  defined.  They  provide  two  estimates  
41:1573:66328:20:21:70:524:434:145:Times:145:Times:which  can  be  used  to  proxy  productivity.  One  measure  uses  age  and  seniority-specific  earn-
41:1574:66431:21:21:70:528:413:145:Times:145:Times:ings of sales staff which can be measured by the sale of insurance contracts, hence a kind of 
41:1575:66525:21:20:70:528:392:145:Times:145:Times:piece rate. Corrected for seniority, the age profile of these piece rates is relatively flat. Their 
41:1576:66625:20:21:70:528:372:145:Times:145:Times:second  measure  is  the  entry  salary  of  clerks.  This  profile  is  much  more  hump  shape.  Both  
41:1577:66730:21:21:70:527:351:145:Times:145:Times:measures are likely to suffer from selection effects. Börsch-Supan, Düzgün and Weiss (2006) 
41:1578:66822:21:21:70:527:330:145:Times:145:Times:use another approach. They used confidential data on error rates in a large assembly line style 
41:1579:66918:21:20:70:524:309:145:Times:145:Times:car manufacturing factory. Output and production times are perfectly controllable in this envi-
41:1580:67013:20:21:70:524:289:145:Times:145:Times:ronment,  permitting  a  direct  estimate  of  productivity.  They  find  that  age  and  experience  ef-
41:1581:67118:21:21:70:524:268:145:Times:145:Times:fects cancel, such that the resulting productivity profile is essentially flat, with reliable obser-
41:1582:67218:21:26:70:200:247:145:Times:145:Times:vations until about age 63. 
41:1583:67246:26:21:70:528:221:145:Times:145:Times:How do these microeconomic differences translate into macroeconomic differences? In order 
41:1584:67336:21:21:70:527:200:145:Times:145:Times:to get some feeling, we underlie our simulations with two alternative age-productivity profiles 
41:1585:67432:21:20:70:528:179:145:Times:145:Times:(in our model represented by εj, see subsection 4.3). One profile is flat; the other imposes the 
41:1586:67529:20:21:70:527:159:145:Times:145:Times:sharp hump shape depicted in figure 16. It features a strong decline of productivity after age 
41:1587:67624:21:0:70:290:138:145:Times:145:Times:60. We treat these age profiles as exogenous.

43:1621:68481:29:20:70:528:729:145:Times:145:Times:We  have  simulated  a  set  of  far-reaching  pension  and  labor  market  policies  and  investigated  
43:1622:68586:20:21:70:529:709:145:Times:145:Times:their  impact  on  production  and  consumption  per  capita  in  three  large  Continental  European  
43:1623:68689:21:21:70:527:688:145:Times:145:Times:countries. A new feature of our computational general equilibrium model is a combination of 
43:1624:68781:21:20:70:527:667:145:Times:145:Times:exogenous changes of labor supply at the extensive margin (metaphorically represented in our 
43:1625:68874:20:21:70:528:647:145:Times:145:Times:model  by  the  number  of  working  persons)  and  endogenous  responses  of  labor  supply  at  the  
43:1626:68977:21:21:70:529:626:145:Times:145:Times:intensive  margin  (metaphorically  called  working  hours).  We  think  of  exogenous  changes  as  
43:1627:69078:21:20:70:524:605:145:Times:145:Times:lifting institutional restrictions generated by the school system, actuarially unfair pension sys-
43:1628:69176:20:21:70:524:585:145:Times:145:Times:tems,  inflexible  working  hours,  and  unavailable  day  care  facilities.  The  endogenous  compo-
43:1629:69277:21:21:70:529:564:145:Times:145:Times:nent  of  labor  supply  (“hours”  chosen  by  the  household  members)  reacts  to  the  exogenous  
43:1630:69378:21:21:70:527:543:145:Times:145:Times:component of labor supply (“working persons” freed from labor market restrictions), but also 
43:1631:69471:21:26:70:434:522:145:Times:145:Times:to social security taxes and to the aging process itself and its repercussions. 
43:1632:69551:26:21:70:524:496:145:Times:145:Times:Our paper shows that direct quantity and indirect behavioral effects are large. They both sig-
43:1633:69645:21:21:70:528:475:145:Times:145:Times:nificantly  affect  economic  growth  and  living  standards.  Due  to  the  strong  interaction  effects  
43:1634:69752:21:20:70:524:454:145:Times:145:Times:between pension system and labor markets, a smart combination of pension policy and adap-
43:1635:69841:20:21:70:528:434:145:Times:145:Times:tation  of  institutions  related  to  the  labor  market  can  do  more  than  such  policies  in  isolation.  
43:1636:69953:21:21:70:527:413:145:Times:145:Times:We show that they could easily offset the effects of population aging on economic growth and 
43:1637:70046:21:20:70:524:392:145:Times:145:Times:living  standards  if  there  were  no  endogenous  behavioral  reactions.  On  balance,  these  behav-
43:1638:70149:20:21:70:527:372:145:Times:145:Times:ioral effects dampen reform efforts, thus representing reform backlashes in our model. Taking 
43:1639:70243:21:21:70:528:351:145:Times:145:Times:behavioral effects into account, a combination of many policy measures is necessary in order 
43:1640:70336:21:21:70:527:330:145:Times:145:Times:to keep per capita consumption from falling behind the secular growth path. If these measures 
43:1641:70430:21:20:70:524:309:145:Times:145:Times:are taken, Old Europe can maintain her high living standards in spite of aging. This is an im-
43:1642:70524:20:27:70:456:289:145:Times:145:Times:portant message for the never ending reform debate on the European Continent. 
43:1643:70602:27:21:70:528:262:145:Times:145:Times:The  key  of  our  approach  –  the  combination  of  an  exogenous  variation  of  employment  rates  
43:1644:70705:21:20:70:524:241:145:Times:145:Times:with endogenous hours choice – has its advantages and disadvantages. It provides a theoreti-
43:1645:70797:20:21:70:524:221:145:Times:145:Times:cally consistent way to model the subtle balance between policy changes and individual reac-
43:1646:70889:21:21:70:524:200:145:Times:145:Times:tions. From an empirical point of view, this approach puts a lot of pressure to get the calibra-
43:1647:70985:21:20:70:529:179:145:Times:145:Times:tion  right  in  order  to  achieve  a  realistic  number  of  households  that  are  constrained  by  labor  
43:1648:71095:20:21:70:529:159:145:Times:145:Times:market  restrictions  (expressed  less  metaphorically:  the  balance  between  what  is  exogenous  
43:1649:71196:21:21:70:524:138:145:Times:145:Times:and what is endogenous in labor supply). The current version of the paper features a calibra-
43:1650:71289:21:0:70:528:117:145:Times:145:Times:tion  that  is  based  on  an  ad  hoc  choice  of  parameters  by  reference  to  other  studies.  In  future  
44:1651:71403:0:21:70:527:760:145:Times:145:Times:versions of the paper we will specify certain calibration targets and determine deep structural 
44:1652:71499:21:27:70:468:739:145:Times:145:Times:model parameters by minimum distance methods as we have done in earlier work. 
44:1653:71577:27:21:70:524:712:145:Times:145:Times:From a theoretical point of view, we do not model a motive for households to actually partici-
44:1654:71671:21:20:70:528:691:145:Times:145:Times:pate  in  the  labor  market.  An  alternative  approach  making  the  metaphorical  distinction  more  
44:1655:71775:20:21:70:528:671:145:Times:145:Times:realistic  would  be  to  model  the  decisions  endogenously at both margins. This could be done 
44:1656:71873:21:21:70:528:650:145:Times:145:Times:by  accounting  for  home  production  and  preferences  for  leisure  goods  as  in  Greenwood  and  
44:1657:71975:21:20:70:527:629:145:Times:145:Times:Vandenbroucke (2005) and by explicitly modeling the institutions that determine households 
44:1658:72066:20:21:70:528:609:145:Times:145:Times:labor market participation decision, e.g., along the lines of Garibaldi and Wasmer (2005) and 
44:1659:72160:21:21:70:527:588:145:Times:145:Times:Guner, Kaygusuz and Ventura (2008). We speculate that removing these frictions would lead 
44:1660:72250:21:20:70:528:567:145:Times:145:Times:to  stronger  total  labor  supply  reactions  than  in  our  model.  Such  extensions  of  our  model  are  
44:1661:72359:20:27:70:198:547:145:Times:145:Times:subject of future research.
