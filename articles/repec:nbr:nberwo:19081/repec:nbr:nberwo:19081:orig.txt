3:56:2609:0:29:255:359:706:195:g_d0_f4:195:g_d0_f6:1. Introduction	
3:57:2624:29:16:72:519:677:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Policy makers have long faced challenges in designing and implementing tax legislation 
3:58:2711:16:16:72:534:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that provides the intended benefits while at the same time avoiding abuse.  This tension is 
3:59:2803:16:16:72:509:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:well illustrated in a long and diverse series of United States tax shelter cases in which 
3:60:2893:16:16:72:490:629:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:parties disagree over the nature of tax-advantaged transactions:  corporations, or 
3:61:2976:16:17:72:507:613:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxpayers, argue that the terms of the transaction comply with the tax code while the 
3:62:3062:17:16:72:532:596:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government argues that the transaction violates the spirit of that law.  In order to address 
3:63:3155:16:16:72:540:580:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:challenges associated with interpreting complex provisions of the tax code, the Courts have 
3:64:3247:16:16:72:517:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:established an economic substance test that is based on evaluating whether a taxpayer 
3:65:3333:16:26:72:454:548:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would have undertaken the actions at hand absent their tax consequences. 
3:66:3406:26:17:72:529:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Traditionally some sort of discounted cash flow analysis is used to evaluate the economic 
3:67:3496:17:16:72:531:505:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substance of tax-motivated transactions. Such an analysis compares the incremental, risk-
3:68:3585:16:16:72:534:489:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adjusted benefits of the activities with the incremental risk-adjusted costs, ignoring taxes.  
3:69:3680:16:16:72:517:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The purpose is to determine whether the taxpayer could reasonably expect to realize a 
3:70:3766:16:16:72:500:457:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:profit absent the disputed tax benefits.  Discounted cash flow analyses are based on 
3:71:3851:16:16:72:518:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:principles of corporate finance that are widely accepted in both business and academic 
3:72:3938:16:17:72:542:425:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:settings.  However, a serious shortcoming of such analyses is that they can be very sensitive 
3:73:4032:17:16:72:538:408:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to long-term financial projections and estimates of discount rates that are developed in the 
3:74:4125:16:26:72:371:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:context of litigation, sometimes many years after the fact.1 
3:75:4185:26:16:72:539:366:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The argument put forward here – consistent with those made in recent court cases – is that 
3:76:4276:16:16:72:528:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:additional principles of economics and corporate finance, based on the modern theory of 
3:77:4364:16:16:72:540:334:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the firm, can be helpful in evaluating the economic substance of corporate reorganizations.  
3:78:4457:16:17:72:533:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In particular, according to the property rights theory of the firm, a key difference between 
3:79:4550:17:16:72:516:301:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:an arm’s length transaction and a transaction inside an organization concerns who has 
3:80:4636:16:16:72:532:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residual control rights, that is, who has the right to determine what happens in events not 
3:81:4728:16:16:72:525:269:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:covered by explicit contractual terms. The possession of residual control rights can have 
3:82:4818:16:16:72:513:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:important efficiency consequences in a world where contracts are incomplete. Among 
3:83:4901:16:17:72:514:237:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other things, to motivate individuals it may not be enough to offer them high-powered 
3:84:4987:17:26:72:532:220:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incentives; it may be necessary also to allocate them ownership or residual control rights. 
3:85:5079:26:16:72:514:194:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In many transactions leading to the creation or reorganization of corporate entities no 
3:86:5167:16:16:72:505:178:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:meaningful transfer of residual control rights actually occurs. These transactions are 
3:87:5254:16:16:72:532:162:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:structured in such a way that both before and after the transaction the company initiating 
3:88:5345:16:39:72:537:146:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the transaction has complete control. This suggests that the same benefits could have been 
3:89:5436:39:19:72:218:107:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
3:90:5492:19:0:72:380:88:42:Times:100:Times:1  Discounted cash flow models can also be manipulated (Damodaran 2007). 
4:91:5605:0:16:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achieved in-house: that is, such reorganizations or creations of a new entity lack economic 
4:92:5697:16:26:72:361:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substance and should not be respected for tax purposes. 
4:93:5753:26:16:72:505:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The purpose of this paper is to spell out these arguments in more detail. We begin in 
4:94:5839:16:17:72:538:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Section 2 with a discussion of the economic substance doctrine.  In Section 3 we review the 
4:95:5931:17:16:72:534:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:property rights theory of the firm and explain how it applies to corporate reorganizations. 
4:96:6023:16:16:72:514:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Section 4 we provide a brief overview of “contingent liability tax shelters” involving 
4:97:6113:16:16:72:540:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:corporate transactions/reorganizations that, based on taxpayer claims, entitle the taxpayer 
4:98:6205:16:16:72:534:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to what amounts to a double deduction on certain anticipated expenses.  In Sections 5 and 
4:99:6295:16:16:72:528:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:6 we apply the property rights theory of the firm to two unrelated contingent liability tax 
4:100:6387:16:17:72:542:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f8:shelter cases that were litigated in federal court: The	Black	and	Decker	Corporation	v.	United	
4:101:6482:17:16:72:512:536:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f2:States, and WFC	Holdings	Corporation	v.	United	States. In Section 7 we discuss how the 
4:102:6569:16:16:72:534:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:analysis from those cases can be extended to other sorts of corporate transactions and tax 
4:103:6660:16:16:72:535:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shelters.  Conclusions follow in Section 8.  In the appendix, we provide further background 
4:104:6752:16:30:71:248:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on contingent liability tax shelters 
4:105:6789:30:29:107:507:458:195:g_d0_f4:195:g_d0_f6:2. Role	of	the	Economic	Substance	Test	In	Corporate	Taxation	
4:106:6849:29:16:72:535:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:For nearly eight decades, federal courts have disregarded transactions (and the associated 
4:107:6940:16:17:72:502:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:claims to tax benefits) that complied with literal terms of the tax code but served no 
4:108:7027:17:16:72:503:396:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:purpose but to reduce taxes.   The seminal case of Gregory	v.	Helvering (293 U.S. 465 
4:109:7113:16:16:71:531:380:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:[1935]) is often cited for the proposition that “the legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the 
4:110:7208:16:16:71:525:364:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which 
4:111:7294:16:16:71:527:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the law permits, cannot be doubted” (Gregory, 293 U.S. at 469). However, the taxpayer in 
4:112:7383:16:26:71:341:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Gregory lost because the Supreme Court found that   
4:113:7435:26:15:107:481:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The whole undertaking, though conducted according to the terms of [the 
4:114:7506:15:14:107:444:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:statute], was in fact an elaborate and devious form of conveyance 
4:115:7572:14:14:107:467:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:masquerading as a corporate reorganization, and nothing else. . . . The 
4:116:7644:14:14:107:495:263:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute.  To hold 
4:117:7725:14:14:108:457:249:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:otherwise would be to exalt artifice above reality and to deprive the 
4:118:7795:14:14:108:385:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:statutory provision in question of all serious purpose.

4:121:7880:28:16:72:534:179:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Five years later, the Supreme Court explained that its holding in Gregory, which addressed 
4:122:7971:16:16:72:520:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the transfer of assets for no apparent business reason, supports “the natural conclusion 
4:123:8060:16:17:72:539:147:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that transactions, which do not vary control or change the flow of economic benefits, are to 
4:124:8153:17:16:72:480:130:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be dismissed from consideration.” (Higgins	v.	Smith, 308 U.S. 473, 476 [1940]).

5:127:8448:16:16:72:510:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:violate the spirit and intent – if not the statutory text – of the Internal Revenue Code.2

5:129:8538:16:17:72:534:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:But what does economic substance mean? A uniform definition has not fully emerged, and 
5:130:8625:17:16:72:509:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:one commentator has described the economic substance test as akin to a “smell test.”

5:132:8798:16:16:72:515:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:non-tax benefit is positive, or must the non-tax benefit be significant relative to the tax 
5:133:8890:16:16:72:533:595:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:benefit? Should the non-tax benefit be assessed in primarily ex-ante or ex-post terms? For 
5:134:8981:16:17:72:526:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:instance, does a transaction that ex-ante had a reasonable prospect of a gain (in terms of 
5:135:9072:17:16:72:521:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expected profits, say) but actually yielded a loss have economic substance?  Conversely, 
5:136:9161:16:16:71:523:546:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:does a transaction that ex-ante seemed unprofitable (in terms of expected profit) but ex-
5:137:9250:16:16:71:524:530:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:post yielded a gain have economic substance?  Suppose that a transaction can be carried 
5:138:9338:16:16:72:536:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:out in two different ways. Both yield positive non-tax benefits but the one with higher non-
5:139:9430:16:16:72:513:498:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tax benefits is less profitable overall given the tax consequences. Does the overall-less-
5:140:9520:16:29:72:341:482:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:profitable option pass the economic substance test?  
5:141:9573:29:16:72:538:453:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Standards regarding the economic substance test were particularly muddled in 2001 when 
5:142:9660:16:16:72:505:437:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the IRS announced that it would disallow losses generated by contingent liability tax 
5:143:9746:16:16:72:495:421:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shelters because “the overall transaction lacks sufficient economic substance to be 
5:144:9830:16:16:72:539:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:respected for tax purposes” (IRS Notice 2001-17, 2001-1 C.B. 730). Although the IRS Notice

5:147:10102:17:16:72:535:356:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f8:somewhat from the test applied in other circuits.   For example, the Fourth Circuit in Rice’s

5:149:10287:16:16:72:537:324:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that would disregard a transaction as a sham for tax purposes if it was (1) motivated by no 
5:150:10379:16:16:72:493:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:business purpose other than obtaining tax benefits; and (2) the transaction has no 
5:151:10462:16:17:72:508:292:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f8:economic substance because no reasonable expectation of profit exists (Rice’s	Toyota

5:153:10639:16:16:71:529:259:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:has “no economic effects other than the creation of tax benefits” lacks merit regardless of

6:188:13867:16:16:72:504:328:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2010).   The new legislation provides that in the case of any transaction to which the 
6:189:13954:16:16:72:495:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:economic substance doctrine is relevant, the transaction shall be treated as having

7:206:15385:29:16:72:526:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The question of why some transactions take place in firms and others take place through 
7:207:15473:16:16:72:537:630:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the market was first raised by Ronald Coase in his famous 1937 article (Coase 1937). Since 
7:208:15564:16:16:72:540:614:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that time progress on the question has been made by Williamson (1975, 1985) and Klein et 
7:209:15653:16:16:72:520:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:al. (1978), among others. For our purposes a more recent strand of the literature called 
7:210:15742:16:17:72:519:582:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Property Rights Theory (“PRT”) will be helpful and we begin by reviewing it here.3 PRT 
7:211:15829:17:16:71:491:565:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shares several features with Coase, Williamson, and Klein et al.’s Transaction Cost 
7:212:15913:16:26:71:411:549:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:economics (“TCE”), but there are also some important differences. 
7:213:15979:26:16:71:514:523:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:PRT, in common with TCE, takes the view that firms arise when parties are engaged in 
7:214:16064:16:16:71:539:507:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:long-term relationships and make relationship-specific investments. A useful example is an 
7:215:16155:16:16:71:538:491:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:electricity plant that locates next to a coal mine (Joskow 1985). Ex-ante there may be many 
7:216:16247:16:17:71:527:475:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mines that the plant could locate next to, but ex-post, after its location decision, the plant 
7:217:16342:17:26:71:300:458:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:has little flexibility about its source of coal.    
7:218:16394:26:16:71:538:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In an ideal world, the parties would govern a relationship like this via a long-term contract. 
7:219:16489:16:16:71:530:416:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The contract would state what each party’s obligations are in all contingencies during the 
7:220:16580:16:16:71:515:400:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:course of the relationship. In practice, it is very difficult to write a comprehensive long-
7:221:16672:16:17:71:518:384:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:term contract for several reasons, one of which is the difficulty of predicting the future. 
7:222:16764:17:16:71:516:367:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Instead parties write contracts that are incomplete. Incomplete contracts specify some 
7:223:16851:16:16:71:507:351:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:obligations of the parties and some contingencies but not others. They are vague and 
7:224:16936:16:16:71:504:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ambiguous in places. They tend to be short-term rather than long-term. They will be 
7:225:17020:16:26:71:416:319:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:renegotiated as time passes and the parties respond to new events. 
7:226:17087:26:16:71:509:293:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Lawyers and judges are, of course, extremely familiar with the concept of contractual 
7:227:17173:16:17:71:531:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incompleteness and the role of the courts in completing an incomplete contract. What has 
7:228:17262:17:16:71:538:260:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been less appreciated in the legal literature, and, until recently, in the economics literature, 
7:229:17359:16:16:71:534:244:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is that there is another important and very familiar mechanism for completing incomplete 
7:230:17448:16:16:71:533:228:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contracts. This mechanism involves asset ownership and firm boundaries and it lies at the 
7:231:17538:16:47:71:140:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:heart of PRT.

7:233:17608:20:16:72:511:145:42:Times:100:Times:3 The PRT is discussed in detail in Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990), Hart (1995), and Hart 
7:234:17715:16:11:72:536:129:100:Times:100:Times:(1989). For recent extensions of Property Rights Theory, see Hart and Moore (2008), Hart (2008), Hart (2009), and

7:237:18043:11:12:72:534:95:100:Times:100:Times:al. (2010), Baker and Hubbard (2003, 2004), and Kaplan and Stromberg (2003). For a survey of empirical work on 
7:238:18154:12:0:72:425:83:100:Times:100:Times:transaction cost economics and property rights theory, see Lafontaine and Slade (2007). 
8:239:18282:0:16:72:510:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:PRT takes the view that the owner of an asset or a set of assets, such as a firm, has the 
8:240:18372:16:16:72:538:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ability to fill in certain aspects of an incomplete contract. Specifically, the owner of an asset 
8:241:18470:16:16:72:537:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:has residual	rights of control; that is, the right to decide all uses of the asset not specified in 
8:242:18570:16:17:72:525:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:an initial contract (as long as these uses are consistent with the law). In practice, owners 
8:243:18663:17:16:72:529:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:often don’t exercise residual control rights themselves—they delegate them to a board of 
8:244:18752:16:16:72:532:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:directors. This is not important for the basic theory, however, and in what follows, we use 
8:245:18844:16:16:72:532:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:owner and board interchangeably. We will, however, make a distinction between the case 
8:246:18931:16:16:72:533:595:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:where the person managing an asset or set of assets owns or controls these assets himself 
8:247:19021:16:17:72:532:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and the case where he doesn’t, that is, he runs a division or subdivision and is answerable 
8:248:19113:17:26:71:193:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to an owner or a board. 
8:249:19137:26:16:71:528:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To see why the allocation of residual control rights matters, consider the electricity plant 
8:250:19230:16:16:71:525:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and the coal mine, and suppose initially that they are separately owned. Assume that the 
8:251:19319:16:16:71:504:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:electricity company needs the coal it burns to be pure but that it is hard to specify in 
8:252:19408:16:16:71:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:advance what pure coal is because there are many potential impurities. Imagine that ash 
8:253:19496:16:17:71:535:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:content is the relevant impurity, and suppose that high ash-content coal is more expensive 
8:254:19587:17:16:71:534:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for the electricity company to burn but is cheaper for the coal mine to mine. Given that the 
8:255:19680:16:16:71:541:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contract does not specify purity in sufficient detail, the coal mine may be within its rights to 
8:256:19777:16:16:71:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:supply cheap high ash-content coal (in effect, it exercises its residual control rights over the 
8:257:19874:16:16:71:504:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics of the coal supplied). The coal mine may be willing to renegotiate the 
8:258:19961:16:17:71:522:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contract and supply low ash content coal but only if it receives a much higher price. As a 
8:259:20052:17:16:71:531:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:result, even with a long-term contract, the electricity company is vulnerable and may lose 
8:260:20143:16:16:71:523:358:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:money. Anticipating problems like this over the course of the relationship the electricity 
8:261:20234:16:26:71:408:342:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company may find it unprofitable to locate next to the coal mine.4 
8:262:20300:26:16:72:525:316:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Now consider the case where the electricity company buys the coal mine before locating 
8:263:20387:16:16:72:490:300:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:next to it. If the coal mine manager is thinking of mining high ash-content coal the 
8:264:20472:16:17:71:499:284:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:electricity company can intervene directly to forbid this action. Since the electricity 
8:265:20560:17:16:71:541:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company manager owns or is in charge of the coal mine, it can direct from which part of the 
8:266:20652:16:16:71:531:251:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mine the coal is taken. Moreover, if for some reason the coal company manager refuses to 
8:267:20741:16:16:71:512:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:follow the electricity company’s instructions, the electricity company can fire him and 
8:268:20829:16:16:71:531:219:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:replace him with a better-behaved manager—something that was not possible when they 
8:269:20913:16:50:71:207:203:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were separate companies. 
8:270:20938:50:19:71:217:153:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
8:271:20994:19:16:72:510:134:42:Times:100:Times:4 One way to solve this “hold-up” problem is for the parties specify in their initial contract that the electricity 
8:272:21110:16:12:72:530:118:100:Times:100:Times:company must locate next to the coal mine in return for an upfront payment. This works if the location decision is 
8:273:21225:12:11:72:527:106:100:Times:100:Times:perfectly contractible. However, even if this is the case, other similar investment decisions —such as whether the 
8:274:21340:11:12:72:520:95:100:Times:100:Times:electricity company should install a boiler that burns this particular mine’s coal efficiently—are likely not to be 
8:275:21456:12:0:71:315:83:100:Times:100:Times:contractible. We discuss the location decision for simplicity. 
9:276:21559:0:16:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Possessing residual control rights over the coal mine thus makes the electricity company 
9:277:21648:16:16:72:504:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:less vulnerable and encourages it to locate next to the coal mine. However, there is a 
9:278:21735:16:16:72:510:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:downside. The electricity company’s ability to intervene in the coal mine’s operations 
9:279:21822:16:17:71:539:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:makes the coal manager more vulnerable. Suppose that the coal manager has an idea about 
9:280:21910:17:16:72:524:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:how to mine the coal more efficiently. When the coal mine was separate, this idea would 
9:281:21998:16:16:72:526:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:lead to higher profits for the coal mine, and, if the manager owned the mine, these would 
9:282:22088:16:16:72:536:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:end up in the coal manager’s pocket. Now that the electricity company owns the coal mine, 
9:283:22178:16:16:72:542:595:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:however, the electricity company may be able to implement the idea without rewarding the 
9:284:22267:16:17:72:522:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:manager adequately. Suppose that the electricity company promises the coal manager a 
9:285:22352:17:16:72:534:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fraction of the cost savings he brings about. Costs are notoriously difficult to measure, and 
9:286:22446:16:16:72:530:546:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the electricity company may be able to use its residual control rights to manipulate these, 
9:287:22538:16:16:72:501:530:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for example, the electricity company could charge some of the electricity company’s 
9:288:22622:16:16:72:534:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expenses to the coal mine.5  Another possibility is that the electricity company may decide 
9:289:22714:16:16:71:528:498:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not to implement the manager’s idea at all6. It could be that the idea has a marginal effect 
9:290:22807:16:17:72:536:482:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on profit and its principal benefit is that, if successful, it would enhance the coal manager’s 
9:291:22903:17:16:72:539:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reputation and career prospects, which is not something that the electricity company cares 
9:292:22994:16:16:72:526:449:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:about. Anticipating that he will not be rewarded for his ideas, either in financial terms or 
9:293:23087:16:16:72:536:433:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:because the ideas won’t be implemented, the coal manager has less incentive to work hard 
9:294:23176:16:16:72:502:417:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to identify and implement cost savings when the coal mine belongs to the electricity 
9:295:23261:16:26:72:270:401:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company than when it is independent. 
9:296:23298:26:17:72:519:375:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In summary, there is a tradeoff concerning ownership of the coal mine. If the electricity 
9:297:23388:17:16:72:526:358:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company owns the coal mine, then the electricity company will have strong incentives to 
9:298:23476:16:16:72:541:342:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:invest in the relationship, namely, to locate its plant next to the coal mine, but the coal mine 
9:299:23573:16:16:72:525:326:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:manager will have weak incentives to identify cost savings. On the other hand, if the coal 
9:300:23664:16:16:72:524:310:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mine is independently owned, then the electricity company will have weak incentives to 
9:301:23751:16:17:72:539:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:invest in the relationship, but the coal mine manager will have strong incentives to identify 
9:302:23845:17:16:72:541:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cost savings.7 This trade-off is central to understanding how ownership structure can affect 
9:303:23938:16:26:72:341:261:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantive economics outcomes, according to PRT.  
9:304:23989:26:16:72:517:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:It is worth reemphasizing the three key features of PRT: incomplete contracts, residual 
9:305:24077:16:16:72:536:219:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control rights, and assets. Contractual incompleteness is important because, in its absence, 
9:306:24170:16:15:72:521:203:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:parties could regulate their relationship entirely via a long-term contract, so ownership 
9:307:24260:15:20:72:218:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
9:308:24316:20:16:72:527:168:42:Times:100:Times:5 For discussions of the ability of people to manipulate budgetary or accounting data in order to subvert incentive 
9:309:24432:16:11:72:500:152:100:Times:100:Times:arrangements, see Lev (2003) and Jensen (2001). It is well known that cost manipulation and questionable 
9:310:24537:11:7:72:505:141:100:Times:100:Times:accounting practices are hazards in, for example, the movie industry; see Bibicoff (1991) and Caves (2003). 
9:311:24645:7:16:72:540:134:42:Times:100:Times:6 For a discussion of how the allocation of control or authority affects the incentive to have and implement ideas, see 
9:312:24765:16:7:72:180:118:100:Times:100:Times:Aghion and Tirole (1997). 
9:313:24791:7:16:72:503:111:42:Times:100:Times:7 The version of PRT described above emphasizes non-contractible relationship-specific investments as the 
9:314:24897:16:12:72:527:95:100:Times:100:Times:determinants of organizational form. A more recent part of PRT emphasizes other factors. See, for example, Hart 
9:315:25009:12:0:72:235:83:100:Times:100:Times:(2009) and Hart and Holmstrom (2010). 
10:316:25087:0:16:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and firm boundaries wouldn’t matter. Residual control rights are important because they 
10:317:25175:16:16:72:519:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tell us how incomplete contracts get completed via the allocation of ownership. Finally, 
10:318:25264:16:16:72:519:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assets—more precisely physical or nonhuman assets—are important because it is with 
10:319:25347:16:30:72:375:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:respect to these that residual control rights are exercised.8

10:321:25449:29:17:72:521:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The approach described above can throw light on why the boundary between firms and 
10:322:25532:17:16:72:508:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contracts (or markets) matters. The approach can also help us understand why firms 
10:323:25615:16:26:72:349:568:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:restructure in response to changes in external events. 
10:324:25670:26:16:72:522:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Various types of restructuring have become common over the last thirty years and have 
10:325:25756:16:16:72:516:526:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:arguably produced large increases in value. These include leveraged buyouts (“LBOs”), 
10:326:25842:16:17:72:536:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:management buyouts (“MBOs”), corporate spin-offs, and equity carve-outs.  The success of 
10:327:25931:17:16:72:541:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these organizational forms can be understood using the theory of the firm and PRT can also 
10:328:26022:16:16:72:534:477:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:explain why the creation of a new business enterprise or a new organizational structure is 
10:329:26113:16:26:72:339:461:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:necessary for the generation of value in these cases. 
10:330:26167:26:16:72:541:435:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In an LBO or MBO, a company or a company division is taken private either by management 
10:331:26255:16:16:72:497:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:or another group. These transactions involve the heavy use of debt to purchase the 
10:332:26338:16:17:72:509:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ownership of the entity from its public shareholders or from its parent company. The 
10:333:26423:17:16:72:521:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transactions are characterized by increased management ownership, increased pay-for-
10:334:26507:16:16:72:541:370:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance, the addition of large, active investors to the board of directors, and the loss of 
10:335:26603:16:16:72:539:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:access to public equity markets. The transactions are common in companies and industries 
10:336:26692:16:16:72:530:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that are growing slowly and are generating substantial amounts of cash, much of which is 
10:337:26781:16:27:72:250:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:wasted on inefficient investments. 
10:338:26816:27:16:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In a spin-off, a publicly traded company distributes some of its assets and liabilities to a 
10:339:26909:16:16:72:529:279:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:newly formed company and the equity in that company is distributed to the shareholders 
10:340:26996:16:16:72:534:263:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the parent company. Each corporation, including the original but now smaller parent, is 
10:341:27087:16:16:72:510:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a separate public company, and, in contrast to an LBO or MBO, most of the ownership 
10:342:27171:16:26:72:277:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rights remain with public shareholders. 
10:343:27211:26:17:72:532:205:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Equity carve-outs are similar to spin-offs, except that, instead of distributing shares to the 
10:344:27306:17:16:71:524:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:public, the parent sells a portion to the public and often retains a majority or controlling 
10:345:27399:16:42:71:239:172:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:interest in the carved-out entity. 
10:346:27434:42:19:71:217:130:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
10:347:27490:19:16:72:529:111:42:Times:100:Times:8 There is no point owning a firm that consists entirely of human assets since (in the absence of slavery) an owner 
10:348:27606:16:12:71:537:95:100:Times:100:Times:cannot directly force a worker to do something. In contrast, an owner can decide unilaterally how a physical asset is 
10:349:27724:12:0:71:117:83:100:Times:100:Times:to be used. 
11:350:27777:0:16:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:It is not hard to see why an LBO or MBO structure is conducive to efficiency gains. The 
11:351:27865:16:16:72:514:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:combination of pay-for-performance, high debt, and significant managerial ownership 
11:352:27949:16:16:72:498:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:means that good performance is highly rewarded while bad performance is heavily 
11:353:28029:16:17:72:512:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:penalized. In other words, incentives are high‐powered. This is very different from the 
11:354:28117:17:16:71:528:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:situation that many managers face in large corporations, where the relationship between 
11:355:28205:16:26:71:278:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:pay and performance is relatively weak. 
11:356:28245:26:16:71:540:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:An important question is, why is it not possible to duplicate the high-powered incentives of 
11:357:28338:16:16:71:523:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:an LBO or MBO while staying within the confines of the original corporate entity, that is, 
11:358:28429:16:16:71:515:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:without a corporate restructuring? We do, after all, see the use of incentive schemes in 
11:359:28518:16:17:71:542:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:companies. Consider a company that is planning to sell a division to private investors via an 
11:360:28612:17:16:71:501:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:LBO or MBO. Why can’t the company generate the same efficiencies in the following 
11:361:28694:16:16:71:501:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:manner: maintain the managers as employees and put them on an explicit incentive 
11:362:28775:16:16:71:534:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:scheme, whereby they receive very large bonuses if divisional profit is high and low salary 
11:363:28867:16:26:71:294:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:or even dismissal if divisional profit is low? 
11:364:28914:26:17:71:535:462:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:PRT explains why a restructuring is necessary to generate value. The LBO/MBO entity and 
11:365:29002:17:16:71:542:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the original company have a completely different control structure. A division inside a large 
11:366:29096:16:16:71:496:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company is not controlled by the people working in the division. Control is held by 
11:367:29180:16:16:71:505:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:headquarters (the CEO or board of directors of the parent). This creates problems in 
11:368:29265:16:16:71:515:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sustaining high-powered pay-for-performance incentives, just as in the electricity-coal 
11:369:29353:16:16:71:514:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:example discussed earlier. Suppose that headquarters tries to create strong incentives 
11:370:29440:16:17:71:524:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:inside the large company by writing a contract promising the divisional manager a large 
11:371:29528:17:16:71:529:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:bonus if his division does well. The problem is that divisional profits are not well-defined 
11:372:29621:16:16:71:527:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:because costs are fungible. In particular, what is to stop headquarters from manipulating 
11:373:29711:16:16:71:526:316:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:divisional profit after the fact, such as charging extraneous expenses to the division, thus 
11:374:29804:16:16:71:515:300:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:making divisional profit look smaller than it really is?  To the extent that the divisional 
11:375:29896:16:17:71:539:284:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:manager anticipates this, the behavior by headquarters is self-defeating since it will reduce 
11:376:29990:17:16:71:499:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the divisional manager’s incentives to generate high profit. However, self-defeating 
11:377:30075:16:16:71:526:251:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:behavior may be hard to avoid: there may simply be no credible way for headquarters to 
11:378:30162:16:26:71:350:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:commit ahead of time not to behave opportunistically. 
11:379:30216:26:16:71:539:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:All this changes after an LBO or MBO. Now those whose actions most affect the profitability 
11:380:30308:16:16:71:538:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the enterprise -- top managers and a few key “outsiders” -- collectively own the (former) 
11:381:30401:16:17:71:533:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:division, in the sense that they hold both the claims to divisional profits and the (residual) 
11:382:30496:17:16:71:522:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control rights. Nobody can intervene to manipulate the profits of the entity. Nobody can 
11:383:30585:16:16:71:520:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:turn down their ideas. Nobody can tell them what to do or fire them. Their incentives to 
11:384:30674:16:0:71:453:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generate an efficient outcome are therefore quite different and far greater. 
12:385:30792:0:16:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Spin-offs and equity carve-outs are similar in a number of ways to LBOs or MBOs, but there 
12:386:30883:16:16:72:533:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are also important differences. The main difference is that control does not shift as clearly 
12:387:30977:16:26:72:182:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as in an LBO or MBO. 
12:388:30998:26:17:72:542:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In a spin-off, most of the ownership rights remain with public shareholders. However, there 
12:389:31090:17:16:72:493:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are two important changes that occur when a company is spun off. First, a layer of 
12:390:31173:16:16:72:535:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:supervision or authority is removed from above the top unit managers. Previously, the top 
12:391:31263:16:16:72:528:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:managers had a boss, the CEO of the parent company. This boss could turn down some of 
12:392:31349:16:16:72:494:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their ideas and veto some of their decisions. Now the only group to which they are 
12:393:31432:16:16:72:539:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:answerable (apart from public shareholders) is the board of the spun-off company, and top 
12:394:31522:16:17:72:530:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:managers are likely to have had considerable influence over the choice of this board. To a 
12:395:31613:17:26:72:393:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:large extent, the unit’s managers are masters of their own fate. 
12:396:31678:26:16:72:524:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Second, the profits of the spun-off company have “integrity” in a way that the profits of a 
12:397:31770:16:16:72:535:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:division of the parent did not. Once a unit is independent, an external group cannot siphon 
12:398:31862:16:16:72:520:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:profits out of this unit by forcing the unit to engage in disadvantageous side-deals or by 
12:399:31953:16:17:72:522:462:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigning expenses to the unit. As a separate legal entity, the spun-off unit can veto such 
12:400:32045:17:16:72:511:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transactions. The integrity of profits has two benefits. First, profit-based performance 
12:401:32134:16:16:72:533:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:schemes become possible and credible. Second, a public market in the spun-off company’s 
12:402:32222:16:16:72:539:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shares can function, and this market will provide important information about the spun-off 
12:403:32313:16:16:72:504:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company’s prospects.  This in turn can allow for better incentive-based performance 
12:404:32397:16:26:72:526:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:compensation for managers (in the form of, for example, equity-based compensation)9.    
12:405:32485:26:17:71:532:355:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Equity carve-outs are similar to spin-offs, except that, instead of distributing shares to the 
12:406:32580:17:16:71:524:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:public, the parent sells a portion to the public and often retains a majority or controlling 
12:407:32673:16:16:71:538:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:interest in the carved-out entity. At first sight, it may seem that such a restructuring should 
12:408:32769:16:16:71:527:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have no effect on performance. After all, according to PRT, a restructuring matters only if 
12:409:32861:16:16:71:520:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control shifts, and here control remains with the parent. However, a subtle change does 
12:410:32949:16:17:71:513:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:occur. Since the board of directors of the carved-out entity owes a fiduciary duty to all 
12:411:33039:17:16:71:506:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shareholders, the parent is limited in its ability to siphon profit out of the entity or to 
12:412:33131:16:16:71:533:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:engage in disadvantageous side-deals so as to benefit the parent. If it did so, it would open 
12:413:33225:16:16:71:505:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:itself up to breach-of-fiduciary-duty suits from minority shareholders. This gives the 
12:414:33312:16:16:71:522:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:carved-out entity’s profit some integrity and provides some role for performance-based 
12:415:33399:16:16:71:541:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:compensation, such as stock options. Of course, the parent probably still has some ability to 
12:416:33493:16:17:71:500:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:manipulate profit and has the ability to intervene in other ways, namely through its 
12:417:33578:17:16:71:519:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:majority board representation. Given that the new entity has limited independence, we 
12:418:33664:16:16:71:534:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would expect an equity carve-out to have a less powerful impact on managerial incentives 
12:419:33753:16:21:71:527:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:than a spin-off. And we would expect both to have a less powerful impact than an LBO or 
12:420:33841:21:19:71:217:107:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
12:421:33897:19:0:72:240:88:42:Times:100:Times:9 See, e.g., Holmstrom and Tirole (1993). 
13:422:33980:0:16:72:512:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:MBO, given that insiders typically have a small ownership stake in a spin-off or equity 
13:423:34068:16:16:72:515:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:carve-out but a large ownership stake in an LBO or MBO, that is, their incentives in the 
13:424:34157:16:26:72:241:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:latter are much higher-powered. 
13:425:34189:26:17:72:524:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We may summarize the discussion of this section as follows. Restructurings create value 
13:426:34277:17:16:72:502:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:because things are possible in the restructured entity that were not possible before. 
13:427:34363:16:16:72:525:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Specifically, the management of the restructured entity becomes more independent, and 
13:428:34449:16:16:72:514:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the profits earned by the new entity have greater integrity—they are less fungible and 
13:429:34536:16:16:72:536:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:more transparent. It may even be possible to create a market in the new entity’s shares. As 
13:430:34628:16:16:72:519:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a result, management can be motivated in new ways. This effect is most powerful in the 
13:431:34715:16:17:72:529:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:case of LBO’s and MBO’s, but the effect, although muted, is still present in the case of spin-
13:432:34809:17:30:72:210:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:offs and equity carve-outs. 
13:433:34837:30:29:192:423:506:195:g_d0_f4:195:g_d0_f6:4. Contingent	Liability	Tax	Shelters	
13:434:34873:29:16:72:535:477:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Contingent liability tax shelters are typically based on corporate transactions that shift the 
13:435:34968:16:16:72:497:461:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:responsibility for managing future expenses (such as environmental cleanup costs, 
13:436:35050:16:16:72:524:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimated medical costs of employees and retirees, or anticipated payouts from product-
13:437:35137:16:16:72:529:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:liability or other unliquidated claims) to a separate subsidiary.  Such transactions may be 
13:438:35229:16:17:72:539:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:very attractive in tax terms to the extent that they allow the taxpayer to take what amounts 
13:439:35322:17:26:72:411:396:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to a double deduction for future expenses. As one promoter put it: 
13:440:35389:26:16:108:535:370:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:With proper planning and structuring of a series of transactions, a taxpayer may be 
13:441:35473:16:16:108:526:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:able to significantly accelerate the deduction (in the form of a capital loss) of such 
13:442:35560:16:16:108:535:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contingent costs.  Such planning involves the use of a risk management company or 
13:443:35642:16:16:108:494:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a health care management company and the sale of some of the stock of the 
13:444:35716:16:17:108:530:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company to a third party manager, consultant or investor.  With this approach, the 
13:445:35799:17:16:108:475:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxpayer may be able to deduct a capital loss equal to the amount of the 
13:446:35872:16:16:108:508:273:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contingency.  In addition, the management company may later be entitled to a 
13:447:35949:16:16:108:526:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:second deduction for the same amount over time as the expenditures are actually 
13:448:36029:16:16:107:530:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incurred. (Black & Decker v. United States, Civil Action No. 02-2070 (USDC D. Md.),

13:450:36190:27:16:71:518:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Although the genesis of contingent liability tax shelters can be traced to an IRS revenue 
13:451:36280:16:16:71:542:182:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ruling issued in 1995 (Revenue Ruling 95-74), the IRS has disputed the legitimacy of the tax 
13:452:36373:16:16:71:494:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:benefits claimed by taxpayers  that lacked a valid non-tax reason for engaging in a  
13:453:36458:16:16:71:538:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contingent liability transaction.  In 2001 it issued Notice 2001-17 to alert such taxpayers of

13:455:36567:26:17:107:532:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department have become aware of 
13:456:36645:17:0:107:539:91:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:certain types of transactions, described below, that are being marketed to taxpayers 
14:457:36771:0:16:108:534:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for the purpose of accelerating and, in some cases, duplicating tax deductions.  This 
14:458:36857:16:16:108:503:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:notice is intended to alert taxpayers and their representatives that the losses 
14:459:36937:16:16:108:524:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generated by such transactions are not properly allowable for federal income tax 
14:460:37018:16:27:108:161:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:purposes.

14:462:37032:26:16:108:522:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Taxpayers assert several business purposes for these transactions. However, the 
14:463:37112:16:16:108:538:591:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Service and the Treasury are not aware of any case in which a taxpayer has shown a 
14:464:37195:16:16:108:533:575:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:legitimate non-tax business reason to carry out the combination of steps described 
14:465:37278:16:17:108:530:559:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:above. Moreover, the Service and the Treasury believe that any business purposes 
14:466:37359:17:16:108:540:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxpayers may assert for certain aspects of these transactions are far outweighed by 
14:467:37444:16:26:108:490:526:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the purpose to generate deductible losses for federal income tax purposes. 
14:468:37519:26:16:72:530:500:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Despite the IRS’s stance, several companies filed suit to challenge the disallowance of the 
14:469:37612:16:16:72:530:484:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tax benefits they claimed , asserting that they were entitled to the tax deductions because 
14:470:37704:16:16:72:520:468:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  transactions generating the beneficial tax treatments were motivated by legitimate 
14:471:37792:16:17:72:509:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:non-tax business purposes.  Two of those disputes are described in detail below.  The 
14:472:37878:17:30:72:484:435:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Appendix includes a more detailed discussion of contingent liability tax shelters.

14:474:38003:29:16:72:540:376:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In 1998, Black and Decker stood to realize a substantial capital gain from the sale of several 
14:475:38098:16:16:72:532:360:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:business divisions. 10  Like many companies, it also faced growing and uncertain expenses 
14:476:38188:16:16:72:524:344:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:associated with its (self-insured) provision of employee and retiree health benefits.  As a 
14:477:38279:16:16:72:511:328:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:result, Black and Decker entered into a transaction that shifted the management of its 
14:478:38366:16:17:72:486:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:employee and retiree healthcare benefits plans to a subsidiary, Black and Decker

14:480:38533:16:16:72:533:279:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:care benefits for Black and Decker employees and retirees over the period 1999-2007.  As 
14:481:38622:16:16:72:498:263:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the end of 1998, the risk-adjusted net present value of the associated health care 
14:482:38708:16:16:72:501:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:liabilities Black & Decker would incur from 1999 through 2007 was estimated to be 
14:483:38790:16:26:72:222:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:approximately $500 million.  
14:484:38819:26:17:72:518:205:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Under BDHMI, the individuals managing the company’s health care expenses remained 
14:485:38901:17:16:72:494:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:largely the same; in particular, a key manager (“Key Manager”) continued in place. 
14:486:38984:16:16:72:539:172:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:However, a retired company executive (“Company Executive”) with relationships and prior 
14:487:39072:16:26:72:516:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:management experience throughout the company was added to the BDHMI board. The

15:492:39437:0:16:72:515:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Company Executive would be compensated with preferred stock that was to be valued 
15:493:39519:16:16:72:538:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:based on the difference between the current baseline projections and the actual healthcare 
15:494:39610:16:16:72:512:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expenses as they transpired. In addition BDHMI would receive advice from an outside 
15:495:39694:16:17:72:525:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:benefits consultant (“Benefits Consultant”) whose sister company (“Sister Corporation”) 
15:496:39782:17:16:72:541:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would own some of the preferred shares.  Finally, health care claims would be processed by 
15:497:39873:16:26:72:252:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:an outside company (“Processor”). 
15:498:39907:26:16:72:544:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As the discussion above suggests, BDHMI was also designed to yield significant tax benefits.  
15:499:40001:16:16:71:505:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The primary benefit was a capital loss from the sale of BDHMI preferred stock to the 
15:500:40086:16:16:71:539:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Company Executive.  The amount of that deduction was approximately equal to the present 
15:501:40174:16:17:71:506:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:value of the contingent liabilities transferred to BDHMI and, in effect, represented an 
15:502:40262:17:16:71:516:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:acceleration of the deductions Black & Decker claimed as the liabilities were paid.  The 
15:503:40351:16:16:71:513:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:secondary benefit was BDHMI’s ability to continue to deduct as business expenses the 
15:504:40436:16:16:71:521:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:healthcare liabilities it assumed.  Thus, Black and Decker asserted that it was entitled to 
15:505:40528:16:16:71:512:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:what amounted to a double deduction associated with its future employee health care 
15:506:40612:16:17:71:525:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expenses  The IRS disagreed and the dispute ended up in court where the determination 
15:507:40698:17:30:71:510:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ultimately rested on whether or not the BDHMI transaction had economic substance.

15:509:40838:29:16:72:536:396:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To analyze that question using PRT, it is first necessary to describe the key elements of the 
15:510:40932:16:16:72:530:380:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction. After various modifications, BDHMI ended up in late 1998 with the following 
15:511:41021:16:27:72:267:364:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ownership and governance structure: 
15:512:41057:27:16:90:512:337:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: BDHMI had one class of common stock and four classes of preferred securities. 
15:513:41136:16:16:108:500:321:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Black and Decker, Inc. and Black and Decker Canada (collectively, “Black and 
15:514:41213:16:16:108:523:305:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Decker”) owned all the common stock and the Class A and E preferred securities, 
15:515:41293:16:17:108:495:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:had 75% of the votes, and could elect six out of eight directors to the board. 
15:516:41372:17:16:90:525:272:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: A trust set up by the Company Executive, owned the Series C preferred securities, 
15:517:41455:16:17:108:512:256:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which promised a total dividend of $80,000 a year, had 12.5% of the votes, and 
15:518:41534:17:16:108:299:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:could elect one director to the board. 
15:519:41573:16:17:90:528:223:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: The Sister Corporation owned the Series D preferred securities, which paid a total 
15:520:41657:17:16:108:530:206:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dividend of $64,000 a year, had 12.5% of the votes, and could elect one director to 
15:521:41741:16:26:108:163:190:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the board. 
15:522:41752:26:16:72:466:164:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The BDHMI transaction also established a board of directors consisting of six 
15:523:41830:16:16:72:533:148:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:representatives of Black and Decker, the retired Company Executive, and a representative 
15:524:41919:16:0:72:203:132:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the Sister Corporation. 
16:525:41987:0:16:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Management did not change under BDHMI. The Key Manager, who managed health care 
16:526:42067:16:16:72:542:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expenses in Black and Decker before the creation of BDHMI became chairman of BDHMI; he 
16:527:42154:16:26:72:298:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:remained an employee of Black and Decker. 
16:528:42196:26:27:72:313:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:BDHMI had the following assets and liabilities: 
16:529:42244:27:16:90:520:623:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: BDHMI’s assets consisted of long-term promissory notes from Black and Decker, 
16:530:42323:16:17:108:519:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:paying interest and principal at various dates over the period 1999-2008. These 
16:531:42403:17:16:108:482:590:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:notes came about as the result of transactions in which Black and Decker 
16:532:42476:16:16:108:530:574:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transferred approximately $560 million in cash to BDHMI and BDHMI then loaned 
16:533:42554:16:16:108:541:558:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this money back to Black and Decker. BDHMI assets also included the proceeds from 
16:534:42636:16:17:108:322:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the sale of various securities to investors. 
16:535:42681:17:16:90:532:525:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: BDHMI’s “liabilities” consisted of its responsibilities for the payment of health care 
16:536:42769:16:16:108:515:509:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expenses of Black and Decker workers and retirees over the period 1999-2007. 
16:537:42846:16:17:108:536:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Note, however, that if BDHMI became insolvent, Black and Decker would be obliged 
16:538:42927:17:26:108:415:476:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to put in enough money to meet these health care expenses. 
16:539:42986:26:16:72:514:450:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The series C and D preferred shares could be called by BDHMI beginning on January 1, 
16:540:43071:16:16:72:516:434:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2004, and could be put to BDHMI by their holders beginning on January 1, 2006. When 
16:541:43155:16:16:72:526:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these securities were called, put, or retired (on December 31, 2007), their holders would 
16:542:43245:16:27:72:453:402:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:receive a liquidation or redemption value given by the following formulas: 
16:543:43320:27:17:90:509:375:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: Series C total share value = min {$5 million, $1 million + 10%  Equity Value}, 
16:544:43401:17:26:90:520:358:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: Series D total share value = min {$3.2 million, $0.8 million + 8%  Equity Value} 
16:545:43484:26:16:72:523:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Here,  Equity Value represents the excess, if any, of the corporation equity value at the 
16:546:43575:16:17:72:517:316:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:time of redemption over the initial value that was described in contracts governing the 
16:547:43663:17:16:72:514:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:BDHMI transaction. In effect, the formula was such that the holders of the Series C and 
16:548:43751:16:16:72:518:283:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Series D preferred shares, the Company Executive and Sister Corporation, respectively, 
16:549:43838:16:16:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would receive some share of the measured cost savings of providing health benefits, with 
16:550:43927:16:17:72:538:251:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Company Executive receiving 10% of such savings and the Sister Corporation receiving 
16:551:44016:17:16:72:532:234:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:8% of such savings, up to a cap in each case. The formula for  Equity Value also included 
16:552:44107:16:16:72:534:218:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:some positive and negative adjustments, which were purportedly designed to insulate the 
16:553:44195:16:26:72:517:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Company Executive and Sister Corporation from changes in costs beyond their control. 
16:554:44280:26:16:72:531:176:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:BDHMI had a three-year renewable consulting arrangement with the Benefits Consultant, 
16:555:44366:16:16:72:519:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:whereby the Benefits Consultant agreed to provide administrative services on a fee-for-
16:556:44453:16:17:72:500:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:service basis. Black and Decker also had a contract with the Processor, whereby the 
16:557:44537:17:0:72:316:127:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Processor agreed to process health care claims. 
17:558:44626:0:29:227:405:706:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f8:5.2. Analyzing	the	Transaction	
17:559:44656:29:16:72:516:677:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:What does the theory of the firm tell us about the economic substance of the Black and 
17:560:44743:16:16:72:516:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Decker-BDHMI transaction? Before 1999, Black and Decker employed personnel in the 
17:561:44825:16:16:72:499:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:human resources department--in combination with outside consultants such as the 
17:562:44905:16:16:71:541:629:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Benefits Consultant and independent contractors such as the Processor. After the Black and 
17:563:44996:16:17:71:502:613:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Decker-BDHMI transaction, health care benefits were administered by a new entity, 
17:564:45078:17:16:71:513:596:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:BDHMI, again in combination with the Benefits Consultant and the Processor. The Key 
17:565:45162:16:16:71:528:580:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Manager remained the same. The Company Executive was brought in as a board member 
17:566:45244:16:16:71:538:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and was compensated on the basis of the difference between actual healthcare expenses as 
17:567:45333:16:26:71:398:548:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:they transpired and the contemporaneous baseline projections. 
17:568:45395:26:17:71:521:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Can one argue that these organizational shifts brought efficiency gains that could not be 
17:569:45485:17:26:71:177:505:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achieved internally? 
17:570:45506:26:16:71:523:479:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:It is certainly true that some things changed. During the period December 1998 through 
17:571:45593:16:16:71:507:463:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:September 2003, BDHMI suggested, and Black and Decker thereafter implemented, a 
17:572:45673:16:16:71:541:447:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:number of proposals for reducing employee and retiree healthcare plan costs, including the 
17:573:45764:16:27:71:128:431:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:following:  
17:574:45776:27:16:89:528:404:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: encouraging retired employees to convert to health maintenance organizations as 
17:575:45857:16:17:107:247:388:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their healthcare providers; 
17:576:45885:17:17:89:402:371:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: outsourcing the administration of the retiree health plan; 
17:577:45945:17:16:89:490:354:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: increasing the portion of healthcare premiums paid by current and retired 
17:578:46020:16:17:107:168:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:employees; 
17:579:46031:17:17:89:512:321:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: increasing active and retired employees’ co-payments for healthcare expenses; 
17:580:46110:17:17:89:502:304:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: increasing active and retired employees’ co-payments on prescription drugs; 
17:581:46187:17:16:89:500:287:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: replacing the point of service and indemnity plans with a preferred provider 
17:582:46265:16:17:107:245:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:organization (“PPO”) plan; 
17:583:46292:17:17:89:388:254:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: adopting a three-tier prescription drug co-pay system; 
17:584:46348:17:16:89:298:237:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: creating a dental PPO for employees; 
17:585:46386:16:17:89:297:221:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: adopting a two-tier benefit plan; and 
17:586:46425:17:16:89:532:204:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: instituting a wellness lifestyle program, under which Plaintiff encouraged smoking 
17:587:46509:16:17:107:511:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cessation, weight loss, and exercise by banning smoking in all of its companies’ 
17:588:46590:17:16:107:512:171:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:facilities and vehicles, reimbursing employees for the prescription drug Zyban, 
17:589:46670:16:16:107:507:155:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:offering on-site smoking cessation classes, reimbursing employees for Weight 
17:590:46747:16:26:107:408:139:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Watchers meeting costs, and subsidizing fitness programs. 
17:591:46805:26:16:71:529:113:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The central question with regard to Black and Decker’s tax claim is could these proposals 
17:592:46895:16:0:71:422:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have been implemented just as well without the creation of BDHMI? 
18:593:47002:0:16:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:One approach to answering this question is to ask whether similar changes occurred at 
18:594:47088:16:16:72:507:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other companies that tried to control their health-care expenses, but did so in-house. 
18:595:47175:16:16:72:536:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:However, even if there are examples like this, the argument can always be made that these 
18:596:47265:16:17:72:540:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other firms were different, and Black and Decker required another approach. Thus it is also 
18:597:47357:17:16:72:540:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:useful to provide a more comprehensive answer. This is where PRT comes in.  According to 
18:598:47446:16:16:72:523:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:PRT, there is no substantive difference between a transaction inside a firm and between 
18:599:47534:16:16:72:536:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firms unless there is a shift in residual control rights. Thus the answer to the question--did 
18:600:47629:16:16:72:501:595:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:forming BDHMI create value? -- hinges on whether residual control rights shifted to 
18:601:47713:16:26:72:117:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:BDHMI.  
18:602:47721:26:17:72:541:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A striking feature of the Black and Decker-BDHMI transaction is that residual control rights 
18:603:47814:17:16:72:538:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:did not shift: Black and Decker maintained complete control over the operations of BDHMI. 
18:604:47904:16:26:71:137:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Specifically,  
18:605:47919:26:26:107:425:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(a) Black and Decker had the majority of the votes of BDHMI;  
18:606:47981:26:16:107:539:468:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(b) Black and Decker could elect the majority of the board members (6 out of 8) and 
18:607:48065:16:27:108:274:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:could replace them at any time;  
18:608:48098:27:16:108:511:425:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(c) all decisions of the BDHMI board had to be ratified by the Black and Decker 
18:609:48178:16:26:108:325:409:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:senior vice president of human resources. 
18:610:48220:26:16:72:542:383:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:An implication of this is that the parties working on the provision of health care benefits for 
18:611:48316:16:16:72:540:367:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Black and Decker employees and retirees have no more independence after the transaction 
18:612:48404:16:16:72:527:351:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:than they had before. Suppose that the Key Manager or the Benefits Consultant comes up 
18:613:48491:16:17:72:534:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with an idea for reducing costs. When health care benefits were administered and paid for 
18:614:48581:17:16:72:501:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:inside Black and Decker, this idea would have had to be approved by the senior vice 
18:615:48665:16:16:72:518:302:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:president and ultimately by the Black and Decker board. Now that BDHMI is a separate 
18:616:48750:16:16:72:532:286:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:entity, this is still the case. First, as we have seen all decisions of the BDHMI board have to 
18:617:48846:16:16:72:528:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be ratified by the senior vice president. Second, given that Black and Decker appoints the 
18:618:48937:16:17:72:528:254:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:majority of the BDHMI board and can replace its representatives at any time, it can easily 
18:619:49028:17:26:72:261:237:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:veto any decision that it doesn’t like. 
18:620:49068:26:16:72:482:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To take another example, suppose that the Key Manager’s performance starts to 
18:621:49146:16:16:72:534:195:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:deteriorate and Black and Decker wants to replace him as a top manager. This was easy to 
18:622:49235:16:16:72:530:179:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:do when health care benefits were managed in-house. However, it is still easy to do when 
18:623:49324:16:16:72:527:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:BDHMI is a separate entity. Black and Decker can simply instruct the board to fire him or 
18:624:49414:16:27:72:387:147:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:replace the majority of board members if it refuses to do this. 
18:625:49477:27:16:72:514:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We noted in Section 3 that there are some restructurings, such as equity carve-outs, in 
18:626:49565:16:16:72:537:104:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which control does not shift and yet where there can be real effects on performance. These 
18:627:49656:16:0:72:535:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effects occur because the profits of the new entity have greater transparency and integrity 
19:628:49789:0:16:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and this can permit the use of performance-based compensation. Moreover, the benefits of 
19:629:49878:16:16:72:534:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance-based compensation are increased if greater transparency of profits permits 
19:630:49966:16:16:72:511:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the creation of a public market in the carved-out entity’s shares and the market yields 
19:631:50054:16:27:72:337:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:important information about the entity’s prospects. 
19:632:50106:27:16:72:530:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:It is hard to believe that the greater transparency of profits could have been an important 
19:633:50198:16:16:72:522:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:factor in the present context. The key parties able to generate cost savings were the Key 
19:634:50288:16:16:72:525:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Manager, Company Executive, Benefits Consultant (and possibly the Sister Corporation). 
19:635:50375:16:16:71:500:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The Key Manager did not have a formal incentive scheme with BDHMI. The Benefits 
19:636:50455:16:16:71:511:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consultant was paid on a fee-for-service basis.  The Company Executive and the Sister 
19:637:50541:16:17:71:524:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Corporation held securities whose return was determined by a formula in which BDHMI 
19:638:50625:17:16:71:491:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:profit did not appear directly. Furthermore, the parties specified a mechanism for 
19:639:50708:16:16:71:519:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:determining the values of the variables that were in the formula--benefit liabilities plus 
19:640:50799:16:16:71:518:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:various positive and negative adjustments:  the ability to manipulate this variables was 
19:641:50888:16:16:71:491:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:independent of ownership or control rights. Finally, BDHMI does not benefit from 
19:642:50969:16:27:71:269:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:participating in public equity markets. 
19:643:51009:27:16:71:531:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We do not intend to suggest that ownership and control could not be relevant in the Black 
19:644:51099:16:16:71:538:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Decker-BDHMI transaction. For example, Black and Decker, through its majority board 
19:645:51187:16:16:71:505:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:representation, can decide whether to fire the Key Manager or whether to renew the 
19:646:51270:16:16:71:514:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Benefit Consultant’s contract. If control had shifted to the Key Manager or the Benefits 
19:647:51359:16:16:71:527:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consultant (or the associated Sister Corporation), such decisions might conceivably have 
19:648:51448:16:17:71:505:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been made differently. This in turn might have affected the Key Manager’s or Benefit 
19:649:51533:17:26:71:522:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consultant’s incentives. However, control did not shift--it stayed with Black and Decker. 
19:650:51623:26:16:71:531:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:For the above reasons, the United States was not swayed by Black and Decker’s claim that 
19:651:51712:16:16:71:507:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the BDHMI transaction made management more independent and allowed the use of 
19:652:51790:16:16:71:537:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:higher-powered incentive schemes, yielding efficiency gains. It is quite possible that health 
19:653:51884:16:17:71:535:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:care benefits were not being managed efficiently inside Black and Decker before 1999 and 
19:654:51973:17:16:71:520:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that some improvements were feasible. In particular, there may have been an excessive 
19:655:52059:16:16:71:519:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:focus on reducing short-term costs at the expense of generating long-term cost savings. 
19:656:52147:16:16:71:533:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:However, given that there was no change in control, these improvements could have been 
19:657:52234:16:16:71:539:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achieved simply by changing the incentive arrangements between Black and Decker and its 
19:658:52322:16:16:71:518:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:employees and outside contractors, rather than through the creation of a new business 
19:659:52408:16:17:71:516:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:entity. Moreover, doing things this way would have saved substantial transaction costs 
19:660:52495:17:16:71:526:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:associated with making BDHMI responsible for Black and Decker’s health care liabilities; 
19:661:52584:16:0:71:463:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these costs ultimately amounted to nearly $3 million in legal and other fees.

20:663:52732:29:16:72:518:677:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:What did the court decide in The	Black	and	Decker	Corporation	v.	USA? Prior to trial the 
20:664:52821:16:16:72:516:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:district court granted summary judgment in favor of Black and Decker under the sham 
20:665:52905:16:16:72:517:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction test. The judge's reasoning was that significant business activity took place 
20:666:52995:16:16:72:521:629:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:within BDHMI, and so, even if the transaction was tax-motivated (which Black & Decker 
20:667:53081:16:17:72:539:613:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:conceded for summary judgment purposes), it was not a sham. The Fourth Circuit reversed 
20:668:53169:17:16:72:536:596:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the judgment for Black & Decker and remanded the case to district court for trial.  In doing 
20:669:53262:16:16:72:532:580:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:so, the Fourth Circuit ruled that substantial business activity within BDHMI did not imbue 
20:670:53353:16:16:72:523:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the BDHMI transaction with economic substance.  Rather, the BDHMI transaction had to 
20:671:53438:16:16:72:514:548:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have the potential to realize significant non-tax benefits in order for Black & Decker to 
20:672:53528:16:17:72:496:532:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:claim the tax benefits the transaction was designed to maximize.  On that score the 
20:673:53612:17:16:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government offered ample evidence [from four expert witnesses] to permit a reasonable 
20:674:53698:16:16:72:526:499:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:trier of fact to conclude that Black & Decker lacked a reasonable expectation of earning a 
20:675:53789:16:16:72:537:483:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:non-tax profit from the BDHMI transaction (The	Black	and	Decker	Corporation,	436 F. 3d at 
20:676:53879:16:30:72:407:467:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:17) .  The case settled soon after, rendering the trial unnecessary.

20:678:53982:29:16:72:531:408:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo, a global financial services company, is another US taxpayer that engaged in a 
20:679:54073:16:16:72:533:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contingent liability transaction in 1998.  The contingent liabilities Wells Fargo transferred 
20:680:54167:16:17:72:535:376:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:related to real-estate leases estimated to be underwater by approximately $426 million. 11  
20:681:54259:17:16:71:532:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As with Black and Decker, Wells Fargo asserted that it was entitled to what amounted to a 
20:682:54349:16:16:71:531:343:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:double tax deduction:  one in the form of a capital loss from the sale of stock it received in 
20:683:54444:16:16:71:533:327:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the initial exchange, and another in the form of ordinary and necessary business expenses 
20:684:54534:16:16:71:509:311:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:associated with the transferred leases. The government, in contrast, asserted that the 
20:685:54621:16:17:71:481:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction that produced the capital loss was an economic sham and should be 
20:686:54699:17:16:71:519:278:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:disregarded as such.  We will see that the structure of the transaction is quite similar to 
20:687:54791:16:16:71:539:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that in Black and Decker, but that the transaction raises additional issues that PRT can help

20:690:54948:29:16:72:524:187:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As of 1998, Wells Fargo, as a result of mergers and office space consolidation, had sublet 
20:691:55039:16:29:72:531:171:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:numerous properties to third parties.  Many of these leases were underwater in the sense

20:695:55408:11:12:71:527:95:100:Times:100:Times:Report of Oliver D. Hart, submitted in WFC Holdings Corporation on December 1, 2008, which can be retrieved 
20:696:55516:12:0:71:350:83:100:Times:100:Times:through PACER at https://ecf.mnd.uscourts.gov/doc1/10112809711.  
21:697:55622:0:16:72:508:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that Wells Fargo earned less from is subtenants than it was paying under the original 
21:698:55708:16:26:72:108:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:leases. 
21:699:55716:26:16:72:504:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In December 1998, Wells Fargo transferred securities and approximately two dozen 
21:700:55797:16:17:72:523:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:underwater leases to Charter, a dormant subsidiary, under an exchange agreement. The 
21:701:55882:17:16:72:528:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:difference between the present value of lease expenses and the present value of sublease 
21:702:55971:16:16:72:521:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income on the underwater leases was estimated to be approximately $425 million.  The 
21:703:56056:16:16:72:542:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transferred securities were intended to fund the lease liabilities and were nearly equivalent 
21:704:56150:16:16:72:508:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in value (after accounting for [nominal stockholder equity payments]).  Together, the 
21:705:56236:16:16:72:540:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exchanged lease liabilities and securities accounted for virtually all the assets and liabilities 
21:706:56334:16:27:72:129:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of Charter. 
21:707:56346:27:16:72:527:526:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As a result of the exchange, Wells Fargo received 100 percent of Charter’s common stock 
21:708:56434:16:16:72:541:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and preferred shares. The preferred stock carried a 6.625 percent dividend and was voting, 
21:709:56525:16:16:72:521:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cumulative, and non-participating. In addition, if the tax laws on dividends changed, the 
21:710:56615:16:16:72:499:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dividend on the preferred shares would be adjusted so that preferred shareholders 
21:711:56697:16:17:72:501:462:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:received the same amount in net terms as before the tax change.  Further, a support 
21:712:56781:17:16:72:508:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:agreement between Wells Fargo and Charter essentially guaranteed that Wells Fargo 
21:713:56863:16:16:72:495:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would make up any shortfall if Charter had insufficient funds to make the required 
21:714:56946:16:26:72:183:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dividend payments.    
21:715:56968:26:16:72:534:387:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In February 1999 Wells Fargo sold 20 percent of the preferred shares to Lehman Brothers 
21:716:57056:16:16:72:533:371:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for $3,750,022.22.15.  Thus, at this date, Wells Fargo owned all the common equity and 80 
21:717:57146:16:17:72:535:355:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent of the preferred equity in Charter, and Lehman owned 20 percent of the preferred 
21:718:57235:17:16:72:507:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equity. Each common and preferred share of Charter had one vote. Since Wells Fargo 
21:719:57318:16:16:72:504:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:owned 630,000 shares of common stock and 16,000 shares of preferred stock, while 
21:720:57399:16:16:72:519:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Lehman owned 4,000 shares of preferred stock, Wells Fargo had over 99 percent of the 
21:721:57484:16:16:72:501:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:votes. Although Wells Fargo required approval from Lehman to take certain actions 
21:722:57566:16:17:72:532:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:affecting the rights of preferred shareholders, in all other matters, such as the selection of 
21:723:57661:17:26:72:369:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the board of directors, Wells Fargo had complete control.  
21:724:57720:26:16:72:539:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As of December 1998, Charter’s board of directors had three members. In addition, Charter 
21:725:57810:16:16:72:526:215:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:had two officers. All of these individuals, except for possibly one, were also employees of 
21:726:57902:16:16:72:534:199:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo. The two senior managers had a formal bonus plan with Charter that involved 
21:727:57990:16:16:72:531:183:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a formulaic assessment of Charter's performance. These assessments were done annually 
21:728:58076:16:17:72:541:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and on a property-by-property basis. For each property, a benchmark calculation of the Net 
21:729:58167:17:16:72:518:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Present Value (NPV) of the underwater lease liabilities was made based on a December 
21:730:58252:16:16:72:523:134:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1998 projection. These benchmark calculations were intended to capture the difference 
21:731:58338:16:16:72:517:118:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between what Charter was paying on the master leases and what it was receiving from 
21:732:58422:16:0:72:504:102:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:subtenants. Charter's annual performance was measured by comparing revised NPV 
22:733:58542:0:16:72:511:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:calculations that incorporated actual performance to date, as defined in the Executive 
22:734:58629:16:26:72:373:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Officer Bonus Plan, with the 1998 benchmark calculations. 
22:735:58687:26:16:72:521:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Charter's aggregate performance was calculated as the sum of the gains associated with 
22:736:58774:16:17:72:513:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:individual properties in which gains were achieved. That is, properties with measured 
22:737:58860:17:16:72:538:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:losses were not included in each year's aggregate performance measurement. According to 
22:738:58948:16:16:72:507:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the bonus plan, as of 2003, the two senior managers were entitled to 6 percent and 4 
22:739:59033:16:16:72:531:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent, respectively, of the measured performance gains, as long as certain pre-specified 
22:740:59124:16:16:72:512:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:thresholds were met. Based on $56.8 million in calculated performance gains through 
22:741:59208:16:30:72:535:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2003, the two senior managers were entitled to $3.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively. 
22:742:59300:30:29:227:405:539:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f8:6.2. Analyzing	the	Transaction	
22:743:59330:29:17:72:540:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:What does the theory of the firm tell us about the economic substance underlying the Wells 
22:744:59421:17:16:72:520:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fargo-Charter transaction? Before December 1998, Wells Fargo employed personnel in 
22:745:59504:16:16:72:538:477:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their Corporate Properties Group to manage their leases. After December 1998, 21 of these 
22:746:59594:16:16:72:511:461:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:leases were transferred to Charter. The personnel working on the 21 leases remained 
22:747:59678:16:16:72:523:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:essentially the same.  Also, Charter’s two senior managers had been and continued to be 
22:748:59766:16:26:72:198:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo employees.  
22:749:59790:26:17:72:530:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The Business Case prepared by Wells Fargo highlighted two important economic benefits 
22:750:59876:17:16:72:518:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of creating Charter. First, managers would be incentivized to beat the market, and such 
22:751:59964:16:16:72:524:370:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incentives would likely contribute to the success of the project.  Second, transferring the 
22:752:60056:16:16:72:524:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:underwater leases to Charter would allow for improved negotiations with (prospective) 
22:753:60142:16:16:72:491:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:subtenants that had deposit or borrowing relationships with Wells Fargo and had 
22:754:60222:16:27:72:520:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:leveraged (or might leverage) these arrangements to get more favorable leasing terms.  
22:755:60309:27:16:72:515:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:There is a problem with both of these arguments. A striking feature of the Wells Fargo-
22:756:60396:16:16:71:538:279:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Charter transaction is that Wells Fargo maintained complete control over the operations of 
22:757:60487:16:16:71:516:263:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Charter. Specifically, Wells Fargo had over 99 percent of the votes of Charter and could 
22:758:60576:16:16:71:496:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:elect or replace the board of directors at any time. Further, the Support Agreement 
22:759:60660:16:16:71:541:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between Wells Fargo and Charter required Wells Fargo to maintain enough votes to be able 
22:760:60749:16:17:72:529:215:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to elect a majority of Charter’s board of directors, so Wells Fargo would always remain in 
22:761:60840:17:16:72:533:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control of Charter. An implication of this was that the parties working on the management 
22:762:60930:16:16:72:524:182:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of leases had no more independence after the transaction than they had before. Suppose 
22:763:61017:16:16:72:515:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that one of the senior managers comes up with an idea for filling vacant properties, for 
22:764:61106:16:16:72:522:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:example, a new marketing plan. When leases were managed by Wells Fargo’s Corporate 
22:765:61189:16:16:72:533:134:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Properties Group this idea could be vetoed by Wells Fargo top management if it did not fit 
22:766:61280:16:0:72:390:118:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in with their overall strategy or they thought it was a mistake. 
23:767:61386:0:16:72:504:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This is still the case when the leases are managed by Charter. Given that Wells Fargo 
23:768:61472:16:16:71:540:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:appoints the Charter board, it can veto any decision that it does not like. While Charter may 
23:769:61566:16:16:71:527:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be a separate legal entity, the senior managers and other Charter employees are no more 
23:770:61654:16:27:71:350:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:autonomous from Wells Fargo than they were before.  
23:771:61706:27:16:71:514:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To take another example, suppose that the performance of one of the senior managers 
23:772:61790:16:16:72:542:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:starts to deteriorate and Wells Fargo wants to replace him. This was easy to do when leases 
23:773:61882:16:16:72:523:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were managed in-house. However, it is still easy to do when Charter is a separate entity. 
23:774:61972:16:16:72:537:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo can simply instruct the board to fire the senior manager and replace the board 
23:775:62063:16:27:72:134:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:if it refuses. 
23:776:62078:27:16:72:507:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Let us turn to the argument that negotiations with (prospective) subtenants that had 
23:777:62163:16:16:72:533:526:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:deposit or borrowing relationships with Wells Fargo would change with the emergence of 
23:778:62250:16:16:71:504:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Charter. One rationale appears to have been that Wells Fargo bank customers would 
23:779:62332:16:16:71:515:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:recognize Charter as distinct from Wells Fargo and no longer attempt to leverage their 
23:780:62419:16:16:71:526:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:deposit or borrowing relationship to receive favorable sublease terms. It is hard to make 
23:781:62509:16:17:71:530:462:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sense of this given that Charter was not an independent entity; Wells Fargo had complete 
23:782:62598:17:16:72:525:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control over its board. Further, the people involved in managing the Charter leases were 
23:783:62687:16:16:72:514:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo personnel. Thus, any client who understood Charter’s corporate structure 
23:784:62772:16:16:72:488:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would realize that its ability to persuade Wells Fargo to put pressure on the lease 
23:785:62856:16:16:72:526:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:negotiators was exactly the same after the formation of Charter as before. Further, Wells 
23:786:62946:16:16:72:539:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fargo continued to present its face to the subtenants of some underwater leases. As of June 
23:787:63038:16:17:72:525:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:30, 1999, no notices of transfer had been sent to the subtenants of 21 underwater leases 
23:788:63127:17:16:72:531:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and rent checks from subtenants continued to be paid to Wells Fargo. Finally, some of the 
23:789:63217:16:26:72:517:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:materials associated with the sublease agreements indicated Wells Fargo involvement. 
23:790:63302:26:16:72:533:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A second rationale, provided by Charter’s two senior managers, is that the presence of the 
23:791:63393:16:16:72:521:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:third party Lehman changed Charter’s negotiating stance. The idea is that Charter could 
23:792:63481:16:17:72:528:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and did argue that it was unable to provide special deals for prospective subtenants with 
23:793:63571:17:16:72:538:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo banking relationships, given its obligations and fiduciary duty to Lehman. This 
23:794:63663:16:16:72:498:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:claim could make sense if Lehman’s returns from its investment in Charter actually 
23:795:63746:16:16:72:541:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:depended in a meaningful way on the terms of the leases that Charter signed. However, this 
23:796:63837:16:16:72:523:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was not the case. The returns associated with Lehman’s investment in Charter were pre-
23:797:63923:16:16:72:534:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:specified and backed both by Charter and by Wells Fargo, through the Support Agreement 
23:798:64010:16:17:72:522:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mentioned above. Moreover, Charter’s actions as they relate to potential good customer 
23:799:64097:17:16:72:528:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:discounts had no practical effect on the combined financial integrity of Charter and Wells 
23:800:64188:16:26:72:109:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fargo.  
23:801:64196:26:16:72:535:118:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Of course, it may have been the case that prospective subtenants believed	that Charter was 
23:802:64287:16:0:72:529:102:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:independent even if it was not, or believed	that Lehman’s investment was at risk even if it 
24:803:64420:0:16:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was not. In other words it is possible that clients had wrong perceptions.  However, the 
24:804:64509:16:26:72:491:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:business purpose of a transaction that relies on subterfuge seems questionable12.  
24:805:64590:26:16:72:520:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A further argument that one of the senior managers and others made is that to improve 
24:806:64676:16:17:72:485:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance it was important for the leases to be separated from the day-to-day 
24:807:64756:17:16:72:521:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:operations of the bank. However, creating a unit inside Wells Fargo whose sole purpose 
24:808:64843:16:26:72:392:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was to manage the leases would have achieved the same goal.  
24:809:64904:26:16:72:540:591:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We noted in Section 3 that there are some restructurings, for example, equity carve-outs, in 
24:810:64997:16:16:72:538:575:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which control does not shift and yet there can be real effects on performance. These effects 
24:811:65090:16:17:72:522:559:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:occur because the profits of the new entity have greater transparency and integrity, and 
24:812:65179:17:16:72:515:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this can permit the use of performance-based compensation. Moreover, the benefits of 
24:813:65264:16:16:72:534:526:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performance-based compensation are increased if greater transparency of profits permits 
24:814:65352:16:16:72:514:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the creation of a public market in the carved-out entity’s shares, and the market yields 
24:815:65441:16:26:72:337:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:important information about the entity’s prospects. 
24:816:65493:26:16:72:536:468:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:It is hard to believe that the greater transparency of profits could be an important factor in 
24:817:65588:16:17:72:525:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo’s case. The compensation of the key parties who may be able to improve the 
24:818:65675:17:16:72:498:435:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:leasing was determined by a formulaic calculation that did not depend on Charter’s 
24:819:65758:16:16:72:518:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ultimate profitability. Furthermore, Charter did not benefit from participating in public 
24:820:65848:16:26:72:154:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equity markets. 
24:821:65864:26:16:72:510:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We may summarize the U.S. government’s position as follows. The idea that the Wells 
24:822:65948:16:17:72:526:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fargo-Charter transaction made management more independent and that this permitted 
24:823:66031:17:16:72:519:344:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the use of higher-powered incentive schemes, or allowed management to bargain more 
24:824:66114:16:16:72:466:328:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:aggressively with lessees or lessors, is unconvincing. There was no change in 
24:825:66192:16:16:72:518:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:independence. It is quite possible that leases were not being efficiently managed inside 
24:826:66281:16:16:72:533:296:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo before December 1998 and that some improvements were feasible. However, 
24:827:66365:16:16:72:521:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these improvements could have been achieved by changing the incentive arrangements 
24:828:66448:16:17:72:532:264:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between Wells Fargo and its employees via contract, rather than through the creation of a 
24:829:66538:17:16:72:517:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:new business entity, Charter.  Moreover, doing things this way would likely have saved 
24:830:66625:16:37:72:456:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:significant transaction costs, just as in the Black and Decker transaction.13   
24:831:66705:37:20:72:218:194:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
24:832:66761:20:16:72:541:174:42:Times:100:Times:12  Implicit in both these rationales is the idea that it is in Wells Fargo’s interest that Charter be seen by subtenants as 
24:833:66886:16:11:71:519:158:100:Times:100:Times:independent, so that they cannot leverage their deposit or borrowing relationships to get more favorable leasing 
24:834:66999:11:12:71:540:147:100:Times:100:Times:terms. This is in fact far from obvious. Leverage might allow Wells Fargo to price discriminate, offering better deals 
24:835:67118:12:11:71:513:135:100:Times:100:Times:to some subtenants (those with deposit or borrowing relationships) than to others (those without). We will not 
24:836:67229:11:10:71:478:124:100:Times:100:Times:pursue this issue further, but simply note that it casts further doubt on the merits of the business case. 
24:837:67336:10:16:72:522:114:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:13 There is one important further consideration in the Wells Fargo case. Wells Fargo also had a regulatory 
24:838:67443:16:13:71:508:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:motive for setting up Charter. Doing so allowed Wells Fargo to switch regulators from the Office of the 
24:839:67547:13:0:71:536:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Comptroller of the Currency to the Federal Reserve Board, which gave it a longer period of time to dispose of 
25:840:67698:0:29:238:394:706:195:g_d0_f7:195:g_d0_f8:6.3. Disposition	of	the	Case	
25:841:67726:29:16:72:498:677:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Following a trial in October 2010, the district court found that Wells Fargo lacked a 
25:842:67812:16:16:72:539:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:legitimate business purpose for engaging in its contingent liability transaction, and that the 
25:843:67907:16:16:72:508:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction lacked economic substance (which the court considered independently).  
25:844:67990:16:27:72:245:629:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Specifically, the Court found that: 
25:845:68026:27:16:90:502:602:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2: “Charter... is a straw entity controlled by WFC and created for the purpose of 
25:846:68106:16:17:108:494:586:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectuating the [transaction]. Its nature undermines a finding of a ‘genuine 
25:847:68184:17:16:108:274:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:multiple-party transaction . . . .’”

25:851:68441:17:16:90:521:503:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f2:  “... any argument for efficiency based on the executive bonus plan is illusory”, as 
25:852:68527:16:16:108:532:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wells Fargo could have implemented such a bonus plan, with lower administrative 
25:853:68607:16:16:108:535:471:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:costs, without the 1998 transaction.  (WFC	Holdings	Corporation, 108 A.F.T.R. 2d at

25:860:68968:16:16:72:521:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:framework proves useful in providing guidance beyond the two cases described above.  
25:861:69053:16:16:72:531:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consider, for example, TIFD	III‐E	vs.	United	States, commonly known as Castle Harbour. 14  
25:862:69144:16:16:71:511:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In this case the taxpayer argued that it had entered into a partnership with two Dutch

25:864:69323:17:16:71:508:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:argument that the transaction had the bone	fide economic substance of raising equity 
25:865:69408:16:17:71:519:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capital rested critically on its assertions that the securities received by the Dutch banks

25:870:70004:13:14:72:526:168:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:into the transaction.  This would surely have saved some legal and other costs.  At the same time without a 
25:871:70112:14:13:72:536:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:third party Wells Fargo would not have qualified for the tax benefits that the court found were at the heart of 
25:872:70224:13:23:72:143:141:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:this transaction.

25:874:70242:7:16:72:528:111:42:Times:100:Times:14 Unless otherwise noted, the facts from this section are drawn from  TIFD III-E Inc., the Tax Matters Partner of 
25:875:70357:16:12:71:537:95:100:Times:100:Times:Castle Harbour-I Limited-Liability Company (342 F. Supp. 2d 94 [D. Conn. 2004], rev’d and  remanded , 459 F. 3d 
25:876:70469:12:0:71:539:83:100:Times:100:Times:220 [2d Cir. 2006], judgment on remand 660 F. Supp. 2d 367 [D. Conn. 2009], rev’d 666 F. 3d 836 [2d Cir. 2012].   
26:877:70624:0:16:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were properly characterized as equity.  Both a trial court and an appellate court evaluated 
26:878:70716:16:16:72:520:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the nature of the cash flows associated with the securities, as well as the corresponding 
26:879:70806:16:16:72:494:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:risks.  Consistent with PRT, both courts examined whether the banks had received 
26:880:70887:16:17:72:527:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:management or control rights.  The trial court, however, sided with the plaintiff and held 
26:881:70978:17:16:72:539:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that even though the Dutch banks had not received any control or management rights, they 
26:882:71067:16:16:72:539:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:had nonetheless received equity.  The district court reasoned that the “average stockholder 
26:883:71159:16:16:72:521:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of a publically traded corporation has no management rights, but there is little doubt he 
26:884:71249:16:16:72:524:595:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:holds equity” (TIFD	III‐E	Inc., 342 F. Supp. 2d at 39).  Given that the lack of control rights 
26:885:71344:16:17:72:530:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:did not automatically disqualify a security from being equity, the district court found that 
26:886:71437:17:16:72:512:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the securities received by the Dutch banks carried enough uncertainty and equity-like 
26:887:71523:16:26:72:262:546:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:properties to be considered equity.    
26:888:71562:26:16:72:500:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This superficial observation ignores the role that even those with individually small 
26:889:71648:16:16:72:535:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:holdings of shares and votes can have in influencing and constraining managerial decision-
26:890:71738:16:16:72:512:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:making.  Critically, small shareholders can form voting blocs and coalitions with other 
26:891:71826:16:17:71:533:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:similarly situated shareholders, or can sell their shares and votes to an activist investor or 
26:892:71921:17:16:71:524:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:takeover bidder who will then have enough votes to affect what the company does.  This 
26:893:72008:16:16:71:531:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:threat constrains the actions of a company’s managers.15  Further, in the context of public 
26:894:72100:16:16:72:540:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:companies, enough dissenting votes can signal significant dissatisfaction, leading managers 
26:895:72192:16:16:72:537:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to re-evaluate their strategy. Composition of ownership is critical here: small shareholders 
26:896:72285:16:26:72:501:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have power precisely because there is no large shareholder who can out-vote them. 
26:897:72367:26:17:72:495:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Castle Harbor, in contrast, the presence of a majority shareholder precluded the 
26:898:72451:17:16:72:510:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:minority shareholder from any direct influence on decision-making.  Even though the 
26:899:72535:16:16:72:507:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Dutch banks contributed nearly 20 percent of the partnership’s assets, they were not 
26:900:72620:16:16:72:530:316:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:entitled to any votes, and exercised no managerial control or influence.  The district court 
26:901:72713:16:16:72:533:300:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:found that FAA rules actively precluded the possibility of giving the Dutch banks a right to 
26:902:72806:16:17:71:519:284:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:elect managers (TIFD	III‐E	Inc., 342 F. Supp. 2d at 18).  Even without that limitation, the 
26:903:72898:17:16:71:514:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Dutch Banks securities’ were, effectively, meaningless in controlling how the company 
26:904:72984:16:16:71:532:251:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would be run, and, as a result, lacked, as PRT highlights, the defining feature of ownership 
26:905:73077:16:26:71:311:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:when viewed in terms of economic substance.  
26:906:73122:26:16:71:511:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Ultimately, the Second Circuit (twice) overturned the district court and found that the 
26:907:73210:16:16:71:522:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“interest of the banks was not a bona fide equity participation,” relying on an analysis of 
26:908:73302:16:17:71:515:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:seven factors which it decided suggested that the banks had received debt, not equity.  
26:909:73390:17:16:71:540:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:While the Second Circuit generally relied upon the district court’s analysis of the cash flows 
26:910:73485:16:25:71:514:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:associated with the Dutch banks’ securities, it concluded that the risks associated with 
26:911:73574:25:20:71:217:119:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
26:912:73630:20:16:72:526:99:42:Times:100:Times:15 There is a voluminous literature on activist investors and the market for corporate control.  For a summary, see 
26:913:73746:16:0:72:189:83:100:Times:100:Times:Shleifer and Vishny (1997).  
27:914:73816:0:16:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these securities were not sufficient to warrant their categorization as equity.  In short, the 
27:915:73911:16:16:72:527:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Second Circuit determined that while the consideration received by the Dutch Banks had 
27:916:73998:16:16:72:533:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:some of the superficial appearances of equity, the bulk of the evidence suggested that “the 
27:917:74090:16:17:72:536:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:funds were advanced with reasonable expectations of repayment regardless of the success 
27:918:74178:17:26:72:156:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the venture.”  
27:919:74196:26:16:72:524:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The conflicting decisions reached by the courts in Castle Harbor demonstrate the murky 
27:920:74283:16:16:72:528:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:nature of characterizing debt and equity based on cash flows and risks.  A wide variety of 
27:921:74374:16:16:72:528:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:factors drive the underlying risks of the cash flow rights associated with a given security, 
27:922:74467:16:16:72:526:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and the corresponding risk profiles are challenging to measure.  Further, there are many 
27:923:74556:16:17:72:481:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ways to formulate payment terms that are neither uniform and fixed (like those 
27:924:74635:17:16:72:506:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:traditionally associated with debt) nor entirely “residual” (like those associated with 
27:925:74723:16:16:72:541:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equity).  Establishing a “bright line” distinction between debt and equity in terms of income 
27:926:74817:16:16:72:514:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rights can pose significant challenges and may be open to abuse.16  PRT highlights that 
27:927:74905:16:16:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:courts need not undertake such a difficult endeavor because, from an economic substance 
27:928:74993:16:17:72:537:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:perspective, control is the defining characteristic of ownership and control rights are often 
27:929:75087:17:26:72:210:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:much easier to identify.17.   
27:930:75117:26:16:72:538:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Analysis of another case, Canal	Corp.	v.	Commissioner, highlights a similar observation.18  In 
27:931:75212:16:16:72:532:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this case, the “taxpayer” formed what it characterized as a partnership with another large 
27:932:75303:16:16:72:516:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:paper company, Georgia Pacific (GP), in which both contributed their respective tissue 
27:933:75390:16:16:72:541:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:paper businesses.  The partnership then borrowed money from an outside bank, which was 
27:934:75477:16:17:72:532:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:guaranteed by GP.  While GP received 95 percent of the partnership’s equity, the taxpayer 
27:935:75567:17:16:72:539:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:received a cash payout from the proceeds of the bank loan for nearly the entire value of the 
27:936:75660:16:26:72:200:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:business it contributed.   
27:937:75687:26:16:72:517:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The regulations under the Internal Revenue Code permit the IRS to re-characterize the 
27:938:75773:16:16:72:530:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contribution of a business to a partnership for cash as a disguised sale that (assuming the 
27:939:75865:16:17:72:532:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cash received exceeds the basis of the property contributed) triggers a taxable gain.  After 
27:940:75958:17:16:72:514:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the IRS re-characterized the above-transactions as a sale, the taxpayer argued that the 
27:941:76046:16:16:72:538:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction was actually a debt-financed transfer of consideration that should qualify as an 
27:942:76139:16:16:72:521:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exception to the disguised-sale rule (Silverman and Nocjar 2011).  This exception exists 
27:943:76228:16:16:72:489:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:when a taxpayer transfers a business to a partnership, receives cash, but remains 
27:944:76310:16:17:72:533:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:economically liable for some amount of the debt raised by the partnership.  In such a case, 
27:945:76402:17:19:72:218:176:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
27:946:76458:19:16:72:520:157:42:Times:100:Times:16 For instance, see Englebrecht et al. (2008) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (2010), noting that one 
27:947:76570:16:12:72:541:141:100:Times:100:Times:objective was to “Eliminate more than 60 pieces of current U.S. accounting literature that are inconsistent, subject to 
27:948:76690:12:7:72:270:129:100:Times:42:Times:structuring, or difficult to understand and apply.” 
27:949:76741:7:16:71:518:122:42:Times:100:Times:17 Of course, in practice income rights and control rights will often be held together and indeed there are strong 
27:950:76856:16:7:72:481:106:100:Times:100:Times:economic reasons for this. See, for example, Grossman and Hart (1988) and Harris and Raviv (1988). 
27:951:76955:7:16:72:540:99:42:Times:100:Times:18Unless otherwise noted, the facts presented in this section are from Canal Corporation and Subsidiaries, Formerly 
27:952:77071:16:0:71:489:83:100:Times:100:Times:Chesapeake Corporation and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (135 T.C. 199 [2010]). 
28:953:77211:0:16:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the amount of the taxpayer’s remaining liability can reduce the amount of the taxable gain.  
28:954:77304:16:16:72:490:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Canal	Corp, the taxpayer, through a subsidiary, indemnified the other partner’s 
28:955:77387:16:16:72:540:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:guarantee of the partnership’s debt, and argued that this indemnity generated an economic 
28:956:77477:16:27:72:467:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:interest in the liabilities of the partnership, greatly reducing its tax burden.     
28:957:77562:27:16:72:520:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Of note, however, is the fact that the taxpayer had given up all management and control 
28:958:77650:16:16:72:523:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rights to its tissue paper business, and does not appear to have been able to influence or 
28:959:77741:16:16:72:512:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:constrain managerial decision-making through covenants or other mechanisms in the 
28:960:77823:16:16:72:503:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:indemnity.  Rather, GP took over full control of the operation, apparently leaving the 
28:961:77910:16:16:72:491:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxpayer with no recourse should GP take some action increasing the risk that the 
28:962:77992:16:17:72:535:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:indemnity would be called.  This did not expose the taxpayer to any real economic liability 
28:963:78084:17:16:72:500:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:under the indemnity, however, because the indemnity (which GP did not request or 
28:964:78165:16:16:72:530:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:require) only covered the principal payments on the loan, due in 30 years, and limited GP 
28:965:78255:16:16:72:525:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to the assets of one of the taxpayer’s subsidiaries, with no provisions mandating that the 
28:966:78346:16:16:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:subsidiary retain assets to cover the indemnity (Canal	Corp., 135 T.C. at 10, 24-26). Based 
28:967:78438:16:17:72:532:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on this reasoning, the Tax Court denied the taxpayer claims and ruled that the transaction 
28:968:78529:17:26:72:222:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was, in fact, a disguised sale.  
28:969:78562:26:16:72:531:429:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:How does PRT relate to Canal	Corp.?  PRT offers an alternative approach to evaluating the 
28:970:78652:16:16:72:503:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:disguised sale exception.  From a PRT perspective the taxpayer’s contribution to the 
28:971:78737:16:16:72:489:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:partnership was unambiguously a sale of its paper business because the taxpayer 
28:972:78817:16:16:72:501:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transferred full control of its assets to the partner.  That is, the taxpayer retained no 
28:973:78907:16:17:72:505:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:authority over how those assets could be used.  Similar to Castle Harbor, focusing on 
28:974:78993:17:16:72:538:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control provides a clearer standard than one that depends on determining whether a given 
28:975:79082:16:26:72:452:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:party’s financial risk is, subsequent to the transaction, substantial enough. 
28:976:79160:26:16:72:542:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:These two examples illustrate a general point:  evaluating a sale based on control rights can 
28:977:79254:16:16:72:541:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be sufficient and allows the trier of fact to avoid the murkiness associated with establishing 
28:978:79349:16:17:72:507:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a specific cash-flow and risk threshold.  Canal	Corp. demonstrates the complexities of 
28:979:79436:17:16:72:538:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:accounting for risk exposure in uncertain business environments over long periods of time 
28:980:79526:16:16:72:509:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and in the face of insurance contracts, indemnification clauses and inactive corporate

28:982:79697:16:16:72:519:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assumptions upon which they rely (See Brealey and Myers (2000, 259-268), discussing 
28:983:79781:16:16:72:481:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sensitivity analysis and Higgins (2009, 103-106)).  A cynical view is that a given 
28:984:79864:16:17:72:521:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction’s terms may be structured to be complex so as to provide the appearance of 
28:985:79951:17:16:72:533:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantial risk where none exists.  Beyond that, since cash flows and risk profiles depend 
28:986:80043:16:16:72:532:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:critically on control, evaluating the latter is a more direct route to determining ownership 
28:987:80136:16:0:72:259:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:than is an evaluation of the former.

29:989:80229:29:16:72:529:677:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The purpose of this paper has been to demonstrate how the economics of ownership and 
29:990:80314:16:16:72:541:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control, specifically PRT, can provide guidance in evaluating the appropriate tax treatments 
29:991:80407:16:16:72:508:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:associated with complex corporate transactions.   Evaluations of economic substance 
29:992:80491:16:16:72:512:629:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and/or business purpose in the context of a corporate transaction often depend on an 
29:993:80576:16:17:72:522:613:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assessment of whether a particular party’s income claims look more like equity or more 
29:994:80663:17:16:72:505:596:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:like debt, or on a present value calculation of the efficiency benefits flowing from the 
29:995:80752:16:16:72:532:580:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction.  However, characterizing a party’s income rights can be very challenging, and 
29:996:80843:16:26:72:531:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:calculations of net present value are notoriously sensitive to assumptions and judgment.   
29:997:80934:26:16:72:540:538:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The view advanced here is that there is an alternative approach that the courts can use that 
29:998:81027:16:17:72:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is simpler and, importantly, more directly captures the economic substance associated with 
29:999:81118:17:16:72:510:505:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ownership. According to PRT the fundamental property of ownership is control. Thus 
29:1000:81201:16:16:72:517:489:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:whether a corporate transaction has economic substance or a business purpose can be 
29:1001:81285:16:16:72:539:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:determined by evaluating whether the transaction involves a meaningful change in control. 
29:1002:81375:16:16:71:537:457:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Did a key party who did not have control before the transaction gain control?  Making such 
29:1003:81466:16:26:72:336:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a determination can be relatively straightforward.   
29:1004:81519:26:17:72:489:415:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We have used the PRT approach to analyze the Black and Decker and Wells Fargo 
29:1005:81597:17:16:72:525:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transactions. In both cases there was no meaningful change in control.  Accordingly, PRT 
29:1006:81686:16:16:72:529:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:suggests that these transactions did not have economic substance or a business purpose.  
29:1007:81775:16:16:72:533:366:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The district court in Wells Fargo agreed, and while it is the only known decision to rely on 
29:1008:81868:16:16:72:498:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:PRT to evaluate the merits of a tax-motivated transaction, we have seen that PRT is 
29:1009:81952:16:16:72:534:334:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consistent with, and supports, the decisions in the Castle Harbor and Canal Corp. Cases. Of 
29:1010:82044:16:17:72:532:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:course, these four cases comprise a small subset of the universe of all cases. However, our 
29:1011:82136:17:16:72:533:301:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:belief and hope is that the approach described here has broad applicability and that it will 
29:1012:82229:16:26:72:222:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be useful in future cases too.  
29:1013:82261:26:16:72:497:259:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Of course, a natural question to ask is: If the economic substance of a transaction is 
29:1014:82348:16:16:72:522:243:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:evaluated according to whether a shift in control rights occurs, might parties not simply 
29:1015:82438:16:17:72:541:227:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:respond by designing their transaction so that a shift in control does indeed occur? There is 
29:1016:82532:17:16:72:534:210:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:no doubt that this is a possible outcome in some cases. However, the costs of structuring a 
29:1017:82624:16:16:72:537:194:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transaction in such a manner are likely to be significant. In the Black and Decker and Wells 
29:1018:82717:16:16:72:525:178:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fargo cases giving up control of employee and retiree health benefits on the one hand or 
29:1019:82806:16:16:72:518:162:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:real estate operations on the other is not something that either company ever seems to 
29:1020:82893:16:16:72:540:146:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have contemplated. More generally, the research—both theoretical and empirical—cited in 
29:1021:82981:16:17:72:540:130:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:footnote 3 provides strong support for the idea that control is valuable and that giving it up 
29:1022:83076:17:16:72:534:113:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:can expose a company to serious risks. A company may, of course, arrange matters so that 
29:1023:83165:16:0:72:521:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control appears to have been relinquished when it has not, but one would hope that the 
30:1024:83293:0:16:72:509:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:courts will be able to see through this. In summary we do not believe that gaming the 
30:1025:83379:16:16:72:507:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system will be a serious obstacle to the evaluation of economic substance in terms of 
30:1026:83465:16:26:72:114:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control.

31:1030:83562:29:16:72:531:677:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) provides that no gain or loss shall be 
31:1031:83654:16:16:72:542:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:recognized if property is transferred to a corporation solely in exchange for stock so long as 
31:1032:83749:16:16:72:531:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the transferor(s) control the corporation immediately after the exchange.  The purpose of 
31:1033:83839:16:16:72:531:629:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the provision is to save the transferor from the immediate recognition of gain (or loss) on

31:1035:84019:17:16:72:522:596:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:recognizes that such an exchange is not a sale of the property, but a “mere change in the 
31:1036:84109:16:16:72:510:580:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:form of ownership and the taxpayer has not really ‘cashed in’ on a theoretical gain, or 
31:1037:84197:16:16:72:516:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:‘closed out’ a losing venture”.  (Portland Oil Co. v. CIR, 109 F. 2d 479, 488 (1st Cir. , cert.

31:1039:84387:16:17:71:534:532:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the assets and liabilities of her sole proprietorship for all of the stock in a new corporation 
31:1040:84483:17:16:71:516:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:will not recognize any gain or loss until she sells the stock.  Section 358 recognizes this 
31:1041:84575:16:16:71:527:499:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mere change in form by providing that the taxpayer’s basis in the stock she received will, 
31:1042:84666:16:16:71:528:483:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with an important exception, be the same as her tax basis in the property she transferred

31:1044:84817:26:16:71:519:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:However, suppose that a taxpayer transfers some assets and some contingent liabilities 
31:1045:84904:16:17:71:540:425:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(liabilities whose amount or extent are not yet known) to the corporation.  How should this 
31:1046:84996:17:16:71:541:408:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transfer be treated for tax purposes?  In 1995, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue 
31:1047:85088:16:16:71:507:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Ruling 95-74 addressing the income tax consequences of a hypothetical transfer by a 
31:1048:85172:16:16:71:525:376:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:corporation of substantially all of its assets and associated contingent liabilities to a new 
31:1049:85266:16:16:71:520:360:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:corporation.  Those assets consisted of a manufacturing plant and equipment, while the 
31:1050:85353:16:17:71:519:344:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:liabilities represented the remediation costs that the transferring company expected to 
31:1051:85441:17:16:71:531:327:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incur in the future from environmental contamination caused by its operations.  In return 
31:1052:85531:16:16:71:529:311:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for its assets and the assumption of its contingent remediation liabilities, the transferring 
31:1053:85625:16:26:71:339:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:corporation received stock in the new corporation.   
31:1054:85678:26:16:71:542:269:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the revenue ruling, the IRS assumed that the transfer of assets and contingent liabilities 
31:1055:85772:16:16:71:542:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for stock qualified as a tax-free exchange under Section 351.  The questions presented were 
31:1056:85864:16:17:71:542:237:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1) whether the tax basis in the stock acquired by the transferring corporation should be 
31:1057:85953:17:16:71:543:220:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the new corporation; and 2) whether the 
31:1058:86041:16:16:71:542:204:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:new corporation could deduct the payments made on account of the contingent liabilities 
31:1059:86129:16:16:71:542:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as they were actually incurred. The IRS determined that the transferee’s tax basis in the 
31:1060:86219:16:16:71:542:172:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stock of the new corporation (namely, the amount by which any gain or loss on its sale 
31:1061:86306:16:17:71:542:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would be measured) was not reduced by the amount of the liabilities the new corporation 
31:1062:86394:17:16:71:542:139:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assumed.  Additionally, because the transferee had yet to incur those contingent liabilities, 
31:1063:86488:16:16:71:542:123:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the IRS concluded that the payment of those liabilities could be deducted as business 
31:1064:86574:16:0:71:251:107:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expenses by the new corporation.   
32:1065:86650:0:16:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consider the following practical example:  Corporation A transfers property with a tax 
32:1066:86737:16:16:72:543:692:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:basis and value of $10 million to Corporation B in exchange for Corporation B’s assumption 
32:1067:86828:16:16:72:542:676:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of $9 million worth of contingent liabilities and 100 percent of the shares of Corporation 
32:1068:86919:16:17:72:543:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B’s stock.  The market value of the stock is only $1 million.  However, the tax basis of the 
32:1069:87012:17:16:72:542:643:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stock is $10 million, because the contingent liabilities do not reduce the tax basis of the 
32:1070:87104:16:16:72:542:627:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stock of the new corporation.  If Corporation A were to sell the stock, it would realize a tax 
32:1071:87198:16:16:71:542:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:loss of $9 million (the market value of the stock minus its tax basis).  Furthermore, 
32:1072:87284:16:16:71:542:595:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Corporation  B  can  deduct  the  cost  of  its  contingent  liabilities  as  incurred.    Since 
32:1073:87381:16:17:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Corporation B is owned and controlled by Corporation A, Corporation A can receive what is 
32:1074:87471:17:16:71:542:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effectively a double tax deduction, one stemming from the loss on the sale of the stock, and 
32:1075:87564:16:16:71:542:546:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:one  stemming  from  deducting  the  costs  associated  with  the  contingent  liabilities  as 
32:1076:87659:16:26:71:126:530:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incurred.   
32:1077:87671:26:16:71:543:504:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f8:Revenue Ruling 95-74 clearly states that it is limited to the transfer of substantially	all	of	
32:1078:87766:16:16:71:542:488:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f2:the	assets of a going concern for bona	fide	business	purposes.  That limitation, however, did 
32:1079:87860:16:17:72:543:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not prevent promoters of aggressive tax strategies from exploiting the ruling to devise and 
32:1080:87952:17:16:72:542:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market to corporate taxpayers with large taxable gains what came to be known as the 
32:1081:88036:16:16:72:544:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“contingent liability tax shelter.”  The shelter they devised placed in the taxpayer’s hands 
32:1082:88129:16:16:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:low-value high-basis stock in a controlled subsidiary that the taxpayer reorganized into a 
32:1083:88220:16:16:72:543:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:liability  management  company  (“LMC”).    Following  the  reorganization,  the  taxpayer 
32:1084:88311:16:17:72:542:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transferred liquid assets and contingent liabilities (such as environmental cleanup costs, 
32:1085:88402:17:16:72:540:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimated medical costs of employees and retirees, anticipated payouts from product-
32:1086:88486:16:16:72:542:358:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:liability or other unliquidated claims) to the LMC for the new class of stock.  Notably, the 
32:1087:88579:16:16:72:545:342:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transfer had no effect on the taxpayer’s core activities, nor did the taxpayer relinquish 
32:1088:88669:16:16:72:543:326:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control over the reorganized subsidiary.  Once the transfer was complete, the taxpayer sold 
32:1089:88761:16:16:72:543:310:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the stock it received in the exchange to an accommodating party at a loss that the taxpayer 
32:1090:88853:16:17:72:543:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:used to offset taxable income.  As one promoter outlined in a presentation  entitled 
32:1091:88938:17:16:72:545:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“Accelerating Contingent Liability Deductions,” the transaction allows the participating 
32:1092:89027:16:16:72:542:261:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxpayer to accelerate the tax deduction it could otherwise take only when the contingent 
32:1093:89117:16:26:71:233:245:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:liabilities are actually incurred: 
32:1094:89152:26:14:143:406:219:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:With proper planning and structuring of a series of 
32:1095:89204:14:14:143:465:205:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transactions, a taxpayer may be able to significantly accelerate 
32:1096:89269:14:14:143:463:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the deduction (in the form of a capital loss) of such contingent 
32:1097:89334:14:14:143:450:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:costs.  Such planning involves the use of a risk management 
32:1098:89394:14:14:143:457:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:company or a health care management company and the sale 
32:1099:89451:14:15:143:459:149:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of some of the stock of the company to a third party manager, 
32:1100:89513:15:14:143:458:134:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consultant or investor.  With this approach, the taxpayer may 
32:1101:89575:14:14:143:439:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be able to deduct a capital loss equal to the amount of the 
32:1102:89635:14:0:143:464:106:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contingency.  In addition, the management company may later 
33:1103:89736:0:14:144:450:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be entitled to a second deduction for the same amount over 
33:1104:89795:14:14:144:385:694:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:time as the expenditures are actually incurred. 
33:1105:89843:14:14:72:75:680:144:Times:144:Times: 
33:1106:89843:14:16:72:503:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In 1998, Congress added section 358(h) to the Internal Revenue Code to outlaw this 
33:1107:89926:16:16:72:536:650:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:scheme on a prospective basis.  It provides that the basis of any stock acquired in a section 
33:1108:90020:16:16:72:536:634:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:351 exchange that exceeds the stock’s fair market value must be reduced by the amount of 
33:1109:90109:16:17:72:531:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:any liability assumed in the exchange.  Applied to the above hypothetical, Corporation A’s 
33:1110:90200:17:16:72:534:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:basis in Corporation B’s stock would have been reduced by $9 million, and the subsequent 
33:1111:90289:16:16:72:517:585:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sale would have produced no gain or loss.  Although Congress included exceptions that 
33:1112:90375:16:16:72:524:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:essentially codified Revenue Ruling 95-74 (by excluding transfers involving the trade or 
33:1113:90464:16:16:72:538:553:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:business that caused the liability, or substantially all of the assets with which the liability is 
33:1114:90563:16:16:72:540:537:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:associated), section 358(h) effectively put an end to the contingent liability tax shelter after 
33:1115:90660:16:27:72:269:521:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the effective date of October 18, 1999. 
33:1116:90700:27:16:72:520:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To deal with the shelters that were implemented before that date, the IRS issued Notice 
33:1117:90788:16:16:72:502:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2001-17.  The notice alerted taxpayers and promoters alike that the IRS intended to 
33:1118:90872:16:16:72:542:462:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:challenge the tax losses claimed from the sale of stock acquired from contingent liability tax 
33:1119:90967:16:16:72:538:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shelter transactions on various grounds.  Relevant to this paper is the IRS’s contention that 
33:1120:91061:16:17:72:496:430:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“the overall transaction lacks sufficient economic substance to be respected for tax
