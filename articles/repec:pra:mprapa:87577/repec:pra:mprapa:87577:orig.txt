2:17:528:36:21:72:526:566:12:Times:12:Times:The nexus between financial development and economic growth has been the subject of many 
2:18:616:21:20:72:526:545:12:Times:12:Times:literature. Researchers have tried to find if the causality is unidirectional, if so which variable 
2:19:715:20:21:72:526:525:12:Times:12:Times:causes  the  growth  of  the  other  or  if  it  was  bi-directional.  However,  the  results  of  these 
2:20:820:21:21:72:526:504:12:Times:12:Times:researches  have  been  conflicting  and  no  definitive  solution  to  this  has  been  discovered.  The 
2:21:926:21:20:72:526:483:12:Times:12:Times:purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  apply  time  series  techniques  to  investigate  this relationship.  The 
2:22:1033:20:21:72:526:463:12:Times:12:Times:focus of this study was based on Bangladesh because it was very recently classified by the UN 
2:23:1127:21:21:72:526:442:12:Times:12:Times:as a developing country and such a study would help the government with critical information 
2:24:1218:21:21:72:525:421:12:Times:12:Times:for formulating policies for its development. To the best of our knowledge, Bangladesh has not 
2:25:1311:21:20:72:525:400:12:Times:12:Times:been  the  interest  of  such  a  study  in  the  past.  Time  series  techniques  such  as Autoregressive 
2:26:1417:20:21:72:526:380:12:Times:12:Times:distributed  lags  (ARDL)  and  the  more  recent Non-linear  autoregressive  distributed  lags 
2:27:1513:21:21:72:526:359:12:Times:12:Times:(NARDL) were used.  The  results were  paired  with  Variance  decomposition  techniques  to 
2:28:1605:21:20:72:526:338:12:Times:12:Times:strengthen the results. Annual data from 1972 to 2016 was obtained from the World Bank data 
2:29:1697:20:21:72:526:318:12:Times:12:Times:bank.  This  study  revealed  that  there  is  a  strong  positive  co-integrating  relationship  between 
2:30:1803:21:21:72:526:297:12:Times:12:Times:financial development and economic growth in Bangladesh and that the finance variable leads 
2:31:1892:21:20:72:525:276:12:Times:12:Times:the  economic growth variable suggesting  a  supply-leading  hypothesis.  Finally,  the  results 
2:32:1986:20:37:72:355:256:12:Times:12:Times:revealed only a short run symmetry between the variables.

3:40:2369:0:37:72:164:757:14:Times:11:g_d0_f6:1. Introduction 
3:41:2383:37:20:72:526:720:12:Times:12:Times:Recent studies, both theoretical and empirical, indicate that there has been a substantial interest 
3:42:2482:20:21:72:525:700:12:Times:12:Times:in  identifying  the  role  of  financial  markets  in  fostering  economic  growth  and  development. 
3:43:2585:21:21:72:526:679:12:Times:12:Times:However,  finding  common  ground  between  promoters  of  both  views  of  the  supply-leading 
3:44:2680:21:20:72:526:658:12:Times:12:Times:hypothesis and the demand-following hypothesis has been difficult. Empirical literature both 
3:45:2772:20:21:72:526:638:12:Times:12:Times:country specific and cross countries have yielded conflicting results. As characteristics differ 
3:46:2868:21:21:72:526:617:12:Times:12:Times:from  country  to  country  such  as  the politics,  economic  policies, culture,  institutional 
3:47:2965:21:21:72:526:596:12:Times:12:Times:arrangements, level of financial development, and role of financial institutions in the economy, 
3:48:3062:21:20:72:526:575:12:Times:12:Times:the causal relationship between the two variables may also be country specific. The results also 
3:49:3159:20:35:72:370:555:12:Times:12:Times:differed according to the control variables used in the studies. 
3:50:3222:35:21:72:526:520:12:Times:12:Times:Regardless  there  has  been  strong  views  from  both  sides  regarding  this  debate.  While  some 
3:51:3324:21:20:72:526:499:12:Times:12:Times:economists believe that a finance-growth relationship is important, some of the more sceptic 
3:52:3415:20:21:72:526:479:12:Times:12:Times:developmental economists question the role of the financial system at all in fostering economic 
3:53:3511:21:21:72:526:458:12:Times:12:Times:growth. And  while  some  empirical  studies  also  show  that  finance  is  a  substantial  driver  of 
3:54:3614:21:20:72:526:437:12:Times:12:Times:economic  growth,  others  conclude  that  relationship  runs  from  economic  growth  to  financial 
3:55:3715:20:35:72:140:417:12:Times:12:Times:development. 
3:56:3727:35:35:72:168:382:12:Times:12:Times:Why Bangladesh? 
3:57:3742:35:21:72:526:347:12:Times:12:Times:In March 2018, the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) announced that Bangladesh 
3:58:3828:21:20:72:525:326:12:Times:12:Times:had fulfilled  the  requirements  to  be  eligible  for  graduation  from  the  list  of  least  developed 
3:59:3934:20:21:72:526:306:12:Times:12:Times:countries  to  developing  countries.  The  eligibility  criteria  for  graduation  depends  upon 
3:60:4032:21:21:72:525:285:12:Times:12:Times:achieving certain scores in Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, the Human Assets Index 
3:61:4122:21:20:72:526:264:12:Times:12:Times:(HAI)  and  the  Economic  Vulnerability  (EVI)  Index  and  other  country-specific  information. 
3:62:4220:20:21:72:526:244:12:Times:12:Times:They had been on the list of least developed countries since 1975. While accepting the letter of 
3:63:4317:21:21:72:526:223:12:Times:12:Times:graduation, the Bangladesh Permanent Ambassador to the UN Masud Bin Momen announced 
3:64:4400:21:21:72:526:202:12:Times:12:Times:that Bangladesh was setting its goal to be listed as a developed economy by the year 2041. For 
3:65:4495:21:20:72:525:181:12:Times:12:Times:the country to graduate in little over twenty years, the fiscal and economic policies have to be 
3:66:4592:20:21:72:526:161:12:Times:12:Times:formulated in ways that would achieve the maximum growth. Understanding which areas to 
3:67:4679:21:35:72:248:140:12:Times:12:Times:focus is therefore of great necessity. 
3:68:4717:35:20:72:525:105:12:Times:12:Times:Lying on the Bay of  Bengal,  east of  India, this small island nation’s economy ranks 44th in 
3:69:4809:20:0:72:526:85:12:Times:12:Times:nominal terms of gross domestic product (GDP) at USD221 billion expected to grow at 7.3%. 
4:70:4898:0:21:72:526:759:12:Times:12:Times:According to IMF, the Bangladesh economy is the second fastest growing major economy at 
4:71:4986:21:21:72:526:738:12:Times:12:Times:the  end  of  2016 and  was  classified  among  the Next  Eleven emerging  market economies  and 
4:72:5079:21:21:72:526:717:12:Times:12:Times:a Frontier  market.  The  economy  of  Bangladesh  has  been  largely  driven  by  the  export  of 
4:73:5177:21:20:72:526:696:12:Times:12:Times:readymade garments, remittances and the domestic agriculture sector. It is one of the largest 
4:74:5269:20:21:72:526:676:12:Times:12:Times:textile exporters trading across the globe. With a population of 160 million, the unemployment 
4:75:5363:21:21:72:526:655:12:Times:12:Times:rate is 4.2% while a 2016 World Bank study revealed that 24.3% of the population still live in 
4:76:5458:21:20:72:526:634:12:Times:12:Times:poverty of which 12.9% live in extreme poverty. The progress to eradicate poverty has been 
4:77:5549:20:35:72:236:614:12:Times:12:Times:steadily rising however it is slow. 
4:78:5584:35:21:72:525:579:12:Times:12:Times:In  keeping  with  the  developmental  goals,  the  annual  budget  for  2017/18  was  increased  by 
4:79:5685:21:21:72:526:558:12:Times:12:Times:20.76%.  The  main  source  of  income  for  the  Bangladesh  government  is  taxes  therefore  to 
4:80:5784:21:20:72:526:537:12:Times:12:Times:finance the budget a number of tax reforms both legal and  administrative were also adopted 
4:81:5876:20:21:72:526:517:12:Times:12:Times:during the year. The 2017 government debt to GDP ratio was 27.1% and the current account 
4:82:5964:21:21:72:526:496:12:Times:12:g_d0_f12:to  GDP  ratio  was -0.6%. The country’s inflation rate is 5.68%. The Dhaka stock exchange 
4:83:6054:21:34:72:529:475:12:Times:12:Times:(DSE) is still very small with a market capitalization of $39.28 billion ranked 48th in the world.  
4:84:6152:34:21:72:526:441:12:Times:12:Times:Despite the developmental goals achieved, the financial sector of Bangladesh does not grow at 
4:85:6246:21:21:72:526:420:12:Times:12:Times:par  with  the  economic  growth.  This  results  of  this  study  may  help  the  country  to  better 
4:86:6349:21:35:72:491:399:12:Times:12:Times:understand this nexus to formulate policies for both its economic and financial growth. 
4:87:6436:35:34:72:147:364:12:Times:12:Times:Research Gap 
4:88:6448:34:21:72:526:330:12:Times:12:Times:Bangladesh  has  not  been  the  interest  of  a  research  to  study  the  causal relationship between 
4:89:6551:21:20:72:526:309:12:Times:12:Times:financial development and economic growth using NARDL techniques. Also, in spite of the 
4:90:6638:20:21:72:526:289:12:Times:12:Times:numerous studies to identify this relationship using other time series techniques, no consensus 
4:91:6733:21:21:72:526:268:12:Times:12:Times:has been achieved in both theoretical and empirical researches. Therefore, an humble attempt 
4:92:6825:21:35:72:384:247:12:Times:12:Times:has been made to research the causality between these variables. 
4:93:6889:35:34:72:270:212:12:Times:12:Times:Our research questions are as follows; 
4:94:6926:34:21:72:526:178:12:Times:12:Times:1. Is  there  a  relationship  between development of  the  financial  sector and  the economic 
4:95:7018:21:21:93:484:157:12:Times:12:Times:growth of a country? If so, is it a positive relationship or a negative relationship? 
4:96:7102:21:20:72:526:136:12:Times:12:Times:2. What  is  the  lead-lag  relationship  between  the  variables  and  which  variable  is  the  leader 
4:97:7206:20:21:93:395:116:12:Times:12:Times:(exogenous) and which variable is the follower (endogenous)? 
4:98:7266:21:0:72:470:95:12:Times:12:Times:3. Is the short run relationship between the variables maintained in the long run? 
5:99:7346:0:34:72:210:758:12:Times:12:Times:Contributions of the study 
5:100:7372:34:21:72:526:724:12:Times:12:Times:In  addition  to  the  Autoregressive  Distributed  Lags  (ARDL),  we  have used  in  this  study  the 
5:101:7475:21:21:72:526:703:12:Times:12:Times:most recent time series technique, Non-linear autoregressive Distributed Lags (NARDL) which 
5:102:7567:21:20:72:525:682:12:Times:12:Times:unlike ARDL does not assume that the adjustment of the error term will be linear or symmetric. 
5:103:7661:20:21:72:526:662:12:Times:12:Times:This new technique would help us better investigate the causal relationship between these two 
5:104:7754:21:35:72:121:641:12:Times:12:Times:variables. 
5:105:7764:35:20:72:526:606:12:Times:12:Times:Data from Bangladesh used from 1972-2016 has not, to the best of our knowledge, been the 
5:106:7851:20:35:72:339:586:12:Times:12:Times:interest of another study investigating this relationship. 
5:107:7909:35:35:72:273:551:12:Times:12:Times:Major findings and policy implications 
5:108:7947:35:21:72:526:516:12:Times:12:Times:The  results  indicate  that  the  effect  of  financial  development  on  growth  is  positive, and  the 
5:109:8053:21:20:72:526:495:12:Times:12:Times:causality  runs  from  financial  variables  to  the  economic  variables.  However,  the  symmetry 
5:110:8153:20:35:72:263:475:12:Times:12:Times:between the variables is only short run. 
5:111:8193:35:21:72:525:440:12:Times:12:Times:As a policy implication, we recommend that supply side policies that foster the growth of the 
5:112:8287:21:20:72:526:419:12:Times:12:Times:financial sector to mobilize the economy. Also, efforts to increase financial investments to the 
5:113:8384:20:21:72:526:399:12:Times:12:Times:country should be explored. Finally, government stance on exporting cheap labour could also 
5:114:8476:21:35:72:448:378:12:Times:12:Times:be revisited to be more limited to increase the supply of labour in the country.

5:116:8578:34:21:72:526:309:12:Times:12:Times:The  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  II  reviews  the  past  theoretical  and  empirical 
5:117:8681:21:21:72:526:288:12:Times:12:Times:literatures  on  this  subject.  Section  III  presents  the  methodology  adopted  for this  study  and

6:122:9008:37:20:72:526:720:12:Times:12:Times:The literature on the granger causality between financial development and economic growth is 
6:123:9101:20:21:72:526:700:12:Times:12:Times:divided. Countless researches, both theoretical  and empirical, have tried to fill this gap with 
6:124:9196:21:21:72:526:679:12:Times:12:Times:conflicting results.  This section tries to support the research questions of this study with past 
6:125:9295:21:35:72:246:658:12:Times:12:Times:theoretical and empirical literature.  
6:126:9333:35:21:90:526:623:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times: Is there a relationship between development of the financial sector and the economic 
6:127:9418:21:22:108:501:602:12:Times:12:Times:growth of a country? If so, is it a positive relationship or a negative relationship?  
6:128:9504:22:20:90:526:580:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times: What is the lead-lag relationship between the variables and which variable is the leader 
6:129:9594:20:22:108:413:560:12:Times:12:Times:(exogenous) and which variable is the follower (endogenous)?  
6:130:9655:22:35:90:484:538:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times: Is the short run relationship between the variables maintained in the long run? 
6:131:9733:35:34:72:279:503:12:Times:12:Times:2.1 Theoretical answers to the questions 
6:132:9771:34:21:72:525:469:12:Times:12:Times:In 1966, Hugh T. Patrick identified the directions of causality between financial development 
6:133:9865:21:21:72:526:448:12:Times:12:Times:and growth as the supply-leading and demand following hypotheses. He posited that in a supply 
6:134:9959:21:20:72:526:427:12:Times:12:Times:leading hypothesis the causal relationship leads from financial to economic growth. According 
6:135:10053:20:21:72:526:407:12:Times:12:Times:to  this  hypothesis,  a  deliberate  creation  of  financial  institutions  and  markets  increases  the 
6:136:10159:21:21:72:526:386:12:Times:12:Times:supply of financial services which in turn leads to real economic growth. On the other hand, he 
6:137:10255:21:20:72:526:365:12:Times:12:Times:postulates that in a demand-following hypothesis, the causal relationship leads from economic 
6:138:10349:20:21:72:526:345:12:Times:12:Times:growth to financial development.  He described that as the real economy grows it might induce 
6:139:10443:21:21:72:526:324:12:Times:12:Times:an  increasing  demand  for  financial  services  leading  to  the  expansion  in  the  financial  sector. 
6:140:10549:21:21:72:526:303:12:Times:12:Times:Additionally, Patrick (1966) proposed a hypothesis for stage of development. This hypothesis 
6:141:10642:21:20:72:526:282:12:Times:12:Times:theorizes  that  supply  leading  financial  development  induces  formation  of  real  capital  for 
6:142:10743:20:21:72:526:262:12:Times:12:Times:economic  development  in  its  early  stages.  This  leads  to  the  development  of  new  financial 
6:143:10845:21:21:72:526:241:12:Times:12:Times:services  and  opportunities  for  investors  and  savers  thus  forming  a  self-sustained  economic 
6:144:10947:21:20:72:526:220:12:Times:12:Times:growth.  Further,  the  theory  states  that  as  financial  and  economic  development  proceed,  the 
6:145:11050:20:21:72:526:200:12:Times:12:Times:supply leading characteristics of financial development gradually diminishes and is dominated 
6:146:11144:21:21:72:290:179:12:Times:12:Times:by demand following financial development. 
6:147:11186:21:35:72:75:158:12:Times:12:Times: 
6:148:11186:35:20:72:526:123:12:Times:12:Times:More  recently,  the  relationship  concerning  financial  development  and  growth  has  been 
6:149:11281:20:21:72:526:103:12:Times:12:Times:identified to be of three types. They are growth driven finance, finance led growth and the two 
6:150:11377:21:0:72:357:82:12:Times:12:Times:way causal relationship known as the feedback hypothesis. 
7:151:11435:0:21:72:526:759:12:Times:12:Times:The finance led growth hypothesis suggests that the development of the financial sector has an 
7:152:11530:21:21:72:526:738:12:Times:12:Times:important role in the growth of the economy. It states that an efficient financial sector is able 
7:153:11628:21:21:72:526:717:12:Times:12:Times:to  pool  the  limited  credit resources  from  the  surplus  units  and  direct  them  to  deficits.  The 
7:154:11734:21:20:72:526:696:12:Times:12:Times:financial sector promotes efficient allocation of resources Akinlo and Egbetunde (2010) and 
7:155:11826:20:21:72:526:676:12:Times:12:Times:Ghali, (1999) are among the researchers whose work support this hypothesis. The endogenous 
7:156:11916:21:21:72:526:655:12:Times:12:Times:growth theory  (Lucas,  1988)  highlights  the  positive  role  of  the  financial  sector  in  boosting 
7:157:12020:21:20:72:526:634:12:Times:12:Times:economic  growth,  by  allocating  resources  to  the  most  productive  investments,  mobilizing 
7:158:12118:20:21:72:526:614:12:Times:12:Times:savings,  reducing  information,  transaction  and  monitoring  costs,  diversifying  risks,  and 
7:159:12216:21:21:72:526:593:12:Times:12:Times:facilitating the exchange of goods and services. This results in a more efficient allocation of 
7:160:12312:21:21:72:526:572:12:Times:12:Times:resources,  more  rapid  accumulation  of  physical  and  human  capital,  and  faster  technological 
7:161:12414:21:34:72:118:551:12:Times:12:Times:progress. 
7:162:12423:34:21:72:526:517:12:Times:12:Times:On the other hand, some economists support the growth driven finance hypothesis and argued 
7:163:12511:21:21:72:526:496:12:Times:12:Times:that is the increase in growth that leads to the improvement in financial sector. The argument 
7:164:12606:21:20:72:526:475:12:Times:12:Times:is that the high economic growth increases demand for some categories of financial assets and 
7:165:12700:20:21:72:526:455:12:Times:12:Times:arrangement  and  that  financial  market  reacts  passively  to  these  increasing  demands.  This 
7:166:12800:21:21:72:526:434:12:Times:12:Times:hypothesis  is  supported  by  scholars  such  as  Agbetsiafa  (2003)  and  Robinson  (1952). 
7:167:12893:21:20:72:523:413:12:Times:12:Times:Interestingly,  Cecchetti  and  Kharroubi  (2012)  argued  that  the  relationship  of  the  finance-
7:168:12994:20:21:72:526:393:12:Times:12:Times:growth nexus is non monotonic and as bank credit to private sector/ GDP increases, finance 
7:169:13083:21:21:72:525:372:12:Times:12:Times:becomes a drag on growth. They postulated that a faster rate of growth of the financial sector 
7:170:13177:21:20:72:525:351:12:Times:12:Times:may  be in  fact  be detrimental  to economic growth  because  the  financial  sector will  start 
7:171:13271:20:35:72:334:331:12:Times:12:Times:competing for resources with the rest of the economy. 
7:172:13322:35:21:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:Further, Lewis (1955) postulated that a two way relationship exists between the two variables 
7:173:13415:21:21:72:526:275:12:Times:12:Times:where the financial market develops as a result of economic growth, which in turn feeds back 
7:174:13508:21:35:72:499:254:12:Times:12:Times:as a stimulant of real economic growth. This hypothesis is supported by Hussein (1996). 
7:175:13594:35:34:72:271:219:12:Times:12:Times:2.2 Empirical answers to the questions 
7:176:13630:34:21:72:526:185:12:Times:12:Times:Researcher Goldsmith (1969) in a cross country study of 34 countries showed that the size of 
7:177:13723:21:20:72:526:164:12:Times:12:Times:the  financial  system  contributes  positively  to  growth. His  study  assumed  that  both  financial 
7:178:13826:20:21:72:526:144:12:Times:12:Times:intermediation  and  growth  were  endogenous.  Levine  (1993)  criticized  Goldsmiths  approach 
7:179:13923:21:21:72:526:123:12:Times:12:Times:and suggested that in addition to the sample size of his study being small and the focal point of 
7:180:14021:21:21:72:525:102:12:Times:12:Times:causality not being tested, the variables that could impact growth were not accounted for and 
7:181:14115:21:0:72:526:81:12:Times:12:Times:the operation of the financial organization was not assessed. Following the neo-Schumpeterian 
8:182:14209:0:21:72:526:759:12:Times:12:Times:model, King and Levine (1993) improved on the study of Goldsmith and increased the sample 
8:183:14297:21:21:72:526:738:12:Times:12:Times:size  to 77 developing  countries  during  1960-1989 including  control  factors.  The  result 
8:184:14389:21:21:72:526:717:12:Times:12:Times:indicated a positive relation between each one of the economic growth and financial indexes. 
8:185:14481:21:20:72:526:696:12:Times:12:Times:However, they too did not address the causality issue. Further, a study by Beck et al. (2000) of 
8:186:14575:20:21:72:526:676:12:Times:12:Times:seventy one countries during 1960-1995 for the causality between financial intermediaries and 
8:187:14669:21:21:72:526:655:12:Times:12:Times:economic growth revealed that improvement of financial intermediaries has significant impact 
8:188:14762:21:20:72:526:634:12:Times:12:Times:on economic growth. Rioja and Valev (2004) concluded that the development of the financial 
8:189:14852:20:21:72:526:614:12:Times:12:Times:sector has a greater impact on economic growth in affluent countries compared to low-income 
8:190:14944:21:35:72:122:593:12:Times:12:Times:countries. 
8:191:14954:35:21:72:526:558:12:Times:12:Times:A  research  by  Odhiambo  (2007)  of  three  Sub-Saharan  African  countries  yielded  conflicting 
8:192:15054:21:20:72:525:537:12:Times:12:Times:results. He concluded that Kenya and South Africa showed evidence of a demand following 
8:193:15142:20:21:72:526:517:12:Times:12:Times:hypothesis while a supply leading hypothesis was evidenced in Tanzania. Additionally, a study 
8:194:15235:21:21:72:526:496:12:Times:12:Times:by Naceur and Ghazouani (2007) empirically concluded that the simultaneous effect of banks 
8:195:15326:21:20:72:525:475:12:Times:12:Times:and  financial  system  development  on  economic  growth  and  there  no  significant  relationship 
8:196:15427:20:21:72:526:455:12:Times:12:Times:between  banking,  stock  market  development  and  growth.  They  further  concluded  that  the 
8:197:15524:21:21:72:526:434:12:Times:12:Times:association between bank development and the growth of the economy is negative. However, 
8:198:15613:21:20:72:525:413:12:Times:12:Times:they did disclose that this might be attributed to the underdeveloped financial systems in some 
8:199:15709:20:35:72:189:393:12:Times:12:Times:of the sample countries. 
8:200:15733:35:21:72:526:358:12:Times:12:Times:Additionally,  while  examining  the  long-run  relationship  between  financial  development  and 
8:201:15832:21:21:72:526:337:12:Times:12:Times:economic growth with evidence from Poland, Kenougios and Samitas (2007) concluded that 
8:202:15918:21:20:72:526:316:12:Times:12:Times:one  the  main  driving  forces  for  long-run  growth  is  credit  to  the  private  sector. Allen  and 
8:203:16022:20:21:72:526:296:12:Times:12:Times:Ndikumana (1998) also found a long run positive correlation between economic growth and 
8:204:16110:21:21:72:526:275:12:Times:12:Times:intermediation of the financial sector in the South African Development Community (SADC). 
8:205:16200:21:20:72:526:254:12:Times:12:Times:On the other hand, Le Roux and Moyo (2015) used GMM estimates for SADC countries and 
8:206:16285:20:21:72:526:234:12:Times:12:Times:found  only  a  short  run  positive  relationship  between  the  variables. Moreover,  a  study 
8:207:16382:21:21:72:526:213:12:Times:12:Times:emphasizing  the  difference  between  short-run  and  long-run  impacts  of  financial  sector 
8:208:16478:21:20:72:525:192:12:Times:12:Times:development of economic growth, Loayza and Ranciere (2002) empirically concluded that the 
8:209:16568:20:0:72:403:172:12:Times:12:Times:negative short-term relationship is related a surge in financial crisis.  
9:210:16641:0:37:72:168:757:14:Times:14:Times:3. Methodology 
9:211:16654:37:34:72:180:720:12:Times:12:Times:3.1 Data Description 
9:212:16674:34:21:72:525:686:12:Times:12:Times:The empirical analysis is based on annual data from 1972 to 2016 (45 years). All the annual 
9:213:16766:21:21:72:526:665:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:data  was  obtained  from  the  World  Banks’  World  Development  Indicators  (WDI)  online 
9:214:16859:21:35:72:448:644:12:Times:12:Times:database. The econometrics analysis was carried out using Microfit and Stata. 
9:215:16936:35:34:72:194:609:12:Times:12:Times:3.2 Model Specification 
9:216:16959:34:21:72:526:575:12:Times:12:Times:GDP per capita growth (annual %) was taken as a proxy for economic growth. It is denoted by 
9:217:17051:21:21:72:526:554:12:Times:12:Times:GDP. Financial  Development  is  measured  as  a  ratio  of  broad  money (M2) to  GDP and  is 
9:218:17144:21:20:72:526:533:12:Times:12:Times:represented by  BRD.  This variable shows  the financial  depth  of  a  growing  economy.  This 
9:219:17237:20:21:72:526:513:12:Times:12:Times:variable is therefore expected to increase overtime if the financial sector develops faster than 
9:220:17334:21:21:72:526:492:12:Times:12:Times:the real sector on one hand, and decrease if the financial sector develops slower than the real 
9:221:17430:21:20:72:526:471:12:Times:12:Times:sector. The second proxy of financial development is domestic credit to the private sector as a 
9:222:17526:20:21:72:526:451:12:Times:12:Times:percentage of GDP which is denoted as CRE. It is assumed that credit provided to the private 
9:223:17618:21:21:72:526:430:12:Times:12:Times:sector will generate larger increases in investment and productivity. The ratio of gross national 
9:224:17714:21:21:72:526:409:12:Times:12:Times:expenditure to GDP denoted by EXT is used as an indicator of macroeconomic stability. And 
9:225:17802:21:34:72:510:388:12:Times:12:Times:finally, Foreign Direct Investments to GDP denoted by FDI was used as a control variable. 
9:226:17891:34:35:217:380:354:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times:GDP = ∫ (BRD, CRE, EXT, FDI) 
9:227:17919:35:29:72:237:319:12:Times:12:Times:3.3 Motivating the methodology 
9:228:17949:29:20:72:523:290:12:Times:12:Times:Auto  Regressive  Distributed  Lag  (ARDL)  is  used  for  testing  presence  of  a  long  term  co-
9:229:18049:20:21:72:526:270:12:Times:12:Times:integrating relationship between lagged levels of variables and helps to identify endogeneity 
9:230:18143:21:21:72:526:249:12:Times:12:Times:and exogeneity of variables. The ARDL test proposed by Paresan, Shin and Smith in 2001 was 
9:231:18234:21:21:72:526:228:12:Times:12:Times:free  from  the  limitations  of  the  unit  root  and  co-integration  tests  that  used  in  time  series 
9:232:18342:21:20:72:526:207:12:Times:12:Times:techniques. This new model did not warrant the variables to be I(0) or I(1) and was more robust 
9:233:18437:20:35:72:474:187:12:Times:12:Times:despite a small sample size (Pattichis, 1999; Mah, 2000, and Tang and Nair, 2002). 
9:234:18519:35:21:72:526:152:12:Times:12:Times:The ARDL model specifications of the functional relationship between GDP per capita growth 
9:235:18610:21:20:72:526:131:12:Times:12:Times:(GDP), Broad money as a share of GDP (BRD), domestic credit to private sector as a share of 
9:236:18702:20:21:72:526:111:12:Times:12:Times:GDP  (CRE),  gross  national  expenditure  as  a  share  of  GDP  (EXT)  and  foreign  direct 
9:237:18796:21:0:72:390:90:12:Times:12:Times:investments as a share of GDP (FDI) can be estimated as follows;

10:255:18998:35:21:72:526:628:12:Times:12:Times:Further,  the  non-linear  ARDL  technique  developed  by  Shin  et  al  (2014)  is  used  to  estimate 
10:256:19102:21:20:72:526:607:12:Times:12:Times:short  and  long  run  dynamics.  This  model  relaxes  the  assumption  used  by  ARDL  that  the 
10:257:19201:20:21:72:526:587:12:Times:12:Times:adjustment  of  the  error  term  is  both  linear  and  symmetric.  Further,  when  the  time  series  are 
10:258:19309:21:21:72:526:566:12:Times:12:Times:noted to have co-integration using their positive and negative components the case of nonlinear 
10:259:19405:21:21:72:526:545:12:Times:12:Times:co-integration is applied. The NARDL framework allows modelling asymmetric co-integration

11:282:20090:37:20:72:526:720:12:Times:12:Times:The unit root tests help us to identify is the variables used in the study are I(0) or I (1) using 
11:283:20189:20:21:72:525:700:12:Times:12:Times:the  tests  of  stationarity  and  non-stationarity.  If  the  variable  is  stationary  it  shows  that  the 
11:284:20299:21:21:72:526:679:12:Times:12:Times:variance is finite and the shocks are only transitory. On the other hand, if it is non stationary it 
11:285:20400:21:35:72:399:658:12:Times:12:Times:means that the shocks would be permanent and variance is infinite.  
11:286:20466:35:20:72:525:623:12:Times:12:Times:Since the variables of the study were already in percentage form, it was used as is, and was not

11:288:20665:21:35:72:418:582:12:Times:12:Times:first difference of the variables was taken to make the mean stationary.

17:537:33631:29:20:72:525:349:12:Times:12:Times:LRSM results show that, broad money variable and the gross expenditure of the government 
17:538:33720:20:21:72:526:329:12:Times:12:Times:variable are insignificant. The p value of the Chi Square both  individual and joint restrictions 
17:539:33816:21:21:72:525:308:12:Times:12:Times:show that is it significant revealing that the restrictions are correct and these variables could be 
17:540:33917:21:20:72:526:287:12:Times:12:Times:dropped from the research. However, these variables though insignificant may be the variables 
17:541:34010:20:21:72:526:267:12:Times:12:Times:that  bring about  the  cointegration of  all the  variables.  Thus,  we  decide not to drop  these 
17:542:34104:21:35:72:271:246:12:Times:12:Times:insignificant variables from the research. 
17:543:34145:35:20:72:526:211:12:Times:12:Times:Next, we move on to the vector error correction model. VECM helps us to identify the variables 
17:544:34240:20:21:72:526:191:12:Times:12:Times:that  are  exogenous  (leaders)  and  exogenous  (followers).  We  used  the  ARDL  model  of  the 
17:545:34339:21:21:72:526:170:12:Times:12:Times:VECM  and  the  below  results  were  selected  using  the  SBC  criterion.  The  coefficient  of  the 
17:546:34442:21:21:72:526:149:12:Times:12:Times:variables  represent  the  speed  of  adjustment  of  the  variables  to  equilibrium.  If  the  values  are 
17:547:34551:21:20:72:525:128:12:Times:12:Times:negative  and  between  0  and -1,  it  means  that  the  variables  have  moderate  to  fast  speed  of 
17:548:34656:20:21:72:526:108:12:Times:12:Times:adjustment  to  equilibrium.  If  it  is  0  it  means  there  is  no  equilibrium.  And  if  it  is  positive,  it 
17:549:34772:21:0:72:410:87:12:Times:12:Times:means that the variable moves away from equilibrium in the long run.

21:638:37854:0:37:72:204:757:14:Times:14:Times:5. Policy Implications 
21:639:37875:37:20:72:526:720:12:Times:12:Times:The  results  of  the  both  ARDL  and  NARDL  empirically  prove  a  co-integrating  relationship 
21:640:37974:20:21:72:526:700:12:Times:12:Times:between financial development and economic growth in Bangladesh. However, both tests show 
21:641:38064:21:21:72:526:679:12:Times:12:Times:conflicting results as to whether the relationship is short run or long run. NARDL empirically 
21:642:38159:21:20:72:526:658:12:Times:12:Times:showed that the resultant co-integrating relationship between the growth and finance variables 
21:643:38254:20:21:72:526:638:12:Times:12:Times:did not display a symmetry of long run information but we could not rule out the possibility of 
21:644:38350:21:21:72:526:617:12:Times:12:Times:a short run symmetry. While the results show the effect of financial development on growth is 
21:645:38444:21:21:72:526:596:12:Times:12:Times:positive,  different  indicators  of  financial  development  display  different  levels  of  effect  on 
21:646:38549:21:34:72:486:575:12:Times:12:Times:growth. The results support a supply leading hypothesis for the Bangladesh economy. 
21:647:38632:34:21:72:526:541:12:Times:12:Times:Therefore, as for policy implications for the Bangladesh government, we recommend policies 
21:648:38722:21:21:72:526:520:12:Times:12:Times:that strengthens the financial sector of the country to deepen the financial markets, and enforce 
21:649:38816:21:20:72:526:499:12:Times:12:Times:institutional measures to strengthen creditor and investor rights. Also, the financial system of 
21:650:38912:20:21:72:526:479:12:Times:12:Times:the country is still young and has the potential to grow exponentially, therefore it could also be 
21:651:39011:21:21:72:526:458:12:Times:12:Times:recommended to open the doors for more foreign financial investments in the banking sector 
21:652:39102:21:20:72:526:437:12:Times:12:Times:that would increase the credit to the private sector. Government incentives such as tax breaks 
21:653:39196:20:21:72:526:417:12:Times:12:Times:and reduced withholding taxes could help  attract foreign investments. More investments would 
21:654:39287:21:21:72:526:396:12:Times:12:Times:increase demand and  employment opportunities resulting in an increased  productivity of the 
21:655:39380:21:35:72:142:375:12:Times:12:Times:real economy. 
21:656:39393:35:20:72:525:340:12:Times:12:Times:Bangladesh is also known to be an exporter of cheap labour. The government could rethink its 
21:657:39486:20:21:72:526:320:12:Times:12:Times:initiatives  to  keep  the  labour  force  in  the  country  rather  than  exporting  it.  Further,  the 
21:658:39590:21:21:72:526:299:12:Times:12:Times:government should also take steps to reduce their income dependence on taxes. More avenues 
21:659:39681:21:20:72:526:278:12:Times:12:Times:to  increase  their  exports  should  be explored.  Increased  exports  equal increased  demand  for 
21:660:39780:20:21:72:526:258:12:Times:12:Times:labour and more opportunities in the market. Businesses would prosper and a more global brand 
21:661:39874:21:35:72:441:237:12:Times:12:Times:could be established for the country that brings in even more opportunities.   
21:662:39952:35:21:72:526:202:12:Times:12:Times:However, the government should avoid implementing demand side monetary policy that might 
21:663:40038:21:34:72:474:181:12:Times:12:Times:bring about a shock to the economy that may be permanent and difficult to reverse.

22:666:40122:0:30:72:157:757:14:Times:16:Times:6. Conclusion 
22:667:40134:30:21:72:526:727:12:Times:12:Times:In conclusion, our humble attempt yielded fruitful results for all three of our research questions. 
22:668:40234:21:20:72:526:706:12:Times:12:Times:This  empirical  study  shows  that  there  exists  a  positive  co-integrating  relationship  between 
22:669:40337:20:21:72:526:686:12:Times:12:Times:financial  development  and  economic  growth in Bangladesh.  Secondly,  the  finance  variable 
22:670:40432:21:21:72:526:665:12:Times:12:Times:leads the  economic  variables  suggesting  a  supply  leading  hypothesis  and  thirdly,  our  results 
22:671:40535:21:34:72:491:644:12:Times:12:Times:from NARDL suggest that there only lies a short run symmetry between the variables.  
22:672:40618:34:21:72:526:610:12:Times:12:Times:Thus,  as  evidenced  by  the  results  of  the  research,  fostering  financial  sector  development  of 
22:673:40724:21:21:72:526:589:12:Times:12:Times:Bangladesh  would  accelerate  its  economic  growth  and  bring  them  closer  to  achieving their 
22:674:40824:21:35:72:308:568:12:Times:12:Times:2041 goals of being listed as a developed nation. 
22:675:40872:35:34:72:263:533:12:Times:12:Times:6.1 Limitations and Future Research 
22:676:40907:34:21:72:526:499:12:Times:12:Times:Despite  the encouraging results,  this  research  has  a  lot  of  limitations.  Firstly,  due  to  time 
22:677:41012:21:21:72:526:478:12:Times:12:Times:constraints  a  more  comprehensive  study  of  the  country  could  not  be  conducted.  With  more 
22:678:41113:21:20:72:526:457:12:Times:12:Times:time, a thorough study could have helped us to identify the most appropriate determinants that 
22:679:41208:20:21:72:526:437:12:Times:12:Times:our country of choice. The determinants for this research were selected based on past literature 
22:680:41305:21:21:72:526:416:12:Times:12:Times:of similar studies. Secondly, the frequency of the data available is very low. Only annual data 
22:681:41400:21:20:72:526:395:12:Times:12:Times:could  be  found  from  the  World  Bank  Indicators,  and  high  frequency  data  has  not  been 
22:682:41498:20:21:72:526:375:12:Times:12:Times:published by the central bank of Bangladesh. A higher frequency of data would explore a more 
22:683:41591:21:29:72:240:354:12:Times:12:Times:accurate result of this relationship. 
22:684:41628:29:21:72:526:325:12:Times:12:Times:Therefore,  further  studies  that  can  be  explored  on  this  topic  for  Bangladesh  include 
22:685:41725:21:20:72:526:304:12:Times:12:Times:investigations of the implications of past government policies. Such a study could enforce or 
22:686:41819:20:21:72:525:284:12:Times:12:Times:denounce  the  findings  of empirical  study  to  study  the  co-integration,  causality  and  long  run 
22:687:41923:21:21:72:526:263:12:Times:12:Times:relationship. In addition to this, exploring an empirical study to study this relationship based 
22:688:42019:21:20:72:526:242:12:Times:12:Times:on findings of government annual and monthly fiscal reports could better streamline the study 
22:689:42113:20:29:72:181:222:12:Times:12:Times:to be country specific.
