2:30:1482:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Using  quasi-random  assignment  of  criminal  cases  to  judges,  we  estimate  large  incarceration 
2:31:1584:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:spillovers in criminal and brother networks. When a defendant is sent to prison, there are 51 and 
2:32:1681:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:32  percentage point  reductions  in  the  probability  his  criminal  network  members  and  younger 
2:33:1782:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:brothers  will  be  charged with  a  crime,  respectively,  over  the  ensuing  four  years.  Correlational 
2:34:1889:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:evidence misleadingly finds small positive effects. These spillovers are of first order importance 
2:35:1987:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:for policy, as the network reductions in future crimes committed are larger than the direct effect 
2:36:2085:14:28:71:216:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:on the incarcerated defendant.

3:65:2626:0:30:72:168:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:I.  Introduction
3:66:2642:30:18:71:540:677:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The long-run consequences of incarceration depend not only on an inmate’s recidivism, but
3:67:2731:18:18:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also on any spillover effects they have on an inmate’s criminal and family networks. Capturing
3:68:2825:18:18:72:540:641:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these peer effects are important for evaluating criminal justice policy and designing effective
3:69:2920:18:18:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prison systems, as the societal costs and benefits of incarceration could be magnified or muted
3:70:3015:18:17:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:once network effects are taken into account. Spillover effects are particularly relevant from a
3:71:3110:17:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy perspective, as incarceration rates in both the U.S. and other OECD countries are
3:72:3198:18:18:72:361:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:currently near all-time highs (World Prison Brief, 2016).
3:73:3255:18:18:89:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Social scientists and policymakers have long been interested in understanding the effect
3:74:3343:18:18:72:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of peers on the behavior of other members in a network.1In the area of crime, there are
3:75:3430:18:18:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:several studies which document positive associations in criminal activity in neighborhoods
3:76:3520:18:18:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and families, and a growing literature which looks at peer effects when neighborhoods, schools
3:77:3614:18:18:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or cellmates are quasi-randomly assigned. There is also an emerging literature on spillover
3:78:3705:18:18:72:539:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects within families which focuses on intergenerational links.2Our study contributes to
3:79:3795:18:18:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the literature by providing the first quasi-experimental evidence for incarceration spillovers
3:80:3889:18:18:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within pre-existing, endogenously chosen criminal networks. We also provide new evidence
3:81:3977:18:18:72:542:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for brothers, adding to recent work on incarceration spillovers between parents and children.
3:82:4070:18:18:89:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Estimating the spillover effects of incarceration is difficult for two reasons: data availability
3:83:4167:18:18:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and bias from either correlated unobservables or simultaneity. The data requirements to
3:84:4254:18:17:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate spillover effects are daunting, as the researcher not only needs to be able to identify
3:85:4350:17:18:72:542:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and link criminal groups and brothers, but also follow these network members over time.
3:86:4437:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Correlated unobservables creates a bias because common environmental or demographic
3:87:4520:18:18:72:542:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factors are likely to drive both higher incarceration and criminal activity within a network,
3:88:4613:18:16:85:539:283:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1For example, peer effects have been studied in the context of college achievement (Carrell, Fullerton and
3:89:4719:16:12:71:540:267:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:West 2009, Sacerdote 2001), paternity leave (Dahl,Løkenand Mogstad 2014), DI takeup (Dahl, Kostøland
3:90:4819:12:12:72:541:255:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Mogstad 2014), workplace productivity (Cornelissen, Dustmann and Schonberg 2017, Mas and Moretti 2009,
3:91:4921:12:12:72:540:243:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Falk and Ichino 2006), financial decisions (Bursztyn, Ederer, Ferman and Yuchtman 2014, Duflo and Saez
3:92:5023:12:12:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2002), consumption (Kuhn, Kooreman, Soetevent and Kapteyn 2011) and technology adoption (Bandiera
3:93:5120:12:8:72:146:219:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Rasul 2006).
3:94:5136:8:15:85:539:211:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2For correlational evidence, see for example, Akee, Copeland, Keeler, Angold and Costello (2010), Case

3:97:5445:12:12:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:to a peer group, see Bayer, Hjalmarsson and Pozen (2009), Billings, Ross and Demming (2016), Billings

3:100:5743:12:12:72:541:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:from parents to children and among siblings, see Bhuller, Dahl, Løken and Mogstad (2018), Billings (2018),

3:102:5948:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Andersen (2017). For effects among criminal groups, see Phillipe (2017), which uses fixed effects, and
3:103:6054:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Lindquist and Zenou (2014), which uses intransitive triads and variation in the number of network links as
3:104:6160:12:0:72:231:88:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:instruments for key network players.
4:105:6197:0:18:72:542:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and simultaneity bias arises because it is difficult to identify who is affecting who in a network.
4:106:6296:18:18:89:542:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper overcomes these challenges in the context of Norway’s criminal justice system.
4:107:6384:18:18:72:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:First, we merge several administrative data sources to construct a census of all crimes,
4:108:6472:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:criminal court cases and incarceration spells in Norway for the period 2005 to 2016. We
4:109:6559:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then link these records for all defendants in Norway to similarly rich panel data for criminal
4:110:6653:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:network members and brothers. To identify causal effects, we take advantage of the random
4:111:6742:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assignment of criminal cases to judges who systematically vary in how likely they are to send
4:112:6835:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a defendant to prison. We utilize this exogenous variation to examine whether a defendant’s
4:113:6926:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incarceration affects the probability their other network members will be charged with a
4:114:7014:18:18:72:175:546:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:crime in the future.3
4:115:7035:18:18:89:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our measure of judge stringency is the average incarceration rate in all other cases a judge
4:116:7127:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:handles. This stringency measure serves as an instrument for the defendant’s incarceration
4:117:7217:18:18:72:542:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since it is highly predictive of the judge’s decision in the current case, but as we document,
4:118:7311:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uncorrelated with observable case characteristics of the defendant and the characteristics
4:119:7401:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of other members in their network. We define criminal groups based on the existence of a
4:120:7489:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:network link up to third order for joint criminal charges in the past (excluding the defendant’s
4:121:7585:18:18:72:542:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current case), although the results are robust to restricting peers to only first order links (i.e.,
4:122:7685:18:18:72:296:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:direct co-offenders in a prior criminal case).
4:123:7731:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper offers three main empirical results.  First, using judge stringency as an
4:124:7814:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instrument, we find large network spillover effects. When a criminal network member is
4:125:7900:18:18:71:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incarcerated, their peer’s probability of being charged with a future crimedecreasesby 51
4:126:7989:18:18:71:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points over the next 4 years. Likewise, having an older brother incarcerated

4:128:8164:18:18:72:218:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points over the next 4 years.
4:129:8193:18:18:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, these peer effects are concentrated in networks where the links between individuals
4:130:8284:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are likely to be active and salient. The criminal network spillovers are driven by peers with
4:131:8377:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strong potential ties to the incarcerated defendant, defined as living geographically close and
4:132:8472:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:having network ties for crimes committed recently. Peers who are less likely to be in contact
4:133:8565:18:18:71:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with each other are unaffected. For the brother network, the spillover passes only from older
4:134:8658:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to younger brothers, and not the other way around. More generally, we find no spillover
4:135:8745:18:18:72:433:170:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:effects for other family members such as sisters, children and spouses.4
4:136:8817:18:16:85:539:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:3Random judge designs have been used in other contexts as well; for example, see Autor, Mogstad and
4:137:8916:16:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Kostøl (2015), Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov and Hansen (2012), Dahl, Kostøl and Mogstad (2014), Dobbie

4:139:9115:8:16:85:539:116:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4In a completely different context, Dahl,Løkenand Mogstad (2014) find similar patterns for more versus
4:140:9217:16:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:less salient peer networks: strong peer effects in paternity leave take-up for co-workers and brothers, but not
4:141:9328:12:0:72:242:88:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:for neighbors or other family members.
5:142:9367:0:18:89:541:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, bias due to selection on unobservables matters. OLS yields modest and positively-
5:143:9455:18:18:72:542:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:signed spillover effects for both networks, even after including an extensive set of controls.
5:144:9549:18:18:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Taken at face value, OLS leads to the erroneous conclusion that incarceration either has no
5:145:9640:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect or slightly increases future crime within networks, whereas the IV estimates which
5:146:9729:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control for selection bias finds that incarceration of a defendant has a strong preventative
5:147:9821:18:18:72:221:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect on their network peers.
5:148:9851:18:18:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Turning to possible mechanisms, it is important to understand the effect of incarceration
5:149:9940:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the defendant. In our data, mean prison time served is 4.8 months, with approximately
5:150:10028:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:90% of defendants serving less than one year. So while the incapacitive effect of removing
5:151:10118:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the defendant from their network can help explain a short term effect, it cannot explain the
5:152:10210:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects we observe up to four years later. The reduction in crime is not driven by a reduced
5:153:10302:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of committing a new crime together (which happens only rarely), suggesting it is
5:154:10394:18:18:72:375:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the positive peer influence of the defendant more generally.
5:155:10454:18:17:89:541:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These empirical findings have important implications for policy. In Bhuller, Dahl, Løken,
5:156:10543:17:18:72:542:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Mogstad (2016), we document that defendants sent to prison commit fewer crimes,
5:157:10626:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participate in job training programs at a higher rate, and increase their employment post
5:158:10715:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:release. This rehabilitative effect is likely due in part to investments in education and training
5:159:10813:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:programs, but also through the extensive use of “open prisons” in which prisoners are housed
5:160:10905:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in low-security surroundings, given their own rooms for safety and privacy, and allowed
5:161:10992:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequent family visits. In comparison, in many other countries rehabilitation has taken a back
5:162:11086:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seat in favor of prison policies emphasizing punishment and incapacitation. In the current
5:163:11176:18:18:72:542:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper, we show that incarceration positively changes the behavior not only of the defendant,
5:164:11268:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but also of members of their network. A policy simulation which increases average judge
5:165:11355:18:18:72:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stringency by 1 standard deviation illustrates the policy relevance of these spillover effets.
5:166:11449:18:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This simulation makes clear that failing to account for incarceration spillover effects will
5:167:11541:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provide misleading projections of total policy impact and post-reform recidivism rates, as
5:168:11631:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the network reductions in future crimes committed are larger than the direct effect on the
5:169:11721:17:18:72:192:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incarcerated defendant.
5:170:11744:18:18:89:541:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes our research design,
5:171:11833:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:setting and data. In Section III, we assess the instrument and interpret the treatment. Section
5:172:11928:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IV presents and interprets our main findings on network spillover effects. The final section
5:173:12020:18:0:72:528:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offers some concluding remarks on the importance of network spillovers for public policy.
6:174:12110:0:30:72:306:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:II.  Research Design, Setting and Data
6:175:12148:30:18:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In Bhuller, Dahl, Løken, and Mogstad (2016, hereafter BDLM), we take advantage of a
6:176:12231:18:18:72:542:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar research design and data to estimate the effect of incarceration on the defendant.
6:177:12321:18:18:71:540:641:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:That paper serves as the backdrop to our current paper, as it is important to know the effect
6:178:12414:18:18:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of incarceration on the defendant to help interpret any spillover effects on their network
6:179:12504:18:17:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:members. This section describes our research design and data, copying some of the most
6:180:12590:17:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relevant information from BDLM. While further details can be found there, here we highlight
6:181:12681:18:18:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:how the quasi-random assignment of judges, combined with the richness of our data, can
6:182:12767:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be used to estimate network spillover effects. We also provide a brief background on prison
6:183:12858:18:43:72:542:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditions in Norway, with a comparison to other Western European countries and the U.S.
6:184:12946:43:26:72:144:491:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:II.A.  Setting
6:185:12960:26:17:71:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We study spillover effects within the criminal justice system of Norway. If the police suspect
6:186:13054:17:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an individual of a crime, they file a formal report. A public prosecutor then decides whether
6:187:13147:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the individual should be charged with a crime as well as whether the case should proceed
6:188:13235:18:18:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a court trial. About half of police reports lead to a formal criminal charge. Of these
6:189:13324:18:18:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:charged cases, the public prosecutor advances approximately 40% of them to a trial. The
6:190:13411:18:18:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other charged cases are either dismissed, directly assigned a fine, or sent to mediation by the
6:191:13506:18:18:72:164:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:public prosecutor.
6:192:13524:18:18:89:539:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Of the cases which proceed to trial, approximately 60% are non-confession cases, while
6:193:13610:18:18:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the remaining are cases where the defendant has confessed to the charges filed by the public
6:194:13702:18:18:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prosecutor.5We focus on non-confession cases in this paper. Once a case proceeds to trial, it is
6:195:13798:18:18:71:539:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assigned to a judge. If the judge finds the accused guilty, he or she can assign a combination of
6:196:13895:18:18:71:539:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possible punishments which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Slightly over half of cases
6:197:13989:18:18:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:result in incarceration, with probation, community service and fines combined accounting
6:198:14077:18:18:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for 44% of outcomes. In a small fraction of cases (5%), the defendant is found not guilty. If
6:199:14170:18:17:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiple individuals are charged in the same case, they take part in the same trial, but can
6:200:14262:17:18:72:495:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have different charges and different sentences depending on their role in the crime.
6:201:14346:18:18:89:539:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The law in Norway dictates that cases are assigned to judges according to the principle of
6:202:14436:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:randomization (Bohn, 2000; NOU, 2002). There are a few exceptions, such as for especially
6:203:14525:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:severe crimes or cases involving juveniles, which we exclude from our sample. To have a
6:204:14612:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample of randomly assigned cases for the same pool of judges, we limit our sample to regular
6:205:14705:18:19:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:judges handling non-confession cases. Regular judges are permanent civil servants (versus
6:206:14794:19:15:85:539:88:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5A defendant chooses whether to confess prior to knowing who their assigned judge will be. The absence
6:207:14896:15:0:72:540:73:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of plea bargaining makes the interpretation of our IV estimates easier (see Dobbie, Goldin and Yang 2018).

7:209:15065:18:18:89:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We measure the strictness of a judge based on their incarceration rate for all other
7:210:15149:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cases they have handled between 2005 and 2014. There are 597 judges, each of whom have
7:211:15235:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presided over an average of 238 randomly assigned court cases. To construct our judge
7:212:15320:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stringency measure, we calculate the leave-out mean judge incarceration rate conditional on
7:213:15411:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fully interacted court and year fixed effects to account for the fact that randomization occurs
7:214:15506:18:35:71:251:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within the pool of available judges.
7:215:15542:35:25:72:133:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:II.B.  Data
7:216:15553:25:18:71:542:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We use several administrative datasets which can be linked using individual identifiers.
7:217:15641:18:18:71:539:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Information on all court cases between 2005 and 2014 comes from the Norwegian Courts
7:218:15725:18:18:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Administration. We link this information with administrative data that contain complete
7:219:15812:18:18:72:542:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:records up to 2016 for all criminal charges, including the type of crime and date of a crime.
7:220:15905:18:18:71:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We merge these datasets with administrative registers containing demographic information
7:221:15993:18:18:72:286:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from Statistics Norway for every resident.
7:222:16035:18:18:89:541:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A key advantage of our register data is that we can link past (suspected or convicted)
7:223:16121:18:18:71:539:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-offenders to each other and brothers to each other. We define criminal networks based
7:224:16209:18:18:71:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on prior co-offender links up to third order. This means that two co-offenders who were
7:225:16296:18:18:71:539:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jointly charged in the same criminal case in the past (first order link) are defined to be
7:226:16386:18:18:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the same network, as are co-offenders of co-offenders (second order) and co-offenders of
7:227:16477:18:17:72:542:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-offenders of co-offenders (third order). To focus on networks which are likely to be active,
7:228:16572:17:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our baseline sample limits the network to individuals living within a five mile radius of each
7:229:16666:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other and who have a link which is less than 3 years old at the time of the court case. We
7:230:16756:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:further exclude co-offenders in the defendant’s current case, so as to avoid network peers
7:231:16846:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:being directly affected by the strictness of the judge to which a defendant is assigned. In
7:232:16937:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our baseline sample, 34% of the links within the criminal network are first order, while the

7:239:17440:18:15:85:539:127:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:6We further restrict the dataset to judges who handle at least 50 randomly assigned cases and to courts
7:240:17543:15:12:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:which have at least two regular judges in a given year. Our regression samples are limited to cases between
7:241:17650:12:8:71:370:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2005 and 2012 so that each defendant can be followed for four years.
7:242:17718:8:16:85:539:92:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7When we examine network spillovers separately by order of the link, the estimates remain large and
7:243:17817:16:0:72:393:76:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:statistically significant, but are not statistically different from each other.
8:244:17897:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Regardless of the sample, defendants facing potential prison time are a disadvantaged
8:245:17982:18:18:71:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:group: they have little education, low earnings, and high unemployment. Serial offenders
8:246:18070:18:18:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are common, with almost 40% of defendants having been charged for a different crime in
8:247:18156:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the previous year. There is also a mix of crime types. Around one fourth of cases involve
8:248:18245:18:18:71:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:violent crime, while property, economic, and drug crime each comprise a little more than 10
8:249:18336:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent of crimes. Drunk driving, other traffic offenses and miscellaneous crime make up the
8:250:18428:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remainder. Appendix Table A.1 also reports on peer group characteristics. On average, each
8:251:18518:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defendant has just over 4 members in their criminal network (conditional on having at least
8:252:18609:18:34:72:513:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one network member) and 1.7 brothers (conditional on having a at least one brother).
8:253:18693:34:26:72:411:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:II.C.  Prison Conditions and Prisoner Characteristics in Norway
8:254:18756:26:18:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To help with interpretation, we briefly describe prison conditions in Norway. Low-level
8:255:18843:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offenders go directly to open prisons, which have minimal security, as well as more freedoms
8:256:18935:18:17:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and responsibilities. Physically, these open prisons resemble dormitories rather than rows of
8:257:19028:17:18:72:542:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cells with bars. More serious offenders are sent to closed prisons with heightened security.
8:258:19120:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Norway has a strict policy of one prisoner per cell and tries to place prisoners close to home
8:259:19214:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so that they can maintain links with the families. This means that there is often a waiting
8:260:19305:18:18:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:list for non-violent individuals before they can serve their prison time; in our data the average
8:261:19402:18:18:71:541:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wait time is 5 months. To help with rehabilitation, prisons offer education, mental health,
8:262:19493:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substance abuse and job training programs; if not enrolled in one of these programs, a prisoner
8:263:19588:18:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is required to work within the prison. After release, there is an emphasis on helping offenders
8:264:19683:18:18:72:306:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reintegrate into society and the labor market.
8:265:19729:18:18:89:539:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Comparing Norway to other countries reveals both similarities and differences.8One
8:266:19811:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference is the amount of money spent on prisoners, which is higher in Norway compared to
8:267:19902:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the average for Western Europe and even higher compared to the average for the U.S. But
8:268:19989:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these averages mask substantial heterogeneity both across countries and across U.S. states, in
8:269:20083:18:18:72:542:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large part due to differences in labor costs (which are roughly two-thirds of prison budgets).
8:270:20177:18:17:71:541:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Another difference is sentence length. Average prison spells are just over 6 months in Norway,
8:271:20271:17:18:72:540:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and almost 90% are less than 1 year. This is considerably shorter compared to the average
8:272:20360:18:18:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prison time of 2.9 years for the U.S., and fairly similar to the median of 6.8 months in other
8:273:20454:18:18:71:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Western European countries. Because of this disparity in sentence lengths, the average cost
8:274:20545:18:18:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per prisoner spell in Norway and Europe is smaller compared to the U.S., even though the
8:275:20633:18:17:72:254:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost per prisoner per year is higher.

8:278:20885:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:populations, see Bureau of Justice Statistics (2015), Raphael and Stoll (2013), Kristoffersen (2014) and Aebi

9:280:21044:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Norway’s prison population looks broadly similar to other Western European nations and
9:281:21130:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the U.S., both in terms of demographics and the types of crimes committed. And while it
9:282:21217:18:18:72:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shares some commonalities with the U.S., the U.S. is an international outlier in incarceration.
9:283:21312:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Norway’s rate of 72 per 100,000 population is slightly lower compared to the average for
9:284:21400:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:European countries of 102 per 100,000. In sharp contrast, the U.S. has a rate of almost 700
9:285:21491:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per 100,00. A majority of this gap is due to longer prison sentences in the U.S., particularly
9:286:21585:18:36:72:295:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for minor crimes (Raphael and Stoll, 2013).
9:287:21628:36:30:72:445:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:III.  Assessing the Instrument and Interpreting the Treatment
9:288:21689:30:25:72:161:534:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:III.A.  IV Model
9:289:21705:25:18:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our goal is to causally estimate spillover effects in criminal and family networks. We label a
9:290:21799:18:18:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defendant facing possible incarceration with the subscript1and their peer with the subscript
9:291:21891:18:18:71:540:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:2. The influence of a defendant being incarcerated after being accused of a crime,I, on their
9:292:21984:18:26:72:507:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peer’s probability of being charged with a crime in the future,C, can be modeled as:
9:293:22068:26:26:237:540:429:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:C2=α2+β2I1+δ2X+ε2(1)
9:294:22088:26:18:71:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereXincludes a full set of interacted year-of-case registration by court dummy variables as
9:295:22181:18:18:71:542:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well as a set of control variables for both the defendant’s and their peer group’s characteristics.
9:296:22280:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Identifying these types of spillover effects is challenging due to the well-known problems of
9:297:22373:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlated unobservables, reflection and endogenous group membership. The third challenge
9:298:22462:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is not an issue in our setting, since the endogenous groups are formed prior to the defendant’s
9:299:22557:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incarceration decision. We overcome the first two challenges in an IV setting using the
9:300:22644:18:17:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional random assignment of cases to judges, which gives rise to exogenous variation in
9:301:22736:17:26:72:457:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the probability a defendant is incarcerated. The first stage of our model is:
9:302:22813:26:26:255:540:252:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:I1=θZ1+πX+v1(2)
9:303:22828:26:18:71:539:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereZ1denotes the stringency measure for the judge assigned to the defendant’s case. We
9:304:22916:18:18:72:539:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also report reduced form estimates ofZ1onC2conditional onX– which do not require
9:305:22996:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions about instrument exclusion or monotonicity. These estimates capture the effect
9:306:23086:18:35:72:446:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the defendant’s judge stringency on the criminal behavior of his peers.
9:307:23160:35:25:72:290:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:III.B.  Instrument Relevance and Validity
9:308:23201:25:18:72:542:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our instrument is the average judge incarceration rate in other cases a judge has handled,
9:309:23291:18:18:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including the judge’s past and future cases that may fall outside of our estimation sample. The
9:310:23386:18:0:72:540:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mean of the instrument is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.07. The histogram appearing
10:311:23476:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Appendix Figure A.1 reveals a wide spread in a judge’s tendency to incarcerate; a judge
10:312:23566:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the 90th percentile incarcerates about 54% of cases as compared to approximately 37% for
10:313:23657:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a judge at the 10th percentile. The appendix figure also plots the probability a defendant is
10:314:23750:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sent to prison in the current case as a function of whether he is assigned to a strict or lenient
10:315:23847:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:judge. The likelihood of receiving a prison sentence is monotonically increasing in the judge
10:316:23940:18:18:72:300:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stringency instrument, and is close to linear.
10:317:23986:18:18:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first panel of Table A.3 reports corresponding first stage estimates for the samples of
10:318:24077:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all defendants, criminal network defendants and brother defendants. We regress a dummy for
10:319:24167:18:18:71:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether a defendant is incarcerated in the current case on our judge stringency instrument
10:320:24257:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and find that being assigned to a judge with a10percentage point higher overall incarceration
10:321:24350:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate increases the probability of receiving a prison sentence by between4to5percentage
10:322:24436:18:18:72:107:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points.
10:323:24443:18:18:89:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix Table A.2 verifies that judges in all cases, as well as the criminal network
10:324:24528:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and brother subsamples we will be focusing on, are randomly assigned to cases. The first
10:325:24616:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:column regresses incarceration on a variety of variables measured before the court decision
10:326:24707:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the sample of all defendants. It reveals that defendant characteristics, type of crime and
10:327:24801:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defendant past work and criminal history variables are highly predictive of incarceration, with
10:328:24896:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:most coefficients being individually significant. In columns 3 and 5 we repeat this exercise
10:329:24988:18:18:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the co-offender and brother subsamples, but add in peer group characteristics as well.
10:330:25078:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For these subsamples, we likewise find these pre-determined variables significantly predict a
10:331:25171:18:18:72:203:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defendant’s incarceration.
10:332:25197:18:18:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In columns 2, 4 and 6 we examine whether judge stringency can be predicted by these
10:333:25280:18:18:72:542:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same sets of variables, and find no statistically significant relationship for any of the samples.
10:334:25378:18:18:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The estimates are close to zero, and the number of significant coefficients is not more than
10:335:25470:18:18:71:541:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would reasonably be expected due to chance. The coefficients are also not jointly significant,
10:336:25564:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:providing strong evidence for conditional randomization. In BDLM, we provide additional
10:337:25651:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tests for conditional independence, the exclusion restriction and monotonicity, and find strong
10:338:25746:17:35:72:376:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:support for the validity of the judge stringency instrument.
10:339:25806:35:26:72:249:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:III.C.  Interpreting the Treatment
10:340:25840:26:18:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To understand the peer effects results which follow, it is important to first understand the
10:341:25932:18:18:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of incarceration on the defendant. Panel 2 of Appendix Table A.3 reports estimates for
10:342:26025:18:18:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the probability a defendant will be charged with a crime within four years after their court
10:343:26117:18:17:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision. OLS estimates a positive and significant effect of incarceration on future criminal
10:344:26210:17:18:72:542:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:charges for each of our samples. But as we found in BDLM, these OLS results are misleading.
10:345:26301:18:0:72:540:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For example, for all defendants, IV yields reductions in future crime of 24 percentage points
11:346:26395:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to an average of 67 percent. The crime reducing effects are somewhat larger for the
11:347:26487:18:18:72:393:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-offender sample and slightly smaller for the brother sample.
11:348:26550:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In our data, mean prison time served is 4.8 months, with almost 90 percent of defendants
11:349:26638:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:serving less than one year. As shown in BDLM, defendants sent to prison reduce their crime
11:350:26728:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both during and after their release, pointing to both incapacitation and rehabilitation as
11:351:26818:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important channels. As we argue in BDLM, the rehabilitative effect is likely due in part to
11:352:26909:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investments in education and training programs (which result in increased employment), high
11:353:27000:18:36:72:525:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality and safe prison conditions (see Section II.C.) and post-release support programs.

11:356:27135:25:18:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:Baseline estimates.We being our investigation of incarceration spillovers by examining
11:357:27221:18:18:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects within criminal networks. As a reminder, our baseline definition of criminal networks
11:358:27314:18:18:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is based on prior co-offender links up to third order which are close in both time (less than 3
11:359:27409:18:18:71:285:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years) and space (within a 5 mile radius).
11:360:27451:18:18:89:539:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The top panel of Table I reports first stage estimates for our criminal network sample of the
11:361:27544:18:18:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defendant’s probability of being sent to prison using our judge stringency instrument. Since
11:362:27636:18:18:71:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we are interested in estimating spillover effects, the unit of observation is a defendant-peer
11:363:27730:18:18:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pair. This means that defendants can appear multiple times in the sample if they have more
11:364:27820:18:18:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than one peer in their criminal network9. On average, each defendant has 4 peers. The
11:365:27905:18:18:71:539:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first stage effect of the instrument is strong and statistically significant, showing that if a
11:366:28000:18:17:72:539:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defendant is assigned to a judge with a10percentage point higher overall incarceration rate
11:367:28091:17:18:72:492:294:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the probability of receiving a prison sentence rises by about4percentage points.10
11:368:28173:18:18:89:540:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The bottom panel of Table I reports estimates of the probability a criminal network peer
11:369:28261:18:18:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has ever been charged with a crime. Separate estimates are reported for year 1 (the period
11:370:28351:18:18:71:541:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when the defendant is likely to be incapacitated in prison), years 2-4 (the period post release),
11:371:28448:18:18:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and years 1-4. In all cases, OLS estimates small, positive spillover effects when a defendant is
11:372:28544:18:18:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incarcerated. In sharp contrast, we find large and opposite-signed results when using our
11:373:28633:18:18:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:judge stringency instrument. For example, the effect of a defendant being assigned a judge
11:374:28723:18:18:71:539:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who is 10 percentage points more stringent is a reduction in their peer’s crime by 2 percentage
11:375:28818:18:12:85:495:150:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:A:9To account for correlation across peers, we cluster on the network in the statistical inference.
11:376:28915:12:15:81:539:138:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:10Note the first stage coefficient need not be one, unless the following conditions hold: (i) the sample of
11:377:29022:15:12:72:540:123:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:cases used to calculate the stringency measure is exactly the same as estimation sample, (ii) there are no
11:378:29128:12:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:covariates, and (iii) there are a large number of cases per judge. In our setting, there is no reason to expect
11:379:29239:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:a coefficient of one. In particular, the full set of interacted court, judge type, case type and year dummies
11:380:29348:12:0:72:228:87:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:breaks this mechanical relationship.
12:381:29385:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points over the ensuing 4 years. When scaled, this yields an IV estimate of a 51 percentage
12:382:29476:18:18:72:448:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:point drop in criminal charges for the peers of an incarcerated defendant.
12:383:29550:18:18:89:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Looking at columns 1 and 2, we see a reduction in peer crime when the defendant is likely
12:384:29639:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be in prison as well as after their release. We find a 31 percentage point drop in peer
12:385:29729:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime in year 1 and a 49 percentage point drop in years 2-4, which are large effects relative
12:386:29822:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the dependent means. So while the incapacitive effect of removing the defendant from
12:387:29909:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their network can help explain a short term effect, it cannot explain the effects we observe in
12:388:30004:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the longer term. Interestingly, the reduction in crime is not driven by a reduced probability
12:389:30097:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of committing a new crime together (which happens only rarely), suggesting it is the positive
12:390:30190:18:34:72:311:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peer influence of the defendant more generally.
12:391:30237:34:18:72:539:512:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:Alternative definitions of criminal networks.Our baseline definition of criminal networks
12:392:30326:18:18:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:includes links up to third order. Column 2 in Appendix Table A.4 reveals qualitatively similar
12:393:30420:18:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:RF and IV estimates compared to our baseline for first order links. While the estimate
12:394:30506:18:18:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remains statistically significant, the standard error increases by more than 50% given the
12:395:30596:18:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller sample size. In column 3, we look at criminal networks defined as including only 2nd
12:396:30688:18:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 3rd order links (and not 1st order links). These estimates are again qualitatively similar
12:397:30782:18:18:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and statistically significant, but with larger standard errors. What we take away from this
12:398:30873:18:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exercise is that it would be too restrictive to define criminal networks as being comprised of
12:399:30967:18:18:72:179:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only first order links.
12:400:30990:18:18:89:539:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Table II, we explore the importance of closeness in a criminal network. We first try an
12:401:31080:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alternative definition of closeness in space, using criminal network links occurring in the same
12:402:31176:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:municipality instead of within a five mile radius (but keeping closeness in time of 3 years or
12:403:31270:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less). The IV estimate in column 2 of -0.42 is qualitatively similar to the baseline estimate
12:404:31363:18:17:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of -0.51 in column 1. In columns 3 and 4, we look at the complement of these two distance
12:405:31452:17:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditions. When the link is greater than 5 miles or in a different municipality, the point
12:406:31543:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates are small and close to zero. The close versus distant estimates are statistically
12:407:31634:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different when comparing columns 1 and 3 (p-value = .03) and close to statistically different
12:408:31727:18:18:71:328:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when comparing columns 2 and 4 (p-value = .11).
12:409:31774:18:18:89:539:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We next try an alternative definition of closeness in time, using criminal network links
12:410:31862:18:18:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from more than three years ago (but keeping closeness in distance). When the links are distant
12:411:31956:18:18:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in time, the IV estimates are small and close to zero. The close versus distant estimates are
12:412:32049:18:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically different when comparing columns 1 and 5 (p-value = .02) as well as columns 2
12:413:32140:18:18:72:185:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 6 (p-value = .06).
12:414:32162:18:18:89:539:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table II makes clear that spillovers occur only for criminal networks which are likely to
12:415:32251:18:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be active. Peers with links which are not geographically close are unlikely to interact with
13:416:32345:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each other on a frequent basis. And peers without recent criminal activity are unlikely to be
13:417:32438:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current members of the same criminal group. These results highlight the usefulness of our
13:418:32527:18:35:72:474:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rich panel data, allowing us to focus on networks which are likely to be active.
13:419:32607:35:26:72:197:637:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:IV.B.  Brother Network
13:420:32629:26:18:71:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now turn to brother and broader family networks. In Table III, we present results for the
13:421:32721:18:17:71:539:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:younger brother of a defendant in the top panel and results for older brothers in the bottom
13:422:32813:17:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panel. We estimate a 32 percentage point reduction over a four year period in the probability
13:423:32906:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a younger brother will be charged with a crime if his older brother is incarcerated. This
13:424:32995:18:18:72:542:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect is somewhat smaller in year 1 (-0.135) compared to the estimate for years 2-4 (-0.338),
13:425:33089:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:although it should be noted that the two estimates are not directly comparable as they cover
13:426:33181:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different lengths of time. The time pattern indicates the reduction in a younger brother’s
13:427:33271:18:18:72:383:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime extends past the time when his older brother is in jail.
13:428:33333:18:18:89:542:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Turning to older brothers, we find no spillovers when the younger brother is incarcerated.
13:429:33423:18:18:71:542:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The point estimates in all three columns are close to zero and statistically insignificant.
13:430:33514:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, the 4 year estimates for the younger versus older brothers in the top and bottom
13:431:33604:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panels are statistically different from each other (p-value = .03). This finding is consistent
13:432:33698:18:18:71:540:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with evidence that suggests that older siblings are influential on younger sibling’s behavior
13:433:33791:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for risky behaviors such as smoking and drinking (Averett, Argys and Rees, 2011; Oettinger
13:434:33881:18:18:71:102:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2000).
13:435:33887:18:17:89:539:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:What about other family ties? In Bhuller, Dahl, Løken, and Mogstad (2018), we found no
13:436:33973:17:18:72:542:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:systematic evidence for intergenerational spillovers from parent to child. Consistent with this,
13:437:34069:18:18:71:541:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when we look at all other family members besides brothers (i.e., spouses, sisters and children),
13:438:34165:18:18:71:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we find no evidence of a spillover effect of incarceration, as reported in Table IV. The IV
13:439:34256:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate for these other family members combined is 0.053 (s.e. = .051), and is statistically
13:440:34349:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different from the estimate for younger brothers (p-value = 0.01). So while younger brothers
13:441:34441:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are heavily influenced by their older brother, there is no evidence of a link for other family
13:442:34535:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ties. These results highlight the importance of separating out different types of family ties
13:443:34628:18:36:71:239:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when examining spillover effects.
13:444:34661:36:30:72:357:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:V.  Policy Relevance of Incarceration Spillovers
13:445:34709:30:18:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our results show that the consequences of incarceration depend not only on an inmate’s
13:446:34795:18:17:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recidivism, but also on the effect it has on their broader criminal and family networks. These
13:447:34889:17:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:findings have important implications for criminal justice policy and the design of effective
13:448:34981:18:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prison systems, as the societal costs and benefits of incarceration are magnified once network
14:449:35077:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects are taken into account. To illustrate this point, we simulate the total reduction in
14:450:35169:18:18:72:426:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime from a hypothetical policy which makes judges more stringent.
14:451:35236:18:18:89:541:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There are two components from this type of policy change: the direct effect on defendants,
14:452:35326:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the spillover effects on network members. We consider an increase in judge stringency of
14:453:35418:18:18:71:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 standard deviation, which translates into making judges 7.23 percentage points more likely
14:454:35510:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to incarcerate a defendant on average. To calculate how this change in the instrument affects
14:455:35603:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:criminal network members and younger brothers, we multiply the reduced form estimates
14:456:35688:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from Tables I and III by .0723 and by the number of members in the relevant network. The
14:457:35776:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:direct effect is calculated based on the reduced form estimates for defendants in each of the
14:458:35869:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:networks (Appendix Table A.3). To ease interpretation, the predicted reduction in criminal
14:459:35959:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:charges is reported as a fraction of the total number of defendants and network members
14:460:36046:18:18:72:382:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ever charged with a crime during the 4 year sample window.
14:461:36104:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Figure I, we graph the direct, spillover and total effects of the policy simulation. In
14:462:36194:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the first year after the court decision, making judges 1 standard deviation stricter on average
14:463:36289:17:18:72:541:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is predicted to reduce the recidivism rate of defendants and their younger brothers by 1.7
14:464:36379:18:18:72:542:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent. Most of this initial reduction can be attributed to the direct effect on the defendants,
14:465:36476:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely due to an incapacitation effect. Over time, however, the spillover effect on younger
14:466:36567:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:brothers increases: by year 4, the total reduction in the recidivism rate is 2.6 percent, of which
14:467:36665:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the spillover effect accounts for 61 percent of the drop. In comparison, the spillover component
14:468:36761:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explains even more of the reduction in recidivism in the criminal network. Relatively large
14:469:36852:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spillover effects arise within the criminal network because there are more criminal peers
14:470:36941:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compared to younger brothers per defendant. Taken together, the simulation results highlight
14:471:37033:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that spillovers are of first order importance for policy, as the network reductions in future
14:472:37126:18:0:72:424:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime are larger than the direct effect on the incarcerated defendant.
