2:14:354:21:14:133:135:545:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F: 
2:15:354:14:13:133:467:531:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:The State of Connecticut’s General Assembly passed a Clean Elections Law 
2:16:427:13:14:133:467:518:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f10:F:in  2005.   In  this  paper  we  conduct  a  preliminary appraisal  of  the law’s 
2:17:509:14:13:133:467:504:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:performance based on recently published data on the voting results of the 
2:18:582:13:13:133:467:491:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:2010  and  2008  state-wide  office  elections.  The  Clean  Elections  Law was 
2:19:662:13:14:133:467:478:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:considered  among  the  most  stringent  in  the nation  at  the  time of  its 
2:20:740:14:13:133:467:464:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:passage.   It established  full  public  financing  for  all  elections  to  state 
2:21:823:13:14:133:467:451:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:offices,  including  the  state  legislature.    The  law  applied  to  primaries  as 
2:22:909:14:13:133:467:437:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:well   as   general   elections.      It   allowed   for   supplemental   monies   in 
2:23:995:13:14:133:467:424:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:unbalanced   contests   pitting  a  privately-financed   candidate   against  a 
2:24:1075:14:13:133:467:410:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:publicly-financed   one.   The   law   also   contained   provisions   banning 
2:25:1154:13:13:133:392:397:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:campaign donations from lobbyists and state contractors.

2:27:1210:14:13:133:467:370:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:Our  study  is  similar  to the 2009 one  prepared  by  the Office  of  Legislative 
2:28:1294:13:14:133:467:357:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:Research but  with  the  benefit  of  additional  data  drawn  from  the  2010 
2:29:1373:14:13:133:467:343:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:election  cycle.   Importantly,  we  conduct  our  examination  using  statistical 
2:30:1456:13:14:133:467:330:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:tests  with  significance  thresholds  at  conventional  95  percent  levels.   We 
2:31:1539:14:13:133:467:316:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:also  add  additional  performance  metrics  to provide  a  wider  lens  to  the 
2:32:1620:13:13:133:467:303:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:appraisal.   We   use  resampling  methods   to  draw  multiple  simulated 
2:33:1695:13:14:133:467:290:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:samples   to   calculate   statistical   significance.      Resampling   techniques 
2:34:1779:14:13:133:467:276:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f10:F:provide a non-parametric determination of a statistic’s distribution and a 
2:35:1854:13:14:133:467:263:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:measure  of  effectiveness  that  is  not  sensitive  to  deviations  from  the 
2:36:1934:14:13:133:377:249:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:assumptions underlying most parametric procedures.

3:38:1997:0:13:133:467:689:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:Based  on  the  results  derived  from  statistical  tests  of  the assembled 
3:39:2075:13:14:133:467:676:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:metrics it is difficult to conclude that the public funding of elections in the 
3:40:2153:14:13:133:466:662:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:State  of  Connecticut  is  an  unqualified  success,  or  for  that  matter,  a 
3:41:2234:13:14:133:467:649:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:qualified   success.    It   appear   that   the   one   conclusion   that   we   can 
3:42:2320:14:13:133:467:635:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:unambiguously draw  is that  the effusiveness and optimism of the various 
3:43:2394:13:13:133:467:622:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:commentators  supporting  clean  election  laws  has  not  yet  come  to  be 
3:44:2471:13:14:133:298:609:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:realized in the State of Connecticut.

4:65:2958:22:22:145:467:563:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Clean  election  laws  aim  to  fund  races  for  state  assemblies  with

4:67:3104:22:22:133:468:519:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:including  limiting or  altogether  eliminating private  funds  expended 
4:68:3177:22:22:133:468:497:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in   support   of   any   candidate (General   Accounting   Office   2003,

4:70:3323:22:22:133:467:453:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:constitute a remedy for a variety of social ills including government

4:74:3601:22:22:133:211:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Williams 2005). 
4:75:3616:22:22:145:467:343:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:In  2005, the State of Connecticut’s General Assembly passed a 
4:76:3678:22:22:133:467:321:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:Clean Elections’ Law, possibly the most stringent in the nation at 
4:77:3745:22:22:133:467:299:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  time (Nyhart  2006).   The  Citizens  Election  Program established 
4:78:3818:22:22:133:467:277:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:full  public  financing  for all  elections  to  state  offices, including  the 
4:79:3898:22:22:133:467:255:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:state  legislature (Mayer  and  Werner  2007,  Zagaja  2009).   The  law 
4:80:3970:22:22:133:467:233:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:applied  to primaries  as  well  as  general  elections.   It  allowed for 
4:81:4044:22:22:133:465:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:supplemental  monies  in  unbalanced  contests  pitting  a  privately-
4:82:4114:22:0:133:467:189:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:financed  candidate against  a  publicly-financed  one. The  law also 
5:83:4194:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:contains provisions banning campaign donations from lobbyists and

5:87:4416:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  Office  of  Legislative  Research (Sullivan  2009) and  a  study  by 
5:88:4489:22:22:133:468:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Zagaja (Zagaja  2009).   In  addition, Parnell  conducts  an  interesting 
5:89:4562:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:albeit limited study examining whether the election law has altered 
5:90:4630:22:22:133:349:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:voting patterns of legislators (Parnell 2010). 
5:91:4675:22:22:145:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Sullivan examined the effect of the legislation on (i) voter choice, 
5:92:4744:22:22:133:468:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(ii) electoral  competition, (iii) voter  participation  and (iii) program

5:94:4884:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2008 election cycle.  Although not testing for statistical significance 
5:95:4956:22:21:133:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  findings of  the Sullivan’s Office  of  Legislative  Research  study 
5:96:5030:21:23:133:468:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  charitably  inconclusive at  best,  noting  that: “it is too early to 
5:97:5104:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:draw  any  causal  linkages  to  changes,  if  any,  that resulted from the 
5:98:5180:22:21:133:345:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:public financing programs (Sullivan 2009)”.

5:100:5292:22:22:133:467:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:metrics   between   2004   and   2008: (i)   electoral   landscape,   (ii) 
5:101:5366:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:participations,    (iii)    electoral    competition,    (iv)    diversity,    (v)

5:103:5517:22:22:133:467:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and   candidates,   limited   excessive   campaign   spending,   allowing 
5:104:5591:22:22:133:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:candidates to spend less time fundraising, and, (vi) increasing voter 
5:105:5661:22:22:133:470:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:confidence and participation.  Zagaja’s results are decidedly mixed.  
5:106:5730:22:0:133:467:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Although  Zagaja  does  not  rely  on  statistical  testing  in  arriving  at 
6:107:5819:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:conclusions his results are instructive nevertheless perhaps because 
6:108:5887:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of   the   added   perspective   provided   by   the   various   qualitative 
6:109:5964:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:measures  attempted.    Zagaja’s findings  suggest  that the  electoral 
6:110:6035:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:law’s goals were met in only two of the seven metrics he examines: 
6:111:6101:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(i)  participation, and, (vi)  allowing  candidates  to  spend  less time 
6:112:6173:22:22:133:468:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:fundraising.  As  for  the remaining  six measures,  they were either

6:114:6317:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Specifically:  scrutiny  of (ii)  electoral  competition,  (iii)  diversity,  (iv) 
6:115:6400:22:22:133:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:decreasing the actual or appearance of influence by interest groups 
6:116:6468:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on   candidates, and, (v) limiting   excessive   campaign   spending, 
6:117:6538:22:21:133:377:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:proffered no support for the electoral law thesis.  
6:118:6589:21:21:145:468:447:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Parnell takes aim at the special interest rationale of the Connecticut 
6:119:6659:21:21:133:467:426:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:election  law (Parnell 2010).    He  measures  changes  in  the  voting 
6:120:6729:21:21:133:467:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:patterns   of   legislators   who   served   in   the   Connecticut General 
6:121:6804:21:21:133:467:384:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Assembly  during  the  2007-08  session  and  accepted  taxpayer  dollars 
6:122:6878:21:21:133:467:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for  their  2008  reelection campaign.    Specifically,  he  argues  that  by

6:124:7031:21:22:133:467:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:priorities to voting patterns, a finding of a noticeable change in voting 
6:125:7105:22:21:133:467:299:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:since   the   beginning   of   election   law   constitutes   support   for   the 
6:126:7187:21:21:133:467:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:argument that freeing legislators from private, voluntary contributions 
6:127:7258:21:21:133:467:257:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:has indeed  made  legislators  more  responsive  to  citizens  and  less 
6:128:7330:21:21:133:468:236:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:responsive to so-called special interests (Parnell 2010). Parnell’s more 
6:129:7400:21:22:133:467:215:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:limited and more focused study finds “no evidence to support the 
6:130:7465:22:0:133:467:193:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:contention  that  providing  taxpayer  dollars  to  legislative  candidates 
7:131:7552:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:reduces  the  likelihood  that  a  legislator  will  vote  with  an  interest 
7:132:7630:22:22:133:170:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:group” 
7:133:7636:22:22:145:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In  this  paper we  conduct an  appraisal  similar  to the  Office  of 
7:134:7707:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Legislative   Research (Sullivan) study   but   with   the   benefit   of 
7:135:7781:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:additional  data  drawn  from  the  2010  election  cycle.    Importantly, 
7:136:7856:22:22:133:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we conduct our examination using statistical tests with significance 
7:137:7925:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:thresholds  at conventional  95  percent  levels.  We  also  add  other 
7:138:7997:22:22:133:440:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:performance metrics to provide a wider lens to the appraisal.   
7:139:8060:22:22:145:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:There as two important qualifications regarding our results.  First, 
7:140:8129:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:there  are neither  theoretical  nor standard  metrics that  can  be 
7:141:8198:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:invoked ex  ante in  the  examination  of  legislation  such  as  the 
7:142:8267:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:election   law   of   Connecticut.    Although   one   can   conceivably 
7:143:8340:22:21:133:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:assemble   a   significantly   large   number   of   informative   metrics 
7:144:8415:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:appraising  the  impact  of  election  laws  generally,  several  authors 
7:145:8489:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:consistently examine the same  few variables. We  examine  the 
7:146:8551:22:21:133:470:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Sullivan   metrics   and   a   few   others   popular   with   researchers.  
7:147:8628:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:However, and for purposes of establishing criteria for success - few 
7:148:8696:22:22:133:467:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of  these  metrics  are  outcome  metrics;  all  are  instrumental  ones. 
7:149:8770:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Thus,   success   is   in   terms of   the particular   realization of   the 
7:150:8846:22:22:133:467:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:instrumental   metric   and   not   necessarily   in   terms   of   ultimate 
7:151:8923:22:22:133:287:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes – however defined.   
7:152:8951:22:22:145:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:For  instance,  consider  the metric ‘voter participation.’  If the 
7:153:9018:22:22:133:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:number of  voters  increases  after  the  adoption  of  the  election law, 
7:154:9093:22:0:133:467:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:all  else  equal, one  could attribute  the  increase  to  the  law  and 
8:155:9176:0:22:133:466:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:thereby argue  that  the  law  has  been  shown  to  be  a  success. 
8:156:9245:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:However,  no  such  conclusion  can  be  established  if  the  ultimate 
8:157:9317:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:outcome of interest is the economic fortunes of the state – gauged 
8:158:9382:22:22:133:468:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in terms of ‘state product per capita,’ ‘the unemployment rate,’ or, 
8:159:9450:22:22:133:420:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:‘construction permits’ or any other representative result.   
8:160:9509:22:22:145:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The  second  concern  is  that  no  one  metric  is  privileged  and 
8:161:9578:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:therefore  several  instrumental  metrics  are  examined.  Similarly, 
8:162:9647:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:there is no conceptually distinct and a priori aggregation weighting 
8:163:9716:22:22:133:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:scheme.   Thus,  to  the  extent  that  the  examined  metrics  convey 
8:164:9787:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:different and  possible  contradictory  inferences there  can  be  no 
8:165:9857:22:22:133:468:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:definitive  way  to  conclude  as  to  whether the  election  law  was 
8:166:9927:22:22:133:422:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:successful – even if we examine only instrumental metrics. 
8:167:9984:22:21:145:470:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Our results reflect those of Sullivan, Zagaja and those of Parnell.  
8:168:10052:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Our  efforts  at  determining  the  significance  of the  law  are  mixed: 
8:169:10127:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:some   metrics   do   suggest   statistically   meaningful   differences 
8:170:10200:22:21:133:467:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:whereas many others don’t.   No  results  are  evident  in  the  2008 
8:171:10270:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cycle.    With   token   exceptions,   all   of   the   minute   differences 
8:172:10347:22:22:133:468:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:observed,  when they  are in  fact  observed, occur  by the  2010 
8:173:10412:22:22:133:208:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:election cycle.  
8:174:10428:22:22:145:467:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Ironically,  a  law  aiming  to  enhance  electoral  competition in  the 
8:175:10501:22:22:133:467:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:state of Connecticut strengthened the position of the Democrats in 
8:176:10568:22:22:133:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a  robustly blue  state:  the  results  of  several  metrics  appear  to have 
8:177:10646:22:22:133:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:bestowed   a   slight   edge   to   Democrats,   at   the   expense   of 
8:178:10719:22:0:133:467:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Republicans.    That  the  legislation may  have benefited  Democrats 
9:179:10800:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:may  be  ironical  but  it  is  also  unsurprising.   Notwithstanding  house 
9:180:10877:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:republican leader Larry Cafero’s observation that “the CEP made  it 
9:181:10944:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:easier   for  his   party   to   recruit   candidates  to   run   for   office   in 
9:182:11028:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:uncontested  districts,”2 one    would    think    that election    law 
9:183:11099:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:proscriptions  handicapping the  ability  of  potential  candidates  to 
9:184:11170:22:22:133:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:raise  money would most  likely  affect  the  generally  more  affluent 
9:185:11242:22:22:133:201:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:republicans.   
9:186:11256:22:22:145:468:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Some caveats: despite the poor statistical showing of the election 
9:187:11323:22:22:133:468:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:law performance metrics in Connecticut it is distinctly possible that 
9:188:11392:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the election law succeeds in “cleaning-up” the observed qualitative 
9:189:11460:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:electoral-related ills, as  has  been  argued.  On  the  other  hand, 
9:190:11529:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:because  of  remaining  porosity  in  the financing  system  the  current 
9:191:11603:22:21:133:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:version   of   the   law may   not   sufficiently   curtail   the continuing 
9:192:11680:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:practice   of   indirect flow   of private funds   to benefit favored 
9:193:11749:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:candidates.  And given the curtailing presence of Citizens United it is 
9:194:11819:22:21:133:467:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not  clear  whether  there  can  be  any  further  tightening (Citizens

9:196:11959:22:22:133:467:315:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:B:conclusively claim that the law does not work or that it works badly; 
9:197:12028:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and  we  do  not claim  as  much.    Nevertheless,  it  does  appear  that 
9:198:12102:22:22:133:468:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:any  benefits  of  clean  election  laws  are  more evident  in  the  telling

11:223:13517:22:22:133:468:646:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:private  money  in  campaigns  is  to  lessen  influence  peddling in 
11:224:13586:22:22:133:468:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:government  outcomes: the ubiquitous “pay-to-play” influence of 
11:225:13649:22:22:133:467:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:interest  groups in  public  policy.    Ostensibly,  in  substituting  state 
11:226:13726:22:22:133:467:580:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:monies  in  lieu  of  private  monies  elected  officials  will  no  longer  be 
11:227:13806:22:22:133:470:558:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:beholden to the special interests represented by their contributors.  
11:228:13876:22:22:133:467:536:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:In   turn,   the   implicit   outcome  of this   cleansing   would   lead  to 
11:229:13954:22:21:133:467:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:legislative   outcomes   that   clearly   reflect,   or   better   reflect,   the 
11:230:14036:21:22:133:262:493:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:interests of the majority.   
11:231:14064:22:22:145:467:471:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Relatedly,  the  laws  also  attempt  to  reach  the  persistence  of 
11:232:14134:22:22:133:467:449:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:incumbency.      Before   there   existed   any   public   monies   made 
11:233:14207:22:22:133:467:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:available   by   clean   election   laws,   aspiring   officeholders   were 
11:234:14283:22:22:133:467:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:compelled to either raise money from citizens or interest groups or 
11:235:14351:22:22:133:466:383:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:self-finance  their  campaigns.  In  the  face  of  a  seemingly  monolithic 
11:236:14428:22:22:133:467:361:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:incumbent   few   potential   donors   were   willing   to   support   a 
11:237:14501:22:22:133:467:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:challenger. Few  candidates had  the  wherewithal  to  pay their  own 
11:238:14571:22:22:133:468:317:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:way.  The perception of invincibility associated with incumbency in 
11:239:14637:22:22:133:468:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect translated  into a full-employment  act  for  sitting  legislators

11:241:14735:22:22:145:467:251:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Election law reformers felt that the seeming sense of entitlement 
11:242:14801:22:22:133:468:229:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:brandished  by  sitting  legislators created  by  the  lack  of  a  credible 
11:243:14878:22:22:133:467:207:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:threat of removal rendered them ineffective and inattentive to the 
11:244:14945:22:22:133:467:185:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:concerns   of   their   constituents.      Public   monies and   limits   on 
11:245:15022:22:0:133:467:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:donations were   considered   an   effective   way   to   overcome   the 
12:246:15107:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:“barriers  to  entry.” Small  donations  pose  a  less  serious  threat 
12:247:15178:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:because  the  individuals  who  make  them  are  in  no  position  to 
12:248:15248:22:22:133:468:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:extract  quid-pro-quo  type  of  concessions  from  legislators.   Yet 
12:249:15319:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:despite    the “breath-of-fresh-air”  quality and    the    bona    fide

12:251:15462:22:22:133:287:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:inconsistencies can be noticed. 
12:252:15493:22:22:145:468:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In Connecticut, the clean elections law adopted in 2005 was not a 
12:253:15559:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:voter  initiative  as  they  are  in  the  few  other  states  who  have 
12:254:15632:22:22:133:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:embraced such  reform.    Rather,  it  was  a  legislative  act.    But  if 
12:255:15707:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:individual   state   legislators   knew   that   influence   peddling   was 
12:256:15783:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:endemic  across  their  ranks – why  not  simply  refuse  to  do  the 
12:257:15852:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:special interest’s bidding?  Why chose the more elaborate process 
12:258:15918:22:21:133:466:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of   assembling   legislation   to   address   this   problem?   Opting   for 
12:259:15996:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:legislation – an approach which binds all – appears to be a solution 
12:260:16063:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to a run-of-the-mill social dilemma problem (Elster 2007, Huberman 
12:261:16129:22:21:133:467:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and Glance 1994).  Every legislator was aware that collectively they 
12:262:16198:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:would all be better off if they refused special interest monies.  And 
12:263:16268:22:22:133:470:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:getting  elected – even  in  state  legislature  races – requires  money.  
12:264:16341:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Yet,  to  individually  refuse  to  accept  money  from  lobbyists  was 
12:265:16413:22:22:133:467:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:impractical because the money would simply be funneled to a more 
12:266:16478:22:22:133:467:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:willing state assemblyman; after all, at some level assemblymen are 
12:267:16546:22:22:133:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a  fungible  lot.    By  collectively  agreeing  to  a  common  course  of 
12:268:16621:22:22:133:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:action via legislation to avoid accepting special interest monies the 
12:269:16691:22:0:133:418:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:legislature found a solution to their “commons” problem.  
13:270:16760:0:22:145:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:A  second puzzling observation logically suggests itself.  It’s not 
13:271:16828:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:clear   that   refusing   private   monies   will   lead   to   better   social 
13:272:16908:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes.    To  our  knowledge  no  meaningful  evidence  linking  the 
13:273:16980:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:provision of the state funding of candidates to improved legislative 
13:274:17049:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:performance  was  provided. In  fact,  some  would  argue  that  the 
13:275:17118:22:22:133:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:impact  on  legislation  has  been  nil.   Voting  by  legislatures  in  the 
13:276:17195:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2010  assembly  was  virtually  indistinguishable  from  the  previous 
13:277:17266:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:legislative   voting   patterns   (Parnell   2010).    Nor   was   there   any 
13:278:17345:22:22:133:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:evidence    linking    the    proposed    measure    or    to    any    other 
13:279:17423:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:performance  metric,  for  that  matter.    In  fact  and  to  the  contrary, 
13:280:17501:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:one  can  envision  any  number  of  scenarios  in  which  the  resulting 
13:281:17575:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:will  of  the  majority,  unencumbered  by  private  monies,  could  have 
13:282:17649:22:21:133:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:serious negative economic repercussions.  Thus, one has to wonder 
13:283:17714:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:why the focus of the clean elections legislation on what are merely 
13:284:17782:23:22:133:468:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:instrumental   measures-rather   than   on   measures   that   would 
13:285:17851:22:21:133:468:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:guarantee  desired  social  outcomes – to  the  extent  that it was 
13:286:17918:21:22:133:186:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:possible?   
13:287:17929:22:22:145:467:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We  conjecture  that with  implicit  instrumental  measures the 
13:288:17993:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:central  concern  of  the  public  funding  of  elections  law  adopted  by 
13:289:18069:22:22:133:467:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Connecticut is  its own  reward.   Indeed,  the  literature  around  the 
13:290:18141:22:22:133:467:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:“fairness heuristic” finds compelling evidence that most people 
13:291:18205:22:22:133:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:resort  to  perceived  procedural  fairness  when  information  on  the 
13:292:18277:22:22:133:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:trustworthiness of an authority is unavailable or corrupted (van den

14:294:18428:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:appear  to  be  beyond  reproach.    The  seeming  impropriety  of  being 
14:295:18502:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:seen  as  beholden  to  private  interests,  especially  after  the  uproar 
14:296:18578:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:resulting in the Governor Rowland’s impeachment, was diminishing

14:300:18796:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  performance  of  several  instrumental  measures  and  thereby 
14:301:18864:22:22:133:462:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:provide a basis for tentative answers. This is our task in this paper.  
14:302:18935:22:22:145:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:To some extent, the ultimate impact of Connecticut’s efforts will 
14:303:19001:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:depend  on  of  the  evolving resolution of  the  recent  controversial

15:326:20323:22:22:145:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We   use   resampling   methods and   draw   multiple   simulated

15:329:20539:22:22:133:418:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:it is possible to test any number of performance metrics.   
15:330:20598:22:21:145:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In   this   instance resampling   conveys   three advantages   over

15:335:20946:22:22:133:468:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:most  parametric  procedures.   The  simulated  samples  are  drawn

15:340:21291:22:0:133:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:greatly limit the applicability of stochastic  data models  such  as the 
16:341:21375:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:traditional logistic  or  multiple  linear  regression  models (Breiman

16:343:21454:22:22:145:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Potentially  useful  non-parametric  tests  such  as  the  Wilcoxon

16:346:21666:22:22:133:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:However,  their flexibility  comes  at  a  loss  of  statistical  power.    It  is 
16:347:21748:22:22:133:465:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:usually  more  difficult  to  reject  the  null  hypothesis  when  non-
16:348:21819:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:parametrics are   used,  which   in   turn  increases   our   chances   of

16:351:22043:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:enhance  the  chances  of  a  finding  in  favor  of  observable  effects  of

16:353:22139:22:21:145:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Last, we   analyze   statistical   constructs in   our   analysis – e.g. 
16:354:22211:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:measures  of  diversity  such  as  the  gini  coefficient,  the  herfindahl

16:357:22432:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sample  statistic  is  compared  with  the  null  resampling  distribution

16:359:22560:22:22:145:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We set forth our null hypothesis of no difference in the levels of

16:363:22686:22:22:145:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Where: Φi represents  the  realization  of  a  particular statistic  in

17:365:22836:0:22:145:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We   generate   via   monte carlo simulation   the   permutation

17:367:22979:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Stata.  We calculate the observed difference between the simulated

17:369:23122:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:assuming a null hypothesis of no difference in election results.  We

17:372:23339:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We  reject  the  hypothesis  and  accept the  alternative  if  the  value  of

19:438:25430:22:22:133:467:395:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We  observe  the  following.    The  direction  of  change  in  the  levels 
19:439:25506:22:21:133:467:373:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between  the  2006  and  20008  election  cycles  were to the contrary

19:442:25731:22:22:133:467:308:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:was  statistically  significant.    And  given  the  impressive  ability  to 
19:443:25808:22:22:133:467:286:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:energize   voters   by   the   2008   Obama   campaign   it   is   not clear

20:449:26081:22:22:133:467:646:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We  examine  several additional  metrics to  capture the  relevance  of 
20:450:26151:22:22:133:467:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:other dimensions of the reach of the elections law.  Specifically, we 
20:451:26221:22:22:133:250:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:examine the following:  
20:452:26242:22:22:133:136:580:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B: 
20:453:26242:22:22:169:453:558:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:(i) Change in the margin of victory for each particular 
20:454:26297:22:22:205:447:536:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:state house race, both in absolute terms and as a 
20:455:26347:22:22:205:456:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:percent of the total vote.  We hypothesize that the 
20:456:26399:22:22:205:449:492:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:increased competitive vigor brought about by the 
20:457:26448:22:22:205:433:470:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:increased funding would reduce the margin of 
20:458:26493:22:22:205:388:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:victory as measured by both metrics. 
20:459:26529:22:22:169:443:426:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:(ii) Electoral races are considered competitive if the 
20:460:26583:22:22:205:446:404:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:average outcome of races is less than or equal to 
20:461:26633:22:22:205:458:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:60%.  We hypothesize that the electoral law should 
20:462:26684:22:22:205:340:360:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:increase competitiveness.   
20:463:26711:22:22:169:457:338:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:(iii) Another measure of competitiveness of vigor is the 
20:464:26767:22:21:205:449:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:total number of votes cast by the opposition.  We 
20:465:26816:21:22:205:409:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:hypothesize that the electoral law should 
20:466:26858:22:23:205:460:273:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:unequivocally result in an increase in the number of 
20:467:26911:23:22:205:348:250:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:votes cast by the opposition. 
20:468:26940:22:21:169:442:228:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:(iv) Diversity is considered a desirable outcome. We 
20:469:26992:21:22:205:439:207:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:examine whether there has been an increase in 
20:470:27038:22:22:205:445:185:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:diversity with the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index of 
20:471:27087:22:0:205:456:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Concentration (HHI).  We look at the share of party 
21:472:27150:0:22:205:466:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:presence in the various races and also at the share of 
21:473:27205:22:22:205:441:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:total votes garnered by each party.  The HHI is a 
21:474:27255:22:22:205:463:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:sample statistics and therefore its sampling variance 
21:475:27309:22:22:205:457:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:can be calculated.  Formally, the index is calculated 
21:476:27362:22:22:205:259:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:as follows: 
21:477:27373:22:22:241:244:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A: 
21:478:27373:22:32:241:338:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:HHI = 10,000* 
21:479:27386:32:22:133:468:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Where: Si is the relevant share of the either party presence or share 
21:480:27456:22:22:133:467:502:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of  votes.    The  higher  the  index  the  less  diversity  is  present.    The 
21:481:27537:22:22:133:436:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:maximum is HHI = 10,000, representing a one party outcome. 
21:482:27595:22:22:133:468:458:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:  The   data   on the   realized   value   of these   other   metrics   are

23:569:29414:22:22:133:467:186:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:obtained from testing the Sullivan metrics.  First, few of the metrics 
23:570:29485:22:0:133:467:164:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:exhibit  statistically  significant  change  between  the  2006  and  2008 
24:571:29572:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:election  cycle.    Thus,  the  observed  improvement  in  the winning 
24:572:29643:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:margin   of   votes   cast   as   a   percent   of   total   votes   cast   is   not 
24:573:29728:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:statistically  significant.    The  same  findings  emerge  for  the  two 
24:574:29802:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:diversity indexes estimated.  Second, there is discernible change in 
24:575:29871:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  metrics  between  2006  and  2008  that  is  contrary  to what  one 
24:576:29943:22:22:133:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:would  expect – but  the  change  is  not  statistically  significant.    For 
24:577:30020:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:example, there is an increase in the average winning margin (levels) 
24:578:30088:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of  votes  between  2006  an  2008  (from  3142  votes  to  4352)  rather 
24:579:30162:22:22:133:290:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:than the anticipated decrease.   
24:580:30194:22:22:145:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:There  are  more  significant  changes  in  the  comparison  with  the 
24:581:30265:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2010  election  cycle.    But  the  results  are  contradictory.   We  find 
24:582:30341:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:positive  improvements  in  the  winning  margin  of  votes  cast  but  a 
24:583:30415:22:21:133:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:deterioration  of  competitive  vote  margin.    Both  are  statistically 
24:584:30489:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:significant.    Importantly,  the  diversity  indexes  show  no  statistically 
24:585:30568:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:discernible  improvement  at  all,  whether  from  the  comparison  to 
24:586:30639:22:21:133:467:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  2008  or  the 2010  cycle.    A  somewhat troubling  indicator  is the 
24:587:30715:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:fact    that    party    and    opposition    diversity    appears    to    have 
24:588:30796:22:22:133:467:315:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:B:deteriorated by  2010  when  compared  to  the  party  and  opposition

24:590:30944:22:22:133:254:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:statistically meaningful.

24:593:31018:27:22:145:467:199:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Our results examining the impact on metrics aimed at appraising

25:595:31168:0:22:133:470:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:statistically  meaningful  differences  whereas  many  others  do not.  
25:596:31239:22:22:133:467:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Hardly  any  statistically  significant  results  are  evident  in  the  2008 
25:597:31317:22:22:133:467:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cycle.      With   token   exceptions,   all   of   the   minute   differences 
25:598:31396:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:observed,  when  they  are  in  fact  observed,  occur  by  the  2010 
25:599:31466:22:22:133:208:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:election cycle.  
25:600:31482:22:22:145:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Ironically,   a   law   aiming   to   enhance   electoral   competition 
25:601:31554:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:strengthened the position of the Democrats in a robustly blue state: 
25:602:31623:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  results  of  several  metrics  appear to  have  bestowed  a  slight 
25:603:31695:22:22:133:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:edge  to  Democrats,  at  the  expense  of  Republicans.    That  the 
25:604:31765:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:legislation  may  have  benefited  Democrats  may  be  ironical  but  it  is 
25:605:31842:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:also  unsurprising.    To  the  extent  that  proscriptions  handicap  the 
25:606:31917:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ability  of  potential  candidates  to  raise  money  it  is  most  likely  to 
25:607:31996:22:21:133:368:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:affect the generally more affluent republicans.   
25:608:32045:21:23:145:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Given  the inconclusiveness in the  information elicited by our 
25:609:32109:23:22:133:467:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:examination  of  the  various metrics assembled it is  difficult  to 
25:610:32178:22:21:133:467:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:conclude   that the   public   funding   of   elections   in the   State   of 
25:611:32255:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Connecticut is an unqualified success, or for that matter, a qualified 
25:612:32326:22:22:133:470:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:success.    First,  no  one metric  takes precedence  over  another.  
25:613:32396:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Second, any weighted combination of metrics must necessarily rely 
25:614:32462:22:22:133:467:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on    subjective    weights.     Third,    performance is    essentially 
25:615:32534:22:22:133:467:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:multidimensional:   superior   performance   against   one   objective 
25:616:32605:22:22:133:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cannot   easily   be   traded   off   against modest   or   inadequate 
25:617:32676:22:22:133:468:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:performance on another.  Fourth, several of the proposed ‘success’ 
25:618:32742:22:0:133:467:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:criteria  may be  specified  inadequately. Fifth,  and  at  any  rate, 
26:619:32825:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:`success’ in  this  instance  refers  to  the  performance  of  the  chosen 
26:620:32900:22:22:133:468:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:metrics.    Put  differently,  our  examination  scrutinized  instruments, 
26:621:32974:22:22:133:230:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not final outcomes. 
26:622:32993:22:22:145:467:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:It should be clear that the lack of conclusive discernible effects is 
26:623:33063:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not  evidence  against  the  proffered  benefits  of  the  Connecticut 
26:624:33134:22:22:133:467:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:clean  election  law.   Our  inconclusive results may  be  an  artifact  of 
26:625:33209:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  data,  in  other  words,  we could have  an  instance  in  which  the 
26:626:33284:22:22:133:467:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:hypothesis  is  true  but  our  metrics  are  poor  representations  of  the 
26:627:33361:22:22:133:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:hypothesis,  resulting  in false  negatives.  The  result  may  also  be  a 
26:628:33437:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:consequence   of   low   statistical   power,   or   the   fact   that   the 
26:629:33514:22:22:133:467:468:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:“administration” of the law was faulty, or even that the existing law 
26:630:33584:22:22:133:467:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:left  several  gaping  loopholes. In  fact,  one  could  realistically  argue 
26:631:33662:22:21:133:467:424:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that because  of  remaining  porosity  in  the  system  the  current  law 
26:632:33736:21:23:133:467:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:may  not  sufficiently  curtail  the  privately-directed  flow  of  funds  to 
26:633:33814:23:22:133:468:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:favored  candidates.  And  given  the  presence  of Citizens  United it  is 
26:634:33889:22:21:133:467:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not  clear  whether  there  can  be  any  further  tightening.   A  critical 
26:635:33966:21:22:133:467:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:limitation  of  our  study  is  the  lack  of  covariates  designed  to  hold 
26:636:34044:22:22:133:467:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:exogenous  influences  constant.    It  may  very  well  be that  there  is  a 
26:637:34123:22:22:133:467:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:vigorous   effect   ascribable   to  the  election   law   but   that   is   not 
26:638:34204:22:22:133:467:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:noticeable  because  it  is  eroded  by  broader  confounding  influences 
26:639:34278:22:22:133:467:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:– for which we don’t control.  Last, given the historical importance 
26:640:34346:22:22:133:467:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of local town and municipal elections in Connecticut a law aimed at 
26:641:34414:22:22:133:467:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:alleviating  the  ills  of  the  state  electoral  system  may  miss  the  well 
26:642:34494:22:0:133:467:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:known  point  that  all  elections are really local,  leading  one to  think 
27:643:34582:0:22:133:467:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that  we  are  looking  for  lost  keys  where  the  light  is  and  not  where 
27:644:34662:22:22:133:232:666:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we dropped them.   
27:645:34680:22:22:145:468:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:It   is   distinctly   possible   that   election   law has   succeeded in 
27:646:34755:22:22:133:467:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:B:“cleaning-up” the observed intangible ills – the  lingering  sense  of 
27:647:34825:22:22:133:467:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:corruption,  the  bothersome  belief  that  only  the  more  affluent  are 
27:648:34900:22:22:133:468:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:listened   to - as was argued. There   is   some   support   for   that 
27:649:34970:22:22:133:467:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:perception.    But  more  accurate or  more  specific tests  will  have  to 
27:650:35046:22:22:133:264:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wait a different occasion.   
27:651:35074:22:22:145:467:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Thus, we cannot conclusively claim that the law does not work or 
27:652:35139:22:22:133:467:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that  it  works  badly. It  appear  that  the  one  conclusion  that  we  can
