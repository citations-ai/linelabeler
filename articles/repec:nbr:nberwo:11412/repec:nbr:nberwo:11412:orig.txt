2:21:908:31:21:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In this paper, I examine changes in labor supply and earnings across regions of Mexico during the
2:22:1005:21:22:71:539:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1990s. I focus the analysis on individuals born in states with either high-exposure or low-exposure
2:23:1104:22:21:71:539:549:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to emigration, as measured by historical data on state migration to the United States. During the
2:24:1201:21:22:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1990s, rates of external migration and interval migration were higher among individuals born in
2:25:1296:22:21:71:539:506:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:high-migration states. Consistent with positive selection of emigrants in terms of observable skill,
2:26:1396:21:22:71:539:485:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:emigration rates appear to be highest among individuals with earnings in the top half of the wage
2:27:1493:22:22:71:539:463:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:distribution. Controlling for regional differences in observable characteristics and for initial regional
2:28:1598:22:21:71:539:441:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:differences in earnings, the distribution of male earnings in high-migration states shifted to the right
2:29:1702:21:22:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:relative to low-migration states. Over the decade, average hourly earnings in high-migration states
2:30:1801:22:26:71:290:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rose relative to low-migration states by 6-9%.

3:38:1974:0:27:89:173:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:1.  Introduction 
3:39:1990:27:28:125:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Over  the  last  several  decades,  migration  to  the  United  States  has  profoundly 
3:40:2078:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affected  the  Mexican  economy.    The  most  obvious  change  has  been  to  Mexico’s  labor 
3:41:2173:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supply.  Between 1970 and 2000, the share of the Mexican population (individuals born 
3:42:2259:28:27:89:527:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  Mexico)  residing  in  the  United  States  increased  from  1.7%  to  8.6%  (Figure  1).1  
3:43:2355:27:28:89:527:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Emigration  rates  have  been  rising  steadily  over  time  and  are  highest  for  young  adults.  
3:44:2456:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Between  1990  and  2000,  10.0%  of  males  and  7.7%  of  females  born  in  Mexico  between 
3:45:2551:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1965 and 1974 migrated to the United States, raising the share of this age cohort living in 
3:46:2643:27:28:89:387:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the U.S. to 17.5% for males and 12.6% for females (Table 1). 
3:47:2704:28:27:125:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Not  surprisingly,  the  outmigration  of  labor  appears  to  have  put  upward  pressure 
3:48:2795:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on wages in Mexico.  Mishra (2004) estimates that in Mexico over the period 1970-2000 
3:49:2881:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  elasticity  of  wages  with  respect  to  the  outflow  of  migrant  labor  was  0.4  and  that 
3:50:2982:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration raised average wages in the country by 8.0%.  Upward pressure on wages has 
3:51:3068:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been strongest for  young adults with above-average education levels (those with 9 to 15 
3:52:3157:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:years of schooling), who in the 1990s were the individuals most likely to migrate to the 
3:53:3246:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:United States (Chiquiar and Hanson, 2005).   Increased labor flows between Mexico and 
3:54:3332:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the United States appear to be one factor contributing to labor-market integration between 
3:55:3423:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  two  countries.    For  the  1990s,  Robertson  (2000)  finds  that  a  shock  that  raises  U.S. 
3:56:3526:27:28:89:364:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages by 10% raises wages in Mexico by 1.8% to 2.5%. 
3:57:3579:28:27:125:522:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Were  the  only  effect  of  emigration  to  raise  wages  for  migrants  and  for  non-
3:58:3668:27:37:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migrating workers who substitute for migrant labor, the labor outflow would yield static 
3:59:3757:37:7:233:236:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
3:60:3805:7:16:89:524:113:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1  In  this  calculation,  the  numerator  is  the  population  of  individuals  born  in  Mexico,  as  enumerated  in  the 
3:61:3929:16:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:U.S.  population  census,  and  the  denominator  is  the  sum  of  this  figure  and  the  population  of  individuals 
3:62:4049:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:born  in  Mexico,  as  enumerated  in  the  Mexican  population  census.    This  calculation  ignores  the  small 
3:63:4164:12:0:89:396:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:number of individuals born in Mexico who have migrated to third countries. 
4:64:4240:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:welfare  losses  in  Mexico.    However,  an  additional  consequence  of  Mexican  emigration 
4:65:4335:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has  been  an  increase  in  the  return  flow  of  remittances.    In  2003,  remittances  from 
4:66:4432:28:27:89:527:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexican immigrants in the United States equaled 2.0% of Mexican GDP (IADB, 2004).  
4:67:4515:27:28:89:423:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These appear to more than offset the loss in GDP due to emigration.2 
4:68:4583:28:27:125:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:  An  important  aspect  of  migrant  behavior  in  Mexico  is  that  the  propensity  to 
4:69:4673:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigrate  varies  greatly  across  regions  of  the  country.    Due  partly  to  historical  accident, 
4:70:4777:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central  and  western  Mexico  have  long  had  the  country’s  highest  labor  flows  abroad.    In 
4:71:4878:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 2, which shows the fraction of households that sent migrants to the United States 
4:72:4967:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over 1995-2000 by Mexican state, emigration rates are  relatively low in states along the 
4:73:5057:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:U.S.  border,  sharply  higher  in  states  600-1200  kilometers  from  the  United  States,  and 
4:74:5155:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lowest in distant southern states.  Regional variation in migration behavior suggests that 
4:75:5246:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  labor-market  consequences  of  migrant  outflows  may  be  concentrated  in  specific 
4:76:5338:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:areas.    If  this  is  true,  estimates  of  the  impact  of  emigration  at  the  national  level  may 
4:77:5443:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:understate  its  impact  on  the  most  affected  regions.    While  the  importance  of  specific 
4:78:5542:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sending  regions  in  Mexican  migration  to  the  United  States  has  long  been  recognized 
4:79:5637:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Cardoso,  1980),  there  is  relatively  little  empirical  work  that  assesses  the  regional 
4:80:5734:28:28:89:482:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic effects of emigration in Mexico (Durand, Massey, and Zenteno, 2001). 
4:81:5812:28:27:125:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: In  this  paper  I  examine  the  regional  impacts  of  emigration  on  labor  supply  and 
4:82:5904:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor-market  earnings  in  Mexico.    I  compare  changes  in  labor-market  outcomes  across 
4:83:5999:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individuals  between  1990  and  2000  in  two  groups  of  states,  states  that  had  high 
4:84:6092:27:37:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration rates in the 1950s and states that had low emigration rates in the 1950s.  There 
4:85:6184:37:7:233:236:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
4:86:6232:7:16:89:524:113:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2 Based on Mishra’s (2004) estimates, the emigration loss in Mexico for 2000 would be 0.45% of GDP (0.5 
4:87:6336:16:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:times  change  in  wages  due  to  emigration  of  8.0%  times  loss  in  labor  supply  due  to  emigration  of  16.0% 
4:88:6456:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:times  labor  share  of  income  of  0.70).    In  that  year,  remittances  were  1.1%  of  Mexican  GDP.    See  Borjas 
4:89:6578:12:0:89:378:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(1999a) for estimates of the immigration surplus for the United States.   
5:90:6653:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  two  key  identifying  assumptions  in  my  analysis.    One  is  that  labor  is  sufficiently 
5:91:6754:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:immobile  across  Mexican  regions  for  region-specific  labor-supply  shocks  to  affect 
5:92:6845:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regional  earnings  differentials.    Robertson  (2000),  Chiquiar  (2004),  and  Hanson  (2004) 
5:93:6942:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provide  evidence  of  region-specific  labor-market  shocks  having  affected  Mexico’s 
5:94:7031:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regional   wage   structure,   which   is   consistent   with   some   degree   of   regional   labor 
5:95:7133:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:immobility.  The second identifying assumption is that current opportunities to migrate to 
5:96:7224:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the United States depend on regional historical migration patterns.  One reason this may 
5:97:7313:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be   the   case   is   that   migration   networks   are   regionally   organized   and   historically 
5:98:7416:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependent.  Munshi (2003) and Orrenius and Zavodny (2004) are recent contributions to 
5:99:7502:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a large literature that finds that in Mexico access to family or community networks helps 
5:100:7592:27:28:89:327:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migrants enter and succeed in the United States.3 
5:101:7641:28:28:125:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: In   the   estimation,   I   use   migration   rates   in   the   1950s   as   a   reduced-form 
5:102:7737:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determinant  of  current  migration  opportunities.    Since  high  emigration  in  the  past  could 
5:103:7838:27:28:89:521:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have altered regions in a manner that affects current labor-market conditions, a reduced-
5:104:7927:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:form  approach  is  more  appropriate  than  using  past  migration  behavior  as  an  instrument 
5:105:8025:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for current migration.  To control for internal migration,  I use the 1950s emigration rate 
5:106:8117:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  an  individual’s birth  state,  rather  than  his  current  state  of  residence.    Historical 
5:107:8217:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  rates  in  an  individual’s  birth  state  are  thus  meant  to  capture  current  access  to 
5:108:8322:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  networks,  and  so  current  opportunities  to  emigrate,  in  the  Mexican  regional 
5:109:8419:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor market in which an individual is located.  The persistence in regional differences in 
5:110:8511:27:34:89:501:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration behavior (Figure 3) is roughly consistent with my identifying assumptions. 
5:111:8596:34:9:233:236:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
5:112:8644:9:17:89:524:114:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3 An implicit third identifying  assumption is that emigration incentives  for Mexicans  were stronger in the 
5:113:8753:17:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1990s  than  in  previous  decades,  which  in  combination  with  the  second  assumption  would  imply  that  any 
5:114:8869:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:negative  labor  supply  shock  associated  with  emigration  would  be  larger  in  states  with  a  longer  history  of 
5:115:8991:12:0:89:416:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:U.S. migration.  Data presented in section 3 are consistent with this assumption.   
6:116:9076:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The challenges to identifying the regional consequences of emigration in Mexico 
6:117:9156:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  analogous  to  those  in  identifying  the  regional  consequences  of  immigration  in  the 
6:118:9254:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:United  States.    Many  studies  have  found  that  across  U.S.  cities  and  states  immigrant 
6:119:9352:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inflows  are  only  weakly  negatively  correlated  with  wage  changes  for  U.S.  native 
6:120:9443:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers, suggesting that immigration has had little impact on the U.S. wage structure (see 
6:121:9534:27:28:89:527:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:LaLonde  and  Topel,  1997;  Smith  and  Edmonston,  1997;  Borjas,  1999;  Card;  2001).  
6:122:9625:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Borjas,  Freeman,  and  Katz  (1997)  argue  that  cross-area  wage  regressions  of  this  type 
6:123:9722:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:identify  the  wage  impact  of  immigration  only  under  restrictive  assumptions.    The 
6:124:9814:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tendency  for  immigrants  to  settle  in  regions  with  high  wage  growth  makes  estimates  of 
6:125:9913:28:27:89:527:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the immigration wage impact based on cross-area regressions susceptible to upward bias.  
6:126:10002:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  standard  practice  of  using  the  preceding  decade’s  regional  immigrant  stock  to 
6:127:10095:28:28:89:521:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:instrument  for  current  regional  immigrant  inflows  may  not  be  valid  if  regional  labor-
6:128:10192:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market  shocks  persist  over  time.    Borjas  (2003)  examines  age  and  education  cohorts  at 
6:129:10291:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the national level and finds larger wage effects from immigration.  He estimates that over 
6:130:10382:28:27:89:521:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1980-2000 the elasticity of U.S. native wages with respect to immigrant inflows was 0.3-
6:131:10470:27:28:89:478:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0.4 and that immigration contributed to a decrease in U.S. average wages of 3%. 
6:132:10550:28:28:125:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Similar  to  the  cross-area  regression  approach,  I  distinguish  between  Mexican 
6:133:10636:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states based on historical migration behavior.  However, distinct from this approach I am 
6:134:10726:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able  to  use  much  longer  lags  on  regional  migration  rates  and  to  measure  historical 
6:135:10822:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  rates  in  an  individual’s  birth  state.    These  features  help  address  the  concerns 
6:136:10925:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  (i)  regional  labor-market  shocks  may  persist  for  more  than  a  decade,  and  (ii)  an 
6:137:11025:28:0:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual’s  current  state  of  residence  may  be  affected  by  current  regional  migration 
7:138:11123:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates.    The  assumptions  underlying  my  approach  are  thus  perhaps  less  restrictive  than 
7:139:11221:28:28:89:495:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those underlying the standard cross-area approach in literature on U.S. immigration. 
7:140:11306:28:27:125:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: An  obvious  challenge  for  the  estimation  is  that  there  may  be  other,  unobserved 
7:141:11397:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differences  between  high  and  low  migration  states  that  may  affect  current  labor-market 
7:142:11495:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes.    By  examining  regional  differences  in  changes  in  outcomes,  rather  than 
7:143:11587:27:28:89:521:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regional  differences  in  outcome  levels,  I  am  able  to  control  for  time-invariant  region-
7:144:11686:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific  characteristics.    Still,  there  may  have  been  other  shocks  in  the  1990s  that  had 
7:145:11789:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differential effects on regions with high versus low opportunities to migrate to the United 
7:146:11881:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:States.    Candidate  shocks  include  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement,  the 
7:147:11971:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:privation  and  deregulation  of  industry,  the  reform  of  Mexico’s  land-tenure  system,  and 
7:148:12069:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the 1994-1995 peso crisis.4  The potential for these shocks to contaminate the analysis is 
7:149:12160:28:28:89:477:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an important concern, which I address in discussing qualifications to my results. 
7:150:12242:28:27:125:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: In  the  next  section,  I  document  further  how  migration  behavior  varies  across 
7:151:12330:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regions  of  Mexico  and  discuss  the  criterion  I  use  for  selecting  which  Mexican  states  to 
7:152:12432:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:include in my sample.   In section 3,  I describe how changes in labor supply vary  across 
7:153:12523:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high and low-migration states in Mexico and compare mean earnings and the distribution 
7:154:12610:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  earnings  in  high  and  low-migration  states.    In  section  4,  I  use  standard  parametric 
7:155:12711:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:techniques  and  non-parametric  techniques  developed  by  DiNardo,  Fortin,  and  Lemieux

7:157:12896:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changed over time in high and low migration states.  By wage of conclusion in section 5, 
7:158:12985:27:37:89:490:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:I discuss limitations of the estimation strategy and ideas for extending the analysis.

8:166:13558:21:27:89:181:667:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2.1  Data Sources 
8:167:13576:27:28:125:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Data  for  the  analysis  come  from  two  Mexican  sources.    In  1990,  I  use  the  1% 
8:168:13667:28:28:89:525:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:microsample of the XII Censo General de Poblacion y Vivienda, 1990, and in 2000 I use 
8:169:13753:28:27:89:525:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:a 10% random sample of the 10% microsample of the XIII Censo General de Poblacion y 
8:170:13837:27:28:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:Vivienda, 2000.  Unfortunately, the 1990 census contains no information about household 
8:171:13925:28:27:89:524:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration behavior.  The 2000 census includes two questions related to emigration:  (i) 
8:172:14014:27:28:89:524:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whether  anyone  from  the  household  migrated  to  the  United  States  (or  another  foreign 
8:173:14110:28:28:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:country) in the last five years (and the number, age, and gender of these individuals), and 
8:174:14202:28:27:89:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(ii) whether anyone in the household received income in the previous month in the form 
8:175:14289:27:28:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of remittances from migrants located abroad (and the quantity received).  These questions 
8:176:14379:28:27:89:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have  obvious  shortcomings.    They  provide  no  indication  of  the  education  of  migrants, 
8:177:14476:27:28:89:524:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return  or  round-trip  migration,  migration  before  1995,  annual  receipts  of  remittances,  or 
8:178:14577:28:28:89:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transfers from migrants in kind rather than in cash.  Still, the 2000 census is useful in that 
8:179:14672:28:27:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it  is  the  only  nationally  representative  sample  available  for  Mexico  that  contains 
8:180:14766:27:28:89:328:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information about migration to the United States. 
8:181:14816:28:27:125:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: For data on historical migration patterns, I use estimates of state emigration rates 
8:182:14901:27:28:89:524:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from Woodruff and Zenteno (2001).  They calculate the fraction of each Mexican state’s 
8:183:14988:28:28:89:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:population  that  migrated  to  the  United  States  over  1955-59  by  combining  data  on 
8:184:15080:28:27:89:524:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexican  state  populations  with  data  on  annual  U.S.  immigration  of  temporary  legal 
8:185:15173:27:28:89:524:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers  from  each  Mexican  state  under  the  U.S.  Bracero  Program.    The  Bracero 
8:186:15262:28:27:89:524:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Program,  which  lasted  from  1942  to  1965,  allowed  U.S.  employers  to  import  workers 
8:187:15356:27:0:89:524:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from  Mexico  (and  the  Caribbean)  to  fulfill  short-term  labor  contracts.    Most braceros 
9:188:15453:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worked in agriculture (Calavita, 1992).  Woodruff and Zenteno (2001) also provide data 
9:189:15540:28:28:89:449:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on state emigration rates in 1924, which I use in some empirical exercises. 
9:190:15616:28:27:125:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: For the  analysis of earnings,  I  focus on men, since their labor-force participation 
9:191:15703:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates  are  relatively  stable  over  time,  rising  modestly  from  73%  in  1990  to  74%  in  2000 
9:192:15805:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(and  are  quite  similar  in  high  and  low  migration  states).    Labor-force  participation  rates 
9:193:15909:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for women are low and variable over time, rising from 21% in 1990 to 32% in 2000.  For 
9:194:15996:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:women, this creates issues of sample selection associated with who supplies labor outside 
9:195:16086:28:27:89:461:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:the home that complicates examining changes in the distribution of earnings.

9:198:16227:27:28:125:524:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Large  scale  migration  from  Mexico  to  the  United  States  began  in  the  early  20th 
9:199:16318:28:28:89:524:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:century.    The  construction  of  railroads  in  the  late  19th  century  linked  interior  Mexico  to 
9:200:16423:28:27:89:524:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  U.S.-Mexico  border,  which  gave  U.S.  employers  improved  access  to  Mexico  labor 
9:201:16516:27:28:89:524:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Cardoso, 1980).   In the  early 1900s, growers in Texas began to recruit farm laborers in 
9:202:16607:28:27:89:524:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexico.    At  the  time,  the  population  on  the  Texas-Mexico  border  was  small  and 
9:203:16698:27:28:89:524:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dispersed.  To find workers, recruiters followed the main rail line into Mexico, which ran 
9:204:16789:28:28:89:524:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:southwest  through  relatively  densely  populated  states  in  the  west-central  region  of  the 
9:205:16888:28:27:89:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:country.  Early migrants came primarily from nine states in this region (Durand, Massey,

9:207:17067:28:27:89:524:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:after  the  U.S.  Congress  imposed  stringent  quotas  on  U.S.  legal  immigration,  which 
9:208:17160:27:28:89:527:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sharply  reduced  immigration  of  low-skilled  labor  from  southern  and  eastern  Europe.  
9:209:17254:28:38:89:524:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Recruitment  intensified  further  in  the  1940s,  after  Congress  passed  legislation  allowing

9:212:17503:16:0:89:201:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Luis Potosí, and Zacatecas. 
10:213:17532:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large-scale  temporary  legal  immigration  from  Mexico  under  the  Bracero  Program 
10:214:17619:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Calavita, 1992).  From the 1920s to the 1960s, the nine west-central states accounted for 
10:215:17710:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:44.0% to 56.1% of Mexican migration to the United States (but only 27.1% to 31.5% of 
10:216:17795:27:28:89:414:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexico’s total population) (Durand, Massey, and Zenteno, 2001).   
10:217:17861:28:27:125:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: After  working  in  the  United  States,  many  migrants  return  to  Mexico  where  they 
10:218:17951:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:often assist later generations in emigrating.  Migrants remaining in the United States have 
10:219:18043:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:created home-town associations that help members of their communities in Mexico make 
10:220:18128:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  transition  to  living  north  of  the  border  (Cano,  2004).    In  addition  to  home-town 
10:221:18227:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associations, there appear to be many informal networks through which current migrants 
10:222:18314:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:help prospective migrants enter the United States, find housing in U.S. cities, and obtain 
10:223:18405:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jobs with U.S. employers.  These networks are often embedded in relationships involving 
10:224:18493:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:family,  kin,  or  community  of  birth,  which  gives  them  a  strong  regional  component.    Of 
10:225:18593:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:218 home-town associations formed by Mexican immigrants enumerated in 2002 survey 
10:226:18675:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of such organizations in southern California, 86.6% were associated with one of the nine 
10:227:18764:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:west-central states (Cano, 2004).  Networks appear to be important for migrant outcomes 
10:228:18852:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  the  receiving  country.    Munshi  (2003)  finds  that  Mexican  immigrants  in  the  United 
10:229:18950:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:States are more likely to be employed the larger is the U.S. population of residents from 
10:230:19040:28:27:89:521:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their  home  community  in  Mexico  (where  he  instruments  for  the  size  of  the  home-
10:231:19131:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:community  population  using  time-series  data  on  regional  rainfall  in  Mexico).    The 
10:232:19224:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:importance   of   migrant   networks   for   migration   behavior   and   their   strong   regional 
10:233:19324:27:28:89:426:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:character may help explain regional persistence in migration patterns. 
10:234:19395:28:28:125:524:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Figure   3   provides   graphical   evidence   of   persistence   in   regional   migration 
10:235:19487:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:behavior.  The states that had high migration rates in the 1950s, during the height of the 
11:236:19579:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Bracero  Program,  continue  to  be  high  migration  states.    The  correlation  between  state 
11:237:19677:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration  rates  in  the  1995-2000  and  the  1955-59  periods  is  0.73.    The  correlation 
11:238:19774:28:27:89:447:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between state migration rates in the 1995-2000 and 1924 periods is 0.48.   
11:239:19849:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: As  Figure  2  illustrates,  high  migration  states  are  not  those  closest  to  the  United 
11:240:19945:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:States.  Nor does income appear to be the sole determinant of emigration.  Table 2 reports 
11:241:20036:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regressions   of   state   emigration   rates   in   1995-2000   on   income   and   other   state 
11:242:20135:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics.    In  column  1,  there  is  a  negative  correlation  between  state  emigration 
11:243:20235:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates and state per capita GDP, but the explanatory power of income isn’t all that high.  In 
11:244:20328:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:column 2, adding distance to the United States (and distance squared) more than doubles 
11:245:20416:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  R-squared  of  the  regression.    The  relation  between  emigration  and  proximity  to  the 
11:246:20516:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:U.S. is nonlinear, with emigration initially rising with distance (reflecting low emigration 
11:247:20609:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in states on the U.S. border) and then declining with distance (reflecting high emigration 
11:248:20700:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for central states and low emigration for distant southern states).  In column 3, adding the 
11:249:20793:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state  emigration  rate  in  1924  as  an  independent  variable  raises  the  R-squared  of  the 
11:250:20891:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regression from 0.25 to 0.46.  However, there appears to be little covariation between the 
11:251:20982:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1995-2000 and 1924 emigration rates that is independent of the 1950s emigration rate.  In 
11:252:21072:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:column 4, once the 1955-59 emigration rate is added the R-squared  rises further to 0.67 
11:253:21161:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  the  1924  migration  rate  becomes  statistically  insignificant,  reflecting  the  strong 
11:254:21258:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:historical persistence in state emigration patterns.  Columns 5-8 repeat the exercise using 
11:255:21350:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  fraction  of  households  in  2000  receiving  remittances  from  migrants  abroad  as  the 
11:256:21447:27:28:89:284:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependent variable, with similar results. 
11:257:21489:28:28:125:524:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: If states with relatively high emigration rates are also states that are more exposed 
11:258:21575:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  other  aspects  of  globalization,  then  the  empirical  analysis  might  confound  the  effects 
12:259:21679:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of emigration with the effects of trade or capital flows.  During the 1980s and 1990s, the 
12:260:21770:28:28:89:527:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexican  government  lowered  barriers  to  international  trade  and  foreign  investment.  
12:261:21863:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Chiquiar (2004) and Hanson (2004) find that since 1985 Mexican states more engaged in 
12:262:21949:27:28:89:527:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:international  trade  have  enjoyed  faster  growth  in  average  income  and  labor  earnings.  
12:263:22046:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, high emigration states do not appear to have benefited disproportionately from 
12:264:22134:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trade and investment reform.  As expected, trade liberalization has affected states on the 
12:265:22225:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:U.S.-Mexico  border  most  strongly,  and,  as  Figure  2  shows,  border  states  are  not  high 
12:266:22323:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration states.  Most high emigration states appear to have relatively low exposure to 
12:267:22413:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreign trade and investment.  This is seen in Figures 4 and 5, which plot the fraction of 
12:268:22504:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  state  population  migrating  to  the  United  States  over  1995-2000  against  the  share  of 
12:269:22605:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreign  direct  investment  in  state  GDP  and  the  share  of  imports  in  state  GDP.    Table  3 
12:270:22708:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shows  that  across  Mexico  states  in  the  1990s  emigration  rates  are  weakly  negatively 
12:271:22804:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlated  with  exposure  to  trade  and  foreign  investment.    It  appears  high  exposure  to 
12:272:22904:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration  is  not  associated  with  high  exposure  to  globalization.    I  discuss  variation  in 
12:273:23007:28:27:89:376:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state exposure to these and other shocks again in Section 5.

12:275:23068:21:28:89:186:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2.3  Sample Design 
12:276:23087:28:27:125:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  examine  the  regional  labor-market  consequences  of 
12:277:23178:27:28:89:524:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration in Mexico.  One approach would be to utilize data on migration to the United 
12:278:23266:28:27:89:521:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:States in Mexico’s 2000 population census.  Using the 2000 data, I could compare labor-
12:279:23353:27:28:89:524:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market  outcomes  in  households  with  emigrants  to  outcomes  in  households  without 
12:280:23442:28:28:89:524:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigrants.    Or,  combining  the  household  cross-sections  in  1990  and  2000,  I  could 
12:281:23535:28:27:89:524:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examine the covariation between the 1990-2000 change in household outcomes with the 
12:282:23619:27:0:89:524:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1995-2000 state emigration rate.  The obvious concern with either of these approaches is 
13:283:23710:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  household  migration  behavior  is  endogenous.    The  unobserved  characteristics  of 
13:284:23804:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households  that  affect  their  earnings  and  labor  supply  are  also  likely  to  affect  whether 
13:285:23906:28:27:89:316:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households send migrants to the United States. 
13:286:23953:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: One  way  to  address  the  endogeneity  problem  would  be  to  use  historical  state 
13:287:24041:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration  rates  as  an  instrument  for  current  opportunities  to  migrate  abroad.    The 
13:288:24137:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discussion  in  section  2.2  suggests  that  the  1950s  emigration  rate  in  an  individual’s  birth 
13:289:24241:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state would be a good indicator of an individual’s access to migration networks and so of 
13:290:24331:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an individual’s relative opportunity to migrate to the United States.  Using data from the 
13:291:24422:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2000  census,  unreported  probit  regressions  show  that  the  likelihood  a  household  either 
13:292:24520:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has sent  a migrant to the United States in the last five  years or has received remittances 
13:293:24613:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from  abroad  in  the  last  month  is  strongly  positively  correlated  with  the  1955-59 
13:294:24706:28:28:89:340:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration rate in the household head’s birth state.6 
13:295:24759:28:27:125:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: However, historical state emigration rates are unlikely to be a valid instrument for 
13:296:24844:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:current migration rates.  Emigration opportunities in an individual’s birth state may have 
13:297:24935:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affected  an  individual’s  accumulation  of  human  capital,  either  by  influencing  the 
13:298:25027:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual’s  early  employment  prospects  (if  local  emigration  rates  affect  local  wage 
13:299:25122:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:levels)  or  the  quality  of  education  the  individual  received  as  a  youth  (if  remittances  or 
13:300:25226:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:local income levels affect the quality of local schools).  Past emigration opportunities are 
13:301:25319:27:69:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:thus likely to affect current labor-market outcomes both directly, through their impact on

13:303:25458:7:16:89:524:136:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:6  Additional  controls  in  this  regression  are  a  cubic  in  age  of  the  household  head,  dummies  for  the 
13:304:25574:16:12:89:523:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:educational attainment of the household head, the sex of the household head, and dummy variables for the 
13:305:25679:12:11:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:state  of  residence.    Evaluated  at  mean  values  for  the  other  regressors,  individuals  born  in  high-migration 
13:306:25801:11:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:states are 24.3% more likely to have had someone in their household migrate to the United States in the last 
13:307:25910:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:five  years  and  21.7%  more  likely  to  have  received  remittances  from  migrants  located  abroad  in  the  last 
13:308:26029:12:0:89:329:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:month (with both of these effects very precisely estimated). 
14:309:26092:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:current  emigration  opportunities,  and  indirectly,  through  their  impact  on  an  individual’s 
14:310:26192:28:28:89:369:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stock of human capital (which is only partially observed). 
14:311:26251:28:27:125:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Given  these  concerns,  I  take  a  reduced-form  approach  by  comparing  changes  in 
14:312:26339:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cross-section  labor-market  outcomes,  where  I  categorize  individuals  according  to  the 
14:313:26433:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration  rate  in  their  birth  state.    In  so  doing,  I  capture  both  the  direct  and  indirect 
14:314:26540:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects  of  historical  emigration  opportunities  on  current  labor-market  outcomes.    In 
14:315:26635:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presenting  the  empirical  results,  I  will  discuss  whether  the  reduced-form  effect  of 
14:316:26730:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:historical  emigration  rates  on  labor-market  outcomes  is  likely  to  under  or  over-state  the 
14:317:26832:27:28:89:382:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect attributable solely to current emigration opportunities. 
14:318:26896:28:27:125:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: My  empirical  strategy  is  thus  to  compare  labor-market  outcomes  in  regions  that 
14:319:26986:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have been more or less exposed to opportunities to migrate to the United States.  Table 4 
14:320:27076:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:describes the sample of  states.   I  drop the six border states from the sample, since these 
14:321:27170:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states  have  benefited  disproportionately  from  trade  and  investment  liberalization.    Most 
14:322:27269:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:border states had above average emigration rates in the 1950s and including them in the 
14:323:27357:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sample   could   confound   the   effects   of   emigration   with   those   of   other   aspects   of 
14:324:27460:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:globalization.    To  help  isolate  the  effects  of  emigration,  I  limit  high-migration  states  to 
14:325:27565:28:28:89:521:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those  with  emigration  rates  in  the  top  three  deciles  of  non-border  states  and  low-
14:326:27660:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration states to those with emigration rates in the bottom three deciles of non-border 
14:327:27750:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states.    In  2000,  10.4%  of  households  in  the  seven  high-migration  states  had  sent  a 
14:328:27848:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migrant  to  the  United  States  in  the  previous  five  years,  compared  with  only  2.1%  of 
14:329:27946:27:28:89:317:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households in the seven low-migration states.   
14:330:27994:28:28:125:524:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: With  the  exception  of  the  Federal  District,  in  which  part  of  Mexico  City  is 
14:331:28083:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:located,  all  the  low-migration  states  are  in  southern  Mexico.    Per  capita  income  in  the 
15:332:28187:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Federal  District  is  over  three  times  that  in  the  southern  low-migration  states.    And,  as 
15:333:28290:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figures  4  and  5  show,  the  Federal  District  has  much  higher  exposure  to  international 
15:334:28388:28:27:89:521:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trade  than  the  southern  low-migration  states.    There  is  also  heterogeneity  among  high-
15:335:28486:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states.    Jalisco,  in  which  Guadalajara  (the  country’s  second  largest  city)  is 
15:336:28586:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:located, has high relatively high exposure to international trade.  By way of checking the 
15:337:28677:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:robustness of the results, I will perform the analysis with and without individuals born in 
15:338:28769:28:28:89:354:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the Federal District or Jalisco included in the sample.

15:341:28852:28:27:89:394:467:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:3.1  Population Changes in High and Low Migration States 
15:342:28909:27:28:125:524:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The most direct effect of emigration has been to reduce the relative population of 
15:343:28992:28:28:89:524:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:young adults born in high-migration states.  Figures 6 and 7 show cohort sizes based on 
15:344:29080:28:27:89:524:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:age in 2000 for males and females born in high-migration or low-migration states.  In the 
15:345:29170:27:28:89:524:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:absence of measurement error, changes in population size are due to either net migration 
15:346:29259:28:27:89:527:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:abroad or to death.  Cohort sizes decline for all age-sex groups, except 10-19 year olds.7  
15:347:29351:27:28:89:524:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Population  declines  are  largest  for  20-29  year-old  men  (men  born  between  1971  and 
15:348:29445:28:28:89:521:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1980)  from  high-migration  states,  whose  number  declines  by  33.4  log  points.    In  low-
15:349:29542:28:27:89:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states,  the  number  of  20-29  year-old  men  drops  by  only  9.4  log  points,  such 
15:350:29642:27:28:89:524:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  the  relative  decline  of  the  20-29  year-old  male  population  in  high-migration  states 
15:351:29743:28:27:89:524:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over  1990-2000  is  24.0  log  points.    Overall,  the  population  of  20-59  year-old  men 
15:352:29838:27:32:89:488:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:declines by 9.8 log points in high-migration relative to low-migration states.8    
15:353:29920:32:7:233:236:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
15:354:29968:7:17:89:524:125:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:7  One  explanation  for  the  increases  in  cohort  size  for  10-19  year  olds  is  greater  measurement  error  in  the 
15:355:30093:17:7:89:504:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1990 census (in which case Figures 7 and 8 may understate reductions in cohort sizes over the decade). 
15:356:30196:7:15:89:524:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:8  One  might  imagine  that  internal  migration  in  Mexico  could  have  partly  reversed  the  change  in  relative 
15:357:30316:15:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:regional  labor  supplies  due  to  emigration.    The  large  exodus  of  individuals  born  in  high-migration  states 
15:358:30437:12:0:89:523:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:might have given individuals from other states an incentive to move in.  But data on population by state of 
16:359:30547:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Absolute and relative changes in female cohorts are smaller.  The cohort of 20-29 
16:360:30629:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:year-old women declines by 16.8 log points in high-migration states and 2.0 log points in 
16:361:30719:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:low-migration  states.    Overall,  the  population  of  20-59  year-old  women  declines  by  8.4 
16:362:30818:27:28:89:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:log  points  in  high-migration  relative  to  log-migration  states.9    Figure  8  shows  that  as  a 
16:363:30922:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result  of  higher  emigration  rates  for  males,  the  share  of  men  in  the  population  of  20-29 
16:364:31026:27:28:89:521:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:year  olds  from  high-migration  states  falls  from  49%  to  45%  during  the  1990s.    In  low-
16:365:31126:28:28:89:438:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration states the change is more modest, with a drop of 50% to 48%. 
16:366:31197:28:27:125:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: It appears men and women born in high-migration states in Mexico have become 
16:367:31274:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more likely to migrate abroad.  One might also wonder whether they have become more 
16:368:31358:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likely to migrate internally.  Table 5 reports probit regressions using data from 1990 and 
16:369:31449:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2000  on  whether  individuals  born  in  high-migration  or  low-migration  states  have 
16:370:31539:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changed their state of residence since birth.  The regressors are (a) a cubic in age, dummy 
16:371:31631:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables  for  five  categories  of  educational  attainment  (1-5  years,  6-8  years,  9-11  years, 
16:372:31734:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:12-15  years,  16+  years),  a  dummy  variable  for  marital  status,  dummy  variables  for 
16:373:31828:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presence  of  children  in  the  household  (ages  0-5,  6-12,  13-18),  dummy  variables  for  the 
16:374:31928:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state  of  birth,  and  a  dummy  variable  for  2000;  (b)  interactions  between  the  age, 
16:375:32022:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education,   marital   status,   and   children   variables   and   the   year   2000   dummy;   (c) 
16:376:32123:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interactions  between  the  age,  education,  marital  status,  and  children  variables  and  a 
16:377:32220:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dummy variable for whether the individual was born in a high-migration state; and (d) the 
16:378:32310:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interaction between the year 2000 dummy and the dummy for whether an individual was 
16:379:32394:27:23:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:born in a high-migration state.  I report results only for this last variable, which captures 
16:380:32488:23:12:521:524:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                 
16:381:32632:12:11:89:523:122:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:residence  (rather  than  state  of  birth)  suggest  that  this  is  not  the  case.    During  the  1990s,  high-migration 
16:382:32757:11:12:89:523:111:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:states experienced the largest net decrease in resident population, followed by low-migration states.  Border 
16:383:32867:12:7:89:317:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:states had the largest net increase in resident population. 
16:384:32927:7:18:89:524:92:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:9 Dropping  the  Federal  District  and  Jalisco,  the  relative  population  of  20-59  year  olds  in  high-migration 
16:385:33046:18:0:89:375:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:states declines by 9.4 log points for men and 7.3 log points for women.

17:390:33466:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states.    Excluding  the  Federal  District  and  Jalisco  the  estimate  falls  to  1.6%.    Between 
17:391:33569:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1990 and 2000, women from high-migration states become 4.1% more likely to live in a 
17:392:33654:28:28:89:527:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state  different  than  their  birth  state,  relative  to  women  from  low-migration  states.

17:395:33944:28:27:89:441:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states have become more likely to migrate either externally or internally.

17:402:34449:28:28:89:524:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:schooling  in  low-migration  states,  versus  47.7%  in  high-migration  states.    For  women, 
17:403:34546:28:27:89:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these figures are 57.5% and 42.7%, respectively.  These differences, however, depend on 
17:404:34634:27:28:89:524:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including  among  low-migration  sates  the  Federal  District,  which  has  the  most  educated 
17:405:34731:28:27:89:524:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:work  force  in  the  country.    Once  the  Federal  District  and  Jalisco  are  dropped  from  the 
17:406:34833:27:28:89:524:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sample,  educational  attainment  is  relatively  similar  in  the  two  groups  of  states,  with 
17:407:34932:28:28:89:524:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:46.9%  of  men  and  40.1%  of  women  in  the  30-39  age  cohort  having  completed  nine  or 
17:408:35028:28:27:89:524:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more years of education in low-migration states and 45.9% of men and 40.6% of women 
17:409:35112:27:0:89:367:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the 30-39 age cohort doing so in high-migration states. 
18:410:35173:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Despite  comparable  or  higher  education  levels  in  low-migration  states,  wages 
18:411:35259:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appear to be higher in high-migration states.  Table 7 shows average hourly wages by age 
18:412:35348:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and schooling cohort in 1990 and 2000.10  For the full sample of states, wages are higher 
18:413:35438:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in high-migration states for most cohorts in 1990 and for all cohorts in 2000.  In 1990, for 
18:414:35531:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:men  with  6-8  years  of  education,  which  spans  mean  schooling  levels  in  either  year, 
18:415:35627:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average  hourly  wages  are  $0.06  to  $0.44  higher  in  high-migration  states,  depending  on 
18:416:35725:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the age cohort (based on age in 2000).  In 2000, these wage differentials widen to $0.25 
18:417:35814:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  $0.74.      Wages  in  high-migration  states  increase  relative  to  wages  in  low-migration 
18:418:35914:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states  in  15  of  the  18  age-schooling  cohorts.    Dropping  the  Federal  District  and  Jalisco, 
18:419:36018:28:27:89:459:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages remain higher in high-migration states in most cohorts for both years. 
18:420:36095:27:28:125:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Figure  9,  which  shows  kernel  densities  for  log  average  hourly  wages,  gives 
18:421:36181:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:another  perspective  on  wages  in  high  and  low-migration  states.    In  1990,  wages  have 
18:422:36278:28:27:89:521:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower  dispersion  and  a  higher  mean  in  high-migration  states  when  compared  to  low-
18:423:36371:27:28:89:521:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states.    In  2000,  these  features  are  more  pronounced.    Relative  to  high-
18:424:36466:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states,  wages  in  low-migration  states  show  an  increase  in  relative  dispersion 
18:425:36565:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  in  relative  mass  in  the  lower  tail.    In  Figure  10,  which  shows  wage  densities 
18:426:36662:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:excluding  the  Federal  District  and  Jalisco,  the  relative  rightward  shift  in  the  wage 
18:427:36759:28:27:89:319:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution for high-migration is more evident. 
18:428:36808:27:28:125:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Both in terms of average wages and wage densities, it appears that unconditional 
18:429:36889:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages in high-migration states are higher than those in low-migration states and that this 
18:430:36980:27:30:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differential increases over the 1990s.  This is seen clearly in Figure 11, which shows the 
18:431:37071:30:7:233:236:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
18:432:37119:7:15:89:524:120:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:10  Average  hourly  wages  are  calculated  as  monthly  labor  income/(4.5*hours  worked  last  week).    I  need  to  assume 
18:433:37247:15:11:89:523:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:individuals  work  all  weeks  of  a  month,  which  could  bias  wage  estimates  downwards.    To  avoid  measurement  error 
18:434:37374:11:10:89:523:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:associated with implausibly low wage values or with top coding of earnings, I restrict the sample to be individuals with 
18:435:37495:10:10:89:523:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:hourly wages between $0.05 and $20 in Mexico (in 2000 U.S. dollars).  This restriction is nearly identical to dropping 
18:436:37614:10:0:89:255:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the largest and smallest 0.5% of wage values. 
19:437:37662:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:double difference in wage densities for high-migration and low-migration states (i.e., the 
19:438:37753:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2000 difference in wage densities for high-migration and low-migration states minus the 
19:439:37841:28:27:89:521:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1990  difference  in  wage  densities).    Relative  to  low-migration  states,  over  time  high-
19:440:37939:27:28:89:452:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration states gain mass in the upper half of the wage distribution.

19:442:38010:21:27:89:286:577:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:4.  Decomposing Changes in Earnings 
19:443:38046:27:28:125:524:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: During  the  1990s,  the  earnings  gap  appeared  to  increase  between  men  born  in 
19:444:38134:28:27:89:524:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high-migration states and men born in low-migration states.  At face value, this change is 
19:445:38225:27:28:89:521:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:difficult  to  interpret.    It  is  possible  that  the  large  exodus  of  individuals  from  high-
19:446:38326:28:27:89:524:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  may  have  increased  the  wages  of  non-migrating  individuals  from  these 
19:447:38423:27:28:89:524:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states relative to wages for non-migrating individuals from low-migration states.  In this 
19:448:38514:28:28:89:524:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:case,  the  national  wage  changes  associated  with  emigration  reported  by  Mishra  (2004) 
19:449:38610:28:27:89:298:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would also be evident at the regional level. 
19:450:38655:27:28:125:527:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: However,  other  interpretations  of  the  observed  wage  changes  are  plausible.  
19:451:38740:28:27:89:524:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Borjas  (1987)  suggests  that  in  countries  with  high  skill  premia  and  high  earnings 
19:452:38834:27:28:89:524:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inequality,  such  as  Mexico,  the  less-skilled  are  likely  to  have  the  highest  propensity  to 
19:453:38937:28:28:89:527:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migrate to  countries with low skill premia and low earnings inequality, such as the U.S.  
19:454:39028:28:27:89:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Mexico, if low-skill, low-wage individuals are more likely to migrate abroad (migrants 
19:455:39118:27:28:89:524:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are negatively selected in terms of skill), the apparent increase in wages in high-migration 
19:456:39211:28:27:89:386:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states may be due partly to shifts in labor-force composition.  
19:457:39275:27:28:125:524:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: To  describe  wages  changes  in  high-migration  and  low-migration  states  more 
19:458:39358:28:28:89:524:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:thoroughly,  I  apply  non-parametric  techniques  for  constructing  counterfactual  wage 
19:459:39449:28:27:89:524:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:densities developed by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996) and Leibbrandt, Levinsohn, 
19:460:39535:27:0:89:524:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  McCrary  (2004).    In  the  first  exercise,  I  compare  the  1990-2000  change  in  the 
20:461:39633:0:28:89:525:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:distribution  of  earnings  between  high-migration  and  low-migration  states, holding  the 
20:462:39727:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:returns to observable characteristics constant.  By fixing the returns to characteristics but 
20:463:39821:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allowing the distribution of characteristics to vary over time and across regions, I isolate 
20:464:39914:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:how  regional  differences  in  the  composition  of  the  labor  force  have  changed.    This  will 
20:465:40016:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:help  reveal  whether  it  is  low-wage  or  high-wage  individuals  from  high-migration  states 
20:466:40114:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who are more likely to migrate abroad.  In the second exercise, I compare the 1990-2000 
20:467:40202:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change  in  the  distribution  of  earnings  between  high-migration  and  low-migration  states, 
20:468:40300:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:holding the distribution of individual characteristics constant.  By fixing the distribution 
20:469:40393:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  characteristics,  but  allowing  the  returns  to  characteristics  to  vary,  I  examine  whether 
20:470:40496:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-migrating  individuals  in  high-migration  states  have  enjoyed  wage  gains  relative  to 
20:471:40593:27:28:89:342:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-migrating individuals in low-migration states.11 
20:472:40645:28:28:125:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: It  is  important  to  recognize  that  neither  non-parametric  exercise  I  perform 
20:473:40731:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amounts  to  a  truly  valid  counterfactual.    This  is  because  emigration  is  likely  to  have 
20:474:40832:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changed   both   the   distribution   of   worker   characteristics and   the   returns   to   these 
20:475:40933:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics.  By looking at each change in isolation, the counterfactual  differences in 
20:476:41026:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage  densities  I  construct  represent  only partial  decompositions  of  the  change  in  the 
20:477:41123:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage  distribution.12    Nevertheless,  the  non-parametric  analysis  will  be  helpful  for 
20:478:41217:28:27:89:334:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assessing the plausibility of the parametric results. 
20:479:41271:27:28:125:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Following  the  non-parametric  estimation,  I  consider  a  parametric  regression  of 
20:480:41359:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differential  wage  changes  in  high-migration  and  low-migration  states  on  differential 
20:481:41453:27:25:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration opportunities (as summarized by historical emigration rates).  The parametric

20:483:41590:7:17:89:524:125:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:11 DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux is not the only approach to non-parametrically decompose changes in wage 
20:484:41694:17:7:89:513:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:distributions.  See Machado and Mata (2005) (and Autor and Katz, 2004) for an alternative methodology. 
20:485:41797:7:15:89:524:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:12 A complete decomposition  would separate  wage changes into components due to changes in returns for 
20:486:41901:15:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:given characteristics, changes in characteristics for given returns, and the interaction of changes in returns 
20:487:42012:12:0:89:485:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and changes in characteristics.  The non-parametric analysis in effect ignores the third component. 
21:488:42114:0:28:89:521:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:approach  will  provide  an  estimate  of  the  differential  in  wage  growth  between  high-
21:489:42208:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration and low-migration states that is associated with emigration.  There are several 
21:490:42298:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reasons  why  we  might  be  reluctant  to  assign  a  causal  interpretation  to  the  parametric 
21:491:42397:27:28:89:330:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results, which I discuss in the concluding section. 
21:492:42449:28:27:125:527:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Finally, the analysis doesn’t address changes in the distribution of unobservables.  
21:493:42534:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If,   holding   observed   characteristics   constant,   Mexican   emigrants   have   low   (high)

21:495:42731:28:27:89:463:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:extent to which migrants are negatively (positively) selected in terms of skill.

21:508:43714:28:28:89:519:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examines how regional differences in these two sets of densities changed over the 1990s. 
21:509:43803:28:27:125:527:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: In the first exercise, I compare the composition of the labor force across regions.  
21:510:43888:27:0:89:524:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:I  ask  how  the  difference  in  earnings  densities  between  high  and  low-migration  states

25:653:49363:91:28:89:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each weighting function in (14) is the product of odds ratios.  In the first weight, the first 
25:654:49458:28:28:89:524:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ratio is the odds an individual is from a low-migration state in 2000 (based on a sample of 
25:655:49550:28:27:89:524:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individuals  from  low-migration  states  in  1990  and  2000),  conditional  on  observables,  x,

25:658:49845:27:28:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two logit models.  In each case, the regressand is a 0-1 variable on the outcome i=L and 
25:659:49934:28:28:89:524:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:t=00 (based on a sample of (i=L, t=00) and (i=L, t=90)).  For the first logit, the regressors 
25:660:50028:28:27:89:524:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  x  and  w;  for  the  second,  the  regressor  is  x,  alone.    Other  weights  can  be  estimated 
25:661:50133:27:28:89:450:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analogously.  After constructing the weights, I estimate (8), (12), and (13).

25:664:50238:27:28:125:524:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: To  evaluate  the  association  between  emigration  and  earnings  parametrically,  I 
25:665:50325:28:27:89:524:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pool  data  on  working  age  men  in  1990  and  2000  from  high-migration  or  low-migration 
25:666:50421:27:0:89:450:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states and estimate the following difference-in-difference wage regression,

26:669:50563:28:27:89:524:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where w is average hourly earnings, X is a vector of observed characteristics, Y2000 is a 
26:670:50653:27:28:89:524:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dummy  variable  for  the  year  2000,  and  High  is  a  dummy  variable  for  whether  an 
26:671:50745:28:28:89:521:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual was born in a high-migration state.  The regression includes controls for state-
26:672:50836:28:27:89:524:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of-birth  fixed  effects  and  allows  returns  to  observable  characteristics  to  vary  across 
26:673:50934:27:28:89:525:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regions and time.  The coefficient, -, captures the mean differential 1990-to-2000 change 
26:674:51024:28:27:89:346:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in earnings between high and low-migration states.13 
26:675:51076:27:28:125:524:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: One important estimation issue is that shocks other than emigration may have had 
26:676:51157:28:28:89:524:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differential  impacts  on  high  and  low-migration  states.    I’ve  already  discussed  the  shock 
26:677:51258:28:27:89:524:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated with NAFTA and other aspects of trade liberalization.  Another shock was the 
26:678:51346:27:28:89:524:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:peso  crisis  of  1995.    After  a  bungled  devaluation  of  the  peso  in  1994,  Mexico  chose  to 
26:679:51449:28:27:89:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:float  its  currency,  which  proceeded  to  plummet  in  value  relative  to  the  dollar.    The 
26:680:51548:27:28:89:524:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ensuing  increase  in  the  peso  value  of  dollar-denominated  liabilities  contributed  to  a 
26:681:51645:28:28:89:524:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banking  collapse  and  a  severe  economic  contraction.    Low-migration  states  (excluding 
26:682:51740:28:27:89:524:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexico City) are modestly less industrialized than high-migration states and so may have 
26:683:51829:27:28:89:524:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been less hurt by the credit crunch.  Also, low-migration states tend to have larger tourist 
26:684:51922:28:27:89:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries,  which  may  have  benefited  from  the  devaluation.    Other  shocks  in  the  1990’s 
26:685:52022:27:28:89:521:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:included  a  reform  of  Mexico’s  land  tenure  system  in  1992,  the  privatization  of  state-
26:686:52120:28:48:89:524:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:owned  enterprises,  and  industry  deregulation.    The  existence  of  these  shocks  leaves  the 
26:687:52220:48:7:233:236:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
26:688:52268:7:17:89:524:125:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:13  Equation  (15)  is  a  standard  difference-in-difference  specification,  which  implies  I  estimate  the  mean 
26:689:52386:17:11:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:differential in  wage growth between  high and low-migration states.  This approach ignores the possibility 
26:690:52494:11:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that  the  wage  effect  of  being  in  a  high-migration  state  may  not  be  uniform  throughout  the  wage 
26:691:52605:11:12:89:521:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:distribution.  A more elegant approach would be to estimate the regional differential in wage changes non-
26:692:52711:12:0:89:386:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:parametrically, as in the framework derived by Athey and Imbens (2003). 
27:693:52785:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results  subject  to  the  caveat  that  factors  other  than  emigration  may  have  contributed  to 
27:694:52887:28:28:89:451:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differential regional changes in earnings.  I return to this issue in section 5.

27:697:52990:28:27:125:524:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The sample for the analysis is the cohort of Mexican men aged 20 to 49 years in 
27:698:53070:27:28:89:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1990 or 30 to 59 years in 2000 who were born in one of the seven high-migration states 
27:699:53157:28:28:89:524:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or one of the seven low-migration states.  By restricting the analysis to a single cohort, I 
27:700:53250:28:27:89:524:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:limit  possible  contamination  of  the  sample  associated  with  more-educated  younger 
27:701:53340:27:28:89:527:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers entering the labor force and less-educated older workers exiting the labor force.  
27:702:53431:28:27:89:448:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The dependent variable is log average hourly labor earnings (see note 10). 
27:703:53506:27:28:125:524:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 12 shows kernel density estimates for the density differences in equations 
27:704:53588:28:28:89:524:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2)  and  (5),  which  characterize  the  difference  in  earning  distributions  between  high  and 
27:705:53689:28:27:89:524:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:low-migration  states  holding  constant  the  return  to  observable  characteristics.    In  1990 
27:706:53789:27:28:89:524:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  2000,  the  density  difference  has  negative  mass  above  the  mean  and  positive  mass 
27:707:53886:28:27:89:524:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below the sample mean (where the mean over the entire sample of states is normalized to 
27:708:53974:27:28:89:524:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:zero).  This implies that  in either  year there  are relatively  few men from  high-migration 
27:709:54069:28:28:89:524:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states  with  above-average  earnings  and  relatively  many  men  from  high-migration  states 
27:710:54165:28:27:89:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  below-average  earnings.    Whatever  the  source  of  this  initial  difference,  it  becomes 
27:711:54266:27:28:89:524:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:modestly  more  pronounced  during  the  1990s.    Between  1990  and  2000,  the  density 
27:712:54357:28:27:89:521:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:difference loses mass above the mean and gains mass below the mean.  Compared to low-
27:713:54442:27:28:89:524:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states,  it  appears  that  men  with  above-average  earnings  from  high-migration 
27:714:54538:28:28:89:339:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states disappear from the sample in larger numbers. 
27:715:54590:28:27:125:524:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The change in the composition of the labor force is perhaps seen more clearly in

28:717:54772:0:28:89:527:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between  high-migration  and  low-migration  states  (for  constant  returns  to  observables).  
28:718:54869:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This  (partial)  double  difference  shows  negative  mass  above  the  mean  and  positive  mass 
28:719:54967:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below the mean, indicating that over time the relative scarcity of high-wage workers has 
28:720:55056:27:28:89:416:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increased in high-migration states relative to low-migration states.   
28:721:55127:28:27:125:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Comparing units on the vertical axes in Figures 11 and 13, it is apparent that the 
28:722:55210:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:counterfactual  double  difference  in  wage  densities  is  small,  but  it  is  still  informative 
28:723:55311:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about the nature of migrant selection on observables.  Figure 7 shows that between 1990 
28:724:55399:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 2000 there was a relatively large loss in the population of working-age men born in 
28:725:55487:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high-migration  states,  which  is  consistent  with  individuals  from  high-migration  states 
28:726:55583:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:having a relatively high propensity to migrate abroad.  What Figures 12 and 13 suggest is 
28:727:55673:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  the  men  most  likely  to  migrate  abroad  are  those  in  the  top  half  of  the  earnings 
28:728:55774:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution.  This finding is inconsistent with negative selection of emigrants in terms of 
28:729:55867:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observable skills and suggests that emigrants exhibit intermediate or positive selection in 
28:730:55959:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terms  of  observable  skills.    Using  data  from  Mexican  and  U.S.  population  censuses, 
28:731:56054:28:27:89:457:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) also find evidence against negative selection.14 
28:732:56129:27:28:125:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One  might  also  be  concerned  that  including  the  relatively  rich  and  globalized 
28:733:56218:28:28:89:527:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regions of the Federal District and Jalisco in the sample of birth states affects the results.  
28:734:56314:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  Figure  14,  I  show  the  double  difference  in  counterfactual  wage  densities  reported  in 
28:735:56415:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 13 (with returns to observables fixed at those for low-migration states in 1990) for 
28:736:56507:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  sample  that  excludes  the  two  states.    Comparing  Figures  13  and  14  shows  that  results 
28:737:56609:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  similar  with  or  without  these  states  in  the  sample.    The  results  are  also  robust  to 
28:738:56713:28:31:89:348:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dropping any one of the other states from the sample. 
28:739:56767:31:8:233:236:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
28:740:56815:8:16:89:524:90:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:14 Results are similar if I evaluate change in earnings densities between high-migration and low-migration 
28:741:56922:16:0:89:480:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:states for returns to observables fixed at those for high (rather than low) migration states in 1990. 
29:742:57026:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Over time, it appears that men born in high-migration states are emigrating from 
29:743:57107:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mexico  in  relatively  large  numbers  and  that  the  emigrants  include  a  disproportionately 
29:744:57205:28:27:89:521:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large  number  of  individuals  with  relatively  high  earnings  potential.    In  a  simple  labor-
29:745:57306:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supply,  labor-demand  framework,  a  decrease  in  the  relative  supply  of  more-skilled 
29:746:57398:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers  in  high-migration  states  would  put  upward  pressure  on  relative  wages  in  these 
29:747:57496:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states (as long as labor was not perfectly mobile between regions of Mexico).  Next, we 
29:748:57584:28:28:89:466:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examine how relative regional returns to observables have changed over time. 
29:749:57661:28:27:125:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure  15  shows  kernel  density  estimates  for  the  density  differences  in  (8)  and 
29:750:57753:27:28:89:521:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(12),  which  characterize  the  difference  in  earning  distributions  between  high  and  low-
29:751:57850:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  holding  constant  the  distribution  of  observable  characteristics.    In  1990 
29:752:57952:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  2000,  the  density  difference  has  positive  mass  above  the  mean  and  negative  mass 
29:753:58049:28:28:89:521:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below  the  mean.    In  either  year,  returns  to  observables  appear  to  be  higher  in  high-
29:754:58148:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  relative  to  low-migration  states.    Although  one  cannot  identify  from 
29:755:58245:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 15 the source of the initial difference in relative regional earnings, relatively high 
29:756:58339:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns  to  observables  in  high-migration  states  is  consistent  with  the  relative  scarcity  of 
29:757:58443:27:28:89:410:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high-wage workers in high-migration states evident in Figure 12.   
29:758:58510:28:28:125:521:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Over  time,  the  difference  in  returns  to  observables  between  high  and  low-
29:759:58594:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  appears  to  have  become  more  pronounced.    Figure  15  shows  that  from 
29:760:58691:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1990 to 2000 the difference in wage densities between high-migration and low-migration 
29:761:58778:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states  gains  mass  above  the  mean  and  loses  mass  below  the  mean.    This  is  seen  more 
29:762:58877:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clearly in Figure 16, which shows the 1990-to-2000 change in the difference in earnings 
29:763:58965:28:28:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:densities   between   high-migration   and   low-migration   states,   holding   constant   the 
29:764:59061:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution of observables.  This double difference shows positive mass above the mean 
30:765:59151:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and negative mass below the mean, indicating that during the 1990’s the wage premium 
30:766:59236:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for above-average wage  earners increased for men born in high-migration states relative 
30:767:59325:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  men  born  in  low-migration  states.    Though  the  partial  double  difference  in  wage 
30:768:59421:27:28:89:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:densities  is  again  small  (compare  to  Figure  11),15  the  increase  in  the  relative  wage  for 
30:769:59524:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:men born in high-migration states evident in Figure 17 is consistent with the decrease in 
30:770:59614:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  relative  supply  of  men  born  in  high-migration  states  evident  in  Figure  13.    In 
30:771:59711:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unreported density estimates, I obtain similar results when I drop men born in the Federal 
30:772:59802:28:27:89:261:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:District or Jalisco from the sample. 
30:773:59839:27:28:125:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The  non-parametric  results  suggest  there  has  been  an  increase  in  relative  wages 
30:774:59930:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  men  born  in  high-migration  states  in  Mexico.    To  evaluate  the  change  in  regional 
30:775:60029:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative  wages  parametrically,  Table  8  shows  estimation  results  for  equation  (15).    The 
30:776:60129:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependent variable is log  average hourly earnings.  The  regressors are dummy variables 
30:777:60218:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for educational attainment, a quadratic in age, a dummy variable for the year 2000 and its 
30:778:60309:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interaction with the age and education variables, a dummy variable for having been born 
30:779:60397:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in a high-migration state and its interaction with the age and education variables, dummy 
30:780:60487:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables for birth state, and the interaction of the year 2000 and high-migration dummy 
30:781:60576:28:28:89:521:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables.    This  last  variable  captures  the  differential  change  in  wage  growth  in  high-
30:782:60676:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  relative  to  low-migration  states.    Standard  errors  are  adjusted  for 
30:783:60772:27:28:89:416:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlation across observations associated with the same birth state. 
30:784:60842:28:27:125:521:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Panel (a) of Table 8 shows that during the 1990’s the cohort of men born in high-
30:785:60923:27:25:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  enjoyed  labor  earnings  growth  that  was  6.3  log  points  higher  than 
30:786:61018:25:7:233:236:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
30:787:61066:7:17:89:524:125:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:15 Since both counterfactual double differences in densities are small, it appears that the interaction between 
30:788:61178:17:11:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:changes  in  worker  characteristics  and  changes  in  returns  to  characteristics  accounts  for  a  large  portion  of 
30:789:61301:11:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the total change in regional relative wages.  However, the double differences in wage densities still appear 
30:790:61410:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to be informative about the direction of these changes.  Relative regional wage changes appear to be larger 
30:791:61518:12:0:89:314:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:where relative regional labor-supply changes are larger. 
31:792:61577:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:earnings  growth  for  individuals  born  in  low-migration  states.    These  coefficients  are 
31:793:61674:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:precisely  estimated.    This  is  consistent  with  the  non-parametric  estimates  and  again 
31:794:61770:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggests that men born in high-migration states enjoyed higher  growth in labor earnings 
31:795:61859:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than men born in low-migration states.  The second two columns of Table 8 show results 
31:796:61946:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where  the  year2000/high-migration  interaction  is  interacted  with  an  indicator  for  an 
31:797:62041:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual  having  9  to  15  years  of  education  (roughly,  workers  with  above  mean 
31:798:62132:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:schooling  years  but  with  less  than  a  college  education).    This  term  allows  relative 
31:799:62229:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:earnings growth to be larger for more-educated workers.  The education interaction term 
31:800:62317:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  positive,  consistent  with  Figure  17  (while  the  variable  appears  imprecisely  estimated 
31:801:62417:28:27:89:467:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the two reported interaction terms are jointly highly statistically significant).16 
31:802:62500:27:28:125:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Panel (b) of Table 8 redoes the estimation, dropping observations for the Federal 
31:803:62582:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:District  and  Jalisco.    Estimated  relative  wage  growth  for  high-migration  states  is  higher 
31:804:62684:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  this  sample,  with  men  born  in  high-migration  states  enjoying  labor  earnings  growth 
31:805:62783:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:8.6 to 8.9 log points higher than for men born in low-migration states.  In the second two 
31:806:62874:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:columns, the interaction between the year2000/high-migration interaction and the dummy 
31:807:62961:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variable for secondary education is again positive (and the two interaction terms are again 
31:808:63053:28:28:89:275:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jointly highly statistically significant). 
31:809:63096:28:27:125:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Since  emigration  rates  are  highest  for  individuals  in  their  twenties,  one  might 
31:810:63187:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expect  that  wage  changes  between  high-migration  and  low-migration  states  would  have 
31:811:63281:28:27:89:525:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been largest for men who are more educated and young.  In unreported results, I included 
31:812:63370:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:additional interactions between the year 2000 dummy, secondary education, and age, but 
31:813:63457:28:43:89:386:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these proved to be imprecisely estimated in most regressions. 
31:814:63519:43:7:233:236:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
31:815:63567:7:0:89:485:79:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:16 Introducing interaction terms for more disaggregated schooling categories yields similar results. 
32:816:63670:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3: Based  on  the  coefficient  estimates,  it  is  possible  to  construct  an  elasticity  of  the 
32:817:63768:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative  wage  for  high-migration  and  low-migration  states  with  respect  to  the  relative 
32:818:63866:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor  supply  in  high-migration  and  low-migration  states.    From  Figure  6,  the  supply  of 
32:819:63966:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:working-age men in high-migration states fell by 9.8 log points relative to the supply of 
32:820:64056:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:working-age  men  in  the  same  cohort  in  low-migration  states.    This  implies  a  wage 
32:821:64150:27:28:89:527:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:elasticity of 0.64.  Excluding the Federal District and Jalisco the wage elasticity is 0.91.  
32:822:64244:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Either elasticity is larger than the value of 0.4 that Mishra (2004) estimates using data on 
32:823:64337:28:27:89:527:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes  in  wages  and  labor  supply  for  age-schooling  cohorts  at  the  national  level.  
32:824:64433:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Recall,  however,  that  my  estimates  are  reduced  form.    They  include  the  direct  effect  of 
32:825:64535:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration  on  wages  (through  changes  in  the  labor  supply),  and  any  indirect  effect 
32:826:64630:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated   with   differential   labor-demand   growth   in   high-migration   states   that   is 
32:827:64730:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated  with  historical  emigration  patterns.    Comparing  my  results  to  Mishra’s 
32:828:64822:28:27:89:466:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggests that the indirect effects of emigration on regional wages are positive.

32:830:64903:21:27:89:161:329:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:5.  Discussion 
32:831:64918:27:28:125:524:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3: In this paper, I examine how emigration may have affected regional labor supply 
32:832:64998:28:28:89:524:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  regional  earnings  in  Mexico.    Mexico  has  a  long  history  of  sending  migrants  to  the 
32:833:65100:28:27:89:524:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:United States.  Since the early 1900s, emigration rates have varied widely across regions 
32:834:65190:27:28:89:524:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the country, with individuals from west-central states having the highest propensity to 
32:835:65281:28:27:89:524:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migrate  abroad.    I  exploit  regional  persistence  in  emigration  behavior  by  focusing  the 
32:836:65380:27:28:89:521:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analysis  on  individuals  born  in  states  with  a  history  of  either  high-migration  or  low-
32:837:65479:28:28:89:486:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration to the United States, as measured by state emigration rates in the 1950s. 
32:838:65563:28:27:125:521:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: As  in  earlier  decades,  during  the  1990s  individuals  born  in  Mexico’s  high-
32:839:65648:27:0:89:527:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states  appeared  to  have  a  relatively  high  propensity  to  migrate  abroad.  
33:840:65744:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Between  1990  and  2000,  the  population  of  20-59  year-old  men  born  in  high-migration 
33:841:65839:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states  declined  by  10  log  points  relative  to  similarly  aged  men  born  in  low-migration 
33:842:65938:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states.    For  women,  the  corresponding  relative  regional  change  in  population  was  8  log 
33:843:66038:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:points.      The   relatively   large   exodus   of   individuals   from   high-migration   states   is 
33:844:66142:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:concentrated  among  individuals  with  above-average  earnings  potential.    This  suggests 
33:845:66236:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  in  terms  of  observable  skills  emigrants  are  positively  selected.    Controlling  for 
33:846:66335:28:28:89:521:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observables,  wages  in  high-migration  states  rose  relative  to  low-migration  states  by  6-
33:847:66433:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:9%.  This implies an elasticity of wages with respect to the labor supply of 0.7-0.8.  This 
33:848:66525:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change reflects both the direct effects of emigration on the labor supply and any indirect 
33:849:66616:28:27:89:443:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects of historical emigration patterns on current regional wage growth. 
33:850:66691:27:28:125:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: There are several possible interpretations of these results.  One is that emigration 
33:851:66776:28:28:89:521:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:raises wages in Mexico, with the effects being most pronounced in states that have well-
33:852:66864:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:developed  networks  for  sending  migrants  to  the  United  States.    This  interpretation  is 
33:853:66962:27:28:89:487:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consistent with the findings in Munshi (2003), Hanson (2004), and Mishra (2004). 
33:854:67043:28:27:125:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: However,  emigration  was  by  no  means  the  only  shock  to  the  Mexican  economy 
33:855:67129:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:during  the  1990’s.    Other  shocks  may  have  also  contributed  to  changes  in  regional 
33:856:67224:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative  wages.    A  large  literature  documents  how  NAFTA  and  other  aspects  of 
33:857:67313:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:globalization  appear  to  have  increased  regional  wage  differentials  in  Mexico.    It  is  not 
33:858:67415:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clear  how  globalization  interacts  with  emigration.    States  more  exposed  to  globalization 
33:859:67515:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appear to have lower migration rates to the United States, suggesting that emigration and 
33:860:67605:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:globalization  may  be  complementary  mechanisms  for  integrating  Mexico  into  the  North 
33:861:67699:28:28:89:527:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:American  labor  market.  Another  important  shock  was  the  Mexican  peso  crisis  in  1995.  
33:862:67796:28:0:89:521:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This  may  have  hurt  high-migration  states  more  than  low-migration  states  (since  high-
34:863:67893:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration states have larger industrial bases and smaller tourist industries), suggesting my 
34:864:67986:28:28:89:443:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates may understate the true effect of emigration on regional wages. 
34:865:68060:28:27:125:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Other  policy  changes,  such  as  the  privatization  and  deregulation  of  Mexican 
34:866:68146:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industry  or  the  reform  of  Mexico’s  land-tenure  system,  may  also  have  had  differential 
34:867:68244:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regional impacts.  Privatization and deregulation appeared to lower union wage premiums 
34:868:68332:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in these sectors (Fairris, 2003).  Since more heavily unionized industries are concentrated 
34:869:68424:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  Mexico’s  north  and  center  and  relatively  absent  in  Mexico’s  south  (Chiquiar,  2003), 
34:870:68523:28:27:89:521:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  might  expect  a  loss  in  union  power  to  lower  relative  wages  in  Mexico’s  high-
34:871:68616:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration  states,  in  which  case  my  results  would  tend  to  understate  the  true  effect  of 
34:872:68717:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emigration.  The reform  of Mexico’s land-tenure  system allowed the sale  of agricultural 
34:873:68808:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:land  that  had  previously  been  held  in  cooperative  ownership.    We  might  expect  this 
34:874:68904:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change  to  have  raised  relative  incomes  in  southern  Mexico,  which  specializes  in 
34:875:68995:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agriculture.    Since  low-migration  states  are  concentrated  in  southern  Mexico,  this  is 
34:876:69092:27:28:89:468:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:another reason my results may tend to understate the true effect of emigration. 
34:877:69172:28:27:125:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  brief  review  of  Mexico’s  other  policy  reforms  during  the  1990’s  does  not 
34:878:69259:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggest any obvious reason why they should account for the observed increase in relative 
34:879:69348:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:earnings  in  high-migration  states.    Still,  in  an  environment  where  multiple  shocks  have 
34:880:69448:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affected  Mexico’s  labor  market  it  is  important  to  be  cautious  about  ascribing  shifts  in 
34:881:69549:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative  regional  earnings  to  any  specific  event.    In  the  end,  we  can  only  say  that  I  find 
34:882:69657:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggestive evidence that emigration has increased relative earnings in Mexican states that 
34:883:69748:27:0:89:386:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have stronger migration networks vis-à-vis the United States.
