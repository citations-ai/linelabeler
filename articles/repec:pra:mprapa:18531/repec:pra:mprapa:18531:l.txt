2:22:599:13:13:106:481:524:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:between firms and universities. Universities have become increasingly involved in 
2:23:681:13:13:106:519:511:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:technology transfer by establishing offices of technology transfer, business incubators, and 
2:24:774:13:13:106:520:498:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:technology parks. This paper presents some aspects of technology transfer centers, specific

2:30:1009:13:13:139:525:418:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:In  a  knowledge  economy,  knowledge  becomes  the  most  important  resource,  
2:31:1090:13:13:106:524:405:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:traditional  factors  as:  land,  capital  and  work  do  not  disappear  but  become  secondary  
2:32:1188:13:13:106:523:392:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:factors. The knowledge becomes the only really relevant intangible asset. The innovations’ 
2:33:1279:13:13:106:524:379:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:diffusion  and  the  high  technologies’  convergence  will  play  a  key  role  in  the  knowledge  
2:34:1380:13:13:106:346:366:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:importance acceleration in the globalization context. 
2:35:1434:13:13:130:523:353:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:The  most  developed  countries  from  the  world  invest  an  important  part  of  their  GDP  
2:36:1530:13:13:106:524:340:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:into  research.  For  example,  the  United  States  invests  2.5%  in  research,  and  Japan  more  
2:37:1631:13:13:106:525:327:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:than  3%.  The  EU  wants  to  invest  3%  of  GDP  in  research  (  Lisabona  obiectiv).  For  
2:38:1727:13:13:106:524:314:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:example,  the  7th  Research  Framework  Programme  2007-2013  developed  by  the  EU  has  
2:39:1819:13:13:106:526:301:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:the  biggest  budget  an  amount  of  67.8  billion  EUR  and  four  specific  programmes:  
2:40:1911:13:13:106:302:288:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:Cooperation, Ideas, People and Capacities. 
2:41:1954:13:13:130:516:275:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:In the United States, overall, the government, universities, and non-profit institutions 
2:42:2043:13:13:106:521:262:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:fund roughly $95 billion of research and industry funds approximately $181 billion. This is 
2:43:2135:13:13:106:247:249:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:34% public and 66% business. 
2:44:2164:13:13:130:523:236:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Through  technology  transfer  the  universities  provide  commercial  sector  companies  
2:45:2254:13:13:106:523:223:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:with access to new discoveries and innovation resulting from research. Industrial partners 
2:46:2345:13:13:106:343:210:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:develop these inventions and manufacture products. 
2:47:2396:13:13:130:525:197:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Universities  seek  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  technological  innovations  to  private  
2:48:2492:13:13:106:522:184:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:companies, in order to create jobs and contributions to local economic development, trying 
2:49:2583:13:13:106:444:171:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:also to attract additional funding sources for scientific research university. 
2:50:2662:13:13:130:524:158:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Therefore,  the  relationship  between  teaching  and  research  is  positively  correlated.  
2:51:2756:13:12:106:524:145:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:Research  helps  teachers  lead  the  way  in  their  fields,  and  an  active  interest  in  research  
2:52:2860:12:13:106:523:133:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:contributes to teaching effectiveness. Education and training are considered to be some of 
2:53:2951:13:13:106:151:120:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:the main. 
2:54:2961:13:13:130:523:107:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Research,  technological  innovation  and  technology  transfer  are  strategic  elements  of

3:57:3253:13:13:106:340:701:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:competitiveness and independence of such entities. 
3:58:3304:13:13:130:523:688:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:We find that education and training and R&D – transfer are, among others, some of 
3:59:3386:13:13:106:522:675:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:the main factors of the business creation process. Universities are being required to operate 
3:60:3480:13:13:106:523:662:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:in a more entrepreneurial way,  commercialising the results of their research and spinning

4:112:7068:13:13:106:522:623:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:transferred  to  outside  the  scientific  community.  In  Romania,  only  a  few  universities  have  
4:113:7171:13:12:106:284:610:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:adopted an entrepreneurial orientation. 
4:114:7211:12:13:139:525:598:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Since  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  the  Romanian  university  system  has  been  
4:115:7297:13:13:106:523:585:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:changing significantly through the several reforms. These reforms gave new opportunities 
4:116:7386:13:13:106:523:572:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:to universities in defining and pursuing their strategies. Nevertheless, the research and the 
4:117:7480:13:13:106:524:559:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:education  are  treated,  yet,  like  being  services  that  funds  consume  and  not  like  being  the  
4:118:7585:13:13:106:300:546:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:main ways for the added value realization. 
4:119:7628:13:13:139:522:533:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:The Universities as facilitators of knowledge transfer are the fundamental catalysts 
4:120:7713:13:13:106:525:520:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:for  regional  economic  and  social  development.  Therefore,  raising  the  potential  role  of  
4:121:7812:13:13:106:526:507:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:universities  in  society  becomes  relevant,  technology  transfer  has  become  a  valuable  
4:122:7907:13:13:106:525:494:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:mechanism  that  can  accelerate  industry  innovation  activities  may  obtain  a  competitive  
4:123:8004:13:13:106:249:481:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:advantage through cooperation 
4:124:8034:13:13:139:523:468:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:The  means  of  technology  transfer  are  not  simple.  There  are  various  channels  of  
4:125:8126:13:13:106:526:455:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:technology   transfer   including   trade   of   goods   and   services,   licensing   contracts,   and   
4:126:8232:13:13:106:524:442:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:movements  of  engineers  as  well  as  the  supply  of    technology  from  a  parent  company,  
4:127:8330:13:13:106:523:429:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:university,  or  other  research  units  and  firms.  In  the  first  stage,  technology  flows  from  the  
4:128:8438:13:13:106:503:416:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:university to firms, and in the second stage, the technology held by the firm, is diffused 
4:129:8529:13:13:106:525:403:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:to  the  other  companies.  However,  the  second  stage  of  technological  diffusion  occurs  
4:130:8625:13:13:106:478:390:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f10:B:through various routs and is extremely difficult to be specified by statistical data. 
4:131:8710:13:13:139:524:377:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:More  recently,  attention  has  focused  on  technology  transfer  channels  between  
4:132:8797:13:13:106:223:364:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:universities and industry. 
4:133:8824:13:13:106:527:351:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:   Figure   1   provides   the   conceptual   framework   that   guides   our   analysis   of   
4:134:8920:13:13:106:524:338:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:determinants  of  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  activities  between  universities  and  
4:135:9016:13:13:106:523:325:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:firms. Universities’ relationships with companies are formed through a series of sequential 
4:136:9108:13:13:106:492:312:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:transactions such as sponsored research, licenses, spin-off firms and labour mobility. 
4:137:9195:13:13:139:522:299:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Universities  are  involved  in  a  two-phase  process  that  involves  first  the  production  
4:138:9291:13:13:106:524:286:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:of  knowledge  and  then  its  application  and  diffusion.  Linkages  between  academic  and  
4:139:9386:13:13:106:522:273:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:industrial research appear to be powerfully influenced by the degree of centralization of the 
4:140:9480:13:13:106:522:260:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:funding system. There is a belief that competition for funding, diversity of funding sources, 
4:141:9574:13:13:106:392:247:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:and, in general, a decentralized funding system would be more 
4:142:9636:13:13:106:523:234:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:conducive  to  university-industry  relationships.  In  addition,  decentralized  systems  tend  to  
4:143:9737:13:13:106:257:221:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:be responsive to local industries. 
4:144:9772:13:13:139:522:208:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:A:Knowledge production increasingly is trans-disciplinary and depends on the ability 
4:145:9855:13:13:106:524:195:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:of  researchers  to  work  with  other  across  a  broad  spectrum  of  disciplines.  A  system  that  
4:146:9958:13:13:106:525:182:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:adheres  to  rigid  disciplinary  boundaries  in  funding  research  projects  will  inhibit  these  
4:147:10059:13:13:106:405:169:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:interactions and thus may limit technology-transfer opportunities. 
4:148:10126:13:13:106:522:156:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:`As illustrated in Figure 1, a conceptual model is in line with the importance of knowledge 
4:149:10218:13:13:106:522:143:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:as a major source of innovation. This model offers a clearly defined process for identifying 
4:150:10311:13:13:106:526:130:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:the  determinants  of  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  activities  between  firms  and  
4:151:10405:13:13:106:524:117:127:g_d0_f9:127:g_d0_f9:B:universities  that  leads  to  competitive  advantage  for    companies  and  additional  funds  for
