3:32:1692:21:16:74:361:569:11:Times:11:Times:C:The Revenue Maximization Oligopoly Model: Comment 
3:33:1742:16:11:65:382:553:10:Times:10:Times:A:Since Professor Baumol's substitution of constrained revenue maximiza- 
3:34:1813:11:11:55:381:542:10:Times:10:Times:B:tion for profit maximization in the objective function attributed to rational 
3:35:1891:11:10:55:381:531:10:Times:10:Times:B:oligopolists, the nature of the relationships between advertising outlay, 
3:36:1965:10:12:55:382:521:10:Times:10:Times:B:price, output, and production cost in the oligopoly equilibrium solution has 
3:37:2042:12:11:55:381:509:10:Times:10:Times:B:been radically altered [1]. However, because these relationships are clearly 
3:38:2119:11:11:55:382:498:10:Times:10:Times:B:articulated neither graphically nor in the mathematical appendix of 
3:39:2187:11:11:55:382:487:10:Times:10:Times:B:Baumol's book (even the revised edition), their appreciation has been 
3:40:2257:11:10:54:381:476:10:Times:10:Times:B:limited. Moreover, a recent article integrating both the price and advertis- 
3:41:2334:10:12:54:382:466:10:Times:10:Times:B:ing outlay variables and touted as the general statement of the Baumol 
3:42:2405:12:11:54:381:454:10:Times:10:Times:B:model is, as will be shown, but a special case of the Baumol model [2]. 
3:43:2477:11:11:54:382:443:10:Times:10:Times:B:In this commentary, we shall present a general model of the sales maximi- 
3:44:2551:11:11:54:382:432:10:Times:10:Times:B:zation hypothesis, articulating the above relationships and remedying the 
3:45:2625:11:11:54:157:421:10:Times:10:Times:B:shortfalls in generality. 
3:46:2651:11:12:64:382:410:10:Times:10:Times:A:In the text of Business Behavior, Value and Growth, Baumol presents his 
3:47:2723:12:11:55:382:398:10:Times:10:Times:B:admittedly "partial" sales maximization argument together with its 
3:48:2790:11:11:54:382:387:10:Times:10:Times:B:equilibrium advertising outlay-price-output solution. The equilibrium out- 
3:49:2865:11:11:54:382:376:10:Times:10:Times:B:put is defined with production costs and price as variables but with adver- 
3:50:2941:11:11:54:382:365:10:Times:10:Times:B:tising outlay excluded. The equilibrium level of advertising depends on 
3:51:3013:11:11:54:382:354:10:Times:10:Times:B:advertising outlay with production costs and presumably output held 
3:52:3081:11:11:54:383:343:10:Times:10:Times:B:constant. Total revenue is a standard parabolic function of output, mar- 
3:53:3154:11:11:54:382:332:10:Times:10:Times:B:ginal production cost is a positive and increasing function of output, and 
3:54:3229:11:11:54:382:321:10:Times:10:Times:B:marginal revenue is a positive but decreasing function of advertising out- 
3:55:3304:11:11:54:381:310:10:Times:10:Times:B:lay. Given a minimum profit constraint, Baumol demonstrates the impossi- 
3:56:3377:11:11:54:382:299:10:Times:10:Times:B:bility of any combination of advertising outlay and output yielding both a 
3:57:3452:11:11:54:344:288:10:Times:10:Times:B:profit above the constraint and maximum sales revenue [1, p. 60]. 
3:58:3518:11:11:64:382:277:10:Times:10:Times:A:In the mathematical note, this problem is  stated as one of maximizing a 
3:59:3591:11:11:54:382:266:10:Times:10:Times:B:total revenue function (price times quantity) subject to a minimum profit 
3:60:3665:11:11:54:381:255:10:Times:10:Times:B:constraint which includes both advertising and production outlays. Here, 
3:61:3738:11:11:54:381:244:10:Times:10:Times:B:marginal production cost is taken to be positive and relevant to the deter- 
3:62:3814:11:12:55:298:233:10:Times:10:Times:B:mination of the equilibrium price and output [1, p. 69]. 
3:63:3871:12:11:64:381:221:10:Times:10:Times:A:In an article by R. L. Sandmeyer [2], Baumol is criticized for failing to 
3:64:3945:11:11:54:381:210:10:Times:10:Times:B:integrate the sales maximizer's price policy with his advertising policy in 
3:65:4021:11:11:54:382:199:10:Times:10:Times:B:describing the equilibrium. This situation is then "remedied" through a 
3:66:4093:11:11:54:381:188:10:Times:10:Times:B:graphical model which "allows price, advertising outlay, and product out- 
3:67:4167:11:11:55:381:177:10:Times:10:Times:B:put to change" [2, p. 1078]. Beginning in a no-advertising situation in which 
3:68:4245:11:11:54:381:166:10:Times:10:Times:B:total revenue is maximized at an output unconstrained by the profit mini- 
3:69:4319:11:11:54:382:155:10:Times:10:Times:B:mum, Sandmeyer demonstrates that profit in excess of the minimum will be 
3:70:4392:11:11:54:381:144:10:Times:10:Times:B:devoted to advertising outlay, generating a new and higher total revenue 
3:71:4465:11:11:54:380:133:10:Times:10:Times:B:function, a new price and a new excess profit level which in turn is devoted 
3:72:4542:11:11:54:381:122:10:Times:10:Times:B:to advertising outlay, etc., until eventually equilibrium output, price, and 
3:73:4619:11:11:54:382:111:10:Times:10:Times:B:advertising outlay are determined. At this equilibrium, the level of profit 
3:74:4695:11:12:55:197:100:10:Times:10:Times:B:equals the minimum acceptable. 
3:75:4726:12:11:64:381:88:10:Times:10:Times:A:Two things should be noted with respect to this model. First, it is a 
3:76:4796:11:11:54:381:77:10:Times:10:Times:B:"partial" model in that all production and marketing costs are fixed and, 
3:77:4870:11:0:54:382:66:10:Times:10:Times:B:consequently, the nonadvertising marginal cost of increasing sales is zero 
4:78:4945:0:21:56:309:592:10:Times:10:Times:B:1356 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
4:79:4979:21:11:55:379:571:10:Times:10:Times:B:over the relevant range. Second, because of the implicit zero marginal cost, 
4:80:5056:11:10:55:379:560:10:Times:10:Times:B:the equilibrium defined by Sandmeyer occurs at the peak of one of the total 
4:81:5132:10:12:54:380:550:10:Times:10:Times:B:revenue functions, i.e., where marginal revenue is zero-a solution which 
4:82:5205:12:11:54:379:538:10:Times:10:Times:B:is inconsistent with the basic equilibrium conditions of the model as stated 
4:83:5282:11:11:54:170:527:10:Times:10:Times:B:by Baumol [1, pp. 61, 69]. 
4:84:5309:11:11:64:381:516:10:Times:10:Times:A:In the following model, the equilibrium for a revenue maximizer will be 
4:85:5381:11:11:54:379:505:10:Times:10:Times:B:shown when price, cost, output, and advertising outlay are all free to vary. 
4:86:5458:11:11:54:380:494:10:Times:10:Times:B:This model will be referred to as the general Baumol model of which both 
4:87:5531:11:11:55:381:483:10:Times:10:Times:B:Baumol's "partial" presentation and Sandmeyer's model are special cases.

4:93:5828:11:10:73:250:415:10:Times:10:Times:A:A (a)-total cost of advertising function;

4:95:5941:11:16:104:340:394:10:Times:10:Times:A:saved from selling x units after a units of advertising. 
4:96:5998:16:11:56:381:378:10:Times:10:Times:B:Given these definitions, we maximize the total revenue function, subject 
4:97:6071:11:18:56:152:367:10:Times:10:Times:B:to a profit constraint:

5:131:7078:11:11:55:381:330:10:Times:10:Times:B:pared with the aTRIax = 0 claimed by Sandmeyer as a characteristic of the 
5:132:7152:11:12:55:147:319:10:Times:10:Times:B:equilibrium solution. 
5:133:7174:12:10:66:381:307:10:Times:10:Times:A:Graphically, Sandmeyer's equilibrium position is shown as To in Figure 1. 
5:134:7248:10:11:56:381:297:10:Times:10:Times:B:With the TR functions representing the relationship of total revenue to 
5:135:7320:11:11:55:381:286:10:Times:10:Times:B:output at different levels of advertising outlay, the minimum profit con- 
5:136:7394:11:11:55:381:275:10:Times:10:Times:B:straint represented by 7r, and the production cost function implied by the 
5:137:7469:11:11:55:385:264:10:Times:10:Times:B:horizontal curve 7r+C, this solution gives an output of OQo, a price of ToQo 
5:138:7546:11:11:55:381:253:10:Times:10:Times:B:/OQo, and advertising outlay of coTo=aobo. Clearly, this solution implies 
5:139:7620:11:11:55:382:242:9:Times:10:Times:B:aTR/ax=dC/dx=0, which, as noted above, is inconsistent with the re- 
5:140:7688:11:11:55:254:231:10:Times:10:Times:B:quirements of the generalized Baumol model. 
5:141:7732:11:11:65:381:220:10:Times:10:Times:A:The solution of the general Baumol model is also shown in Figure 1.

5:144:7947:11:11:55:380:187:10:Times:10:Times:B:given by 7r. In this case the production cost function is implied by 7r+C(x) 
5:145:8024:11:11:55:381:176:10:Times:10:Times:B:+a. For each level of advertising outlay, a new total cost function (includ- 
5:146:8101:11:11:55:384:165:10:Times:10:Times:B:ing 7r) is observed. At output OQo, the advertising outlay is aobo = coTo, 
5:147:8176:11:11:55:380:154:10:Times:10:Times:B:total production cost is equal to boTo, and total revenue equals total cost 
5:148:8252:11:11:55:381:143:10:Times:10:Times:B:including the minimum profit constraint. These conditions, then are true

5:150:8396:11:11:55:381:121:10:Times:10:Times:B:However, while the sales maximizer is in equilibrium at Qo in the Sand- 
5:151:8468:11:11:55:380:110:10:Times:10:Times:B:meyer model, he is not in equilibrium in the general Baumol model. The 
5:152:8539:11:11:55:385:99:10:Times:10:Times:B:next unit of advertising will be purchased, output will be cut back from OQo 
5:153:8616:11:11:55:386:88:10:Times:10:Times:B:to OQj, the price of the output will be raised from ToQo/OQo to T1Ql/OQ1, 
5:154:8690:11:11:55:381:77:10:Times:10:Times:B:and total production cost will decrease from Tobo to T1b1. The change will 
5:155:8765:11:11:55:385:66:10:Times:10:Times:B:be undertaken because total sales revenue is increased from ToQo to T1Qj. 
5:156:8839:11:0:65:381:55:10:Times:10:Times:A:In general, then, the sales maximizer in the general Baumol model will

6:159:9020:11:11:53:381:558:10:Times:10:Times:B:and a greater sales volume than will the sales maximizer in the Sandmeyer 
6:160:9094:11:11:53:381:547:10:Times:10:Times:B:version of the Baumol model. With dC/dx> 0, the oligopolist will find it in his 
6:161:9174:11:11:53:381:536:10:Times:10:Times:B:interest to allocate profit surplus from production to advertising in the

6:175:9905:12:15:137:295:321:11:Times:11:Times:C:U.S. Manufacturing: Comment 
6:176:9933:15:11:63:380:306:10:Times:10:Times:A:In responding to previous critiques of our incidence study [41, we have 
6:177:10005:11:11:53:380:295:10:Times:10:Times:B:conceded that our initial effort should eventually come to be replaced by a 
6:178:10081:11:11:53:380:284:10:Times:10:Times:B:more complex approach, involving a structural model in which price, wage, 
6:179:10155:11:11:53:380:273:10:Times:10:Times:B:and shifting behavior are specified, and all equations are identified. While 
6:180:10232:11:11:53:380:262:10:Times:10:Times:B:the required data are exceedingly difficult to obtain, such a reformulation 
6:181:10308:11:11:53:379:251:10:Times:10:Times:B:may eventually be forthcoming. Such a model may not only provide better 
6:182:10380:11:11:53:380:240:10:Times:10:Times:B:information on total shifting, but also show how shifting comes about and 
6:183:10454:11:11:53:380:229:10:Times:10:Times:B:what "direction" it takes. It is with great anticipation, therefore, that one 
6:184:10532:11:11:53:381:218:10:Times:10:Times:B:follows beyond the opening pages of a recent article by R. J. Gordon, where 
6:185:10608:11:11:53:380:207:10:Times:10:Times:B:such an approach appears to be taken.' But as the paper proceeds, it be- 
6:186:10681:11:19:53:289:196:10:Times:10:Times:B:comes apparent that no such improvement is offered. 
6:187:10733:19:15:53:121:177:10:Times:10:Times:B:Tax-less Model 
6:188:10748:15:11:63:380:162:10:Times:10:Times:A:Gordon begins with a model for a tax-less world. He defines profits as 
6:189:10819:11:11:53:379:151:10:Times:10:Times:B:sales minus costs, with costs a function of quantity, wage rates, and ma- 
6:190:10893:11:11:53:379:140:10:Times:10:Times:B:terial prices. Sales equals product price times quantity, where price is 
6:191:10966:11:11:53:379:129:10:Times:10:Times:B:determined by a behavioral equation involving mark-up prices. This 
6:192:11033:11:11:53:380:118:10:Times:10:Times:B:assumption is worth testing, although other behavior hypotheses might 
6:193:11103:11:11:52:379:107:10:Times:10:Times:B:have been used as well. In equation (7), Gordon attempts to present the 
6:194:11175:11:11:53:380:96:10:Times:10:Times:B:system in reduced form. Some of the variables in (7) being unavailable, he 
6:195:11250:11:19:53:379:85:10:Times:10:Times:B:proceeds to make certain substitutions, thus arriving at equation (12), 
6:196:11322:19:10:60:382:66:7:Times:9:Times:F:1 See [21. To simplify and to permit reference to our model, we consider the Gordon model 
6:197:11412:10:0:53:187:56:9:Times:9:Times:F:only in its rate of return formulation.
