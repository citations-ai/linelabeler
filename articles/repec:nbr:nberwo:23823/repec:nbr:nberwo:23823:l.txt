2:27:1420:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Limits  on  consumer  attention  give  firms  incentives  to  manipulate  prospective  buyers’  allocation 
2:28:1527:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:of attention. This paper models such attention manipulation and shows that it limits the ability of 
2:29:1626:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:disclosure regulation to  improve  consumer  welfare.  Competitive information supply,  from  firms 
2:30:1725:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:competing  for attention,  can  reduce  consumers’  knowledge  by  causing  information  overload.  A 
2:31:1826:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:single firm subjected to a disclosure mandate may deliberately induce such information overload 
2:32:1921:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:to  obfuscate  financially relevant  information,  or  engage  in  product  complexification  to  bound 
2:33:2024:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:consumers’  financial  literacy. Thus,  disclosure  rules  that  would  improve  welfare  for  agents 
2:34:2125:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:without   attention   limitations   can   prove ineffective   for   consumers   with   limited   attention. 
2:35:2232:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:Obfuscation  suggests  a  role  for  rules  that  mandate not  only  the  content  but  also  the  format  of 
2:36:2341:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:disclosure;  however,  even  rules  that  mandate  “easy-to-understand” formats  can  be  ineffective 
2:37:2442:14:42:72:428:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:against complexification, which may call for regulation of product design.

3:45:2632:0:28:108:218:673:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:46:2647:28:16:108:504:645:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Governments can increase welfare by addressing market failures and providing pub-
3:47:2728:16:17:108:504:629:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:lic goods. In addition, they often try to make constituents better informed, hoping
3:48:2811:17:16:108:504:612:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to raise welfare by inducing consumers to make better decisions. For example, gov-
3:49:2893:16:16:108:504:596:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ernment agencies such as the Food and Drug Association (FDA) and the Consumer
3:50:2970:16:17:108:504:580:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Protection Agency (CPA) disseminate recommendations and guidelines.  In addi-
3:51:3047:17:16:108:504:563:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tion, firms are increasingly required to disclose information that is deemed relevant
3:52:3132:16:17:108:504:547:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to consumers, so credit card companies must disclose important details about the
3:53:3212:17:16:108:468:530:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:products they offer and food producers must adhere to labeling regulations.
3:54:3287:16:17:124:503:514:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Yet processing this information requires consumers’ attention. If attention is un-
3:55:3369:17:16:108:504:497:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:limited, more information is weakly better, so any regulation that mandates disclo-
3:56:3452:16:16:108:504:481:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sure cannot do harm. There is growing evidence that consumers’ attention is limited,
3:57:3536:16:17:108:503:465:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:however (see, e.g.,Chetty et al.(2009);Dellavigna and Pollet(2009);Abaluck and
3:58:3614:17:16:108:503:448:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Gruber(2011)), which makes the welfare consequences of regulation that mandates
3:59:3693:16:17:108:504:432:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disclosure, a priori, less clear, as consumer attention devoted to one piece of infor-
3:60:3779:17:16:108:504:415:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mation may crowd out attention to others. The literature on rational inattention
3:61:3859:16:17:108:503:399:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f5:B:analyzes how a decision-maker with limited attention allocates it across variouspas-
3:62:3943:17:16:108:504:382:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f3:B:sivesources of information (e.g.,Sims,2003;Wiederholt,2010). The core idea in
3:63:4020:16:17:108:504:366:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:this paper is that consumers’ limited attention gives information providers, such as
3:64:4104:17:16:108:503:349:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:firms, incentives to beactive.To be more precise, when a consumer’s attention is
3:65:4184:16:16:108:503:333:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:limited, her ultimate purchasing decisions may hinge on what she pays attentionto;
3:66:4266:16:17:108:504:317:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:this, in turn, incentivizes firms to engage inattention manipulation, that is, strate-
3:67:4352:17:16:108:504:300:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:gic actions to influence how she allocates her attention. This is distinct from, and
3:68:4436:16:17:108:504:284:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:operates on top of, any incentive to manipulate the substance of consumer-facing
3:69:4516:17:16:108:183:267:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:communication.
3:70:4530:16:17:124:503:251:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The first part of the paper shows that, in the presence of attention manipula-
3:71:4608:17:16:108:504:234:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tion, competitive information supply, from firms competing for attention, can reduce
3:72:4692:16:16:108:504:218:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:consumer knowledge by causing information overload. In the second part of the pa-
3:73:4773:16:17:108:504:202:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:per I show that a single information provider, such as a firm mandated to disclose
3:74:4855:17:16:108:503:185:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information, may deliberatelyinduceinformation overload to conceal information.
3:75:4934:16:17:108:504:169:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, requiring a firm to disclose all hidden, undesirable features of its product may
3:76:5020:17:16:108:504:152:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:have no impact on social welfare; the firm will simply disclose these features along
3:77:5104:16:17:108:504:136:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with an avalanche of irrelevant information. But if full disclosure policies can back-
3:78:5190:17:0:108:504:119:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f5:B:fire, intuition suggests that there is an easy fix: simply to mandate not onlywhat
4:79:5273:0:17:108:504:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:firms disclose, but alsohowit should be disclosed.  The paper’s third result is a
4:80:5354:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disconcerting one, however: Mandating that firms provide easy-to-understand infor-
4:81:5436:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mation about the products they sell will induce “complexification” of the underlying
4:82:5520:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:products themselves. This is essential as it limits the potential welfare gains from
4:83:5604:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mandated information provision; in fact, complexification can eradicate all welfare
4:84:5687:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:gains. Together, these findings demonstrate that taking attention manipulation into
4:85:5770:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:account has important implications for the design of consumer protection regula-
4:86:5850:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tion, by suggesting a role for rules that restrict communication, mandate not only
4:87:5932:16:16:108:462:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the content but also the format of disclosure, and regulate product design.
4:88:6007:16:17:124:503:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:These findings arise in a theoretical framework of information exchange between
4:89:6086:17:16:108:504:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:one consumer (the decision-maker; henceforth the “DM”) and various suppliers of in-
4:90:6169:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:formation (firms; henceforth “experts”). To capture attention manipulation, I want
4:91:6251:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to permit the experts to beactive,in the sense that they make persuasion effort
4:92:6330:16:17:108:503:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:choices that, in turn, affect the optimal attention allocation of the DM. I depart
4:93:6412:17:16:108:503:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:from the framework byDewatripont and Tirole(2005), who model a DM interacting
4:94:6489:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with asingleexpert. The DM considers taking an action with an uncertain pay-
4:95:6565:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:offto her, but that would surely benefit the expert (e.g., buying a good from the
4:96:6646:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expert). Before the DM decides, she can communicate with the expert. Communi-
4:97:6723:16:17:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cation is a moral-hazard-in-team problem: The more attention the DM pays to the
4:98:6802:17:16:108:503:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expert, and the greater the expert’s effort, the more likely it is that information is
4:99:6888:16:17:108:503:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:exchanged successfully between them.Dewatripont and Tirole(2005) refer to this as
4:100:6969:17:16:108:504:327:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f3:B:issue-relevant communication,because it concerns the DM’s actual benefits from the
4:101:7051:16:16:108:504:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:action. Importantly, the expert does not know what conclusion the DM will draw
4:102:7129:16:17:108:503:295:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:from the information he provides; he only knows that it may affect her decision.1
4:103:7210:17:16:108:504:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f5:B:In addition,Dewatripont and Tirole(2005) include a pre-play stage in whichcue
4:104:7287:16:17:108:503:262:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f3:B:communicationtakes place. This does not concern the actual benefits associated
4:105:7365:17:16:108:504:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with the action, but rather the decision’s ex ante appeal, that is, the likelihood that
4:106:7452:16:17:108:439:229:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(issue-relevant communication will show that) the action is beneficial.
4:107:7523:17:15:120:504:212:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:1Intuitively, a firm representative selling a product can expend effort to convey more informa-
4:108:7618:15:10:108:504:197:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:tion about the product to the buyer, without knowing with certainty whether it will make the
4:109:7710:10:11:108:504:187:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:prospective buyer conclude that her payofffrom the product will be positive (and choose to buy) or
4:110:7808:11:11:108:504:176:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:negative (and choose to abstain). Thus, information provided by the seller is always truthful in this
4:111:7909:11:11:108:503:165:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:setting; put differently, no vendors are behaving in an unlawful manner – their choice regarding how
4:112:8009:11:11:108:503:154:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:much persuasion effort to make simply concerns how much effort to make to clearly and truthfully
4:113:8105:11:11:108:503:143:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f10:F:convey additional information about the product to the buyer. As we shall see,even though all
4:114:8198:11:11:108:504:132:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f8:F:communication is required to be truthful, this does not guarantee that a seller lacks strategies for
4:115:8298:11:0:108:504:121:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:effectively hiding information that he believes would reduce the consumer’s willingness to purchase.
5:116:8399:0:17:124:503:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:To analyze attention manipulation, I introduce multitasking into this framework.
5:117:8479:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:A single DM (she) considers several binary actions, and can communicate with one
5:118:8559:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:distinct expert (he) on each of them. Each of these issue-relevant information ex-
5:119:8641:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:changes is a moral-hazard-in-teams problem, and the DM now faces a multitasking
5:120:8720:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:problem because she must divide her limited attention between the various experts.
5:121:8802:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:In the first part of Section 2, I show that, in this framework, attention substitution
5:122:8888:16:17:108:503:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:leads to externalities that I refer to as attentioncrowding out: Each expert ignores
5:123:8972:17:16:108:503:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the effects of his chosen persuasion effort on the attention that the DM devotes to
5:124:9055:16:16:108:503:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:other experts.  Interestingly, an expert benefits or suffers from crowding out de-
5:125:9137:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:pending on whether he believes that attention from the DM will raise or lower the
5:126:9218:17:16:108:504:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood that she takes the action from which he benefits. This makes an expert’s
5:127:9301:16:17:108:489:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expected payoffnon-monotonic in the appeal of other experts’ proposed actions.
5:128:9379:17:16:124:503:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:In the second part of Section 2, I allow each action’s ex ante appeal to be un-
5:129:9458:16:17:108:504:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:observed by the DM, and add a stage before issue-relevant communication in which
5:130:9538:17:16:108:504:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cue communication can take place.  Specifically, each expert can, at a cost, send
5:131:9619:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:hard information about his proposed action’s appeal to the DM, and she can process
5:132:9701:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:this cue at a cost. Intuitively, in the presence of competition between experts for
5:133:9784:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the DM’s attention, cue communication takes place first and helps the DM select
5:134:9863:16:17:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:which experts (actions) to devote attention to in the second stage. Cue communi-
5:135:9943:17:16:108:504:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cation thus shapes the set of actions on which the DM ends up deliberating. For
5:136:10022:16:17:108:504:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:this reason, I say that cue communication takes place in the “selection stage” and
5:137:10104:17:16:108:432:327:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:issue-relevant communication in the subsequent “deliberation stage.”
5:138:10172:16:16:124:503:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:I analyze how the DM’s welfare changes as the cost of sending cues—or proposing
5:139:10251:16:17:108:504:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:actions to the DM—falls and, consequently, more experts seek attention and more
5:140:10330:17:16:108:504:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:choices enter the picture.  Initially, she benefits from the fact that she has more
5:141:10413:16:17:108:504:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:actions from which to choose. But as entry becomes cheaper, it becomes profitable
5:142:10494:17:16:108:504:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for experts who propose less-appealing actions to enter. As a result, the average
5:143:10575:16:17:108:504:229:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:quality of the proposed actions deteriorates, and the DM must read cues, at a cost,
5:144:10658:17:16:108:504:212:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to find the attractive ones. Eventually, as the supply escalates, screening ceases to
5:145:10743:16:17:108:487:196:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:be worthwhile to her, and she picks proposed actions for deliberation randomly.
5:146:10822:17:16:124:503:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Thus, at a certain point, as the competition for the DM’s attention increases and
5:147:10903:16:16:108:504:163:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she gets more information, she processes less of it—or tunes out—and fares worse.
5:148:10984:16:17:108:503:147:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:I refer to this asinformation overload. Its immediate cause is that the quality of
5:149:11066:17:16:108:504:130:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the proposed actions decreases with the quantity; actions worthy of deliberation
5:150:11146:16:0:108:504:114:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:become the proverbial needle in a haystack. The deeper cause, though, is negative
6:151:11228:0:17:108:504:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:externalities: Entry is individually rational for each expert, even as it complicates
6:152:11313:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the selection problem for the DM and spoils overall communication. A DM with
6:153:11389:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:limited attention may hence want to limit access to her attention space, even if
6:154:11469:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that reduces her choice set. She faces a trade-offbetween comprehensiveness and
6:155:11548:16:17:108:193:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:comprehensibility.
6:156:11566:17:16:124:503:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Section 3 reinterprets the framework to capture a DM who communicates with
6:157:11640:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a single expert on one action that has severalaspects. In the deliberation stage, the
6:158:11725:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:DM’s multi-tasking problem now stems from the fact that the DM must decide how
6:159:11803:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to allocate her scarce attention across the various aspects of the action. Recall that,
6:160:11890:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in the selection stage, in the “multiple experts”-setting analyzed in Section 2, the
6:161:11974:17:16:108:504:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:DM is unsure of each action’s ex ante appeal. The analogue in Section 3 is that the
6:162:12057:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:DM is unsure which aspects of the (single) action are financially relevant, and hence
6:163:12142:17:16:108:361:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:worth devoting attention to in the deliberation stage.
6:164:12196:16:17:124:503:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The analysis in Section 3 picks up on the information overload result from Section
6:165:12278:17:16:108:504:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:2 and shows that a single expert may induce this outcome. Specifically, in Section
6:166:12360:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:2, information overload resulted from various experts’ competition for attention.
6:167:12441:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Section 3 shows that a single expert, who faces no competition for the DM’s attention
6:168:12526:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:but who can communicate with the DM about multiple aspects of the action for
6:169:12602:16:17:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:which he advocates, maystrategically induceinformation overload in the DM. This
6:170:12681:17:16:108:504:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:arises when the expert wants to divert attention from relevant aspects that are
6:171:12760:16:17:108:504:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:“unfavorable” in the sense that, if the DM learns more about those aspects, she may
6:172:12843:17:16:108:504:327:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f3:B:nottake the action. Of course, if it were up to the expert, he would not bring up
6:173:12924:16:16:108:504:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:any such unfavorable aspect – that is, he would not send any cue about it. But
6:174:13002:16:17:108:504:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sometimes the expert cannot or may not withhold such information, e.g.  due to
6:175:13080:17:16:108:504:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:laws that mandate disclosure of relevant information. I show that, in response to
6:176:13161:16:17:108:504:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:such a disclosure mandate, the expert chooses to inundate the DM with cues relating
6:177:13244:17:16:108:504:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mostly to irrelevant aspects of the action. This induces information overload, which,
6:178:13329:16:17:108:503:229:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in turn, effectively conceals the inconvenient aspects that the firm was mandated to
6:179:13413:17:16:108:504:212:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disclose in the first place. In other words, the expert shares superfluous information
6:180:13499:16:17:108:503:196:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to strategically induce information overload, which essentiallyobfuscates the DM.
6:181:13580:17:16:108:504:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:When consumers’ attention is limited, simple disclosure rules can thus be completely
6:182:13664:16:16:108:337:163:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ineffective and have no impact on social welfare.
6:183:13713:16:17:124:503:147:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:But if disclosure mandates can backfire because firms can induce information
6:184:13789:17:16:108:504:130:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:overload, intuition suggests an immediate solution: to mandate not only what firms
6:185:13871:16:0:108:504:114:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disclose, but also that it be disclosed in an easy-to-understand way. The second part
7:186:13957:0:17:108:504:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of Section 3, however, shows that requiring a firm to provide easy-to-understand in-
7:187:14041:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:formation about a product it sells can induce a “complexification” of the underlying
7:188:14125:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:product itself. I show this by extending the model with a single expert to allow the
7:189:14209:17:16:108:503:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:DM’s payofffrom the (single) action to be comprised of many components, and to
7:190:14287:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:allow the expert to manipulate that composition so long as the total payoffstays
7:191:14367:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:constant. Intuitively, such payoff-equivalent variations amount to changing the num-
7:192:14451:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ber of financially relevant aspects of the product. This gives the expert yet another
7:193:14536:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tactic with which to thwart learning: The expert can force the DM to understand
7:194:14615:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:more details of the action, or product, to grasp its total payoff; in other words, he can
7:195:14704:16:17:108:503:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:make it morecomplex. Complexification ensures that an increasing amount of rele-
7:196:14784:17:16:108:504:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:vant information slips the DM’s attention and, by the same token, that whatever she
7:197:14867:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f3:B:canlearn in the deliberation stage is so trivial that it no longer affects her decision.
7:198:14955:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:In a nutshell, even if she fully understands all the aspects on which she can delib-
7:199:15039:16:17:108:504:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:erate, she will always do what she would have done anyway. Complexification thus
7:200:15119:17:16:108:504:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:has same welfare consequences as inducing information overload — it can eradicate
7:201:15200:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:all intended welfare gains from mandated information provision. But complexity is
7:202:15281:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a more delicate issue for regulation: Unlike strategic information overload, it cannot
7:203:15367:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:be tackled at the level of communication, information, and disclosure; it may call for
7:204:15453:16:17:108:254:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:intervention in product design.
7:205:15484:17:16:124:503:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:This paper builds on and contributes to several strands of the literature. First, I

7:210:15886:17:16:108:504:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:invites attention manipulation. More generally, this relates to a number of studies
7:211:15969:16:17:108:504:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that examine how a DM communicates with multiple experts or with a single expert

7:217:16449:14:11:108:503:165:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:can be withheld but not misrepresented (Grossman,1981;Milgrom,1981). When communication
7:218:16536:11:11:108:504:154:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:is a moral-hazard-in-teams problem, the softness is intermediate: Communication conveys hard

7:220:16727:11:11:108:504:132:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:soft. Introducing a lying cost represents another way to bridge soft and hard information (see, e.g.,

8:227:17302:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:each expert’s incentive to acquire costly information – is, however, distinct from
8:228:17384:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information overload. In my setting, there is no information acquisition; instead,
8:229:17466:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:central to my finding that more information can reduce a DM’s knowledge is that
8:230:17545:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:experts manipulate not only the substance of communication but also the DM’s
8:231:17621:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention allocation. This suggests that limits to attention are important in deter-

8:242:18455:16:17:108:504:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:consumers’ attention is limited. The two key results presented in Section 3 relate to

8:245:18702:16:16:108:503:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in settings with optimal consumer search.5In these papers, firms’ incentives to raise

8:247:18877:15:11:108:504:264:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:information acquisition by multiple agents with flexible information structures. They show that
8:248:18972:11:11:108:504:253:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:competition may increase or decrease information, but provide conditions under which a higher
8:249:19065:11:7:108:485:242:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:number of experts cannot provide less aggregate information in the sense ofBlackwell(1951).
8:250:19156:7:15:120:503:235:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:4In these models, all the experts have information relevant to the same action. In contrast, I
8:251:19250:15:11:108:504:220:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:analyze a case in which each expert has information about a different action. This relates to studies
8:252:19351:11:11:108:504:209:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:on organizational design in which multiple division managers communicate local information to the
8:253:19448:11:11:108:504:198:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:central management (Dessein and Santos,2006;Alonso et al.,2008).  These studies, however,
8:254:19537:11:7:108:477:187:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:address neither limited attention on the part of the DM nor competition for that attention.
8:255:19628:7:15:120:504:180:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:5In settings where multiple firms sell a homogenous good and compete on price,Wilson(2010)

8:257:19811:11:11:108:504:154:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:search costs, andCarlin(2009) focuses on how this affects market prices. Other papers that discuss
8:258:19909:11:11:108:504:143:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:obfuscation or related mechanisms in the context of competitive price discrimination models include

9:261:20113:0:17:108:504:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:these search costs stem from competition between firms. The present paper shows
9:262:20192:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that obfuscation and complexification can be individually rational even when a single
9:263:20277:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:firm operates in the absence of competition, if it is subjected to disclosure regula-
9:264:20362:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tion. In addition, the paper makes a distinction between obfuscation – which alters
9:265:20445:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:communication about a product without altering the product itself – and complexifi-
9:266:20528:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cation – which affects the product characteristics per se. While the consumer welfare
9:267:20613:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of these phenomena are similar, the distinction has crucial implications
9:268:20698:17:16:108:265:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for optimal disclosure regulation.

9:274:21138:16:17:108:503:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the attribute.  Put differently, I allow interested parties to influence the relative

9:285:21858:16:17:108:503:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:there is a distinct expert who gets a deterministic payoffd>0if the DM takes

10:295:22558:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:each action, the vested expert can provide information, and the DM can devote
10:296:22635:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention to processing this information.  Through such communication, the DM
10:297:22712:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:can learn the realization of ̃xi. The expert himself knows neither whether ̃xi= ̄xor

12:395:28725:15:14:116:503:122:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:10The assumption that the DM can devote attention to onlyttopics can, in this context, be
12:396:28814:14:0:108:504:108:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:thought of as a lower boundron the amount of (nonzero) attention that the DM can devote to any

13:398:28990:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:select at most two experts for the deliberation stage. I refer to the pre-play stage
13:399:29074:16:17:108:503:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:as the “selection stage.”11N=N ̄α+Nαexperts can enter the competition to be
13:400:29149:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:selected. Of these,N ̄αpropose actions of high quality (α= ̄α)andNαof low quality

13:402:29309:17:16:108:242:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:want attention,α< ̄α<α∗.
13:403:29333:16:17:124:503:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:As inDewatripont and Tirole(2005), each expert’s quality is his private infor-
13:404:29411:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mation. Hence, an expert may be willing to signal the quality of his action if it helps
13:405:29498:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:him get selected, and the DM may be willing to read such signals before choosing
13:406:29578:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:on which actions to deliberate, that is, with which experts to communicate. Specifi-
13:407:29662:17:16:108:503:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cally, at costqS>0, an expert can send a cue (signal) that contains hard information
13:408:29746:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:about the quality of his action. Upon receiving a cue, the DM decides whether to
13:409:29826:17:16:108:503:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:process it, at costqR>0, to learn the action’s quality. No expert can be selected
13:410:29907:16:17:108:504:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:without having sent a cue; hence,qScan be thought of as an entry cost. As I explain
13:411:29990:17:16:108:305:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:below, this last assumption is not crucial.
13:412:30033:16:16:124:503:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:I solve this game, deliberation stage plus selection stage, for perfect Bayesian
13:413:30113:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium.  Furthermore, I focus on the equilibria favored by the DM, that is,
13:414:30193:17:32:108:384:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:those with the maximum number of high-quality entrants.
13:415:30248:32:16:108:503:361:119:g_d0_f12:119:g_d0_f3:B:Information overloadAs would be expected, when the cost of entry decreases,
13:416:30323:16:16:108:504:345:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the supply of experts—and hence the number of actions from which the DM can
13:417:30398:16:17:108:504:329:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:choose—increases. However, as the DM’s choice set grows, her expected utility first
13:418:30481:17:29:108:420:312:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:increases, but then decreases. Proposition2states this key result:

13:425:31016:14:11:108:504:218:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:science. As Cohen (2011, p.1) writes, the distinction between “attentive processing” (the deliber-
13:426:31114:11:11:108:504:207:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:ation stage) and “pre-attentive processing” (the selection stage) is logically inherent in the notion

13:430:31506:11:11:108:504:163:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:‘pre-attentive’ processing must be performed prior to the operation of selective attention, and its
13:431:31605:11:11:108:504:152:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:output is used for the selection. The distinction between pre-attentive and attentive processing is

14:436:32003:25:17:124:503:631:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:It is instructive to describe how equilibrium behavior in the selection stage
14:437:32080:17:16:108:504:614:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:changes as the cost of sending cues,qS, falls from prohibitively large to negligi-
14:438:32162:16:17:108:503:598:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:bly small. The impact on the DM’s expected utility is illustrated in Figure2, where
14:439:32245:17:25:108:448:581:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a decrease inqSrepresents a movement from right to left on thex-axis.

14:441:32378:25:17:124:503:531:119:g_d0_f20:119:g_d0_f3:A:•AsqSfalls, it at some point becomes sufficiently attractive for some high-
14:442:32453:17:16:135:504:514:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:quality experts to enter.  Here, the cues in themselves are a signal of high
14:443:32529:16:17:135:504:498:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:quality, so the DM need not process them but can select her communication
14:444:32602:17:16:135:504:481:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:partner(s) for the deliberation stage at random from the pool of entrants. (This
14:445:32682:16:17:135:504:465:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:relies on the assumption that the DM can observe that a cue was sent even if
14:446:32758:17:16:135:504:448:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:she does not assimilate it. If we relax this, the economic insights remain valid,
14:447:32839:16:16:135:503:432:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:as I explain below.)  In thissignalingoutcome, the DM’s welfare increases

14:449:32983:17:16:135:504:399:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:generally, smaller than the number of experts with whom she can communicate
14:450:33058:16:17:135:504:383:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:in the deliberation stage; otherwise, the DM’s welfare remains constant. This
14:451:33135:17:16:135:503:366:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:is captured in Figure2:AsqSdecreases, the DM benefits from an expansion in

14:454:33357:16:25:135:488:317:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:low-quality experts, so her expected utility remains flat asqSfalls further.
14:455:33433:25:17:124:504:292:119:g_d0_f20:119:g_d0_f3:A:•AsqSfalls belowqS, some low-quality experts find it attractive to enter as well.
14:456:33514:17:16:135:504:275:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:A signaling equilibrium, in which a random pick from among the entrants en-

14:458:33666:17:16:135:504:242:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:DM reacts in either of two ways: Either she continues to randomize and sim-
14:459:33741:16:17:135:504:226:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:ply accepts the lower (average) expert quality or, ifqRis not too high, she
14:460:33816:17:16:135:504:209:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:reads cues with positive probability to screen out low-quality experts. So as
14:461:33893:16:17:135:503:193:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:not to make the selection stage trivial, I focus onqRthat is low enough for
14:462:33968:17:16:135:502:176:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f15:A:the DM to engage in activescreening.  Clearly, her welfare decreases asqS
14:463:34041:16:16:135:504:160:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:falls, as it becomes harder to spot high quality. Already, the arrival of more
14:464:34119:16:17:135:504:144:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:cues—essentially, access to more information—makes the DM worse off. The
14:465:34191:17:0:135:301:127:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:next stage is merely the copestone.
15:466:34228:0:17:124:504:673:119:g_d0_f20:119:g_d0_f3:A:•AsqSvanishes, the avalanche of low-quality cues reduces the average quality in
15:467:34307:17:16:135:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:the entrant pool so much that screening becomes futile—high quality becomes
15:468:34382:16:17:135:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:the proverbial needle in the haystack. As a result, there is neither signaling nor
15:469:34464:17:16:135:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:screening, justpooling: the DM gives up on active selection and accepts that
15:470:34540:16:17:135:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:she is all but bound to encounter low quality in the deliberation stage. Her
15:471:34616:17:16:135:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:expected utility thus approachesU∗,her expected utility from communicating
15:472:34690:16:17:135:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:with two low-quality experts (on two low-quality actions) in the deliberation
15:473:34767:17:22:135:162:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:stage.
15:474:34773:22:16:108:504:535:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, at a certain point, as the competition for the DM’s attention increases and
15:475:34854:16:16:108:504:519:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she gets more information, she processes less of it—or tunes out—and fares worse. I
15:476:34937:16:17:108:504:503:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:refer to this phenomenon—the more cues the DM gets, the fewer she processes, and
15:477:35017:17:16:108:331:486:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:the worse she fares—asinformation overload.12
15:478:35062:16:17:124:503:470:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:It is instructive to make precise how (the idea of) information overload is related
15:479:35145:17:22:108:503:453:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to (the idea of) limited attention. To this end, consider this quote bySimon(1971):
15:480:35228:22:16:151:476:431:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:What information consumes is rather obvious: It consumes the at-
15:481:35292:16:17:135:476:415:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:tention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty
15:482:35366:17:16:135:476:398:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the
15:483:35439:16:22:135:476:382:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:overabundance of information sources that might consume it. [p. 40-41]
15:484:35509:22:17:108:504:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, attention, in limited supply, becomes a scarcer resource in relative terms when
15:485:35594:17:16:108:504:343:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:confronted with more information. But this does not imply information overload
15:486:35672:16:17:108:504:327:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:or that more information provided candecreaseknowledge acquired. The idea of
15:487:35748:17:16:108:504:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information overload is that a wealth of information not only “creates...aneedto
15:488:35828:16:16:108:504:294:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:allocate that attention” (emphasis added) but actuallyimpairs the abilityto do so
15:489:35909:16:32:108:154:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:efficiently.
15:490:35921:32:16:124:504:246:119:g_d0_f12:119:g_d0_f3:A:Alternative assumptionsIf I instead assume that the DM cannot observe
15:491:35990:16:16:108:504:230:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that a cue was sent unless she incurs a cost to read it, the economic insights remain:
15:492:36076:16:17:108:504:214:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:She must open exactly two cues so long as only high-quality experts enter; then,
15:493:36156:17:16:108:504:197:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she must either open exactly two cues but rely on information of lower quality, or
15:494:36238:16:17:108:504:181:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:open more than two cues on average to identify two high-quality experts. In either
15:495:36320:17:16:108:504:164:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:case, her expected utility remains constant when only high-quality types enter and
15:496:36402:16:15:108:334:148:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:decreases with the number of low-quality types.
15:497:36449:15:15:116:503:133:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:12The signaling and screening outcomes arise independently of our assumption that there are
15:498:36540:15:10:108:508:118:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:infinitely many experts of low quality.  The pooling outcome requires thatNα,thenumberof
15:499:36628:10:0:108:477:108:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:low-quality experts, is sufficiently large relative toN ̄α,thenumberofhigh-qualityexperts.
16:500:36720:0:17:124:503:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Further, the equilibria described above exist even if we relax the assumption
16:501:36797:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that an expert must send a cue to enter. However, in that case, there is a further
16:502:36879:16:17:108:503:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium forqS→0in which the experts cease to send cues, aware that they are
16:503:36958:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:no longer processed, and the DM picks randomly from the entire pool of experts.
16:504:37037:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Still, the DM favors the equilibrium in which she picks randomly from a subset of
16:505:37118:17:16:108:503:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:experts—which includes all high-quality experts—who send a cue, because it offers
16:506:37199:16:17:108:318:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:better odds of picking a high-quality expert.
16:507:37244:17:16:124:503:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f5:A:Also, we need notassumedifferences in quality. Instead, suppose expertsinvest
16:508:37321:16:16:108:508:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in quality. Specifically, suppose allNexperts begin with low quality (α=α)but
16:509:37398:16:17:108:503:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:can invest in high quality (α= ̄α) at some costc>0before entering. Proposition2
16:510:37477:17:16:108:504:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:implies that information overload frustrates investment in high quality. Intuitively,
16:511:37562:16:17:108:503:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the value of quality is reflected in the expected utility difference between a high-
16:512:37646:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:quality and a low-quality type. For prohibitiveqS, both types expect to earn zero,
16:513:37728:16:17:108:504:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:so there is no incentive to invest in quality. AsqSfalls, ifcis not too high, some invest
16:514:37817:17:16:108:503:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in quality and send cues. But asqS→0, information overload erodes the premium
16:515:37894:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:on quality, so again no one invests. The supply of high quality collapses when it
16:516:37975:16:17:108:503:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:becomes too cheap to approach the DM. This isnotbecause the DM ceases to value
16:517:38053:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:quality. On the contrary, she would like to treat high-quality experts preferentially;
16:518:38139:16:17:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:however, she in unable to do so when finding them amounts to looking for a needle
16:519:38220:17:31:108:174:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in a haystack.
16:520:38234:31:17:108:503:329:119:g_d0_f12:119:g_d0_f3:B:Externalities as the driving force of information overloadThe immedi-
16:521:38303:17:16:108:504:312:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ate cause of information overload is that the quality of proposed actions decreases
16:522:38386:16:17:108:504:296:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with the quantity; actions worthy of deliberation become the proverbial needle in a
16:523:38469:17:16:108:504:279:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:haystack. The deeper cause, though, is negative externalities: Entry is individually
16:524:38553:16:17:108:504:263:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:rational for each expert, even as it complicates the selection problem for the DM and
16:525:38638:17:16:108:504:246:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:spoils overall communication. This is because each expert ignores how his own entry
16:526:38721:16:16:108:503:230:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:affects the communication environment as a whole. If the expert were identical for
16:527:38803:16:17:108:504:214:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:all actions, he would send cues only for two high-quality actions. In the decentralized
16:528:38890:17:16:108:504:197:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:setting, however, sending cues remains individually rational even as each cue sent
16:529:38972:16:17:108:504:181:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:aggravates the complexity of the DM’s selection problem up to a point where active
16:530:39054:17:16:108:504:164:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:selection breaks down. This, in turn, frustrates the incentives toproducequality.
16:531:39135:16:17:108:504:148:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Intuitively, it is as if the low-quality experts, each seeking to be noticed, pollute the
16:532:39224:17:16:108:504:131:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:DM’s attention field. Indeed, information overload is similar to pollution or conges-
16:533:39309:16:0:108:503:115:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tion and, like them, may be amenable to efficiency-improving intervention. The next
17:534:39394:0:17:108:504:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:subsection addresses practical expressions of information overload, and discusses the
17:535:39479:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:fact that a DM with limited attention may want to limit access to her attention
17:536:39558:16:17:108:503:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:space, even if that reduces her choice set. In a nutshell, she faces a trade-offbetween
17:537:39645:17:32:108:306:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:comprehensiveness and comprehensibility.

17:540:39803:17:16:108:504:551:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:more channels (phone, Internet, email, instant messages, etc.) and on more plat-
17:541:39883:16:17:108:504:535:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:forms (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc.). In the presence of information overload, such
17:542:39968:17:16:108:504:518:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:an abundance of information can be counterproductive. Indeed, a business research
17:543:40049:16:17:108:504:502:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:firm nominated information overload as the “problem of the year” in 2008, predict-
17:544:40131:17:16:108:504:485:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ing that it would cost firms $650 billion in lost productivity and innovation due
17:545:40212:16:16:108:504:469:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to “unnecessary interruptions.” The main concern is that an escalating quantity of
17:546:40294:16:17:108:504:453:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information comes with a decline in average quality and that this inverse relation-
17:547:40377:17:16:108:503:436:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:ship between amount and relevance makes it harder to find “good” information.13
17:548:40456:16:17:108:504:420:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:This makes selection, as in my model, a daunting issue, and suggets that consumers
17:549:40538:17:16:108:482:403:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:should value products that help reduce their choice sets and improve selection.
17:550:40617:16:17:124:503:387:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:In this vein several technology firms, including Microsoft, Intel, Google, and
17:551:40695:17:16:108:504:370:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:IBM, recently formed a nonprofit organization, the Information Overload Research
17:552:40775:16:17:108:503:354:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Group, to develop solutions to information overload.14Google’s success formula, its
17:553:40858:17:16:108:504:337:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f3:B:rankingalgorithm, implements pre-selection. And its ubiquity on the Internet, as
17:554:40938:16:16:108:504:321:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:gateway and gatekeeper, betrays the import of information overload. The logic of
17:555:41018:16:17:108:504:305:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:pre-selection also underlies solutions such as email filters, ranking inbox messages by
17:556:41105:17:16:108:504:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:imputed importance, compiling communication histories for every sender, displaying
17:557:41187:16:17:108:504:272:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:email portions to allow for fast screening, and sophisticated filing and search func-
17:558:41272:17:16:108:504:255:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tions. Such ranking of electronic messages minimizes information overload; that is,
17:559:41355:16:17:108:504:239:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:it reduces the “economic loss associated with the examination of a number of non-
17:560:41436:17:16:108:504:222:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:or less-relevant messages” and distinguishes “communications that are probably of
17:561:41517:16:16:108:371:206:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:interest from those that probably aren’t” (Losee,1998).
17:562:41572:16:17:124:503:190:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Information overload is not just a matter of Internet and emails. In a seminal
17:563:41650:17:16:108:504:173:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:study,Jacoby et al.(1974) explore how the quality of consumption decisions depends

18:568:42024:0:17:108:503:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:product dropped offat high levels of information load. InJacoby et al.(1973), a
18:569:42103:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:companion paper, they further show that the subjects spent less time on processing
18:570:42185:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information—or in their words, tuned out—once the information load exceeded a
18:571:42262:17:16:108:503:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:certain threshold.15Many other experiments in organization science, accounting,
18:572:42341:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:marketing, and information science corroborate the notion that more information
18:573:42420:17:16:108:503:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:can impair cognitive processes and decisions (Edmunds and Morris,2000;Eppler
18:574:42496:16:17:108:197:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and Mengis,2004).
18:575:42513:17:16:124:503:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Because information overload is a driving force behind innovations in commu-
18:576:42589:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:nication and information management, it is connected to recent research on choice
18:577:42670:16:17:108:503:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:architecture, that is, how the presentation of choices affects decisions (Thaler and
18:578:42754:17:16:108:503:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Sunstein,2008).Cronqvist and Thaler(2004), for example, study the introduction of
18:579:42835:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a new retirement savings plan in Sweden in 1993. Eligible Swedes were encouraged to
18:580:42918:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:choose five out of 456 funds, to which their savings would be allocated. One third of
18:581:43003:16:17:108:504:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:all eligibles made no active choices; their savings were instead allocated to a default
18:582:43090:17:16:108:504:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:fund (essentially a pre-selection by the government). Information overload seems a
18:583:43172:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:likely reason that so many Swedes rely on the default choice: Comparing hundreds
18:584:43252:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of funds is a Herculean task for ordinary households, and one might expect many of
18:585:43334:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:them to resort to the default or make superficial active decisions. Indeed, studying
18:586:43418:16:17:108:503:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the same Swedish reform,Karlsson et al.(2006) show that funds that (for exogenous
18:587:43499:17:16:108:504:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:reasons) were better represented in the fund catalogue—that is, have better “menu
18:588:43580:16:17:108:337:344:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:exposure”—received more active contributions.16
18:589:43627:17:16:124:503:327:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:All of the above examples suggest that decision-makers can benefit from receiv-
18:590:43706:16:16:108:504:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ing less information, despite the associated decrease in choice set. Indeed, in the
18:591:43789:16:17:108:504:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:presence of information overload, there is a trade-offbetween variety and simplic-
18:592:43871:17:16:108:504:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ity, or between comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. This evidence contrasts
18:593:43951:16:17:108:504:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with models of decision-making under unlimited attention, where a larger choice set
18:594:44034:17:14:108:282:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cannot make an individual worse off.

18:602:44631:11:11:108:504:151:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:show that wealth accumulation is highly responsive to automatic retirement contributions, which
18:603:44726:11:0:108:495:140:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:effectively eliminates the need to process information ahead of making retirement contributions.
19:604:44824:0:28:108:504:673:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:C:3  A Single Expert and Strategic Attention Manipulation
19:605:44879:28:16:108:504:645:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:In the previous section, we saw that crowding out and information overload result
19:606:44960:16:17:108:504:629:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:from the strategic interaction between multiple experts, each of whom try to persuade
19:607:45045:17:16:108:504:612:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the DM to take one distinct action. By making minor modifications to the original
19:608:45126:16:16:108:504:596:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:setting, this section reinterprets the framework to study a DM who communicates
19:609:45205:16:17:108:503:580:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with asingleexpert on one action that has severalaspects. In the deliberation stage,
19:610:45289:17:16:108:504:563:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the DM’s multi-tasking problem now stems from the fact that the DM must decide
19:611:45367:16:17:108:504:547:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:how to allocate her scarce attention between the various aspects of the action. In
19:612:45449:17:16:108:504:530:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the selection stage, recall that in the “multiple experts”-setting analyzed in Section
19:613:45535:16:17:108:504:514:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:2, the DM is unsure of each action’s ex ante appeal. The analogue in Section 3 is
19:614:45616:17:16:108:504:497:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that the DM is unsure which aspects of the (single) action are financially relevant,
19:615:45700:16:16:108:504:481:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and hence worth devoting attention to in the deliberation stage. Next, we introduce
19:616:45783:16:33:108:201:465:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the set-up in detail.
19:617:45804:33:23:108:435:432:143:g_d0_f11:143:g_d0_f11:C:3.1  Modified set-up: Deliberation and selection stages
19:618:45859:23:17:108:503:409:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The DM communicates with a single expert about one action,A, which has many
19:619:45934:17:16:108:503:392:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:aspects. Specifically, suppose the DM’s payofffromAcan be expressed as the sum
19:620:46012:16:0:108:228:376:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f14:B:ofNRcomponents: ̃x=

19:624:46152:17:0:108:313:343:119:g_d0_f13:36:g_d0_f23:C:E( ̃x)=NR[ ̄α ̄x+(1− ̄α)x], where ̄α=1NR

19:626:46195:11:13:328:504:340:64:g_d0_f19:119:g_d0_f3:A:1αi.Similar to before, absent more
19:627:46229:13:17:108:503:327:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information, the DM takesAin the deliberation stage if and only if ̄α>α∗≡−x ̄x−x.
19:628:46310:17:16:108:504:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Or put differently, if the DM can obtain more information, she uses an opt-in rule if
19:629:46395:16:17:109:287:294:119:g_d0_f14:119:g_d0_f3:B: ̄α≤α∗and an opt-out rule if ̄α>α∗.
19:630:46430:17:16:124:504:277:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to theNRcomponents of the actionAthat are relevant to the action’s
19:631:46508:16:16:108:504:261:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:payoff, there exist an additionalN∅components ofAthat are irrelevant to the DM’s
19:632:46588:16:17:108:503:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:payoff. I assume that the DM does not know which components are relevant,17and
19:633:46666:17:16:108:504:228:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:is potentially unaware of components per se. Intuitively, this captures a plausible
19:634:46749:16:17:108:504:212:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:situation: Inclined towards a particular choice, the DM might yet discover (finan-
19:635:46831:17:16:108:504:195:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cially relevant) aspects that change her opinion. Thus, the DM is faced with two sets
19:636:46916:16:17:108:504:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of questions: What components exist, and which ones are relevant (selection stage)?
19:637:46999:17:16:108:491:162:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:And how much attention should a given component receive (deliberation stage)?
19:638:47076:16:15:116:503:146:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:17This is analogous to the assumption, in the setting with multiple actions presented in Section
19:639:47172:15:11:108:504:131:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:2, that the DM does not know which actions are of a high quality and which actions are of a low
19:640:47267:11:0:108:138:120:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:quality.
20:641:47277:0:17:124:503:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:As before, the expert’s communication incentives hinge on the DM’s decision

20:644:47439:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:To maximize the chances that the DM revises her beliefs upwards, and so opts in,

20:646:47604:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:favorable information. That is, he sends her cues about, and exerts persuasion effort
20:647:47689:16:17:108:270:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:on, the topics with the highestαi.
20:648:47723:17:16:124:503:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:By contrast, if the DM follows an opt-out rule, her default is to take actionA,
20:649:47802:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:but she may depart from this default—and opt out—if she learns about any relevant
20:650:47883:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:aspects of the action that are unfavorable.  Then, the expert wants to withhold
20:651:47962:17:16:108:504:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the relevant information.  In the model, this means that, on his own accord, he
20:652:48041:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:would never send a cue about any relevant aspect in the selection stage, since this
20:653:48124:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:could only induce the DM to devote attention to it in the deliberation stage, and
20:654:48205:16:17:108:504:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:subsequently to change her mind and abandon the action after all. In this situation,
20:655:48289:17:16:108:503:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a mandatory disclosure law would make a difference to the expert’s communication
20:656:48369:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:strategy: By mandating that the expert (firm) reveals any relevant financial aspects
20:657:48453:16:17:108:403:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of the product, it would be illegal to withold this information.
20:658:48517:17:16:124:503:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:To formalize what happens when the expert is subjected to such a mandate,
20:659:48590:16:17:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:assume for simplicity that there is one relevant topic,NR=1, that the number of

20:661:48753:16:17:108:504:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(as in Section 2). These assumptions are merely simplifying; indeed, the “strategic
20:662:48836:17:16:108:504:327:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information overload”-result reported below holds as long as the DM can devote
20:663:48914:16:16:108:503:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention to only a limited number of topics in the deliberation stage andN∅is
20:664:48992:16:17:108:503:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sufficiently large relative toNR. Finally, as before, it is costly for the DM to process
20:665:49080:17:16:108:503:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cues:qR>0. For convenience, I refer to cues about relevant (irrelevant) topics as
20:666:49161:16:33:108:229:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:relevant (irrelevant) cues.

20:670:49354:16:17:108:504:173:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:unaware of—the relevant topic, the expert has no reason to bring it to her attention
20:671:49438:17:16:108:504:156:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:by sending a relevant cue. In fact, the expert is best offsending no cues at all. Now
20:672:49523:16:26:108:439:140:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:suppose that, by a disclosure mandate, the relevant cue must be sent.

21:674:49668:0:17:108:509:673:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:C:sure laws mandate that the relevant cue is sent. AsqS→0,theexpertsendsan

21:676:49817:25:17:124:503:631:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition 3 is closely related to the information overload result in Section
21:677:49895:17:16:108:503:614:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:2; yet, the underlying economic mechanism is different. In Section 2, information
21:678:49976:16:17:108:504:598:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:overload resulted from various experts’ competition for attention.  Proposition 3
21:679:50057:17:16:108:504:581:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:shows that a single expert, who faces no competition for the DM’s attention but who
21:680:50140:16:16:108:504:565:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:can communicate with the DM about multiple aspects of the action for which he
21:681:50217:16:17:108:503:549:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:advocates,strategically inducesinformation overload in the DM when he is subjected
21:682:50299:17:16:108:504:532:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to a disclosure provision that mandates drawing the DM’s attention to the financially
21:683:50384:16:17:108:486:516:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:relevant aspect of the action (the product he tries to persuade the DM to buy).
21:684:50463:17:16:124:503:499:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Intuitively, the expert is afraid that the DM, by paying attention to the relevant
21:685:50545:16:17:108:504:483:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:topic, might discover unfavorable information about the action and opt out.  To
21:686:50624:17:16:108:504:466:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:reduce the odds that the DM identifies — that is, selects — the relevant topic, the
21:687:50707:16:17:108:504:450:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disclosure mandate thus gives the expert an incentive to supply irrelevant aspects in
21:688:50792:17:16:108:504:433:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the selection stage, by sending out irrelevant cues, even though this is costly for him.
21:689:50880:16:16:108:504:417:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:A swarm of mostly irrelevant cues, in turn, thwarts the DM’s chance, and hence her
21:690:50962:16:17:108:504:401:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:incentives, to pinpoint the relevant topic. In other words, the expert intentionally
21:691:51046:17:16:108:504:384:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:induces information overload, which effectively conceals the inconvenient aspect that
21:692:51131:16:17:108:504:368:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the firm was mandated to disclose in the first place. In a nutshell, the disclosure
21:693:51214:17:16:108:504:351:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mandate, which is intended to raise the DM’s awareness of the financially relevant
21:694:51296:16:17:108:504:335:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:aspect of the product that she considers, generates a response on the part of the
21:695:51377:17:16:108:479:318:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expert that in practice renders the DM financially illiterate,orobfuscates her.
21:696:51456:16:16:124:503:302:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:As a result, the disclosure mandate has no impact on the DM’s final decision;
21:697:51533:16:17:108:504:286:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she buys the product even if an understanding of the financially relevant aspect
21:698:51613:17:16:108:504:269:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:would have pushed her to opt out, since strategic information overload makes her
21:699:51693:16:17:108:504:253:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:as uninformed in the presence of a mandate as she is in its absence. This sharply
21:700:51774:17:16:108:504:236:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:illustrates that, when consumers’ attention is limited, simple disclosure rules can be
21:701:51860:16:32:108:387:220:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:completely impotent and have no impact on social welfare.

22:716:52879:25:17:108:504:516:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Note that the issue was not only that the “inconvenient” information was at times
22:717:52960:17:16:108:504:499:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:unavailable. It was also that, even when provided, it was made available in a way
22:718:53041:16:17:108:504:483:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that made it costly to locate the relevant information; that is, in a way that induced

22:739:54574:15:11:108:504:155:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in another market: consumer retailing. They note that consumer product manufacturers tend to
22:740:54666:11:11:108:503:144:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:offer retailer-specific variants of common brands, and argue that this multiplicity of near-identical
22:741:54767:11:11:108:504:133:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:products is intended to prevent direct price comparison, and to thereby raise consumer search costs.

23:751:55501:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:provide fee information; cheap talk or non-disclosure are illegal and would have
23:752:55581:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:serious consequences ex post. Still, this does not mean that consumers become well-
23:753:55664:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:informed. Even when information is hard and disclosed, senders can still—through

23:756:55907:17:32:108:451:475:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:may prove completely ineffective when consumers’ attention is limited.22

23:760:56145:17:16:108:504:386:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:as too little; a surfeit of details can prove as uninformative as a dearth thereof. But
23:761:56232:16:17:108:504:370:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:if disclosure mandates can backfire because firms can induce information overload,
23:762:56314:17:16:108:504:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:intuition suggests an immediate solution: to mandate not only what firms disclose,
23:763:56396:16:16:108:504:337:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:but also that it is disclosed in an easy-to-understand way.  Indeed, more recent
23:764:56476:16:17:108:504:321:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disclosure rules often are of this flavor: Credit card companies must now disclose key
23:765:56562:17:16:108:503:304:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:details of the products they offer in a salient fashion, health insurance companies
23:766:56645:16:17:108:504:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:must provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) of each plan offered,
23:767:56720:17:16:108:504:271:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and food producers must adhere to standardized labeling regulations to declare all

23:769:56867:17:16:124:503:238:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:In this subsection, I use the theoretical framework to analyze the strategic re-

24:780:57710:17:16:124:503:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:I show this by extending the model with a single expert to allow the DM’s pay-

24:782:57868:17:16:108:503:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expert to manipulate that composition so long as the total payoffstays constant.
24:783:57948:16:17:108:503:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Intuitively, such payoff-equivalent variations amount to changing the number of fi-

24:785:58098:16:17:124:503:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:To allow for complexification, I introduce an option enabling the expert to design

24:787:58260:16:0:108:333:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f14:B:least initially—the sum ofNRcomponents, ̃x=

24:791:58409:17:0:108:419:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f14:B:expert can now recompose the payoffstructure into any form ̃y=

24:794:58488:13:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f5:B:the total (realized) payoffis invariant: ̃y= ̃x. I call ̃yapayoff-equivalent variation
24:795:58574:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(of ̃x). Crucially, I assume that the DM does not know the “original” composition,
24:796:58656:16:17:108:503:459:119:g_d0_f20:119:g_d0_f3:B:{ ̃xi}.23In any case, absent communication, such variation does not matter; it affects
24:797:58742:17:16:108:308:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:neither the DM’s decision nor her welfare.
24:798:58784:16:16:124:503:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:As an illustration, consider two simple mathematical operations the expert can
24:799:58862:16:9:108:503:410:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:use to create payoff-equivalent variations. One is to divide each ̃xiintomparts,

24:808:59098:13:16:108:504:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:one salient item, such as the monthly rent, a landlord might disaggregate them into
24:809:59181:16:17:108:504:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:various fees, such as for maintenance, utilities, move-in or move-out, parking, laundry

24:811:59348:16:0:108:279:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f14:B:that neutralize each other, as in ̃y=

24:820:59432:13:17:108:503:295:119:g_d0_f13:119:g_d0_f3:B:N=3NR. A real-world example is a purchase involving a nominal price, fees, taxes,
24:821:59513:17:16:108:504:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:discounts, bonuses, rewards, and so forth, which partly offset each other. In both
24:822:59595:16:17:108:435:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:examples, seeing one component is not informative about the others.
24:823:59662:17:16:124:504:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Even if the total expected payoffremains unchanged, the payoffcomposition
24:824:59735:16:17:108:504:229:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:matters for communication. As before, suppose the DM cannot deliberate on more
24:825:59813:17:16:108:504:212:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:than a certain number of topics (in keeping with the previous framework, say, two).
24:826:59896:16:17:108:504:196:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:A proliferation of components then causes more relevant information to slip her
24:827:59975:17:15:108:504:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention. Furthermore, disaggregating the payoffcan make each component, in and
24:828:60055:15:15:116:503:164:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:23Alternatively, I could assume that she does not know how a given payoff-relevant variation is
24:829:60150:15:11:108:504:149:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:related to the original composition. Either assumption captures situations of the following kind: A
24:830:60249:11:11:108:504:138:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:consumer is inclined to buy a good based on superficial information. That said, she is not aware of
24:831:60348:11:11:108:504:127:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:all aspects, such as hidden costs, that could influence her decision. Further, discovering one aspect
24:832:60449:11:0:108:341:116:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:is not necessarily informative about undiscovered aspects.
25:833:60509:0:17:108:503:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of itself, less important. To see this point, let ̃xih= ̃ximfor alliin the first (landlord)

25:835:60682:16:17:108:503:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:component, ̃xim. Crucially, this reduces how much the DM can learn from a given
25:836:60761:17:16:108:219:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:number of components.
25:837:60782:16:17:124:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Payoff-equivalent variation is thus a means of manipulating the DM’s learning
25:838:60859:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:process. How the expert uses such means hinges, as before, on the DM’s decision
25:839:60938:16:17:108:503:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:rule. If she uses an opt-in rule, the expert wants to help her learn more aboutA.
25:840:61019:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:He would setN≤2—such that no relevant aspect escapes deliberation—and exert
25:841:61094:16:16:108:503:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f4:B:communication effort on all the components. That is, he would simplify the payoff
25:842:61175:16:17:108:255:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:structure and strive to explain.

25:844:61287:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:opposite. He would increase the number of components, even if it were costly to do
25:845:61369:17:25:108:462:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:so, only to thwart learning. Suppose he must payv>0to raiseNby one.

25:851:61728:16:17:108:504:359:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ponents. At the same time, he disaggregates the payoffto reduce the amount of
25:852:61805:17:16:108:504:342:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information she can possibly wrest from any given component. In the limit, even
25:853:61884:16:17:108:504:326:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:what she can learn from the components she is capable of studying becomes so trivial
25:854:61968:17:16:108:504:309:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that it no longer affects her decision: She chooses what she would have chosen with-

25:858:62285:16:17:108:504:244:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:overload — it can eradicate all intended welfare gains from mandated information
25:859:62365:17:31:108:414:227:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:provision, even if the mandate prohibits unclear communication.
25:860:62428:31:17:108:504:196:119:g_d0_f12:119:g_d0_f3:B:Complexification in practiceAccording to Edward L. Yingling, president and
25:861:62502:17:16:108:504:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:chief executive of the American Bankers Association (ABA), during his first term
25:862:62582:16:17:108:504:163:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Obama urged credit card companies “to issue asimplecredit card product” (emphasis
25:863:62663:17:16:108:504:146:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:added). A year earlier, after similar comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.

26:866:62910:0:17:108:440:673:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:representatives had signaled strong opposition to such interventions.24
26:867:62981:17:16:124:503:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The UK financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), is also
26:868:63056:16:24:108:190:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:quoted as saying:
26:869:63073:24:16:151:476:616:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:[P]roviders of financial products may gain from the lack of price trans-
26:870:63145:16:17:135:476:600:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:parency about their products. [. . . ] It may be in the provider’s interest
26:871:63220:17:24:135:373:583:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:to increase the complexity of the product charges.
26:872:63270:24:16:108:504:559:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Other examples of complexification come from the food industry, where legislation
26:873:63351:16:16:108:504:543:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mandates that all ingredients be listed in a food declaration; however, “incidental
26:874:63434:16:17:108:504:527:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:additives” need not be listed.  This has provided food producers with incentives
26:875:63514:17:16:108:504:510:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for complexification, most prominently by removing an ingredient that consumers
26:876:63593:16:17:108:504:494:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:may be want to avoid, and replacing it with one or several incidental additives that
26:877:63677:17:16:108:503:477:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:accomplish the same effect in food but that remain invisible (provided each of them
26:878:63760:16:17:108:504:461:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:is included in small enough a quantity). A recent example is Starbuck’s use of a color
26:879:63846:17:16:108:504:444:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:additive derived from the animal world classified as an incidental additive instead of
26:880:63932:16:17:108:504:428:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:an ingredient, which effectively caused a non-vegan product to be labeled vegan and
26:881:64015:17:16:108:504:411:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:caused a stir among vegan consumers.25Similarly, widespread consumer awareness
26:882:64093:16:16:108:504:395:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of the dangers of BPA has spurred development of a new range of plastic products
26:883:64173:16:17:108:504:379:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:labelled “BPA Free”; however, these products contain BPA replacement substances
26:884:64252:17:16:108:503:362:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:that have produced health problems similar to those associated with BPA itself.26
26:885:64333:16:17:108:504:346:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Clearly, in the absence of mandated disclosure of the ingredients in food, none of
26:886:64415:17:16:108:504:329:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:these complexifications was necessary; in the presence of this disclosure rule, however,
26:887:64503:16:17:108:433:313:119:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f6:B:they represented strategic responses on the part of food producers.27
26:888:64572:17:16:124:503:296:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:As opposed to the examples presented in the previous subsection, which showed
26:889:64649:16:16:108:503:280:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:manipulation of the complexity ofinformation, the examples provided here refer to

26:902:65622:11:10:108:504:118:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:how food product design reflects the introduction of various types of labeling regulations with great

27:906:65849:16:17:124:503:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:However, while complexity of information has a simple legislative recipe man-
27:907:65926:17:16:108:504:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:dating that firms provide easy-to-understand information, complexification is much
27:908:66008:16:17:108:504:607:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:harder to address from a legislative perspective. In fact, Proposition4, along with
27:909:66091:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the real-world examples of complexification presented in this subsection, underscore
27:910:66175:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that even the most elaborate disclosure rule – which specifies exactly how easy-to-
27:911:66258:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:understand-information should be provided – may be completely ineffective for the
27:912:66339:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:consumer. This is becauseanyregulation at the communication level proves futile
27:913:66418:16:17:108:503:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:if the seller can modify theobjectof communication in a way that makes it intel-

27:915:66582:16:17:108:504:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:communication is correct, the matter to be decided becomes too complicated. In
27:916:66660:17:16:108:503:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:such a case, to be effective, regulation may have to target the object of communi-

27:918:66825:17:38:108:175:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:thornier issue.
27:919:66840:38:27:108:207:404:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:C:4  Conclusion
27:920:66853:27:16:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Limits on consumer attention limitations give firms incentives to manipulate prospec-
27:921:66938:16:17:108:504:361:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tive buyers’ allocation of their attention. To the best of my knowledge, this paper
27:922:67021:17:16:108:504:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:is the first to model such attention manipulation. In its presence, competitive in-
27:923:67104:16:17:108:504:328:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:formation supply can reduce consumer knowledge by causing information overload.
27:924:67183:17:16:108:504:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, a single firm subjected to a disclosure mandate may deliberately induce
27:925:67264:16:17:108:504:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:information overload to obfuscate financially relevant information, or engage in prod-
27:926:67350:17:16:108:383:278:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:uct complexification to bound consumer financial literacy.
27:927:67408:16:16:124:505:262:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:These findings demonstrate that attention limitations matter crucially for whether
27:928:67490:16:17:108:504:246:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disclosure regulation improves consumer welfare: Disclosure rules that would improve
27:929:67574:17:16:108:504:229:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:welfare for agents without attention limitations can prove ineffective for consumers
27:930:67658:16:17:108:504:213:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with limited attention. Obfuscation suggests a role for rules that mandate not only
27:931:67741:17:16:108:504:196:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the content but also the format of disclosure; however, even rules that mandate dis-
27:932:67825:16:17:108:503:180:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:closure of “easy-to-understand” information are ineffective against complexification,
27:933:67910:17:16:108:336:163:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:which may call for regulation of product design.
27:934:67958:16:17:124:503:147:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:An interesting avenue, not pursued in the present paper, is that heterogeneity in
27:935:68039:17:16:108:504:130:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention constraints may provoke multiple forms or degrees of attention manipula-
27:936:68121:16:0:108:503:114:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tion.Banerjee and Mullainathan(2008) posit that the poor are subject to tighter
28:937:68202:0:17:108:504:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention constraints than the rich, who can afford better technologies to free up
28:938:68284:17:16:108:504:656:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention. They then show that this induces differences in productivity that amplify
28:939:68368:16:17:108:503:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the differences in initial endowment; inequality breeds more inequality.Allcott and

28:942:68606:17:16:108:504:590:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:show that lower-income individuals have more severe attention limitations. The cur-
28:943:68689:16:17:108:504:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:rent paper’s findings suggest that the problem may be even worse: The poor may
28:944:68767:17:16:108:504:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:not only start out with tighter attention constraints, but may also find their limited
28:945:68853:16:16:108:504:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attention exploited more than the rich. In short, the tighter constraints may make
28:946:68935:16:17:108:504:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:them less productiveand more manipulable. Manipulation is perhaps the more wor-

37:1170:81048:17:16:124:503:231:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f18:A:Second, we show that there exists a unique interior equilibrium. Definingg(r1)≡

38:1182:81651:29:17:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:By (9), whenr1tends to one, LHS of (7) tends to zero and RHS is strictly greater

38:1187:82049:16:17:124:503:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:From the above two steps, we conclude that the unique interior equilibrium

40:1263:86342:17:16:108:504:150:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the DM, an increase inαraises the probability that a trade will occur. In addition
40:1264:86424:16:17:108:503:134:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to this direct effect, an increase inα1affects Expert1because the optimal efforts
40:1265:86505:17:0:108:416:117:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:change. I show that this second effect reinforces the direct effect.
41:1266:86575:0:17:124:530:673:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f18:A:We start fromα1=αL<α∗, and the associated equilibrium(r∗1(αL),s∗1(αL),s∗2(αL))∈
41:1267:86654:17:16:108:503:656:119:g_d0_f14:119:g_d0_f3:B:(0,1)3(for a givenα2). I compare Expert1’s expected utility in this equilibrium to
41:1268:86736:16:17:108:504:640:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that in an equilibrium whereα1=αH=αL+ε,αH<α∗. The equilibrium asso-
41:1269:86803:17:16:108:503:623:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ciated withαH,(r∗1(αH),s∗1(αH),s∗2(αH))∈(0,1)3, satisfiesr∗1(αH)>r∗1(αL)and
41:1270:86878:16:17:108:503:607:119:g_d0_f13:119:g_d0_f3:B:s∗1(αH)>s∗1(αL). Whenα1≤α∗, for a given level of effort on the part of Expert
41:1271:86955:17:16:108:503:590:119:g_d0_f14:119:g_d0_f3:B:1, his expected utility is increasing with the attention that he gets from the DM.
41:1272:87037:16:17:108:503:574:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f14:B:Thus, even if Expert1’s effort were held fixed ats∗1(αL)whenα1=αH, Expert1
41:1273:87111:17:16:108:503:557:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:would be strictly better offgetting attentionr∗1(αH)from the receiver than getting
41:1274:87193:16:16:108:503:541:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attentionr∗1(αL)<r∗1(αH). Clearly, then, Expert1is strictly better offin the equi-
41:1275:87275:16:17:108:503:525:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:librium associated withαH—where the DM devotes attentionr∗1(αH)to him and
41:1276:87348:17:16:108:503:508:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:he plays his best reply,s∗1(αH)—than in the equilibrium associated withαL. Hence,
41:1277:87429:16:17:108:503:492:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the expected utility of Expert1in equilibrium increases withα1forα1∈(0,α∗).
41:1278:87504:17:16:108:504:475:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Because all best reply functions and utility functions are continuous, the expected
41:1279:87587:16:17:108:247:459:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:utility increases continuously.
41:1280:87618:17:16:124:504:442:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Whenα1>α∗, his expected utility is decreasing with the attention that he gets
41:1281:87695:16:16:108:504:426:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:from the DM. Sender1’s effort is fixed at zero whenα1>α∗; and the DM’s attention
41:1282:87775:16:17:108:504:410:119:g_d0_f13:119:g_d0_f3:B:r∗1(α1)is decreasing withα1.  Thus, asα1increases, Expert1’s expected utility
41:1283:87852:17:16:108:504:393:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:increases because he gets less (undesirable) attention from the receiver.  Because
41:1284:87934:16:17:108:504:377:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:all best reply functions and utility functions are continuous, the expected utility
41:1285:88017:17:16:108:217:360:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:decreases continuously.
41:1286:88040:16:17:124:503:344:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Atα∗, Expert1’s effort cost drops discontinuously (to zero); moreover, the at-
41:1287:88118:17:16:108:504:327:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tention he receives drops discontinuously as the DM’s decision rule changes from an
41:1288:88201:16:16:108:504:311:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:opt-in to an opt-out rule. Both of these changes raise Expert1’s expected utility
41:1289:88282:16:32:108:183:295:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:discontinuously.

49:1990:101063:16:32:108:258:633:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she identifies the relevant topic.

49:1992:101169:17:16:108:503:584:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:first cue that the DM assimilates. She incurs the costqR.Withprobability1/k,
49:1993:101245:16:16:108:504:568:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she finds the relevant topic, and devotes all of her attention to this topic.  With

49:1995:101409:17:16:108:503:535:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:always assimilates a second cue: the cost of assimilation is stillqR; however, the

49:1999:101741:17:31:108:418:469:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:she continues to assimilate cues until she finds the relevant topic.
