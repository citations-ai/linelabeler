2:24:1167:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper investigates whether the minimum wage leads to inefficient job rationing. By not allowing
2:25:1267:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:wages to clear the labor market, the minimum wage could cause workers with low reservation wages
2:26:1363:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:to be rationed out while equally skilled workers with higher reservation wages are employed.  This
2:27:1461:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:paper exploits the overlapping nature of the CPS panels to more precisely identify those most affected
2:28:1563:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:by the minimum wage, a group I refer to as the "unskilled." I test for inefficient rationing by examining
2:29:1668:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:whether the reservation wages of employed unskilled workers in states where the 1990-1991 federal
2:30:1765:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:minimum wage increase had the largest impact rose relative to reservation wages of unskilled workers
2:31:1865:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:in other states.  I find that reservation wages of unskilled workers in high-impact states did not rise
2:32:1968:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:relative to reservation wages in other states, indicating that the increase in the minimum wage did
2:33:2067:14:28:72:289:462:12:Times:12:Times:not cause jobs to be allocated less efficiently.

3:41:2256:0:27:72:155:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:1.  Introduction 
3:42:2272:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Debates about  the  minimum  wage  tend to center  on the  relative  magnitudes  of  its 
3:43:2361:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:redistributive benefits and unemployment costs.  The debate about the employment effects of the 
3:44:2457:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum  wage  has  been  especially  heated  (see, Burkhauser  et  al.,  2000;  Card,  1992;  Card  and 
3:45:2562:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Krueger,  1994,  1995;  Card  et  al.,  1994;  Deere  et  al.,  1995;  Katz  and Krueger,  1992;  Neumark 
3:46:2668:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Wascher,  1992,  1994,  2000;  and Singell  and  Terborg  2005).    Brown  (1999)  and  Neumark 
3:47:2768:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Wascher  (2007)  give  comprehensive  overviews  of  the  debate  of  the  possible  employment 
3:48:2868:28:27:72:212:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cost of the minimum wage.   
3:49:2895:27:28:108:546:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However,  the  costs  of  the  minimum  wage  are  not  necessarily  limited  to  unemployment.  
3:50:2992:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The  minimum  wage  also  interferes  with  the  allocative  function of  the  labor  market  and could 
3:51:3096:28:27:72:546:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:thus lead to an inefficient allocation of workers to jobs (Friedman and Stigler, 1946; Lott, 1990).  
3:52:3197:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Even  if  the  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  has  no impact  on total  employment,  it  can  cause 
3:53:3300:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inefficient rationing.  This happens if workers who were unwilling to work at the old and lower 
3:54:3396:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum  wage  displace  current  workers  of  the  same skill  level.    In  this  case,  workers  with 
3:55:3501:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wages below the old minimum wage are replaced by workers with reservation wages 
3:56:3593:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:above the old minimum wage.  The deadweight loss of such inefficient rationing is equal to the 
3:57:3688:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difference  between  the  reservation wages  of  these  two  types  of  workers  and,  as  Glaeser  and 
3:58:3791:28:27:72:441:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Luttmer (2003) point out, this deadweight loss is typically a first-order loss.  
3:59:3871:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Theory  cannot  tell  us a  priori  whether  rationing  will  be  efficient  or  not.    Rationing is 
3:60:3973:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:efficient  if, for  each  group of  people  with  the  same marginal  product,  all  non-employed  people 
3:61:4079:28:27:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have a reservation wage that equals or exceeds the reservation wage of any employed person.  In 
3:62:4175:27:0:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other  words,  it  must  be  impossible  to  increase  social  welfare  by interchanging employed  and 
4:63:4278:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:non-employed  individuals  with the  same  skill  level.1   This  concept  of  efficient  rationing takes 
4:64:4384:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employment  at  each  level  of  skill  as  given  and ignores  other  potentially  important  costs  of  the 
4:65:4494:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rationing process itself such as queuing costs (see Barzel, 1974, and Suen, 1989). Rationing may 
4:66:4591:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:result in an efficient job allocation if those with the lowest reservation wages are willing to spend 
4:67:4693:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more  effort  in  activities  that  increase  the  chance  of  getting a  job.    However, rationing will  be 
4:68:4803:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inefficient if employers randomly select employees with heterogeneous reservation wages from 
4:69:4895:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:an excess supply of potential employees of the same skill. Inefficient rationing also results if, for 
4:70:4997:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:some reason, those with high reservation wages have an edge in obtaining jobs over persons with 
4:71:5093:27:28:72:189:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:low reservation wages.2 
4:72:5116:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: This paper examines empirically whether higher minimum wages reduce the efficiency of 
4:73:5202:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  allocation of  jobs.3  Misallocation and  rent-seeking costs  of  price  controls  have  been 
4:74:5301:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:empirically  estimated  in  other  settings,  most  notably  for  the  gasoline  market by  Deacon  and 
4:75:5404:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Sonstelie (1989) and Frech and Lee (1987), for the housing rental market by Glaeser and Luttmer 
4:76:5500:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(2003), and for the natural gas market by Davis and Killian (2007).  Linneman (1982) and Lang 
4:77:5594:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Kahn (1998) give evidence that minimum wages affect the composition of employment, thus 
4:78:5685:28:27:72:543:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hinting that the rationing process may favor certain types of workers. Palda (2000) simulates the 
4:79:5783:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deadweight loss of rationing under the assumption that rationing is random.  To my knowledge, 
4:80:5877:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:however,  this  is  the  first  study that  empirically  examines  whether  the  minimum  wage  leads  to 
4:81:5983:27:51:72:198:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inefficient job rationing.   
4:82:6011:51:7:72:218:161:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
4:83:6071:7:15:72:516:154:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:1 The benefit of using a rationing concept that takes employment at each skill level as given is that it eliminates the need to 
4:84:6198:15:10:72:533:139:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:estimate the effect of a change in employment at one skill level on the marginal product of workers of other skill levels who are 
4:85:6328:10:7:72:270:129:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:substitutes or complements in the production function. 
4:86:6382:7:15:72:523:122:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:2 For example, this could be the case if persons who live in a household with another working adult both have relatively high 
4:87:6507:15:7:72:498:107:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:reservation wages and have an edge in getting a job due to the connections of the working member in their household. 
4:88:6623:7:15:72:539:100:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:3 Holzer, Katz and Krueger (1991) find that minimum wage jobs attract more applicants than jobs that pay either slightly more or 
4:89:6751:15:0:72:424:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:slightly less.  This constitutes the most direct evidence that the minimum wage leads to rationing. 
5:90:6851:0:27:108:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Because  the  minimum  wage  is  only  binding for  a  relatively  small  group of  unskilled 
5:91:6945:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals,  it  is  necessary  to  accurately  identify  these  individuals  in  order  to  obtain  precise 
5:92:7055:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimates  of  minimum-wage  effects.    This  paper  develops  a  novel  measure  of  skill  to  identify 
5:93:7162:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these individuals.  Rather than measuring skill by characteristics such as age, education, industry 
5:94:7262:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:or  occupation,  this  paper  uses  market  wages.    For  a  given  state  and  year,  a  person’s  wage  is  a 
5:95:7375:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reflection of her skill as valued by the market.  Over time, however, the wage that a person with 
5:96:7473:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a constant skill level earns may change for many reasons such as changes in technology or in the 
5:97:7570:28:27:72:539:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage.  Thus, to use the wage as a measure of skill, it is important to net out these state-
5:98:7669:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specific  changes  in  the  returns  to  skill.    I  exploit the  panel  nature  of  the  Current  Population 
5:99:7780:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Survey (CPS) to estimate state-specific changes in returns to skill and use these estimates to infer 
5:100:7881:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skill from wages in different years. Using these wage-based skill measures, I divide the working 
5:101:7977:27:28:72:545:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population into four skill groups: an unskilled, a low skilled, a semi-skilled and a skilled group.  
5:102:8078:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The skill levels of these groups correspond respectively to the first, second, third, and top seven 
5:103:8178:27:28:72:311:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage deciles of the 1989 state wage distribution.  
5:104:8227:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The 1990/91 federal minimum wage increase (from $3.45 to $4.25) had a greater impact 
5:105:8312:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in some states than in others because of differences in state minimum wages, skill composition, 
5:106:8407:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and nominal  returns  to  skill.  I  measure  the  degree  of  the  impact  by the  fraction of  workers  in 
5:107:8516:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:each  state earning from  $3.35 to  $4.24  per  hour  in  1989.    The  impact  of  the  federal  minimum 
5:108:8620:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage increase varied not only across state, but also across skill groups within a given state.  I use 
5:109:8722:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these differences across skill groups as a specification check on the estimates of the efficiency of 
5:110:8823:28:27:72:139:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:job rationing. 
5:111:8837:27:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Using data from the merged outgoing rotation groups of the Current Population Survey of 
5:112:8925:28:0:72:542:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1989 and 1992, I find that employment for the unskilled group fell significantly in states where 
6:113:9023:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the minimum wage impact was large compared to states where it was relatively small.  However, 
6:114:9117:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this  employment  reduction seems  to  be  largely offset  by increased  employment  among low-

6:116:9324:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that, for a more broadly defined group of less skilled workers (which includes both unskilled and 
6:117:9421:28:28:72:430:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:low-skilled workers), no large negative employment impact can be found. 
6:118:9492:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Because  reservation wages  are  not  available  in  the  CPS,  I  instead  use  proxies  that are 
6:119:9591:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:likely to be correlated with reservation wages within skill groups, such as the potential income of 
6:120:9691:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other household members. In a scenario with inefficient rationing, the average reservation wage 
6:121:9787:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  unskilled  workers  rises  as  the  minimum  wage  enables  individuals  with  higher  reservation 
6:122:9890:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wages  to  displace  workers  with  lower  reservation wages.4  I  find,  however,  that  the  average 
6:123:9993:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wage  of  unskilled  workers  fell  between  1989 and 1992 in  the  states  where  the 
6:124:10092:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum  wage  had the  greatest  impact  relative  to other  states.    This  fall  in the  average 
6:125:10193:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wage is  statistically  significant  for  two  of  the  four  reservation wage  proxies,  and 
6:126:10299:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cannot be explained by changes in the level of employment of unskilled workers.  This finding 
6:127:10393:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggests  that  the  minimum  wage  increase  did  not  lead  to  inefficient  rationing.    The  average 
6:128:10499:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wage  proxies  did  not  fall  significantly  for  any of  the  other  skill  groups  in  the  high 
6:129:10611:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact  states,  but  showed  a  significant  increase  in  some  cases.    Given  these  results,  it  seems 
6:130:10721:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unlikely that exogenous state-specific shocks to reservation wage proxies can explain the relative 
6:131:10820:27:28:72:379:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decrease in the average reservation wage of unskilled workers.  
6:132:10883:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: A  caveat  to  these  results  is  that  they  are  based  on  a  relatively  modest  minimum  wage 
6:133:10983:28:27:72:542:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase  and only  examine  changes  in  the  allocation of  jobs  over  a  four-year  period.  They 
6:134:11085:27:22:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:therefore do not rule out the possibility that the minimum wage could lead to inefficient rationing 
6:135:11185:22:7:72:218:107:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
6:136:11245:7:15:72:536:100:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:4 Using self-reported reservation wages from another data set, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find empirical support for 
6:137:11372:15:0:72:179:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the reservation wage proxies. 
7:138:11402:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:over  a  longer  time  period or  that  a  larger  minimum  wage  increase  could  cause  inefficient 
7:139:11504:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rationing. While  the  lack  of  evidence of  inefficient  rationing  bears  favorably  on the  minimum 
7:140:11606:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage as an instrument for income redistribution, the estimates of the employment effects of the 
7:141:11702:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage suggest caution. I find that employment among the unskilled drops significantly 
7:142:11795:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in states where the minimum wage had the greatest impact. This loss in employment seems to be 
7:143:11889:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:largely  offset  by a  gain  in  employment  among the  low  skilled.  Hence,  while  total  employment 
7:144:11993:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:may not be significantly affected, some of the poorest members of society are likely to be hurt by

7:147:12109:28:28:72:212:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2.  Theoretical Framework 
7:148:12134:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: It has long been known that one of the potential costs of imposing wage or price controls 
7:149:12224:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is  that  jobs  or  goods  may  no longer  be  allocated  to  those  who value  them  most  (Friedman  and 
7:150:12330:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Stigler, 1946).    Various  authors  have  presented  theoretical  analyses  of  misallocation and rent-
7:151:12434:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:seeking costs of controls that prevent prices from clearing the market (Barzel, 1974; Weitzman, 
7:152:12530:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1977;  Suen,  1989;  and Palda,  2000).   Building  on this  work,  I  present  a  simple  theoretical 
7:153:12633:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:framework that  generates  predictions  that  will  enable  us  to  draw  inferences  from  the  empirical 
7:154:12740:27:28:72:270:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results about the efficiency of rationing.  
7:155:12782:28:27:108:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The efficiency of rationing is a concern in markets in which there is heterogeneity across 
7:156:12873:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals in their valuation of the good (or job). If all individuals had the same valuation, any 
7:157:12971:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:allocation across individuals would be equally efficient.  In the labor market, the degree to which 
7:158:13071:28:27:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:an individual values a job is given by her reservation wage for that job.  For simplicity, I assume 
7:159:13171:27:0:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that jobs are homogeneous.  This implies that an individual’s reservation wage is the same for all 
8:160:13271:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:jobs,  which rules  out  efficiency losses  from misallocation within a  given set  of  working 
8:161:13366:27:28:72:275:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals and a given number of jobs.5   
8:162:13408:28:27:108:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Consider  a  segment  of  the  labor  market  in  which  all  individuals  have  the  same  level  of 
8:163:13510:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skill,  i.e.  are  equally  productive  from  the  perspective  of  a  firm.6  Let  there  be  a  continuum  of 
8:164:13622:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these individuals, who are indexed by their reservation wage θ.7 Their cumulative distribution is 
8:165:13720:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:given  by G(θ)  and their  density  by g(θ).    Each  individual  either  works  full-time  or  is  not 
8:166:13823:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employed.  To measure the efficiency of the allocation of these individuals to a given number of 
8:167:13920:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:jobs, it is useful to introduce an allocation function p(θ).  This function denotes for each value of 
8:168:14022:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f1:θ the fraction of individuals with that reservation wage holding a job.  An efficient allocation of 
8:169:14122:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:jobs requires and implies that every person holding a job values this job more than any individual 
8:170:14221:28:27:72:181:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:without a job.  Hence:

8:189:14712:7:15:72:535:175:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:5 In the case of heterogeneous jobs, even if the people with the lowest reservation wages obtain jobs, they might not be matched 
8:190:14840:15:11:72:537:160:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:to the jobs that they value most.  This type of misallocation can be an additional efficiency cost of price controls.  I cannot test if 
8:191:14976:11:10:72:525:149:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:the allocation of workers across jobs is efficient, because that also requires information about job characteristics, which is not 
8:192:15107:10:10:72:533:139:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:available in the data used.  However, Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) find that this type of misallocation constitutes a large fraction 
8:193:15238:10:7:72:222:129:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:of the misallocation costs of rent-control. 
8:194:15281:7:15:72:530:122:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:6 This assumption will be relaxed later to analyze how the imposition of a minimum wage can affect skill groups for which the 
8:195:15406:15:7:72:184:107:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:minimum wage is not binding. 
8:196:15434:7:15:72:537:100:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:7 I assume that the private reservation wage equals the social reservation wage.  In other words, there is no externality from a job

9:240:16425:14:28:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Equation 3  shows  that  changes  in  the  average  reservation wage  of  working individuals  that 
9:241:16525:28:27:72:543:349:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cannot  be  explained  by changes  in  employment  indicate  a  change  in  the  efficiency  with  which 
9:242:16630:27:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:jobs  are  allocated.    To  investigate  whether  the  minimum  wage  causes  inefficient  rationing,  the 
9:243:16738:28:27:72:543:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change in the average reservation wage of working individuals is regressed on the impact of the 
9:244:16834:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage and a control for changes in employment.  A positive coefficient on the impact 
9:245:16926:28:28:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  the  minimum  wage  on reservation wage  indicates  that  a  minimum  wage  increase  leads  to  a 
9:246:17029:28:27:72:266:211:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher deadweight loss of job rationing. 
9:247:17069:27:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In  a  labor  market  with  multiple  segments,  each  consisting of  workers  with  roughly  the 
9:248:17167:28:27:72:542:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:same level of skill, this analysis can be  extended  to apply to each segment.  Because labor of a 
9:249:17266:27:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:certain skill level may be a complement or substitute for labor of other skill levels, employment 
9:250:17364:28:0:72:543:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:changes in one segment may affect labor demand in the other segments. Through this mechanism 
10:251:17457:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  effects  of  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage will  not remain  limited  to those  skill  segments 
10:252:17565:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:where  the  increase  is  binding.    If  the  minimum  wage  reduces  employment  in  the  unskilled 
10:253:17667:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:segment, and labor demand is not completely inelastic, then labor demand will increase for those 
10:254:17764:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skill  levels  which  are  substitutes  for  the  unskilled  workers.    It  is  plausible  that  the  closest 
10:255:17875:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substitutes  for  the  unskilled  workers  are  low-skilled  workers.    In  this  case,  demand for  low-
10:256:17981:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skilled workers would increase, possibly increasing their wages such that the minimum wage is 
10:257:18075:27:28:72:207:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:no longer binding for them. 
10:258:18102:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: If  nearby skill  groups  are  sufficiently  close  substitutes,  the  links  between  the  different 
10:259:18204:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skill  segments of  the  labor  market  have two  important  implications.   First,  rationing  only  takes 
10:260:18312:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:place  among unskilled  workers.   Therefore,  it  is  important  to  accurately  identify  the  unskilled 
10:261:18419:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:when  testing for  changes  in  the  efficiency  of  rationing.   Second, the  employment  effects  of the 
10:262:18526:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage are likely to be of opposite signs for unskilled and low-skilled workers.  Hence, 
10:263:18621:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the measured employment effects of the minimum wage on a group of workers that includes both 
10:264:18714:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are  likely  to  be  less  pronounced.    This,  too,  suggests  that  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  precise 
10:265:18825:28:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure  of  skill  to  estimate  whether  the  minimum  wage  causes  a  loss  of  jobs  among the 
10:266:18925:28:27:72:178:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled individuals.

10:272:18990:28:27:72:543:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The  empirical  methodology consists  of  two  main  steps.   The  first  step  estimates  wage 
10:273:19086:27:28:72:543:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:evolution curves which are needed to construct the wage-based  skill measure.  The second step 
10:274:19181:28:0:72:542:115:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimates how the increase in the federal minimum wage affected employment and the efficiency 
11:275:19277:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of rationing of unskilled individuals.  Because only the first step requires that individuals appear 
11:276:19378:27:28:72:420:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in two consecutive years, different samples are used for these two steps. 
11:277:19451:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The data used to estimate the wage evolution curves come from the NBER extracts of the 
11:278:19538:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:merged  outgoing rotation groups  of  the  Current  Population Survey  for  1989 to  1992.  Because 
11:279:19638:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:approximately half the individuals who are in the outgoing rotation group in one year reappear in 
11:280:19736:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  outgoing rotation group next  year,  it  is  possible  to  construct  three  overlapping panels  by 
11:281:19841:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:matching individuals who appear in two consecutive years.  Each panel contains approximately 
11:282:19934:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:115,000 persons,  consisting of  individuals  that  are  matched  in  two  consecutive  years.   Because 
11:283:20039:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:many of these individuals, especially those over 65, have a missing or allocated wage in one or 
11:284:20135:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:both years, the sample on which the wage evolution curves are based consists of approximately 
11:285:20229:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:45,000 individuals in each of the three overlapping panels.  Appendix A describes the matching 
11:286:20324:27:28:72:126:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:procedure. 
11:287:20334:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The  CPS  merged  outgoing rotation  groups  also  provide  the  sample  used  to  examine  the 
11:288:20430:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects  of  the  minimum  wage  on  employment  and the  efficiency  of  rationing.    This  sample 
11:289:20531:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:combines the outgoing rotation groups from 1989 with those from 1992.  The sample is limited 
11:290:20624:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to individuals between the ages of 16 and 65 and excludes working people with missing wages, 
11:291:20717:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:allocated wages or wages below $1.00/hr (which are likely to be measurement error).  The wage 
11:292:20811:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is  measured  as  the  hourly  wage  for  hourly  workers  and as  usual  weekly  earnings  divided  by 
11:293:20914:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:usual  weekly  hours  for  salaried  workers.    The  sample  size  for  1989 and 1992 combined  is 
11:294:21014:28:28:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:472,152 observations.  Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for the variables in this 
11:295:21111:28:27:72:111:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sample.

11:297:21118:28:0:72:219:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:3.2 Formation of Skill Groups 
12:298:21149:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Because the minimum wage mainly affects low-wage workers, the accuracy of estimates 
12:299:21233:27:28:72:493:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of minimum-wage effects increases with the precision with which these individuals are 
12:300:21319:28:27:72:504:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identified.  Researchers often use demographic characteristics such as education or age to 
12:301:21410:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identify these individuals. In the context of this paper, however, using age to identify low-wage 
12:302:21508:28:28:72:513:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers is problematic since age may also proxy for reservation wages.  I therefore use just 
12:303:21601:28:27:72:511:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education as the demographic characteristic to identify low-wage workers, and create three 
12:304:21691:27:28:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education groups: high school dropouts, high school graduates and those with some college or 
12:305:21784:28:27:72:105:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more.  
12:306:21790:27:28:108:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In order to identify those affected by the minimum wage more precisely than is possible 
12:307:21878:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with  education,  this  paper  develops  a  methodology that  exploits  wage  data  to  identify  these 
12:308:21982:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals.  If  we  define  skill  such  that  wages  are  strictly  increasing in  skill  within  each  state-
12:309:22095:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:year cell, the working population can be divided into skill groups based on their observed wages 
12:310:22192:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in  a  given  state  before  the  minimum  wage  increase.    However,  due  to  the  increase  in  the 
12:311:22296:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage and other shock to the labor market, the wages that correspond to each skill level 
12:312:22392:28:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:likely  change  over  time.    For  each  skill  group,  we  must  therefore  identify  those  individuals,  in 
12:313:22504:28:27:72:543:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the period after the minimum wage increase, who would have earned the same wage as members 
12:314:22595:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of that skill group in the period before the minimum wage increase.  Thus, to create groups with 
12:315:22692:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constant  skill  levels  over  time,  one  needs  to  know  the  1989 wage  and the1992 wage  that 
12:316:22791:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponds to each skill level. Plotting these two wages for all skill levels in a given state yields 
12:317:22894:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a so-called “wage-evolution” curve for that state. As illustrated in Figure 1, the wage evolution 
12:318:22991:28:27:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:curve tells us how the boundary wages between the skill groups in 1989 (w1,89, w2,89, and w3,89) 
12:319:23088:27:0:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correspond to  boundary  wages  in  1992  (w1,92, w2,92,  and w3,92).  These  boundary  wages  in  1992 
13:320:23193:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:can  then  be  used  to  construct  the  skill  groups  in  1992 that  have  the  same  level  of  skill  as  the 
13:321:23307:27:307:72:217:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponding group in 1989. 
13:322:23335:307:20:72:75:374:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
13:323:23335:20:28:108:543:354:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To construct   a   wage   evolution curve,   we   need two consecutive   years   of   wage 
13:324:23426:28:28:72:543:326:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observations  for  individuals  with  a  constant  skill  level.    It  seems  likely,  however,  that  the  skill 
13:325:23541:28:27:72:543:298:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level  of  workers  observed  in  two  consecutive  years  of  the  CPS  increases  because  their  work 
13:326:23646:27:28:72:543:271:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:experience  increases  by one  year.  To  correct  for  the  increase  in  the  wage  that  results  from  the 
13:327:23757:28:27:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase in experience, I estimate cross-section regressions of log wage on a spline in age.  I run 
13:328:23856:27:28:72:542:216:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:separate  regressions  with  state  fixed  effects  for  each  sex-race-education cell.8  The  sample  is 
13:329:23962:28:28:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:restricted  to  workers  with  wage  observations  in  both  years  to  ensure  compatibility  with  the

14:385:26135:28:17:72:542:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:procedure in reverse, which yields an estimate of the inverse of the wage evolution curve.  This

14:395:26724:11:11:78:532:106:97:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1: The breakpoints in the spline, ln κj, occur at hourly wages of $0.99, $ 3.34 $4.24, $5.49, $6.99, $8.49, $9.99, $12.49, $14.99,

15:400:27248:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:obtain an unbiased estimate of the wage evolution curve by combining the biased estimate of the

15:402:27449:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:above, three wage evolution curves are estimated for each state: for 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-
15:403:27544:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:92.    For  each  state,  these  three  curves  are  combined  to  form  a  single  wage  evolution curve  for 
15:404:27655:27:28:72:227:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1989 and 1992, as in Figure 1.   
15:405:27687:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3: The working population is divided into four skill groups: in 1989, the unskilled, the low 
15:406:27776:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:skilled, the semi-skilled and the skilled group consist respectively of workers in the first, second, 
15:407:27877:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:third and in the top seven deciles of the 1989 state wage distribution.  The wage evolution curve 
15:408:27975:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is  used  to  find the  1992 wages  that  separate  these  four  skill  levels.    In  1992,  workers  are 
15:409:28082:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:classified into the four skill groups based on their 1992 wage and these boundary wages.  Table 2 
15:410:28180:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shows  the  boundary  wages  that  separate  these  four  skill  groups  in  1989 and in  1992 for  each 
15:411:28285:27:28:72:99:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:state.

15:414:28320:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: For jobs to be  allocated efficiently within a group of equally skilled workers, they must 
15:415:28411:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be  allocated  to  those  individuals  who have  the  lowest  reservation wages.    Thus,  to  test  for 
15:416:28516:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inefficient job rationing, we need variables that are correlated with reservation wages conditional 
15:417:28616:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on skill level.  Based on theoretical considerations, I identify the following four reservation wage 
15:418:28717:28:18:72:113:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proxies: 
15:419:28725:18:7:72:218:138:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
15:420:28785:7:15:72:540:131:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:12 If the attenuation bias in the wage evolution curve and its inverse are the same, any point (x,y) on the unbiased curve will show 
15:421:28917:15:10:72:516:116:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:up as (x,y+v) on the biased wage evolution curve and as (x+v,y) on the biased inverse wage evolution curve, where v is the 
15:422:29040:10:11:72:534:106:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:attenuation bias at point (x,y).  The unbiased wage evolution curve can therefore be found by numerically determining the set of 
15:423:29169:11:10:72:522:95:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:points (x,y) for which there exists some v such that (x,y+v) lies on the biased wage evolution curve and (x+v,y) on the biased 
15:424:29296:10:0:72:181:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:inverse wage evolution curve. 
16:425:29327:0:27:90:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1)    Labor  earnings  of  other  household  members.    This  proxy variable  is  likely  to  be 
16:426:29426:27:28:90:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:positively correlated with reservation wages because the hardship of non-employment tends 
16:427:29516:28:27:90:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to  be  lower  if  other  household  members  have  more  income.    Ideally  non-labor  earnings  of 
16:428:29618:27:28:90:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other  household  members  would  also  be  included  but  they  are  not  available  in  the  CPS

16:431:29837:27:28:90:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to be positively correlated with reservation wages because the value of household production 
16:432:29930:28:27:90:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is likely to be higher if other household members are spending time at work.  Moreover, the 
16:433:30022:27:28:90:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hardship  of  non-employment  is  likely  to  be  lower  because  the  other  household  members 
16:434:30119:28:28:90:176:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:provide earnings. 
16:435:30136:28:27:90:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(3)  The number of other adults in the household, where adults are defined as people aged 20 
16:436:30229:27:28:90:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and older.  Because  other  adult  household members  could potentially find a  reasonably 
16:437:30320:28:27:90:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:paying job,  this  variable  is  likely  to  be  positively  correlated  with  reservation wages  for  the 
16:438:30427:27:28:90:217:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reasons mentioned above. 
16:439:30451:28:28:90:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(4) Younger  than  30.    Teenagers  and people  in  their  twenties  are  likely  to  have  a  higher 
16:440:30554:28:27:90:543:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wage  (for  a  given  skill  level)  because  of  schooling opportunities  available  to 
16:441:30655:27:28:90:545:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:them, the possibility of parental support and fewer financial commitments such as mortgages.  
16:442:30748:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A number of surveys have asked individuals about their reservation wage; these responses can be 
16:443:30844:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:used to test  the  validity of  these  proxies.13  In practice,  three  important  issues  complicate 
16:444:30946:28:35:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:validating the  reservation wage  proxies.    First,  some  skepticism  seems  justified  concerning the 
16:445:31051:35:7:72:218:149:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
16:446:31111:7:16:72:530:142:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:13 Other studies have used self-reported reservation wages to analyze search behavior and the effects of government actions on 
16:447:31237:16:10:72:536:126:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:unemployment.  These studies include Kiefer and Neumann, 1979 (using a survey conducted by Pennsylvania State University), 
16:448:31360:10:10:72:520:116:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:Feldstein and Poterba, 1984 (using a 1976 CPS supplement), Holzer, 1986 (using the NLSY) and Jones, 1989 (using a 1982 
16:449:31479:10:11:72:530:106:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit).  As an alternative approach, Hofler and Murphy (1994) use a stochastic 
16:450:31604:11:10:72:530:95:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:frontier regression technique to infer reservation wages from a sample of employed workers.  None of these studies confirm or 
16:451:31730:10:0:72:321:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:reject the proposed proxies for reservation wage conditional on skill. 
17:452:31802:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:degree to which reservation wages can be measured by the answer to “What is the lowest wage 
17:453:31893:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:or salary you would accept on any job?”  Individuals may not know the answer, may engage in 
17:454:31985:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wishful  thinking,  or  may  understate  their  reservation wage  to  show  they  are  truly  unemployed 
17:455:32090:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and rightfully  claim  unemployment  benefits  (especially  if  they  believe  the  government  may 
17:456:32190:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:obtain their answer).  Moreover, the questions are usually vague about the job characteristics and 
17:457:32288:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:opportunities for further search.  Second, the question is typically asked of a select sample such 
17:458:32387:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as  unemployed individuals  who are  actively seeking work.    Third,  care  must  be  taken to 
17:459:32483:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adequately control for skill, otherwise reservation wage proxies may not reflect the individual’s 
17:460:32581:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time  and effort  costs  of  working but  merely  reflect  the  earnings  opportunities  corresponding to 
17:461:32687:28:28:72:286:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the unobserved skill level of that individual. 
17:462:32733:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Despite  these  caveats,  it  remains  valuable  to  examine  whether  these  reservation wage 
17:463:32828:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proxies  receive  empirical  support.    Using the  self-reported  reservation wages  from  the  Panel 
17:464:32931:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Study of Income Dynamics, I find that, conditional on skill, each of the four proxies is positively 
17:465:33031:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correlated with  self-reported reservation wages.    Moreover,  the  correlation is  statistically 
17:466:33130:28:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant at the 5% level for all but the third proxy (Nr. of other adults in the household).  The 
17:467:33231:28:27:72:339:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:validation results are described in detail in appendix B.

17:470:33359:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The  federal  minimum  wage  increased  from  $3.35/hr  to  $3.80/hr  in  April  1990  and was 
17:471:33454:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:raised to $4.25 in April 1991.  I measure the impact of the federal minimum wage increases on a 
17:472:33550:28:27:72:542:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:state by the fraction of workers in that state who earn an hourly wage between $3.35 and $4.24 in 
17:473:33648:27:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1989.  This impact measure is listed for each state in the first column of table 2 and varies from 
17:474:33746:28:0:72:543:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1.7%  for  Alaska  to  20.3%  for  Mississippi.    The  measure  is  similar  to  the  one  used  by Card 
18:475:33854:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1992),  except  that  he  only  considered teenage  workers,  whereas  my sample  includes  all 
18:476:33951:27:28:72:116:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers. 
18:477:33959:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The impact of the federal minimum wage differs, not only across states, but also across 
18:478:34047:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skill  groups.    In  particular,  the  impact  is  greatest  on unskilled  workers.    This  variation in  the 
18:479:34159:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact of the minimum wage increase across states and skill groups is used to test the effect of 
18:480:34256:28:27:72:300:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wages on the efficiency of rationing. 
18:481:34301:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Consider  an increase  in the  minimum  wage  in  a  state  where  employment  remains 
18:482:34387:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constant.  Under efficient rationing, the average reservation wage of the employed should not be 
18:483:34484:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:affected.  Under inefficient rationing, however, we would expect the average reservation wage of 
18:484:34581:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled  workers  to  increase  because  some  non-employed  people  with  high reservation wages 
18:485:34681:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:take  jobs  of  previously  employed  people  with  lower  reservation wages.    We  would  expect  the 
18:486:34785:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase  in  average  reservation wages  to  show  up  most  strongly  for  unskilled  workers  because 
18:487:34890:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the increase in the minimum wage affects them most.  Next, consider a minimum wage increase 
18:488:34982:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in a state where employment also changes.  Under efficient rationing, a decrease in employment 
18:489:35077:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:should decrease  the  average  reservation wage  of  workers  because  those  with the  highest 
18:490:35173:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wages  are  rationed  out.    Similarly,  an  increase  in  employment  should  raise  the 
18:491:35276:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:average  reservation wage  of  workers  under  efficient  rationing.    Inefficient  rationing,  however, 
18:492:35382:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:leads to a greater than predicted increase in reservation wages given the change in employment 
18:493:35477:27:28:72:183:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the unskilled group. 
18:494:35500:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To examine whether an increase in the minimum wage leads to inefficient rationing, the 
18:495:35587:28:27:72:218:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:following regressions are run: 
18:496:35617:27:22:72:75:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
18:497:35617:22:0:71:536:107:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f1:  !(reservation wage)sk="k+impacts#k+!employmentsk$k+vsk         (6) 
19:498:35680:0:13:72:75:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
19:499:35680:13:28:72:542:695:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:where s  indexes  states  and k  indexes  wage-based  skill  groups  or  education groups.    A  separate 
19:500:35786:28:27:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression is run for each of these groups.  The dependent variable is the change between 1989 
19:501:35880:27:28:72:542:640:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and 1992 in the average reservation wage (as measured by one of the four proxies) in group k in 
19:502:35976:28:28:72:542:612:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:state s.    The  key explanatory  variable  is impacts,  which  measures  the  impact  of  the  federal 
19:503:36080:28:27:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage increase on state s by the fraction of workers in that state earning between $3.35 
19:504:36176:27:28:72:542:557:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and $4.24 in  1989.    I  instrument impacts  by  its  own  value  lagged  one  year  to  rule  out the 
19:505:36279:28:27:72:542:529:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:possibility that any of the results are driven by random over or under sampling in 1989 of certain 
19:506:36378:27:28:72:542:502:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:subgroups  of  the  population.    Random  over  or  under  sampling of  subgroups  that constitute  a 
19:507:36480:28:28:72:543:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:disproportionate share of low-wage workers and have a higher or lower than average reservation 
19:508:36575:28:27:72:543:446:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage,  would  create  a  mechanical  correlation between impacts  and changes  in  the  reservation 
19:509:36674:27:28:72:543:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage  proxies. The  second independent  variable  is  Δgroupsizesk  ,  which  measures  the  change 
19:510:36773:28:27:72:543:391:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between  1989 and 1992 in  the  size  of  group k in  state s  as  a  fraction of  the  working-age 
19:511:36873:27:28:72:542:364:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population in that state.  This variable controls for any changes in the average reservation wage 
19:512:36971:28:28:72:542:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that can be attributed to changes in the group’s employment rate.  The error term is denoted by 
19:513:37067:28:27:72:90:308:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:vsk. 
19:514:37071:27:28:72:542:281:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Theory  predicts  that γk  should  be  positive  for  the employed  groups  and negative  for  the 
19:515:37170:28:27:72:542:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:non-employed  groups  if  the  efficiency  of  rationing remains constant.    If  the  minimum  wage 
19:516:37271:27:28:72:542:226:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase has no impact on the efficiency of rationing, theory predicts that βk should be zero for 
19:517:37369:28:28:72:543:198:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:all groups.  If the minimum wage increase exacerbates inefficient rationing, βk is positive for the 
19:518:37467:28:27:72:543:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled group but equal to zero for the other employed groups for whom the minimum wage is 
19:519:37560:27:28:72:542:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not  binding.    Under  inefficient  rationing,  the  average  reservation wage  of  non-employed 
19:520:37658:28:27:72:543:115:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled individuals   decreases.      However,   because   non-employed unskilled individuals 
19:521:37754:27:0:72:543:88:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constitute only a fraction of the non-employed group, it is doubtful that this effect can be tested 
20:522:37856:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:using the  estimate  of βk  for  the  non-employed  group.    Following from  these  predictions, 
20:523:37954:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimates  of βk  that  are  only  positive  for  unskilled  workers  but  not  for  the  other  groups  would 
20:524:38065:28:27:72:496:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:indicate that a minimum wage increase reduces the efficiency of the allocation of jobs.   
20:525:38154:27:28:108:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:For the education groups, theory predicts that inefficient rationing will lead to a positive 
20:526:38247:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f1:βk for the employed and that βk will be larger for less educated workers than for more educated 
20:527:38343:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers.    Under  inefficient  rationing, βk  will  be  negative  for  the  non-employed  and βk  will  be 
20:528:38450:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more  negative  for  less  educated  individuals.    Finally,  one  can  control  for  reservation-wage 
20:529:38554:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shocks  that  are  unrelated  to  the  minimum  wage  increase  and specific  to  education groups  and 
20:530:38657:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:states by taking the difference between the βk of employed and non-employed individuals in each 
20:531:38753:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education group.  Hence, under inefficient rationing, this difference (Δβk) should be positive and 
20:532:38852:28:27:72:203:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decreasing with education.

20:538:38935:28:28:72:542:320:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Before turning to the main question of whether the increase in the minimum wage led to

20:540:39126:27:28:72:542:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employment.  The estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on wages serve as a joint check 
20:541:39219:28:27:72:543:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on the  impact  measure  and  the  estimates  of  the  wage  evolution curves.    The  estimates  of  the 
20:542:39325:27:28:72:507:210:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact of the minimum wage on employment by skill level are of direct interest to policy. 
20:543:39414:28:28:72:543:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To examine whether wages evolved differently in states where the impact of the federal 
20:544:39501:28:27:72:465:154:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage increase was relatively large, the following regressions were run: 
20:545:39580:27:15:72:75:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
20:546:39580:15:0:72:543:112:144:g_d0_f30:144:g_d0_f1:Δwagesk = αk + impacts βk + εsk ,  (7) 
21:547:39618:0:13:72:75:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
21:548:39618:13:28:72:542:695:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:where Δwagesk is the change in the wage (in $) for a worker of skill k (as measured by the 1989 
21:549:39713:28:27:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage) in state s and impacts is the impact of the federal 1990/91 minimum wage increase on state 
21:550:39810:27:28:72:542:640:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:s  (as  measured  by the  fraction of  workers  in  1989  with  wages  between  $3.25 and  $4.24).    For 
21:551:39916:28:28:72:542:612:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:each skill level, a separate cross-section IV regression is run with 51 observations.  The impact 
21:552:40014:28:27:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure  is  instrumented  by its  own  lag  of  one  year  to  rule  out  the  possibility  of  a  mechanical 
21:553:40125:27:28:72:255:557:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correlation due to sampling variation. 
21:554:40163:28:27:72:543:529:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Figure 2 graphs the coefficients βk and the corresponding confidence intervals, which are 
21:555:40253:27:28:72:542:502:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:based on Huber/White   robust   standard errors.      The   figure   shows   that   the   coefficients 
21:556:40356:28:28:72:543:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponding to  skill  levels  of  $3.00 to  $3.35 are  not  significantly  different  from  zero.    This 
21:557:40465:28:27:72:543:446:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:result  should  come  as  no  surprise  because  the  wages  of  workers  in  these  skill  levels  must  be 
21:558:40574:27:28:72:542:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:raised  to  the  new  legal  minimum  of  $4.25 independently  of  the  fraction of  workers  who are 
21:559:40676:28:27:72:542:391:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:affected  by this  change.    The  coefficients  corresponding to  skill  levels  from  $4.00 to  $5.00 are 
21:560:40784:27:28:72:542:364:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significantly  positive.    This  finding is  consistent  with  the  case  that  workers  with  skill  levels  in 
21:561:40898:28:28:72:543:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  $4.00 to  $5.00 range  are  close  substitutes  for  workers  with  skill  levels  around $3.35.    In 
21:562:41006:28:27:72:542:308:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:states where a larger fraction of workers are affected by the minimum wage increase, one would 
21:563:41101:27:28:72:543:281:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:expect  a  bigger  drop in  employment  among unskilled  workers,  which  increases  the  wages  of 
21:564:41201:28:27:72:542:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers who are close substitutes for them.  The  magnitude of the coefficient, about 4, implies 
21:565:41298:27:28:72:543:226:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that the wages of workers with skill levels between $4.00 and $5.00 increased by about 75 cents 
21:566:41394:28:28:72:542:198:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more in the highest impact state, Mississippi, than in the lowest impact state, Alaska.  The wages 
21:567:41493:28:27:72:542:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  workers  of  skill  levels  corresponding to  $6.00  and up are  not  significantly  affected  by the 
21:568:41599:27:28:72:284:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact of the minimum wage on their state. 
21:569:41641:28:27:72:543:115:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To examine  the  effect  of  the  minimum  wage  increase  on employment,  I  classified 
21:570:41730:27:0:72:545:88:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals  into  wage-based  skill  groups  and into  education groups,  as  described  in  section 2.  
22:571:41838:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Table  3a  shows  the  summary  statistics  for  the  4  wage-based  skill  groups  and for  the  group of 
22:572:41945:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:non-employed individuals.    This  table  shows  that  unskilled workers  are  disproportionately 
22:573:42043:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:young,  female,  single  and less  educated  and  live  in  households  with  more  other  adults.    While 
22:574:42151:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled workers have the highest rate of high school dropouts, the other skill groups still have 
22:575:42250:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substantial  high school  dropout  rates.    The  same  holds  for  the  other  dimensions  along which 
22:576:42354:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled  workers  are  over-represented.    This  implies  that  skill  groups  based  on any of  these 
22:577:42460:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other variables would span a relatively large range of skills as measured by the wage employers 
22:578:42556:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are  willing to  pay  these  individuals.    Table  3b shows  the  summary  statistics  for  the  education 
22:579:42663:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:groups.  It shows that employed high school dropouts are disproportionately young, male, black, 
22:580:42759:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:single  and from  households  with  more  other  adults.    This  reveals  some  striking differences 
22:581:42861:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between the high school dropouts and the unskilled.  High school dropouts are disproportionately 
22:582:42958:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:male whereas unskilled workers are disproportionately female.  Unskilled workers are also much 
22:583:43053:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:younger and more often single than high school dropouts.  Finally, the fact that less than 25% of 
22:584:43151:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  high school  dropouts  earn  wages  in  the  bottom  wage  decile  implies  that  even  high  school 
22:585:43256:28:28:72:397:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dropouts span a considerable range of skills as measured by wages. 
22:586:43322:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 4 shows how the level of employment for each skill group is affected by the impact 
22:587:43411:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  the  federal  minimum  wage  increase.    Panel  A  shows  the  results  for  the  wage-based  skill 
22:588:43516:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:groups.  It shows that the unskilled experienced a large and significant decline in employment in 
22:589:43614:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:states  where  more  workers  were  covered  by the  federal  minimum  wage  increase  compared  to 
22:590:43714:28:28:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other  states.    Employment  among the  low  skilled,  in  contrast,  showed  a  significant  increase  in 
22:591:43822:28:38:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:those  states  relative  to  the  other  states.14  This  is  the  expected  result  if  the  low  skilled  are  close 
22:592:43941:38:7:72:218:118:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
22:593:44001:7:16:72:530:111:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:14 This may be one of the reasons why studies that identified the unskilled by demographics, education or occupation, which is 
22:594:44127:16:10:72:523:95:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:likely to be noisy measure of skill, did not tend to find negative employment effects (e.g., see Card, 1992; Katz and Krueger, 
22:595:44254:10:0:72:531:85:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:1992; Lang and Kahn, 1998).  Studies that did find negative employment effects often based skill groups on wage information, 
23:596:44381:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substitutes for unskilled workers.  Employment in the other two skill groups also shows a relative 
23:597:44480:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase in the high impact states, but this increase is not significant.  It seems very unlikely that 
23:598:44583:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the large relative decrease in the fraction of non-employed persons in high impact states can be 
23:599:44680:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:explained by the  minimum  wage.    Rather,  it  seems  that  high impact  states  happened to 
23:600:44775:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:experience  favorable  economic  shocks  relative  to  low  impact  states.    This  makes  the  drop in 
23:601:44880:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employment among the unskilled even more striking.  Apparently this drop occurred in spite of 
23:602:44974:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relatively  favorable  economic  conditions  in  those  states.    These  results  indicate  that,  while  the 
23:603:45085:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage may only have a minor employment impact on a broadly defined group of less 
23:604:45173:27:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skilled workers, it has a large negative impact on employment among the least skilled workers.   
23:605:45269:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: These employment results depend on the accuracy of the estimates of the wage evolution 
23:606:45355:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:curves.    If,  for  some  reason,  the  wage  evolution curves  systematically  underestimate  the  wage 
23:607:45461:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase  for  unskilled  workers  in  high impact  states,  too few  individuals  will  be  classified  as 
23:608:45569:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled  in  those  states.    While  figure  2  shows  that  the  wage  evolution curves  estimate  a 
23:609:45674:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relatively large wage increase for the unskilled in the high impact states, one should be aware of 
23:610:45773:28:28:72:512:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the sensitivity of the employment effects to any possible bias in the wage evolution curves. 
23:611:45865:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The results for the education groups are shown in panel B.  Overall employment in high 
23:612:45951:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact  states  rose  relative  to  low  impact  states  but  this  rise  should  probably  be  attributed  to 
23:613:46062:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relatively  favorable  economic  conditions  in  high impact  states  rather  than  the  minimum  wage 
23:614:46165:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:since  we  also  find employment  increases  for  groups  unlikely  to  be  affected  by the  minimum 
23:615:46266:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage.    While  the  relative  employment  increase  in  high impact  states  was  less  pronounced  for 
23:616:46371:28:27:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:high school  dropouts  than  for  high school  graduates,  much  of  this  difference  arises  because 
23:617:46474:27:23:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employed high school dropouts comprise a smaller fraction of the working-age population (10%) 
23:618:46568:23:11:72:542:106:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                                                                                                                                                                    
23:619:46763:11:10:72:538:95:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:which may identify the unskilled and most affected individuals more precisely.  (e.g., see Abowd et al., 1999; Currie and Fallick, 
23:620:46894:10:0:72:176:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:1996; and Linneman, 1982). 
24:621:46922:0:27:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:than  employed  high school  graduates  (25%).    It  is  especially  striking that  the  fraction of  non-
24:622:47029:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employed  high school  dropouts  fell  sharply  in  the  high impact  states  compared  to  low  impact 
24:623:47133:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:states.    Because  this  fall  is  nearly  four  times  as  large  as  the  employment  increase  among high 
24:624:47242:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:school  dropouts  in  high impact  states,  many of  the  non-employed  high school  dropouts  in  high 
24:625:47346:28:28:72:545:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact  states  must  either  have  migrated  to  low-impact  states  or  obtained  high school  degrees.  
24:626:47453:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus, when estimates are based on education groups no clear negative employment impact of the 
24:627:47547:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage on low-wage workers is apparent.  However, this lack of an impact may be due 
24:628:47636:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to  the  fact  that  low-wage  workers  cannot  be  identified  with  enough  precision by education 
24:629:47737:27:28:72:110:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:groups.

24:635:48067:28:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:changes  in  the  level  of  employment  among the  unskilled  (see  equation  6).    The  results  of  this 
24:636:48176:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression are  reported  for  the  each  of  the  four  reservation wage  proxies  in  the  first  column  of 
24:637:48287:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:panel A of table 5.  Similar regressions are run for the other skill groups to check for exogenous 
24:638:48385:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:state-specific  movements  in  reservation wage  proxies  that  happen  to  be  correlated  with  the 
24:639:48487:27:28:72:411:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact measure.  These results are reported in the remaining columns. 
24:640:48556:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The table shows that the minimum wage had a negative effect on the average reservation 
24:641:48643:28:0:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage in the unskilled group according to all four proxies.  This decline is significant for two of 
25:642:48744:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the proxies.15 The coefficient on the change in employment among the unskilled (Δ group size) is 
25:643:48840:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:positive,  as  theory  would  predict,  for  three  of  the  four  proxies,  but  is  not  significant  for  any of 
25:644:48956:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:them.    These  movements  in  the  average  reservation wage  suggest  that  the  allocation of  jobs 
25:645:49059:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among unskilled workers, if anything, became relatively more efficient in those states where the 
25:646:49156:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage had the largest impact.  These results suggest that the increase in the minimum 
25:647:49248:28:27:72:274:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage did not lead to inefficient rationing. 
25:648:49291:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: An alternative explanation for these results is that the reservation wage proxies showed a 
25:649:49382:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relative  decline  in  the  high impact  states  for  some  reason unrelated  to  the  minimum-wage 
25:650:49482:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase.    In  this  case,  however,  one  would  expect  to  find  negative  coefficients  on the  impact 
25:651:49591:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure  for  all  skill  groups.   It  is  striking that  these  coefficients  are  all  positive  (2  of  them 
25:652:49704:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significantly so)  for  the  low-skilled group,  which is  the  group that  is  most  similar  to the 
25:653:49806:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled.16  Hence,  it  seems  unlikely  that  an  exogenous  relative  decline  in  reservation wage 
25:654:49910:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proxies  in  the  high  impact  states  can  explain  the  results,  unless  this  decline  affected  unskilled 
25:655:50022:27:28:72:295:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers without affecting other skill groups.   
25:656:50069:28:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Another  alternative  explanation for  these  results  is  a  bias  in  the  formation of  the  skill 
25:657:50171:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:groups.    In  particular, the  relative  reservation wage  of  unskilled  workers  could  fall  in  the  high 
25:658:50282:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact  states  if  low-skilled  workers  have  lower  reservation wages  and a  greater  proportion of 
25:659:50386:28:7:72:218:239:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
25:660:50446:7:15:72:517:232:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:15 Lang and Kahn (1998) find that the employment composition of less skilled workers moved towards teenage and student 
25:661:50564:15:11:72:533:217:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:workers in states where the minimum wage impact was largest. Their finding contrasts with my finding that the minimum wage 
25:662:50687:11:10:72:535:206:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:increased the fraction of individuals older than 30 among the unskilled workers. Perhaps this difference is due to the measure of 
25:663:50817:10:10:72:527:196:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:skill. Lang and Kahn identify less skilled workers as those employed in the eating and drinking establishments and working in 
25:664:50943:10:7:72:165:186:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:food service occupations. 
25:665:50968:7:15:72:529:179:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:16 To test whether the reservation wages of unskilled workers fell relatively more in the high impact states after controlling for 
25:666:51098:15:15:72:416:164:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:any common shocks to the lowest two skill groups in each state, I ran the following regression: 
25:667:51193:15:11:365:542:149:34:g_d0_f44:79:g_d0_f1:12(.)**skskskskskkskreswageunskilledimpactunskilledgroupsizegroupsizeunskilledv!"#$$%=+++%+%+ (8) 
25:668:51289:11:10:72:530:138:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:where unskilledk is a dummy variable for unskilled workers, δs is a set of state fixed effects and the remaining variables are the 
25:669:51420:10:10:72:529:128:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:same as in equation (6).  The regression is run for unskilled and low skilled workers combined and thus has 102 observations.  
25:670:51547:10:11:72:530:118:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:The direct effect of impacts is absorbed by state fixed effects.  The coefficient β is significantly positive for all four reservation 
25:671:51682:11:10:72:535:107:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:wage proxies, confirming that the relative drop in the reservation wages of unskilled workers in the high impact states cannot be 
25:672:51812:10:0:72:527:97:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:driven by shocks to the lowest two skill groups that happened to be correlated with the impact of the minimum wage increase. 
26:673:51938:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:low-skilled  workers  are  misclassified  as  unskilled  in  the  high impact  states  in  1992.17  Three  of 
26:674:52048:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the four reservation wage proxies are indeed lower for the low skilled than for the unskilled (as 
26:675:52146:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:table 3 shows).  It seems unlikely, however, that a greater proportion of low-skilled workers are 
26:676:52244:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misclassified as unskilled in the high impact states in 1992 because, as table 4 shows, these states 
26:677:52345:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:had  a  relative  increase  in  the  number  of  individuals  classified  as  low  skilled  and a  relative 
26:678:52453:28:27:72:274:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decrease in those classified as unskilled.   
26:679:52497:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Panel B of table 5 examines whether the change in the demographic composition of the 
26:680:52582:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skill  groups  is  also  correlated  along  other  dimensions  with  the  impact  of  the  minimum  wage 
26:681:52687:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase.18    The  first  column  shows  that  none  of  the  changes  in  the  demographics  of  unskilled 
26:682:52796:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers  is  correlated  with  the  impact  of  the  minimum  wage  at  a  significance  level  of  5%  or 
26:683:52903:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lower.    The  negative  coefficient  on  high school  dropouts,  which  is  significant  only  at  the  10% 
26:684:53011:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level, suggests that the minimum wage may have led to a relative increase in the average level of 
26:685:53109:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education of  unskilled  workers  in  high impact  states.    This  might  be  an  indication that  some 
26:686:53214:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variation in skill levels is present even within the unskilled group.  If this is the case and the least 
26:687:53319:28:28:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skilled within the  unskilled group lost  their  jobs  due  to the  minimum  wage,  the  average 
26:688:53416:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education level among unskilled workers would indeed increase.  For the remaining skill groups, 
26:689:53512:27:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:most of the changes in demographic composition are not significantly related to the impact of the 
26:690:53610:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum  wage.    The  difference  in  the  impact  of  the  minimum  wage  on the  demographic 
26:691:53706:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:composition of   unskilled and low-skilled workers   is   insignificant   for   all   demographic 
26:692:53804:28:28:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics  except  the  fraction married.    It  therefore  seems  unlikely  that  the  differential 
26:693:53911:28:27:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change  in  the  reservation wage  proxies  for  the  unskilled  in  the  high impact  states  can  be 
26:694:54014:27:7:72:218:129:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
26:695:54074:7:15:72:526:122:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:17 Note that, for such misclassification to occur, the bias in the estimates of the wage evolution curves would need to be in the 
26:696:54203:15:7:72:332:107:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:opposite direction of the bias needed to explain the employment results. 
26:697:54275:7:15:72:523:100:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:18 This was tested using the same specification as in regression (8), except that the reservation wage proxy was replaced by a 
26:698:54401:15:0:72:173:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:demographic characteristic. 
27:699:54430:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:explained  by random  shocks  that  happened  to  affect  unskilled  but  not  low-skilled  workers  in 
27:700:54534:27:28:72:132:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:those states. 
27:701:54547:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The  results  from  the  wage-based  skill  groups  therefore  indicate  that  the  allocation of 
27:702:54645:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employment  has  improved  for  unskilled  workers  in  states  where  the  impact  of  the  minimum 
27:703:54745:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wage was high relative to other states.  This finding provides evidence against the hypothesis that 
27:704:54845:28:27:72:502:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the increase in the federal minimum wage led to inefficient rationing in the labor market. 
27:705:54935:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To  test  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  to  the  definition of  skill  groups,  table  6  shows  the 
27:706:55042:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results  for  education groups.    The  first  three  columns  test  the  effect  of  the  minimum  wage  on 
27:707:55150:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wage proxies for the three education groups, and find no significant effect for any of 
27:708:55249:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the four proxies in any of the three education groups.  These findings are consistent with those of 
27:709:55349:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  wage-based  skill  groups.    An  advantage  of  using education groups  is  that  it  allows  one  to 
27:710:55457:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:compare the impact of the minimum wage on employed persons to the impact on non-employed 
27:711:55546:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:persons.    In  this  way,  one  can  control  for  exogenous  shocks  to  reservation wages  that  are 
27:712:55650:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:common to employed and non-employed individuals.  The last three columns show the impact of 
27:713:55742:28:28:72:539:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  minimum  wage  on  the  reservation wage  proxies  of  the  employed  compared  to  the  non-
27:714:55840:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employed.    This  differential  impact  is  insignificant  in  all  cases  except  on one  reservation wage 
27:715:55949:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proxy,  Δ employed  persons  in  household,  for  the  high school  dropouts  and the  high school 
27:716:56046:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:graduates.    The  fact  that  this  impact  is  significant  for  both  high school  dropouts  and graduates 
27:717:56156:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggests  that  it  is  unlikely  to  be  caused  by the  minimum  wage,  which  should  have  mainly 
27:718:56258:28:28:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:affected  high school  dropouts.    Like  the  findings  from  the  wage-based  skill  groups,  the  results 
27:719:56367:28:27:72:543:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from  the  education groups  provide  no support  for  the  hypothesis  that  the  increase  in the 
27:720:56467:27:28:72:362:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimum wage reduced the efficiency of the job allocation.

28:724:56541:14:28:72:75:665:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
28:725:56541:28:27:72:542:637:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In this paper, I examine the impact of the minimum wage on the level and composition of 
28:726:56629:27:28:72:543:610:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employment.    Because  the  minimum  wage  primarily  affects  individuals  whose  skill  level  is 
28:727:56730:28:28:72:542:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sufficiently  low  that  the  minimum  wage  is  binding for  them,  it  is  important  to  accurately  and 
28:728:56838:28:27:72:542:554:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precisely  identify  these  individuals.    I  present  a  new  methodology to  identify  these  unskilled 
28:729:56945:27:28:72:543:527:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers.      Using the   overlapping panel   nature   of   the   CPS,   I   estimate   how   the   wages 
28:730:57051:28:27:72:543:499:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponding to a  constant  skill  level  changed over  time  in each state.    I  then use  this 
28:731:57151:27:28:72:479:472:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:information to infer each worker’s skill from the actual wage paid to this individual. 
28:732:57237:28:28:72:543:444:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Using this methodology to identify workers’ skills, I find that the 1990/91 increase in the 
28:733:57329:28:27:72:543:416:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:federal   minimum   wage   reduced employment   among unskilled workers.      However,   their 
28:734:57424:27:28:72:542:389:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employment reduction seems to be largely compensated for by increased employment among the 
28:735:57515:28:27:72:543:361:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:next  skill  group,  which  is  likely  to  be  a  close  substitute.    Hence,  for  a  more  broadly  defined 
28:736:57627:27:28:72:542:334:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:group of less skilled workers, I do not find a large negative employment impact.  This may help 
28:737:57723:28:28:72:542:306:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to explain why estimates relying on relatively imprecise measures of skill such as age, education, 
28:738:57821:28:27:72:484:278:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:or occupation may not find large employment effects from minimum wage increases. 
28:739:57901:27:28:72:543:251:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: I  find no evidence  that  the  minimum  wage  led to inefficient  job rationing among 
28:740:57988:28:27:72:542:223:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled  workers.    If  anything,  the  allocation of  jobs  seems  to  have  become  relatively  more 
28:741:58094:27:28:72:542:196:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:efficient in states where the impact of the federal  minimum wage increase was larger.  In other 
28:742:58190:28:28:72:543:168:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:words, those who valued their job least, as measured by four reservation wage proxies, appear to 
28:743:58287:28:0:72:339:140:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have lost their jobs due to the minimum wage increase. 
29:744:58343:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: An  advantage  of  the  wage-based  skill  measure  is  that  it  reflects  firms’  valuations  of 
29:745:58442:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:skills.    By  construction,  the  unskilled  group identifies  only  low-wage  workers,  precisely  those 
29:746:58549:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:who are  most  affected  by a  minimum  wage  increase.    However,  the  methodology  used  to 
29:747:58645:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:construct  these  wage-based  skill  groups  is  relatively  complicated  and one  might  be  concerned 
29:748:58749:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that the results could be driven by some bias in the formation of the skill groups.  I show that the 
29:749:58850:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:finding that  minimum  wages  do not  adversely  affect  the  efficiency  of  rationing can  only  be 
29:750:58952:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:explained by a bias in the skill groups if relatively more low-skilled workers are misclassified as 
29:751:59052:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unskilled in high impact states.  This, however, seems unlikely because the number of unskilled 
29:752:59148:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:workers fell relative to low skill workers in high impact states.  To further test the robustness of 
29:753:59249:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  results,  I  also  used  education as  a  measure  to  identify  low-wage  workers.    These  estimates 
29:754:59358:28:27:72:545:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:also do not support the hypothesis that minimum wages reduce the efficiency of job allocation.  
29:755:59454:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:While  the  lower  precision with  which  education  identifies  low-wage  workers  perhaps  favors 
29:756:59554:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:finding no effect, it is at least reassuring that the results from the wage-based skill groups are not 
29:757:59656:27:28:72:137:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:contradicted. 
29:758:59669:28:28:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: These  results  have  mixed  implications  for  the  desirability  of  the  minimum  wage  as  a 
29:759:59766:28:27:72:542:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:policy  instrument.    The  absence  of  evidence  for  inefficient  rationing suggests  that  there  is  no 
29:760:59874:27:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:need to add the deadweight loss of job misallocation to the other costs associated with minimum 
29:761:59969:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wages.  On the other hand, the results do indicate that an increase in the minimum wage reduces 
29:762:60065:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the employment rate of unskilled workers, who are among the poorest members of society.  This 
29:763:60159:28:28:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:means  that  policy  makers  who are  concerned  about  people  at  the  very  bottom  of  the  wage 
29:764:60260:28:27:72:542:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:distribution should be cautious about advocating the minimum wage as an instrument for income

34:959:68553:10:9:72:536:243:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1) The source of the data are the NBER extracts of the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups.  The universe for this data consists of all non-
34:960:68692:9:9:90:539:234:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:institutionalized persons of age 16 and older.  The 1989 sample was selected as follows (with the 1992 figures between parentheses): Of the 
34:961:68832:9:9:90:538:225:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:initial 324,711 (332,184) observations, 49,974 (51,984) were dropped because they are older than 65.  A further 1,822 (1,594) observations 
34:962:68971:9:9:90:521:216:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:were dropped because their sampling weight is missing.  Finally, 597 (496) observations are dropped because their wage is lower than 
34:963:69104:9:9:90:533:207:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1.00$/hr (which is probably measurement error) and 39,067 (39,209) observations are dropped because they are working but their wage is 
34:964:69239:9:10:90:158:198:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:missing or allocated. 
34:965:69260:10:9:72:537:188:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:2) The variable Other earnings in household measures the total labor income (usual weekly earnings) of other household members divided by 
34:966:69397:9:9:90:536:179:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:the total number of household members in the sample.  This variable is expressed as a percentile in each state-year cell.  Adults are defined 
34:967:69539:9:9:90:539:170:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:as persons of age 20 and older. The variables Nr. of other employed persons in household and Nr. of other adults in household are topcoded 
34:968:69678:9:11:90:393:161:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:at 2 to prevent outliers from driving results.  All the remaining variables are dummy variables.

36:1065:72078:9:9:72:537:253:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1) The variable Impact of minimum wage is a measure of the impact of the 1990/91 federal minimum wage increase on a state.  It is measured 
36:1066:72216:9:10:90:518:244:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:as the fraction of workers between the ages of 16 and 65 whose wage in 1989 was greater or equal than $3.35/hr and strictly less than 
36:1067:72350:10:9:90:527:234:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:$4.25/hr.  The wage is measured as the hourly wage for hourly workers and as usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours for 
36:1068:72483:9:9:90:146:225:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:salaried workers. 
36:1069:72500:9:9:72:524:216:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:2) The wage boundary between unskilled and low-skilled workers in 1989 is the wage at the 10th percentile of the wage distribution in the 
36:1070:72637:9:9:90:542:207:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:relevant state.  The wage boundary between these two skill categories in 1992 is found by estimating what the wage in that state would be in 
36:1071:72778:9:10:90:523:198:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1992 for a worker of the same skill as a worker earning the boundary wage in 1989.  This estimation procedure is described in detail in 
36:1072:72914:10:9:90:504:188:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:section 3.2.  The 1989 boundary wage between low-skilled and semi-skilled workers is the 20th percentile of the 1989 state wage 
36:1073:73042:9:11:90:444:179:63:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:distribution and the 1989 boundary wage between semi-skilled and skilled workers is set at the 30th percentile.

37:1121:74302:10:9:72:533:186:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1)  The skill groups are formed as follows.  In 1989, the unskilled are in the lowest decile of the state wage distribution, the low skilled are in 
37:1122:74449:9:9:90:530:177:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:the second decile of the state wage distribution, the semi-skilled in the third decile of the state wage distribution and the skilled in the top 
37:1123:74594:9:10:90:536:168:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:seven deciles.  In 1992, the unskilled group is formed by estimating what the 1992 wages in each state would be for workers with the same 
37:1124:74732:10:9:90:527:158:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:skill as the workers in the unskilled group in 1989 (this estimation procedure is described in detail in section 3.2).  Workers whose 1992 
37:1125:74871:9:9:90:539:149:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:wages fall in this range are classified as the unskilled in 1992.  Hence, the unskilled group in 1992 does not generally coincide with the first 
37:1126:75016:9:9:90:507:140:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:decile of the wage distribution in 1992.  The low skilled, the semi-skilled and the skilled groups for 1992 are created analogously. 
37:1127:75148:9:10:72:522:131:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:2) The variable Other earnings in household measures the total labor income of other household members divided by the total number of 
37:1128:75281:10:9:90:530:121:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:household members.  This variable is expressed as a percentile in each state-year cell.  Adults are defined as persons of age 20 and older. 
37:1129:75421:9:9:90:529:112:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:The variables Nr. of other employed persons in household and Nr. of other adults in household are topcoded at 2 to prevent outliers from 
37:1130:75558:9:0:90:302:103:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:driving results.  All the remaining variables are dummy variables.

41:1355:81372:10:9:72:500:283:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1)  The dependent variable is the change in the characteristic listed in the first column between 1989 and 1992 for each skill group. 
41:1356:81504:9:9:72:539:274:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:2)  The independent variable are Impact of minimum wage, which is a measure of the impact of the 1990/91 federal minimum wage increase in 
41:1357:81641:9:9:90:540:265:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:each state, and Δ Group size, which is  the change between 1989 and 1992 in the size of the relevant skill group as a fraction of the working-
41:1358:81783:9:9:90:540:256:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:age population (ages 16-65).  Impact of minimum wage is measured as the fraction of workers between the ages of 16 and 65 whose wage in 
41:1359:81919:9:9:90:319:247:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1989 was greater or equal than $3.35/hr and strictly less than $4.25/hr.  
41:1360:81992:9:10:72:524:238:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:3)  For each skill group and dependent variable, a separate cross-section regression is estimated with the 51 states as observations.  In each 
41:1361:82134:10:9:90:535:228:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:regression the Impact of minimum wage is instrumented for by its value lagged one year. Huber/White robust standard errors are reported.  
41:1362:82272:9:11:90:496:219:63:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Observations are weighted by the harmonic mean of the number of observations in the two years of each state-skill group cell.

42:1431:83559:10:9:72:517:290:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1)  The dependent variable is the change in the characteristic listed in the first column between 1989 and 1992 for each education group. 
42:1432:83695:9:9:72:539:281:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:2)  The independent variable are Impact of minimum wage, which is a measure of the impact of the 1990/91 federal minimum wage increase in 
42:1433:83832:9:9:90:540:272:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:each state, and Δ Group size, which is  the change between 1989 and 1992 in the size of the relevant skill group as a fraction of the working-
42:1434:83974:9:10:90:540:263:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:age population (ages 16-65).  Impact of minimum wage is measured as the fraction of workers between the ages of 16 and 65 whose wage in 
42:1435:84110:10:9:90:319:253:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1989 was greater or equal than $3.35/hr and strictly less than $4.25/hr.  
42:1436:84183:9:9:72:524:244:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:3)  For each skill group and dependent variable, a separate cross-section regression is estimated with the 51 states as observations.  In each 
42:1437:84325:9:9:90:535:235:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:regression the Impact of minimum wage is instrumented for by its value lagged one year. Huber/White robust standard errors are reported.  
42:1438:84463:9:11:90:513:226:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:Observations are weighted by the harmonic mean of the number of observations in the two years of each state-education group cell.

43:1442:84660:31:27:72:75:676:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
43:1443:84660:27:28:72:501:649:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: This appendix describes the procedure used to match individuals who appear in 2 
43:1444:84740:28:27:72:533:621:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consecutive years of the CPS.  This matching procedure is not straightforward because the CPS 
43:1445:84834:27:28:72:527:594:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:samples residential units and does not contain person identifiers. Therefore a single residential 
43:1446:84932:28:28:72:529:566:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unit identifier may correspond to two different households in cases where a household moves.  
43:1447:85026:28:27:72:506:538:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The idea behind the matching procedure is to use information about the sex, race, age and 
43:1448:85116:27:28:72:531:511:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relationship codes of individuals within each household to (i) assess the likelihood that a single 
43:1449:85215:28:27:72:509:483:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:household identifier indeed identifies the same household in both periods and (ii) to match 
43:1450:85307:27:28:72:522:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals within households. Madrian and Lefgren (2000) explain the rotating design of the 
43:1451:85400:28:28:72:525:428:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:CPS and examine several different matching procedures. My approach is consistent with their 
43:1452:85492:28:27:72:166:400:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recommendations.  
43:1453:85509:27:28:72:526:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The first column of table A.1 describes the matching process between 1989 and 1990.  
43:1454:85594:28:27:72:530:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The CPS interviews individuals for 4 consecutive months, then waits 8 months, and interviews 
43:1455:85687:27:28:72:532:318:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:them again for 4 consecutive months.  The outgoing rotation groups only contain individuals in 
43:1456:85782:28:28:72:516:290:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:their 4th or 8th interview month.  Therefore, only observations in their 4th interview month in 
43:1457:85878:28:27:72:533:262:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1989 or in their 8th interview month in 1990 need to be considered for a match.  As rows 1a and 
43:1458:85974:27:28:72:502:235:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1b show, there are 335,012 such observations with 95,309 distinct household identifiers.  
43:1459:86064:28:27:72:512:207:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However, dropping households that appear only in one year leaves 297,712 observations in 
43:1460:86153:27:28:72:511:180:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:75,245 households (see rows 2a and 2b).  Within each household, the maximum number of 
43:1461:86239:28:28:72:527:152:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:matches is the lowest number of observations in that household over the 2 years.  As shown in 
43:1462:86333:28:27:72:492:124:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:row 3, this reduces the number of potential matches to 139,862 or 279,724 person-year 
43:1463:86419:27:0:72:138:97:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observations. 
44:1464:86434:0:27:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Of these 139,862 potential matches, 122,452 unique matches were identified. Matched 
44:1465:86518:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observations have the same household identifier, race and gender, and the age of the person must 
44:1466:86615:28:27:72:537:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have increased by two or fewer years.  Some multiple matches are resolved by requiring that the 
44:1467:86711:27:28:72:524:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:age of the person increased by exactly one year and by using the relationship codes.  Multiple 
44:1468:86806:28:28:72:304:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:matches that cannot be resolved are discarded.   
44:1469:86854:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Even if a unique match is identified, it is unclear that the matched observations refer to 
44:1470:86945:27:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the same individual.  First, the same household identifier might be used for a different household 
44:1471:87044:28:27:72:525:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:if the original household could not be located by the interviewers.  The matching routine rates 
44:1472:87140:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:each matched household on a 5-point scale indicating the likelihood that the same household 
44:1473:87232:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identifier refers to same household.  This rating is based on the number of matched individuals in 
44:1474:87331:28:27:72:510:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the household, the number of non-matched individuals, their ages and relationship codes.19 
44:1475:87421:27:28:72:533:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second, within the same household, the wrong individuals could be matched to each other.  For 
44:1476:87515:28:27:72:538:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example, this could happen if one person moved out and a different person of the same age, race 
44:1477:87611:27:28:72:541:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and gender moved in.  Hence, the quality of the individual matches within each household is also 
44:1478:87708:28:28:72:489:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rated.  This rating is based on the method used to resolve any multiple matches, on the 
44:1479:87796:28:27:72:417:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relationship codes and on whether the person aged by exactly one year. 
44:1480:87866:27:28:72:521:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: These subjective quality ratings are validated using education for the 1989/90 and the 
44:1481:87953:28:27:72:524:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1990/91 matches.  The education validation is not possible for 1991/92 because the education 
44:1482:88046:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:definitions changed.  As expected, the validations show that matches with higher quality ratings 
44:1483:88142:28:28:72:524:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are less likely to have incompatible education levels, where incompatible education levels are 
44:1484:88237:28:38:72:521:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:those that decrease over time or increase by more than 2 years.  These validations are used to 
44:1485:88332:38:7:72:218:118:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
44:1486:88392:7:16:72:537:111:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:19 The routine that rates match qualities was constructed to mimic my subjective assessment.  I subjectively rated a large number 
44:1487:88521:16:10:72:530:95:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:of matches and created an algorithm that best captured these assessments.  This algorithm is too complicated to describe in full 
44:1488:88650:10:0:72:192:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:detail but is available on request. 
45:1489:88687:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:determine the quality ratings of the household and individual match required for a “high-quality” 
45:1490:88785:27:28:72:529:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:match.  As rows 4a and 4b show, 92.6% of the unique matches in 1989/90 are considered high-
45:1491:88876:28:27:72:530:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:quality.  Of these high-quality matches 2% have incompatible education levels, whereas nearly 
45:1492:88970:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:10% of the low-quality matches have incompatible education levels (see rows 5a and 5b).  Of the 
45:1493:89066:28:28:72:505:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:high-quality matches, even the most highly rated matches still have a rate of incompatible 
45:1494:89157:28:27:72:534:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education levels of 1.9% (not shown in the table).  This raises the suspicion that the base rate of 
45:1495:89257:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misreporting education levels may be close to 1% per year.  In this case, the number of false 
45:1496:89351:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:positive matches may be substantially lower than the 2% suggested by the education validation.  
45:1497:89447:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:On the other hand, some false positive matches may not be detected by the education validation 
45:1498:89542:28:28:72:406:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:because both individuals happen to have the same level of education. 
45:1499:89610:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: For the estimation of the wage evolution curves, I only use high-quality matches.  Row 6 
45:1500:89699:27:28:72:531:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shows that 45,687 matches of the 113,429 high-quality matches have non-missing wage data in 
45:1501:89791:28:27:72:530:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:both years.  While this fraction may seem low, one should realize that the matches also include 
45:1502:89886:27:28:72:465:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the elderly population and that imputed or allocated wages are treated as missing.

47:1546:90971:14:27:72:530:678:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In this appendix, I examine the empirical validity of the reservation wage proxies using 
47:1547:91060:27:28:72:517:651:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the self-reported reservation wage measure from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.  The 
47:1548:91149:28:27:72:525:623:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:National Longitudinal Study of Youth also has a self-reported reservation wage, but the PSID 
47:1549:91242:27:28:72:501:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:was used because its sample is more representative.  The reservation wage in the PSID is 
47:1550:91331:28:28:72:533:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:measured as the response to the question: “What is the lowest wage or salary you would accept 
47:1551:91424:28:27:72:487:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:on any job?”  This question was only asked of family heads who are not working, not 
47:1552:91507:27:28:72:497:513:144:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:temporarily laid off and who have “done anything in the last four weeks to find a job.”20 
47:1553:91596:28:27:72:515:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Moreover, the question was only asked from 1980 to 1987, and the sample was restricted to 
47:1554:91686:27:28:72:538:458:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals between the ages of 16 and 64 for comparability with the CPS sample.  This leaves a 
47:1555:91782:28:27:72:508:430:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sample of 3308 person-year observations.  Eliminating individuals with missing education 
47:1556:91871:27:28:72:528:403:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:information reduces the sample to 3275 person-year observations on 1861 distinct individuals. 
47:1557:91964:28:27:72:520:375:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We would expect a valid proxy to explain the self-reported wage after controlling for 
47:1558:92050:27:28:72:510:348:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ability.  Hence, a proxy is judged empirically valid if we find a significantly positive β in a 
47:1559:92146:28:28:72:234:320:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression of the following form: 
47:1560:92179:28:28:72:75:292:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
47:1561:92179:28:31:72:543:264:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:(self-reported reservation wage)  =  α  +  (reservation wage proxy) β  +  (skill measures) γ  +  ε

47:1563:92275:28:28:72:536:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The reservation wage proxies from PSID data were constructed to resemble as much as possible 
47:1564:92368:28:27:72:531:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:the four CPS reservation proxies used elsewhere in the paper:  Other earnings in the household 
47:1565:92463:27:28:72:535:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(as a percentile),  Nr. of other employed persons in household,  Nr. of other adults in household 
47:1566:92561:28:15:72:516:122:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Age less than 30.  However, a number of differences were unavoidable.  First, the PSID 
47:1567:92652:15:7:72:218:107:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:                                                             
47:1568:92712:7:15:72:516:100:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:20 In 1985, the question was also asked of non-employed job-searching spouses of family heads.  These individuals are not 
47:1569:92833:15:0:72:160:85:79:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:included in the analysis. 
48:1570:92860:0:27:72:524:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proxies are measured at the family level whereas the CPS ones are measured at the household 
48:1571:92952:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level.  Second, Other earnings in the family includes half of the family’s asset income if a wife is 
48:1572:93052:28:27:72:504:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:present and reflects taxable income in the past calendar year, whereas in the CPS no asset 
48:1573:93143:27:28:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:income is included and earnings are based on usual weekly earnings.  Like the CPS, Other 
48:1574:93232:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:earnings in the family excludes any income of the person to whom the reservation wage proxies 
48:1575:93326:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:apply and is scaled for family size by dividing by the number of 16-64 year olds in the family.  
48:1576:93423:27:28:72:513:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Third, Other earnings in the family is expressed as a percentile in each year rather than as a 
48:1577:93518:28:27:72:417:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentile in each state-year cell because of sample size considerations. 
48:1578:93591:27:28:72:538:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To ensure that the reservation wage proxy reflects the individual’s time and effort cost of 
48:1579:93683:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:working rather than an unobserved component of skill, the controls include two skill measures.  
48:1580:93779:28:27:72:521:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The first is the average hourly earnings of the individual in the past calendar year.  A dummy 
48:1581:93874:27:28:72:535:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variable is included for the 438 observations with missing average hourly earnings.  The second 
48:1582:93970:28:27:72:535:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:control for skill is the individual’s predicted wage.  This prediction is based on the demographic 
48:1583:94069:27:28:72:514:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics of this individual, including the reservation wage proxies, year dummies and 
48:1584:94162:28:28:72:517:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics of the local labor market. It is important that the reservation wage proxies are 
48:1585:94259:28:27:72:514:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:included in order to control for those components of the proxies that reflect skill rather than 
48:1586:94355:27:28:72:536:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effort and time costs of working.  To predict wages, I first run an OLS regression of log average

48:1591:94779:7:16:72:470:142:42:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:21 The demographics and controls include sex, race dummies (black, white and other), marital status dummies 
48:1592:94886:16:10:72:522:126:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:(married/cohabitating, single, widowed and divorced), education dummies (high school dropout, high school graduate, some 
48:1593:95007:10:10:72:541:116:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:college, college degree or more), a 6-segment linear spline in age (breakpoints at 20,30,40, 50 and 60), 7 dummies for the number 
48:1594:95137:10:11:72:539:106:79:g_d0_f1:79:g_d0_f1:of kids under 17, 9 dummies for family size, a 10-segment spline in the first reservation wage proxy (other earnings), a full set of

49:1598:95531:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression are applied to the demographic and labor market characteristics of the sample with 
49:1599:95625:28:27:72:387:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:self-reported reservation wages to generate a predicted log wage. 
49:1600:95690:27:28:72:494:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The results of the OLS regressions of log self-reported reservation wages on the 
49:1601:95771:28:28:72:509:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reservation wage proxies and skill measures are reported in table B.1.  All four reservation 
49:1602:95864:28:27:72:529:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:proxies have a positive effect on the self-reported reservation wage and the effect is significant 
49:1603:95963:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for all proxies except the third proxy, Nr. of other adults in the family.  Hence, these proxies are 
49:1604:96064:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not only plausible on theoretical grounds but also confirmed empirically.  When all four proxies 
49:1605:96161:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are entered jointly in the regression (not reported), the fourth proxy remains significant but the 
49:1606:96260:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:first three become insignificant.  This is not surprising because the first three proxies are highly 
49:1607:96361:28:27:72:511:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:collinear.  The controls for skill are highly significant and the results are as expected; more 
49:1608:96457:27:0:72:354:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:highly skilled individuals have higher reservation wages.

50:1635:97230:10:9:72:524:337:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:1) Huber/White robust standard errors in parentheses.  Standard errors are corrected for group error terms for repeated observations of the 
50:1636:97368:9:9:90:339:328:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:same individual. The 3275 observations come from 1861 distinct individuals. 
50:1637:97443:9:10:72:532:319:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f3:2) The dependent variable is the self-reported reservation wage, which is the answer to the question: “What is the lowest wage or salary you 
50:1638:97583:10:9:90:177:309:63:g_d0_f3:63:g_d0_f1:would accept on any job?” 
50:1639:97608:9:9:72:523:300:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:3) The data are from the PSID.  The reservation wage question was asked from 1980 to 1987 to unemployed family heads who have been 
50:1640:97738:9:9:90:530:291:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:looking for work in the last four weeks. For consistency with the CPS reservation wage proxies, the sample is limited to individuals aged 
50:1641:97876:9:9:90:375:282:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:from 16 to 64. Finally, 33 individuals with missing education information were dropped. 
50:1642:97963:9:9:72:495:273:63:g_d0_f1:63:g_d0_f1:4) The log average hourly earnings of individuals for whom this variable was initially missing was set equal to the sample mean.
