2:29:736:14:14:306:309:453:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
2:30:736:14:13:126:499:439:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Most rich countries in the world and four US states require drivers talking on 
2:31:815:13:14:90:520:426:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phones to use hands-free devices. However, previous research has failed to arrive 
2:32:904:14:14:89:516:412:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:at a consensus on the effect of mobile phones on traffic accidents yet has concluded that 
2:33:994:14:14:89:426:398:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the effect of hands-free and hand-held phones on accidents is similar. 
2:34:1065:14:14:125:499:384:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:This paper uses state-level data from 1997-2005 on mobile phone ownership, 
2:35:1140:14:13:89:523:370:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:traffic fatalities, and hands-free laws and finds that (1) mobile phones contribute to traffic 
2:36:1235:13:14:89:511:357:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities and (2) hands-free laws appear to reduce fatalities. Specifically, mobile phone 
2:37:1326:14:14:89:520:343:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership results in a large and statistically significant increase in traffic fatalities in bad 
2:38:1423:14:14:89:507:329:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:weather or wet road conditions, with no effect in good weather or dry road conditions. 
2:39:1510:14:14:89:484:315:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Laws requiring drivers to use hands-free technologies while talking reduce traffic 
2:40:1593:14:13:89:508:301:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities in adverse conditions, and the effect grows stronger and becomes statistically 
2:41:1683:13:14:89:504:288:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:significant the longer the law is in effect, although these longer-term effects are based 
2:42:1773:14:14:90:493:274:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:solely on New York, which in 2001 became the first state to have a hands-free law. 
2:43:1856:14:14:126:514:260:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The analysis relies on microdata from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to 
2:44:1936:14:14:90:524:246:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:estimate effects for traffic fatalities in different conditions and to isolate fatalities unlikely 
2:45:2035:14:13:90:507:232:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to be affected by confounding changes in alcohol policies or graduated licensing laws.

3:57:2945:36:27:126:523:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Has the rapid increase in mobile phone usage contributed to traffic fatalities in the 
3:58:3031:27:28:90:497:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:United States? Does legislation requiring drivers to use hands-free technology while 
3:59:3116:28:27:90:519:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:talking have any effect on traffic fatalities? This paper answers these two questions, both 
3:60:3208:27:28:89:519:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:central to the public debate over regulations on mobile phone usage while driving. Using 
3:61:3297:28:28:89:515:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:state-level panel data on mobile phone ownership, hands-free laws, and traffic fatalities, 
3:62:3388:28:27:89:523:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:this paper finds that mobile phones are associated with higher traffic fatalities, but only in 
3:63:3483:27:28:89:515:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:bad weather or wet road conditions. The limited experience of a few states suggests that 
3:64:3572:28:27:89:504:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hands-free laws reduce traffic fatalities, but the results are sensitive to the time period 
3:65:3664:27:28:89:498:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:studied and the specification. The findings give a nuanced picture of the relationship 
3:66:3751:28:28:89:486:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:between mobile phones, hands-free laws, and traffic fatalities and suggest that the 
3:67:3835:28:27:89:368:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:benefits of hands-free laws depend on driving conditions. 
3:68:3893:27:28:125:519:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death in the US. In 2005, crashes resulted 
3:69:3977:28:27:89:514:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in over 43,000 fatalities. Motor vehicle accidents rank 8th among causes of death for the 
3:70:4067:27:28:90:494:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:overall population and are the leading cause of death at ages 5-34.1 Globally, traffic 
3:71:4154:28:27:90:466:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mortality rates are even higher in the developing world, and the World Health

3:74:4391:28:27:89:520:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:has led countries throughout the world to require hands-free technology for talking while 
3:75:4481:27:28:89:513:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:driving. Japan became the first large country to ban mobile usage while driving without 
3:76:4569:28:41:89:518:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hands-free technology in 1999. As of 2006, every G7 country except the US banned non-

4:91:5985:27:28:90:512:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:allowed municipalities to pass local hands-free laws, the US is clearly an outlier among

4:95:6143:28:27:126:488:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Previous research has found conflicting evidence about the extent to which 
4:96:6218:27:28:90:488:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phones contribute to traffic accidents.3 However, despite different research 
4:97:6302:28:27:89:513:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:methodologies, these studies agree that the risks to safety are similar for hands-free and 
4:98:6393:27:28:89:477:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:handheld mobile phone usage. These previous studies rely on laboratory driving 
4:99:6472:28:27:89:516:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:simulations, which do not necessary reflect behavioral changes people make in response 
4:100:6559:27:28:89:518:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to a hands-free law, and surveys in which drivers recall past accidents, which are subject 
4:101:6650:28:28:89:298:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to measurement error and selection issues.

4:107:7108:7:16:90:521:159:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:3 At the same time, there are reasons why mobile phone ownership could reduce traffic accidents as well as 
4:108:7215:16:12:89:523:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:contribute to them. Redelmeier and Tibshirani (1997) note that, in 39% of non-serious accidents (those with 
4:109:7323:12:11:89:520:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:property damage but no bodily injury), mobile-phone-owning drivers called emergency services afterward. 
4:110:7427:11:12:89:512:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:Being in possession of a mobile phone to call for assistance immediately could reduce the share of traffic 
4:111:7534:12:11:89:495:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:accidents that result in fatalities. It is even theoretically possible that the positive effect of calling for 
4:112:7645:11:12:89:509:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:assistance could outweigh the effect of driver distraction so that, on balance, drivers with mobile phones 
4:113:7752:12:11:89:502:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:are less likely to die from accidents than those without mobile phones, though no study has drawn that

5:116:8108:36:27:90:503:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:non-serious accidents just before the event and at a comparable time in the past. They 
5:117:8195:27:28:90:518:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:estimate the likelihood of an accident to be 4.3 times higher when using a phone, though 
5:118:8284:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:this estimate is based only on drivers who have had accidents and own mobile phones 
5:119:8368:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and may not reflect the broader population if people are heterogeneous in mobile phone 
5:120:8455:28:28:90:517:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:usage and in how mobile phone usage affects their driving. Hahn and Prieger (2006) use 
5:121:8542:28:27:90:522:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:data on recent and retrospective traffic accidents and mobile phone usage. They construct 
5:122:8632:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:a panel from respondents’ recollections over two years and model the effect of cell phone 
5:123:8722:28:27:90:482:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:usage on traffic accidents. Their estimates of the effect of mobile phone usage on 
5:124:8805:27:28:90:507:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:accidents is smaller than those of Redelmeier and Tibshirani, in part because they find 
5:125:8893:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that individuals with higher mobile phone usage are riskier drivers independent of their 
5:126:8982:28:27:90:523:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone usage.4 They attribute the higher rates of relative risk found in other studies 
5:127:9075:27:28:90:476:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to others’ looking at a particularly accident-prone sample whose behavior is not 
5:128:9156:28:27:90:517:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:generalizable to the population. However, their method relies on recall and identifies the 
5:129:9247:27:28:90:525:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect of mobile phone usage on accidents from differences in the recalled levels of phone 
5:130:9338:28:27:90:505:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:usage over time, and it is unclear how serious a problem measurement error might be. 
5:131:9423:27:28:90:499:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Further, their data were collected online, and their sample – like all online samples – 
5:132:9511:28:28:90:480:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:could be biased on unobservables whose relationships to variables of interest are 
5:133:9593:28:27:90:144:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:unknown.  
5:134:9603:27:28:126:500:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Two studies based on laboratory and naturalistic experiments have found that 
5:135:9680:28:27:90:503:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phones create significant distractions that result in driving less safely. Strayer, 
5:136:9771:27:28:90:495:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Drews, and Crouch (2006) find that the distraction from mobile-phone usage makes 
5:137:9852:28:20:90:502:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drivers more accident-prone than having a blood-alcohol concentration at the level of 
5:138:9938:20:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
5:139:9986:8:16:90:487:101:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:4 Hahn and Prieger identify this heterogeneity using individual effects, taking advantage of data on 
5:140:10087:16:11:89:493:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:respondents’ recollections of mobile phone usage and traffic accidents at multiple points in time. On 
5:141:10189:11:0:89:390:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:average, survey respondents provided 3.7 quarters’ worth of observations.  
6:142:10264:0:36:90:699:744:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:DRAFT                                                          4                                                                                                                                                                              
6:143:10505:36:27:90:516:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:.08%, based on a driving simulator, even though driving while intoxicated leads to more 
6:144:10593:27:28:90:494:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:aggressive driving behaviors than mobile phone usage does. The National Highway 
6:145:10673:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA 2006) naturalistic driver study outfitted 100 
6:146:10758:27:28:90:502:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:cars with sensors and data collection hardware to test the effect of numerous possible 
6:147:10845:28:28:90:518:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:distractions on crashes and near-crashes. This methodology has the distinct advantage of 
6:148:10934:28:27:90:502:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:separately estimating the effect of both dialing and talking/listening on a phone while 
6:149:11022:27:28:89:478:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:driving. Dialing increased accident risk by 180% compared to the baseline of no 
6:150:11102:28:27:89:520:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:distractions; talking/listening raised accident risk by 30%. Since drivers spend more time 
6:151:11193:27:28:89:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:talking and listening than dialing, the two activities contribute nearly equally to incidents. 
6:152:11288:28:28:126:490:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Despite the different magnitudes that the above studies find on the effect of 
6:153:11366:28:27:90:508:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone usage on traffic safety, they reach a consensus that driving while using a 
6:154:11454:27:28:90:512:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hands-free device is no safer than driving while using a standard hand-held device. The 
6:155:11542:28:27:90:502:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:consensus is especially striking because of the widely varying methodologies that the 
6:156:11628:27:28:90:500:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:different studies use. Redelmeier and Tibshirani (1997) find no significant difference 
6:157:11715:28:27:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:between the increased accident risk when using hands-free and hand-held units. Hahn and 
6:158:11803:27:28:90:487:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Prieger (2006) find that hands-free device users are more careful drivers, and after 
6:159:11888:28:28:90:496:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:controlling for these selection effects find no significant reduction in accidents from 
6:160:11976:28:27:90:517:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hands-free devices relative to handheld devices, conditional on minutes of mobile phone 
6:161:12064:27:28:90:495:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:usage. And Strayer, Drews, and Crouch (2006) find no significant differences in the 
6:162:12148:28:27:90:502:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:impairments introduced by handheld and hands-free devices. These consistent results 
6:163:12232:27:28:90:499:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:about hands-free devices have been used to call into question the value of hands-free 
6:164:12318:28:0:90:121:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:laws.

7:166:12566:36:27:126:499:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:However, it does not follow from these studies’ findings that hands-free laws 
7:167:12644:27:28:90:522:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:have no effect on traffic safety. These studies have found that hands-free devices offer no 
7:168:12736:28:27:90:472:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reduction in driver inattention or crash risk relative to handheld mobile devices 
7:169:12818:27:28:90:517:626:144:Times:144:g_d0_f6:conditional on using a phone while driving. But drivers choose whether and when to use 
7:170:12905:28:28:90:489:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:a phone, and it is theoretically possible that a hands-free law could change drivers’ 
7:171:12991:28:27:90:503:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:likelihood of using a phone while driving. On one hand, a hands-free law could make 
7:172:13075:27:28:90:518:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drivers less likely to talk while driving if hands-free technology is cumbersome or lower-
7:173:13165:28:27:90:498:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:quality or if the hands-free law serves as an educational warning about the danger of 
7:174:13251:27:28:90:519:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:talking while driving; in these ways, a hands-free law could increase safety. On the other 
7:175:13342:28:28:90:515:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hand, a hands-free law could make drivers believe that hands-free devices are safer than 
7:176:13431:28:27:90:500:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:handhelds and therefore raise drivers’ likelihood to use a phone while driving; in this 
7:177:13519:27:28:90:523:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:way, a hands-free law could reduce safety. The effect of a hands-free law on traffic safety 
7:178:13611:28:27:90:511:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:is therefore unanswered by previous research; this paper answers this question directly,

7:181:13707:27:28:126:258:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:APPROACH AND DATA 
7:182:13725:28:28:126:500:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:This paper uses state-level panel data on mobile phone ownership, hands-free 
7:183:13802:28:27:90:515:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:laws, and traffic fatalities to assess the overall effect of phone ownership and hands-free 
7:184:13894:27:28:90:501:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:laws on fatalities. Applying these methods to mobile phones and hands-free laws has 
7:185:13978:28:27:90:490:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:advantages over laboratory studies and over self-reported or administrative data on 
7:186:14062:27:28:90:498:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone usage while driving. First, mobile phone usage can not be consistently 
7:187:14146:28:28:90:516:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:observed or measured at the time of a traffic incident. A driver might purposely hang up 
7:188:14235:28:0:90:520:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:so not to appear negligent, and police do not have immediate or comprehensive access to 
8:189:14323:0:36:90:699:744:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:DRAFT                                                          6                                                                                                                                                                              
8:190:14564:36:27:90:504:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone records. These concerns make data on observed phone usage, including 
8:191:14646:27:28:90:508:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:police reports on mobile phone involvement in traffic accidents, questionable. Second, 
8:192:14733:28:27:90:522:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hands-free laws might have effects on driving behavior and mobile phone usage behavior 
8:193:14820:27:28:89:522:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that are not captured in laboratory settings. Hands-free laws could affect the likelihood of 
8:194:14913:28:28:89:521:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:whether drivers use a phone at all while driving, regardless of whether the device is hand-
8:195:15004:28:27:89:518:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:held or hands-free. Furthermore, the people who switch from hand-held phones to hands-
8:196:15090:27:28:89:470:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:free phones in places where a law is in effect could differ from the people who 
8:197:15170:28:27:89:512:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:voluntarily switch from hand-held phones to hands-free phones in the absence of a law. 
8:198:15257:27:28:89:524:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The presence of driver heterogeneity (as Hahn and Prieger 2006 show) means that we can 
8:199:15344:28:28:89:512:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:not judge the effect of hands-free laws based on the behavior of people who voluntarily 
8:200:15432:28:27:89:503:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:switched from hand-held to hands-free phones in the absence of a law. To understand 
8:201:15516:27:28:89:514:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:how mobile phone ownership and hands-free laws affect traffic fatalities, it is important 
8:202:15606:28:27:89:498:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to analyze how fatalities have changed in places where hands-free laws are in effect. 
8:203:15692:27:28:125:510:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Using state-level panel data is a standard framework in the economics literature 
8:204:15773:28:27:89:504:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:on traffic safety issues, which exploits changes in laws or other exogenous forces that 
8:205:15861:27:28:89:513:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:affect states at different times or rates. This method has been used to study the effect on

8:209:16222:28:27:89:520:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:NHTSA’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which reports traffic fatality data 
8:210:16309:27:28:89:522:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:comprehensively and consistently across all states for many years. The fatality data cover 
8:211:16400:28:0:89:505:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:deaths from traffic incidents of drivers, passengers, and others, including pedestrians.

9:213:16731:36:27:126:513:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:This paper also uses FARS fatality data aggregated by state and year. But rather 
9:214:16812:27:28:90:494:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:than relying on aggregated FARS data published by NHTSA, this paper uses FARS 
9:215:16890:28:27:90:500:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:microdata on persons, vehicles, and conditions to create customized state-year totals. 
9:216:16977:27:28:90:517:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Customized aggregation has two advantages. First, it is possible to exclude fatalities that 
9:217:17069:28:28:90:514:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:could be related to policy factors that are difficult to summarize using state-year control 
9:218:17161:28:27:90:512:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variables. For instance, over the time period covered in this paper, many states changed 
9:219:17250:27:28:90:513:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the minimum ages for getting a learner’s permit and a driver’s license; states might also 
9:220:17340:28:27:90:500:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:have changed the level of enforcement or penalties for driving under the influence of 
9:221:17426:27:28:90:499:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:alcohol. Both young and drunk drivers are involved in a considerable share of traffic 
9:222:17512:28:28:90:508:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities, and rather than attempt to develop crude proxies for state policies, this paper 
9:223:17604:28:27:90:517:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:will look at aggregate fatality measures that exclude accidents involving young or drunk 
9:224:17693:27:28:90:504:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drivers. Second, it is possible to look separately at fatalities under specific conditions, 
9:225:17785:28:27:90:498:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:such as when roads are wet or at nighttime. Since mobile phone usage could vary by 
9:226:17868:27:28:90:481:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions (if, say, people use mobile phones more during rush hour) or different 
9:227:17950:28:27:90:503:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions could alter the effect of mobile phones on fatalities (if, say, mobile phones 
9:228:18039:27:28:90:482:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:aggravate the risk of fatalities on icy roads), looking separately at fatalities under 
9:229:18126:28:28:89:500:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:different conditions might help explain not only whether mobile phones affect traffic 
9:230:18212:28:27:89:201:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities but also why. 
9:231:18237:27:28:125:521:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Ideally, this paper would investigate the effect of mobile phones on both fatalities 
9:232:18322:28:27:89:515:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and non-fatal accidents. However, FARS only includes accidents that result in fatalities, 
9:233:18412:27:28:89:520:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and there are no data for non-fatal accidents measured consistently across states and over 
9:234:18503:28:32:89:518:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:time.5 Although fatal accidents constitute a small percentage of total accidents, they bear 
9:235:18595:32:7:90:237:97:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
9:236:18643:7:16:90:504:90:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:5 The NHTSA’s initiative to coordinate non-fatal crash data, the State Data System (SDS), included 29 
9:237:18745:16:0:89:498:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:states as of 2004, up from 17 states in 1999. Each state reports non-fatal crash data using its own data 
10:238:18850:0:36:90:699:744:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:DRAFT                                                          8                                                                                                                                                                              
10:239:19091:36:27:90:486:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:a much larger share of media and policy attention.6 Even a conservative economic 
10:240:19172:27:28:90:522:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:measure of the value of a human life is far in excess of the monetary cost of replacing the 
10:241:19264:28:27:90:523:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:most expensive car totaled in a non-fatal accident. Still, it is plausible that the distractions 
10:242:19361:27:28:90:519:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of mobile phone usage affect the likelihood of non-fatal accidents differently than that of 
10:243:19453:28:28:90:504:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatal accidents. If anything, mobile phones are likely to increase fatalities by less than 
10:244:19544:28:27:90:522:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:they increase non-fatal accidents if (as mentioned above) having a mobile phone makes it 
10:245:19633:27:28:90:524:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:easier to get emergency assistance quickly after an accident and reduce the likelihood that 
10:246:19725:28:27:90:517:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:an accident results in a fatality. Unlike this paper, Redelmeier and Tibshirani (1997) and 
10:247:19816:27:28:90:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Hahn and Prieger (2006) look only at non-fatal accidents because they rely on  surveys of 
10:248:19906:28:28:90:506:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drivers’ past accident history and obviously cannot include drivers who have died as a 
10:249:19993:28:27:90:196:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:result of an accident.  
10:250:20017:27:28:126:517:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:For this study, data on mobile phone ownership come from Forrester Research, a 
10:251:20096:28:27:90:446:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:technology research and consulting firm. Each year Forrester conducts its 
10:252:20170:27:28:90:520:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Technographics benchmark survey of 60,000-100,000 households about their technology 
10:253:20254:28:27:90:518:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:adoption and behaviors.7 Over the period 1997-2005, Forrester’s Technographics survey 
10:254:20340:27:94:90:480:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:asked about mobile phone ownership in the household. State-level mobile-phone

10:256:20562:12:12:90:499:189:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:definitions and reporting standards, whereas the FARS system for fatalities is consistent across states, 
10:257:20667:12:11:89:468:177:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:includes all states, and covers many years. See http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd-

10:259:20778:7:16:90:508:159:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:6 In 2004, there were 38,000 fatal crashes, 1.9 million injury crashes, and 4.3 million non-injury crashes 
10:260:20885:16:12:89:510:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:(property damage only). Fatal crashes therefore account for about 2% of crashes in which there is bodily 
10:261:20990:12:7:89:273:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:harm, and .6% of all crashes (NHTSA 2005). 
10:262:21033:7:16:90:520:124:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:7 Forrester’s Technographics surveys are conducted by mail; the samples are selected from national market 
10:263:21139:16:11:90:504:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:research panels to be representative of US households demographically and are weighted to correct for 
10:264:21241:11:12:90:509:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:differences in response rates. Forrester has used TNS/NFO’s market research panel since 2001 and used 
10:265:21343:12:11:90:482:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:NPD’s panel in earlier years. Forrester collects data in the 48 contiguous states and the District of 
10:266:21445:11:0:90:250:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:Columbia, but not in Alaska or Hawaii.

11:268:21725:36:27:90:511:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership in each year is tabulated from this question. The survey does not ask mobile 
11:269:21812:27:28:90:478:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:phone owners whether they use their mobile phones specifically while driving.8  
11:270:21892:28:27:125:496:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:An alternative, less suitable source of data on mobile phone ownership is the 
11:271:21970:27:28:89:485:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which reports mobile subscriptions 
11:272:22046:28:28:89:493:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:annually based on wireless carriers’ reporting requirements. The FCC data have the 
11:273:22129:28:27:89:487:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:disadvantage of identifying the location of where the mobile phone subscription is 
11:274:22212:27:28:89:511:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:registered, which might not be where the subscriber lives and drives most often. This is 
11:275:22301:28:27:89:510:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:not just a hypothetical concern: the disadvantage of this can be seen most clearly in the 
11:276:22391:27:28:89:492:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:data for the District of Columbia (DC), where in 2004 the FCC reported 1.2 mobile 
11:277:22473:28:28:89:506:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:subscriptions per resident, compared to 68% household ownership in DC according to 
11:278:22556:28:27:89:501:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Forrester. The discrepancy between the FCC and Forrester data for DC is most likely 
11:279:22640:27:28:89:516:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explained by commuters who live in Maryland and Virginia and work in DC, do little of 
11:280:22726:28:27:89:504:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:their driving in DC (or none, if they commute by transit), but have their mobile phone 
11:281:22813:27:28:89:514:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:subscriptions registered in DC. Furthermore, the FCC does not require carriers to report 
11:282:22902:28:27:89:504:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:subscriptions for any state in which they have fewer than 10,000 subscribers. In some 
11:283:22988:27:28:89:521:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:small states in some years, aggregate mobile subscription data are suppressed to maintain 
11:284:23078:28:28:89:519:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:confidentiality of individual provider data.9 Finally, the FCC reports mobile subscription 
11:285:23169:28:27:90:510:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:by state starting only in 1999. For all of these reasons, this paper relies on the Forrester

11:288:23317:8:16:90:511:170:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:8 In the US, talking on mobile phones has long been associated with driving. In the early years of mobile 
11:289:23423:16:11:90:501:154:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:phones, they were regularly called “car phones.” In 2003 mobile phone users spent 44% of their usage 
11:290:23524:11:12:90:523:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:minutes in cars (Dizon 2004). In 2006, 73% of adults who drive and have a cell phone reported in an online 
11:291:23631:12:7:90:447:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:survey that talk on their cell phone while driving at least some of the time (Harris 2006). 
11:292:23723:7:16:90:513:124:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:9 This potentially introduces a form of bias that would not be eliminated using state or fixed effects. With 
11:293:23832:16:11:90:515:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:the rapid growth of mobile phone subscriptions, underreporting at the state level would be greatest in low-

12:301:24481:27:28:90:511:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:opposite directions. Traffic fatalities in the US fell from 15.4 per 100,000 population in 
12:302:24572:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:1997 to 14.7 per 100,000 population in 2005. At the same time, mobile phone ownership 
12:303:24658:28:27:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:grew from 38% of households in 1997 to 76% of households in 2005.11 In states were 
12:304:24741:27:28:90:519:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone ownership increased more over the period, traffic fatalities increased more 
12:305:24830:28:27:89:503:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(or decreased less), but this relationship is not statistically significant. The correlation 
12:306:24923:27:28:89:518:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:between 1997-2005 changes in household mobile phone ownership and per capita traffic 
12:307:25008:28:28:90:522:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities is .07, (p=.62, n=49). Figure 1 depicts this relationship. States vary considerably 
12:308:25103:28:27:90:514:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in both the levels and changes in fatalities and mobile phone ownership. In 2005, traffic 
12:309:25193:27:28:90:515:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities per 100,000 population ranged from 33.4 in Wyoming to 6.9 in Massachusetts. 
12:310:25280:28:27:90:484:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The change in traffic fatalities over 1997-2005 ranged from an increase of 5.4 per 
12:311:25363:27:28:90:516:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:100,000 in Wyoming to a decrease of 5.8 per 100,000 in Utah. Mobile phone ownership 
12:312:25447:28:27:90:485:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in 2005 was highest in Georgia (84%) and Connecticut (83%) and lowest in West 
12:313:25525:27:28:90:513:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Virginia (53%); the change in mobile phone ownership over 1997-2005 ranged from an 
12:314:25608:28:28:89:493:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:increase of 45 percentage points in New Hampshire to an increase of 29 percentage 
12:315:25690:28:27:90:243:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:points in Illinois and Nebraska. 
12:316:25723:27:28:126:501:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Many factors affect traffic fatalities, and, over this period when mobile phone 
12:317:25803:28:27:90:500:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership rose rapidly, numerous other trends contributed to the reduction in overall 
12:318:25889:27:28:90:479:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities, including improvements in vehicle technology and the laws and public 
12:319:25970:28:32:90:484:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:awareness about factors, like drunk driving and seat belts, as shown in the studies

13:324:26528:36:27:90:521:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:discussed above. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity among states that could be 
13:325:26620:27:28:90:503:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:correlated with changes in both traffic fatalities and mobile phone ownership, such as 
13:326:26707:28:27:90:519:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:vehicle miles traveled per capita, economic conditions, and demographic changes, which 
13:327:26794:27:28:90:279:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the economics literature has identified. 
13:328:26835:28:28:126:523:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:To isolate the effect of mobile phones on fatalities, the empirical strategy involves 
13:329:26921:28:27:90:520:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:both state and year fixed-effects as well as additional independent variables not absorbed 
13:330:27012:27:28:90:358:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in the fixed effects.12 The model to be estimated is this:

13:333:27071:28:28:90:521:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The dependent variable is per capita traffic fatalities of type j in state i and year j. Results

13:335:27260:27:28:90:511:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explained below. The explanatory variable of interest is mobile phone ownership in the

13:342:27829:8:16:90:518:193:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:12 Because of possible correlation of errors for observations for the same state across years, standard errors 
13:343:27940:16:7:90:382:177:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:will be corrected by clustering on state in all specifications in this paper. 
13:344:28018:7:11:90:482:170:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:13 “Mobile phone ownership” always refers to the percentage of households with a mobile phone.

14:361:29130:36:27:126:518:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Two additional factors, alcohol policies and youth driving restrictions, have been 
14:362:29213:27:28:89:506:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:shown in other research to affect fatalities. Because alcohol policies and youth driving 
14:363:29302:28:27:89:515:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:restrictions could be correlated with mobile phone adoption or with the promulgation of 
14:364:29390:27:28:89:493:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hands-free laws, they need to be accounted for. First, alcohol: there is no doubt that 
14:365:29477:28:28:89:506:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:alcohol affects fatality rates. Levitt and Porter (2001) find legally drunk drivers are 13 
14:366:29568:28:27:89:458:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:times more likely to have fatal accidents than sober drivers, and that in 1993 
14:367:29647:27:28:89:508:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:approximately 15% of drivers on the road between 8 pm and 5 am have been drinking. 
14:368:29730:28:27:89:498:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:NHTSA reports that 34% of traffic fatalities in 2004 were alcohol-related. However, 
14:369:29814:27:28:89:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:some policies, like minimum drinking ages and severity of punishment for drunk-driving, 
14:370:29902:28:28:89:509:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:affect fatality rates; others, like beer taxes and the legal limit on blood-alcohol content, 
14:371:29995:28:27:89:508:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:appear not to (see Levitt and Porter (2001), Dee (1999), and Cohen and Einav(2003)).  
14:372:30081:27:28:125:507:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Second, youth driving: Simons-Morton and Ouimet (2006) review the relevant 
14:373:30156:28:27:89:495:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:literature, which shows that graduated licensing programs, which put restrictions on 
14:374:30241:27:28:89:504:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:young drivers (typically 16 and 17 year-olds) in the form of a “junior license,” reduce 
14:375:30329:28:27:89:520:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:crash rates. During the period 1997-2005 most states toughened their graduated licensing 
14:376:30418:27:28:89:521:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:program, for instance by forbidding driving during certain hours or in certain locations or 
14:377:30510:28:28:89:286:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:requiring driving with adult passengers.  
14:378:30552:28:27:125:519:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Explanatory variables related to alcohol policies and graduated licensing laws are 
14:379:30635:27:28:89:513:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:excluded from the specification even though both are known to affect fatality rates. The 
14:380:30724:28:27:89:524:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variables for alcohol-related policies are often crude measures and, in many cases, exhibit 
14:381:30816:27:28:89:480:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:little state variation over the recent period.15 Graduated licensing laws do exhibit 
14:382:30901:28:20:90:518:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variation across states over the time period under study, but graduated licensing laws are 
14:383:30992:20:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
14:384:31040:8:16:90:514:101:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:15 For instance, the 1984 National Minimum Drinking Age Act made federal highway funding contingent 
14:385:31140:16:11:90:511:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:on states raising the drinking age to 21. Since 1988 all states have met the federal rules, although there is 
14:386:31250:11:0:90:414:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:some state variation on exceptions like underage drinking with parental consent.

15:388:31569:36:27:90:483:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:multi-faceted and are not easily compared across states or reduced to quantitative 
15:389:31652:27:28:90:141:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:measures. 
15:390:31662:28:27:126:514:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:As an alternative way to handle alcohol and youth driving, this paper focuses on 
15:391:31743:27:28:90:511:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities that involve neither alcohol nor a youth driver – fatalities which should not be 
15:392:31835:28:28:90:499:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:affected by alcohol policies or graduated licensing laws.16 In fact, it is likely that any 
15:393:31926:28:27:90:498:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect of mobile phone ownership on traffic fatalities would be more pronounced for 
15:394:32010:27:28:89:521:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers. This is in part because the peak times for 
15:395:32104:28:27:89:503:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone usage while driving are different than the peak times for drunk driving. 
15:396:32190:27:28:89:515:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:NHTSA reports that 54% of weekend night fatalities are alcohol-related, compared with 
15:397:32276:28:28:90:507:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:11% of weekday daytime fatalities. In contrast, NHTSA observations of mobile phone

15:399:32443:27:28:90:501:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rush-hours; the NHTSA does not conduct its mobile phone usage observation studies 
15:400:32525:28:27:90:509:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:outside of daylight hours (see Tables 2 and 3). Furthermore, many states forbid drivers 
15:401:32613:27:28:90:485:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:with learners’ permits from using mobile phones, regardless of whether the phone

15:403:32733:27:28:126:515:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The first results using the empirical model are presented in Table 4; the effect of 
15:404:32817:28:28:90:502:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone ownership on fatalities is inconclusive. Column 1 of Table 4 shows the 
15:405:32901:28:27:90:503:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficient on mobile phone ownership in the absence of controls other than state and

15:407:33080:28:29:90:520:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in column 2) lowers the coefficient value by one-third. The coefficient on unemployment

15:409:33216:8:16:90:511:147:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:16 Following the NHTSA definition, this paper defines a fatality as “alcohol-related” if any driver or non-
15:410:33323:16:11:90:495:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:motorist (a pedestrian, usually) involved had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 grams per 
15:411:33423:11:12:90:520:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:deciliter (g/dl) or above. FARS reports BAC measurements or estimates for all participants in a fatal crash.

16:417:34117:36:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rate is negative and statistically significant.18 To test for a non-linear relationship between 
16:418:34213:27:28:89:519:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone ownership and traffic fatalities, column 3 of Table 4 includes the square of 
16:419:34303:28:27:89:486:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone ownership, which is statistically insignificant. Column 4 repeats the 
16:420:34386:27:28:89:518:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:specification in column 2, but using only fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers 
16:421:34478:28:28:89:517:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:as the dependent variable. The coefficients on the age variables fall, and in particular the 
16:422:34571:28:27:89:498:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficient on the share of adults age 16-24 moves from being significant at the 10%

16:424:34744:28:27:89:512:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Excluding fatalities involving youth drivers naturally affects the coefficients on the age 
16:425:34835:27:28:90:514:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variables, and excluding alcohol-related fatalities matters as well since the likelihood of 
16:426:34927:28:28:90:364:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:alcohol involvement in a crash varies by age of victim.19 
16:427:34984:28:27:126:524:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The effect of mobile phones on traffic fatalities, however, depends on weather and 
16:428:35067:27:28:90:520:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:road conditions.20 Table 5 presents the same specification as before but for specific types 
16:429:35159:28:27:90:523:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of traffic fatalities. All columns exclude fatalities involving alcohol or young drivers. The 
16:430:35253:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effects of mobile phone ownership on fatalities in good weather or dry road conditions 
16:431:35340:28:27:90:520:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:are indistinguishable from zero. The coefficients of mobile phone ownership on fatalities 
16:432:35430:27:28:90:521:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in bad weather or wet road conditions are positive, statistically significant, and large. The 
16:433:35524:28:28:90:520:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficient of 2.22 in the regression of bad weather fatalities (column 2), when compared 
16:434:35614:28:27:90:510:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to the average bad-weather fatality rate of 1.37, implies that every ten-percentage point

16:440:36074:16:11:90:519:154:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:someone in the crash, not necessarily the driver or the person killed, was intoxicated), compared with 38% 
16:441:36181:11:7:90:514:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:of 16-24 year-olds, 33% of 45-64 year-olds, 17% of 0-15 year-olds, and 12% of people 65 years or older. 
16:442:36285:7:16:90:493:136:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:20 In this paper, “bad weather” is defined as “rain,” “sleet,” “snow,” “fog,” or “other” (smoke, smog, 
16:443:36388:16:12:90:521:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:blowing sand, or dust). In this paper, “wet road conditions” are defined as “wet”, “snow or slush”, “ice”, or 
16:444:36498:12:11:89:519:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:“sand, dirt, or oil.” The FARS coding manual enumerates these weather and road conditions, which guides

16:446:36710:12:11:89:499:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:of persons involved, vehicles involved, and the accident itself. The accident variables include weather 
16:447:36814:11:0:89:491:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:conditions and road surface conditions at the time of the crash, as well as numerous other attributes.

17:451:37322:28:27:90:524:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities (column 4), when compared to the average wet-road fatality rate of 1.90, implies 
17:452:37414:27:28:90:505:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that a ten-percentage point increase in mobile phone ownership raises wet-road traffic 
17:453:37501:28:28:89:523:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities by 13%. In sum, mobile phone ownership increases fatalities in bad weather and 
17:454:37591:28:27:89:483:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in wet road conditions by a large amount, though not in good weather or dry road 
17:455:37672:27:28:89:145:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions. 
17:456:37684:28:27:125:515:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Mobile phone ownership does not have a statistically significant effect on traffic

17:458:37854:28:28:89:515:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:positive but statistically insignificant for daylight, darkness, and dawn or dusk fatalities, 
17:459:37948:28:27:89:493:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:as well as rush-hour fatalities (which can be in daylight, darkness, or dawn or dusk, 
17:460:38034:27:28:89:322:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:depending on the season), as shown in Table 6.  
17:461:38082:28:27:125:517:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Mobile phone ownership, therefore, has a large and statistically significant effect

17:463:38257:28:27:89:511:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mobile phone ownership is associated with a large increase in fatalities, suggesting that 
17:464:38347:27:28:89:516:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the distraction of mobile phone usage aggravates the challenge of driving under difficult

17:466:38519:28:27:89:521:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership does not, however, contribute to fatalities in either the increased congestion of 
17:467:38611:27:28:89:359:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rush-hour traffic or the decreased visibility of darkness.

17:470:38718:8:16:90:499:124:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:21 One should not make estimates of how much the increase of mobile phones ownership from zero to 
17:471:38816:16:11:90:517:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:current levels have affected fatalities since the time period covered by this paper begins only when mobile 
17:472:38924:11:12:90:510:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:phone ownership was at 38% nationally. Even though the results show that a linear relationship between 
17:473:39027:12:11:90:501:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:mobile phone ownership and traffic fatalities is a reasonable hypothesis, the relationship could be non-
17:474:39131:11:0:90:440:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:linear if years prior to 1997, when mobile phone ownership was lower, were included.

18:477:39494:27:28:126:521:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:To test the effect of hands-free laws, the analysis now looks at how fatalities have 
18:478:39579:28:27:90:506:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:changed in the few states with hands-free laws relative to the rest of the US. Although 
18:479:39667:27:28:89:514:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:laws requiring drivers to use hands-free devices when using phones are the norm in rich 
18:480:39755:28:28:89:523:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:countries, within the US only New York, New Jersey, the District of Columbia (DC), and 
18:481:39842:28:27:89:485:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Connecticut have state-wide hands-free laws in effect, with similar laws passed in 
18:482:39925:27:28:89:471:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:California and Washington. Some cities in other states, like Santa Fe, NM, and 
18:483:40004:28:27:89:501:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Brookline, MA, require hands-free devices while talking and driving. In many states, 
18:484:40089:27:28:90:489:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:some types of drivers – such as school-bus drivers – are required to use hands-free 
18:485:40173:28:28:89:523:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:devices. On the other hand, eight states forbid their municipalities from restricting mobile 
18:486:40266:28:27:90:234:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:phone usage while driving.22  
18:487:40296:27:28:126:522:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Only New York had a hands-free law in effect during a significant period covered

18:490:40546:28:27:90:474:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:New Jersey’s and the District of Columbia’s laws took effect in July, 2004, and 
18:491:40626:27:28:90:513:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Connecticut’s in October, 2005. California’s and Washington’s laws take effect in July,

18:493:40795:28:27:90:522:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities will therefore be based on data from New York only, while the short-term effect

18:497:41058:28:20:90:473:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:a decline in fatalities, New York an increase, and New Jersey little change, in a

19:504:41806:27:28:90:517:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:year prior to the hands-free law taking effect and the first year the law was in effect; this 
19:505:41900:28:27:90:509:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:change over time is compared with the change in fatalities for the same time period for 
19:506:41988:27:28:90:490:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the U.S. excluding the four states with laws in effect at any time. In New York, the 
19:507:42073:28:28:90:509:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:difference-in-differences was positive for overall fatalities, those not involving alcohol 
19:508:42164:28:27:90:489:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and youth drivers, and those in bad weather and in wet road conditions. In DC, the 
19:509:42247:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:difference-in-differences was negative for all four types of fatalities, and dramatically so: 
19:510:42341:28:27:90:507:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers fell by close to half in the year starting 
19:511:42434:27:28:90:497:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:July 2004, when the hands-free law took effect. Connecticut was excluded from this 
19:512:42517:28:28:90:516:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:analysis because the law was in effect for only three months during the period this study 
19:513:42607:28:27:90:127:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:covers. 
19:514:42615:27:28:126:499:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Over a longer time period after the hands-free law took effect, however, New 
19:515:42692:28:27:90:523:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:York’s fatality rate has fallen relative to that of the US overall. Since 1997 New York has 
19:516:42784:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:had lower fatality rates – both overall and for specific types of fatalities – than the US, 
19:517:42876:28:27:90:512:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:but the gap widened after 2002 for fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers. The 
19:518:42966:27:28:89:521:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:gap widened after 2002 for fatalities in bad weather or wet road conditions, not involving 
19:519:43057:28:28:89:515:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:alcohol or youth drivers, as well. The fatality rate not involving alcohol or youth drivers 
19:520:43149:28:27:89:517:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in New York fell from 5.56 per 100,000 population in 2001, the year at the end of which 
19:521:43237:27:28:89:287:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the law went into effect, to 4.89 in 2005. 
19:522:43280:28:27:125:477:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:To include the experience of all states with hands-free laws in effect, the 
19:523:43356:27:28:89:517:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:empirical framework is expanded to include a variable equal to the share of the year that 
19:524:43446:28:28:89:505:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:a state had a hands-free law in effect. The model of the effect of hands-free laws to be

20:529:43787:28:27:90:517:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The law variable for New York equals .17 in 2001 and 1 in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005; 
20:530:43873:27:28:90:520:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:for New Jersey and DC, .5 in 2004 and 1 in 2005; for Connecticut, .25 in 2005; and 0 for 
20:531:43962:28:28:90:519:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:all other state-years. In this model, the coefficient on the existence of a hands-free law in 
20:532:44056:28:27:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:state i at time t is interpreted as a one-time permanent shift in fatalities due to the law. 
20:533:44149:27:28:89:478:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:This model implies that the law has an immediate and persistent effect on traffic 
20:534:44231:28:27:90:140:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities.  
20:535:44244:27:28:126:508:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The coefficient on the hands-free law dummy is negative and significant for all 
20:536:44324:28:28:90:494:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:three measures of fatalities that exclude those involving alcohol or youth drivers. In 
20:537:44411:28:27:90:517:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:column 1 of table 9, the coefficient on the hands-free law for all fatalities is negative but 
20:538:44505:27:28:90:510:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:not statistically significant (t=1.6). For fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers, 
20:539:44599:28:27:90:483:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the coefficient is -.907 and statistically significant; this large magnitude implies a 
20:540:44686:27:28:90:484:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reduction in fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers of nearly 10%.23 The 
20:541:44770:28:27:90:507:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficients on hands-free law is negative and significant for both the bad-weather and 
20:542:44858:27:28:90:502:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:wet-road-condition fatalities; having the law in effect implies a 17% reduction in bad-
20:543:44945:28:28:90:506:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:weather fatalities and a 16% reduction in wet-road-condition fatalities. Comparing the 
20:544:45032:28:27:90:519:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficients on hands-free law with those on mobile phone ownership, the effect of a law 
20:545:45121:27:28:90:509:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:is roughly equivalent to reducing mobile phone ownership by more than 10 percentage 
20:546:45205:28:27:90:125:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:points. 
20:547:45213:27:28:126:501:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:However, a more plausible and less restrictive model would allow both for an 
20:548:45290:28:32:90:485:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:initial change in the level of fatalities as well as an ongoing change in the trend of

21:560:45860:36:27:90:516:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities. The difference-in-differences analysis showed that fatalities in New York rose 
21:561:45951:27:28:90:511:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the first year; reductions in fatalities came in subsequent years. A second model, which 
21:562:46040:28:27:90:171:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:captures this, is:

21:565:46059:28:27:90:514:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In this model, the impact of the hands-free law is captured both by the initial (intercept) 
21:566:46151:27:28:90:513:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:shift, represented by θ1, and by the change in the trend, represented by θ2. The lawyears 
21:567:46241:28:27:90:509:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variable equals the number of years since the passage of the hands-free law in state i at 
21:568:46331:27:28:89:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:time t. Since this model tests whether the law changes the trend in fatalities, a linear trend 
21:569:46426:28:28:90:520:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:is included as well for every state i in the set of states M which have a law in effect for at 
21:570:46521:28:27:90:488:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:least a year during the period 1997-2005. This applies to New York, DC, and New 
21:571:46601:27:28:90:426:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Jersey, so the model includes a linear time trend for those three areas. 
21:572:46674:28:27:126:487:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:For the three fatality types that do not involve alcohol or youth drivers, the 
21:573:46753:27:28:90:507:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficients on both the hands-free-law intercept-shift and the hands-free-law and year 
21:574:46841:28:27:90:514:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:interaction are negative, though not statistically significant at the 5% level. The law and 
21:575:46933:27:28:90:496:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:year interaction is negative and significant at the 10% level for fatalities in wet-road 
21:576:47022:28:28:90:489:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions (see column 4, Table 10). None of the three state-specific time trends is 
21:577:47107:28:27:90:204:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:statistically significant. 
21:578:47134:27:28:126:480:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Because all four hands-free laws took effect mid-year, the above analysis

21:580:47295:27:28:90:493:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:year that the law was in effect. To remove this measurement error, the analysis was 
21:581:47379:28:28:90:521:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:repeated with monthly data.24 The FARS reports the day and time of each fatality, so it is 
21:582:47470:28:15:90:519:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:possible to generate fatality rates by month rather than by year. Forrester’s mobile phone

22:603:48047:36:27:90:508:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership measure, however, comes from an annual survey at the end of each year, so 
22:604:48131:27:28:90:511:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the monthly level of mobile phone ownership was linearly interpolated using the figure 
22:605:48218:28:27:90:520:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:from the Decembers preceding and following the month in question. All four of the other 
22:606:48306:27:28:90:501:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explanatory variables – vehicle miles traveled, unemployment rate, precipitation, and 
22:607:48392:28:28:90:517:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:heating degree days – are available monthly by state as well. The Census reports the age 
22:608:48481:28:27:90:488:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:distribution only annually, and because none of the age variables has any effect on 
22:609:48565:27:28:90:518:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers, the age variables were dropped from the 
22:610:48656:28:27:90:477:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:month-level analysis. The specifications remain the same as for the annual-level 
22:611:48737:27:28:90:482:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:analysis.25 Monthly fatalities are reported per million population, whereas annual 
22:612:48820:28:28:90:521:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities were reported per 100,000 population. Summary statistics for monthly variables 
22:613:48910:28:27:90:217:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:are presented in Table 11. 
22:614:48937:27:28:126:500:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The results of the month-level analysis are very similar to those in the annual-
22:615:49017:28:27:90:519:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:level analysis. Under the restrictive model of the law having an immediate and persistent 
22:616:49107:27:28:90:492:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect (i.e. only an intercept shift), the coefficient on hands-free law is negative and 
22:617:49196:28:27:90:513:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:statistically significant for the three fatality types not involving alcohol or youth drivers 
22:618:49290:27:28:90:500:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(see Table 12). The coefficient magnitudes are nearly identical to the annual analysis 
22:619:49377:28:28:90:508:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:after taking into account the rescaling of the fatalities variable from per 100,000 to per 
22:620:49468:28:27:90:134:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:million.  
22:621:49478:27:28:126:495:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Adding the variable for the number of months that the law has been in effect 
22:622:49555:28:27:90:519:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:yields the same results as before: for all fatality types, both the law dummy (representing 
22:623:49647:27:37:90:507:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:an intercept shift) and the law-and-month interaction (representing a slope change) are

22:625:49783:7:16:90:521:113:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:25 The month-level panel covers 97 months: December 1997 to December 2005. Earlier months in 1997 are 
22:626:49885:16:12:90:523:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:excluded because December 1997 is the earliest that mobile phone ownership is available, and interpolation 
22:627:49992:12:11:90:520:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:for the rest of 1997 would require an earlier value. With 49 states (including DC and excluding Alaska and 
22:628:50099:11:0:90:314:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:Hawaii), the number of observations is 97 x 49 = 4753.

23:630:50392:36:27:90:507:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:negative yet statistically insignificant. The one exception is that the interaction term in 
23:631:50484:27:28:90:521:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the regression for fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers (column 2 of Table 13) 
23:632:50576:28:27:89:503:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:is negative and statistically significant. The time trends for New York and DC are not 
23:633:50663:27:28:89:512:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:statistically significant for any fatality type; the time trend for New Jersey is significant 
23:634:50757:28:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:for only fatalities in wet road conditions not involving alcohol or youth drivers (column 4 
23:635:50849:28:27:90:521:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of Table 13) and for Connecticut, which had a law in effect only for the last three months 
23:636:50940:27:28:90:217:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of the period under study. 
23:637:50967:28:27:126:523:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The final specification replaces the intercept-and-shift terms with dummies for six 
23:638:51051:27:28:90:503:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:periods after the law took effect. This allows the effect to be non-linear; it also makes 
23:639:51141:28:28:90:506:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explicit which states’ experiences are contributing to the estimates. The first of the six 
23:640:51232:28:27:90:488:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:periods covers 1-6 months of the law in effect, and all four states contribute to this 
23:641:51319:27:28:90:479:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:estimate. The next two periods, which cover months 7-12 and 13-18, include the 
23:642:51398:28:27:90:490:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:experience of New York, New Jersey, and DC, and the last three periods, covering 
23:643:51479:27:28:90:522:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:months 19-24, 25-36, and 37+, include only New York. This specification also includes a 
23:644:51567:28:27:90:489:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:dummy indicating whether the law had been passed but had not yet taken effect.26  
23:645:51649:27:28:126:488:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The coefficients on the hands-free laws are consistently negative for all six 
23:646:51727:28:28:90:505:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:periods and all four fatality types, but only sometimes statistically significant.27 In the 
23:647:51819:28:27:90:506:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:regressions on all fatalities and on fatalities not involving alcohol or youth drivers, the 
23:648:51911:27:28:90:524:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficients on months 19-24 are statistically significant; in the regressions on fatalities in 
23:649:52007:28:27:90:495:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:bad weather and fatalities in wet road conditions (columns 3 and 4 of Table 14), the 
23:650:52092:27:48:90:496:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficients on months 25-36 and 37+ are all statistically significant. The only other 
23:651:52179:48:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:

23:653:52314:11:16:90:517:90:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:27 The one coefficient that is non-negative is the .004 value for months 13-18 in the regression of fatalities 
23:654:52425:16:0:90:256:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:in bad weather (column three, Table 14).

24:656:52704:36:27:90:517:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:statistically significant coefficient is that on months 7-12 in the regression of fatalities in

24:659:52821:27:28:126:309:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
24:660:52847:28:28:126:519:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Mobile phone ownership is associated with more traffic fatalities, but only in bad 
24:661:52930:28:27:90:508:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:weather or wet road conditions. In effect, mobile phone ownership interacts with these 
24:662:53017:27:28:90:478:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kinds of dangerous driving conditions to increase traffic fatalities. Mobile phone 
24:663:53100:28:27:90:514:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership has no statistically significant effect on fatalities in good weather or dry road 
24:664:53192:27:28:90:519:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions; nor does mobile phone ownership interact with darkness or the congestion of 
24:665:53280:28:28:90:498:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rush-hour to increase fatalities during those times. Because a small share of fatalities 
24:666:53369:28:27:90:506:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:occur in bad weather or wet road conditions, the effect on mobile phone ownership on 
24:667:53454:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities in these conditions are masked when fatalities are examined in aggregate. Just as 
24:668:53547:28:27:90:520:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the effect of mobile phones on traffic incidents may be heterogeneous across individuals, 
24:669:53637:27:28:90:523:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:as Hahn and Prieger (2006) find, the effects are also heterogeneous with regard to driving 
24:670:53728:28:27:90:146:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions. 
24:671:53740:27:28:126:522:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The findings about hands-free laws on traffic fatalities are less definitive, but they 
24:672:53827:28:28:90:508:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:suggest that laws probably reduce traffic fatalities, at least in the longer-term. Looking 
24:673:53918:28:27:90:490:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:across all the entire analysis of hands-free laws, the findings consistently point to a 
24:674:54006:27:28:90:470:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reduction in traffic fatalities when the laws are in effect. In the most restrictive 
24:675:54091:28:27:90:522:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:specification, where the hands-free law variable is a dummy representing a one-time shift 
24:676:54181:27:28:90:509:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in the level of fatalities, the estimates are statistically significant: it is clear that fatality 
24:677:54280:28:28:90:492:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rates fell after hands-free laws went into effect. In other specifications, many of the 
24:678:54368:28:0:90:500:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:estimates are not statistically different from zero. However, even in the most flexible 
25:679:54456:0:36:90:696:744:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:DRAFT                                                         23                                                                                                                                                                           
25:680:54694:36:27:90:500:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:specification, with non-linear effects, some estimates are statistically significant, and 
25:681:54784:27:28:90:226:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:essentially all are negative.  
25:682:54815:28:27:126:523:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The analysis is limited, of course, by the fact that only New York has had a law in 
25:683:54899:27:28:89:505:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect for longer than 18 months of the period under study. New York is the only state 
25:684:54986:28:28:89:489:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:contributing to these statistically significant (and large) declines in fatalities in bad 
25:685:55076:28:27:89:506:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:weather and in wet road conditions more than two years after the law went into effect. 
25:686:55163:27:28:89:498:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Because these significant results include a New York specific time trend, control for 
25:687:55249:28:27:89:511:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:weather variables, and exclude fatalities involving alcohol or youth drivers whose rates 
25:688:55338:27:28:89:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:could have been affected by other policy changes in New York, there is no other apparent 
25:689:55427:28:28:89:507:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explanation for the drop in these fatalities in New York other than the hands-free law.  
25:690:55516:28:27:125:519:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The big question is why hands-free laws appear to reduce some types of fatalities 
25:691:55598:27:28:89:511:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:when other research has consistently found that drivers using hands-free devices are no 
25:692:55686:28:27:89:518:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:less likely to be in accidents or be distracted than drivers using hand-held phones. Recall 
25:693:55778:27:28:89:512:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that these previous studies found a similar level of distraction among drivers using both 
25:694:55868:28:27:89:504:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:types of devices, conditional on using the device. In practice, however, drivers decide 
25:695:55956:27:28:89:496:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:whether and when to use mobile phones. The question, then, is how hands-free laws 
25:696:56038:28:28:89:499:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:might change drivers’ likelihood of using mobile phones when driving, regardless of 
25:697:56122:28:27:89:310:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:whether the device is handheld or hands-free. 
25:698:56168:27:28:125:495:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:It may be that drivers in states with hands-free laws are shifting their talking 
25:699:56249:28:27:89:520:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:minutes to when they are not driving, or to those times while driving when talking is less 
25:700:56340:27:37:89:494:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:likely to contribute to a fatal accident, or reducing their overall phone usage.28 Why 
25:701:56427:37:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
25:702:56475:7:16:90:501:113:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:28 Hands-free laws do not decrease mobile phone ownership or average spending on mobile phones. A 
25:703:56573:16:12:90:508:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:regression of mobile phone ownership on demographics for the same panel of states and years yields an 
25:704:56675:12:11:90:513:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:insignificant coefficient on the law variable; this is the case for both the level of mobile phone ownership 
25:705:56784:11:0:90:521:74:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:and the average household mobile phone bill. It is possible, however, that drivers in hands-free states could

26:707:57132:36:27:90:494:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:might hands-free laws reduce usage under some driving conditions? It could be that 
26:708:57215:27:28:89:501:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drivers find hands-free technology more cumbersome to use if making a call requires 
26:709:57299:28:27:89:513:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:handling two devices (the headset or earpiece and the phone) rather than one, or drivers 
26:710:57388:27:28:90:503:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:might find a decrease in sound quality from a bad headset or undependable Bluetooth 
26:711:57472:28:28:90:514:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:wireless connection. Unfortunately, the state-level data on mobile phone ownership and 
26:712:57559:28:27:90:418:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities used in this paper cannot assess any of these speculations.  
26:713:57631:27:28:126:520:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Yet another explanation why hands-free laws could reduce mobile phone usage is 
26:714:57710:28:27:90:511:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that the law in itself serves as an educational warning about the danger of talking while 
26:715:57800:27:28:90:524:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:driving, thus discouraging usage or at least encouraging more discretion in deciding when 
26:716:57890:28:28:90:507:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to talk. A test of this is whether fatalities decrease in the period after a state has passed 
26:717:57984:28:27:90:461:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the law but before it has taken effect; the passage of the law itself signals the 
26:718:58066:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:government’s belief of the danger of hand-held phones, so any education effect of the law 
26:719:58156:28:27:90:522:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:could begin at the time of passage rather than enforcement. The model presented in Table 
26:720:58245:27:28:90:494:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:14 includes a dummy indicating whether a hands-free law was passed but not yet in 
26:721:58327:28:27:90:523:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect. Table 7 shows that this period lasted five months in New York, six months in New 
26:722:58416:27:28:90:471:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Jersey and DC, and three months in Connecticut. The effect of passage prior to 
26:723:58495:28:28:90:487:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:enforcement is ambiguous: the effect is negative and statistically significant on all 
26:724:58581:28:27:90:513:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities (column 1 of Table 14) and positive and statistically significant on fatalities in 
26:725:58675:27:28:90:376:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:wet road conditions not involving alcohol or youth drivers. 
26:726:58735:28:27:126:517:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A recent Harris Poll tries to address these open questions. Among respondents in 
26:727:58816:27:37:90:501:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:states with hands-free laws, 61% use a mobile phone while driving all or some of the

26:730:59148:11:12:90:491:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:phone users with a monthly usage allotment do not pay for marginal minutes unless they exceed the 
26:731:59246:12:11:90:138:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:allotment.

27:734:59497:36:27:90:513:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:time, compared with 73% of respondents overall. Respondents in states with hands-free 
27:735:59583:27:28:90:512:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:laws are more likely to think that using a mobile phone while driving in dangerous than 
27:736:59671:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:respondents overall, 64% vs 56%. However, these results cannot be used to assess the 
27:737:59756:27:28:89:520:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect of hands-free laws because the poll was conducted only at one point in time, rather 
27:738:59847:28:28:89:513:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:than before-and-after hands-free laws came into effect. Therefore these poll data cannot 
27:739:59936:28:27:89:507:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rule out the possibility that respondents in states with hands-free laws exhibit different 
27:740:60027:27:28:89:395:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:behaviors and attitudes, regardless of the law being in effect.29  
27:741:60094:28:27:126:520:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The results show that the effect of New York’s hands-free law on reducing traffic 
27:742:60176:27:28:90:486:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities strengthens over time: after two years the effects on fatalities in wet road 
27:743:60264:28:28:90:506:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conditions and bad weather conditions are negative, statistically significant, and large. 
27:744:60354:28:27:90:482:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Several explanations are consistent with the law’s effect strengthening over time, 
27:745:60437:27:28:89:514:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:although the available data cannot be used to test these explanations. One is that drivers 
27:746:60528:28:27:89:512:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:wait to comply with the law until the probability and severity of enforcement is known. 
27:747:60616:27:28:89:499:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Another is that if hands-free laws have an educational effect or are introduced with a 
27:748:60703:28:27:90:496:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:program of education, the education takes time to sink in and change behaviors. Yet 
27:749:60787:27:28:90:461:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:another could be that over time drivers replace more cumbersome hands-free 
27:750:60862:28:28:90:494:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:technologies, like a corded headset, by investing in less obtrusive and plausibly less 
27:751:60949:28:27:90:500:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:distracting technologies like Bluetooth headsets or phones that are integrated into the

27:754:61107:7:16:90:519:159:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:29 This survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive, a polling firm, in May, 2006. The sample size is 
27:755:61215:16:12:90:523:143:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:2,085. Many caveats apply. Online surveys aren’t generalizable to the offline population and, depending on 
27:756:61322:12:11:90:496:131:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:the sampling methodology, might not be representative of the online population. Survey results were 
27:757:61422:11:12:90:508:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:reported without sample sizes in each cell, so tests of significance for differences between groups aren’t 
27:758:61529:12:11:90:517:108:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:possible to conduct. Finally, these results do not control for individual characteristics, and microdata from 
27:759:61639:11:12:90:490:97:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:the survey were not made public for researchers to assess whether these differences in attitudes and 
27:760:61740:12:11:90:474:85:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:behavior among respondents in hands-free states hold true when after controlling for individual

28:763:62092:36:27:126:491:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Another question raised by the results is why a hands-free law could have a 
28:764:62168:27:28:90:493:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:negative and statistically significant effect on fatality types for which mobile phone 
28:765:62255:28:27:90:489:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership does not have a statistically significant positive effect in the first place? 
28:766:62343:27:28:90:506:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Column 1 of Table 14 shows that the coefficient on months 19-24 is significant for all 
28:767:62430:28:28:90:510:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fatalities; the coefficients on months 7-12 and 37+ are significant at the 10% level. Yet 
28:768:62520:28:27:89:504:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the effect of mobile phone ownership on all fatalities, though positive, is insignificant 
28:769:62610:27:28:90:519:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:with a t-statistic well under one (column 4, Table 4). One possible explanation is that the 
28:770:62702:28:27:90:514:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effects of mobile phone ownership and hands-free laws are heterogeneous, as Hahn and 
28:771:62787:27:28:90:518:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Prieger (2006) argue. During the period that this study covers, 1997-2005, mobile phone 
28:772:62875:28:28:90:502:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership rose from 38% to 76% of the population, so the estimated effect of mobile 
28:773:62959:28:27:89:520:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:phone ownership on traffic fatalities reflects behavior of later adopters of mobile phones. 
28:774:63051:27:28:90:515:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:However, hands-free laws apply to all mobile phone users, not only later adopters. With 
28:775:63139:28:27:90:513:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:heterogeneous effects, we would not necessarily get consistent results for mobile phone 
28:776:63227:27:28:90:499:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ownership among later adopters and hands-free laws among all mobile phone users.
