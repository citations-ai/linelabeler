2:31:1563:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We examine how emerging market (EM) investors allocate their stock portfolios internationally. Using
2:32:1663:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:both country-level and institution-level data, we find that the coming wave of EM investors systematically
2:33:1769:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:over- and under-weight their holdings in some target countries. These abnormal foreign allocation
2:34:1866:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:biases of EM investors offer robust support of the information endowment hypothesis of van Nieuwerburgh
2:35:1969:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:and Veldkamp (2009). Specifically, past capital and trade flows from a foreign country to the home
2:36:2067:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:country create an information endowment (or advantage) that lead home country investments to be
2:37:2162:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:overweight that foreign country. At the institutional level, information advantage proxies based on
2:38:2261:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:relationships between EM institutional investors and the headquarters of their parent companies have
2:39:2361:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:strong explanatory power for international portfolio allocations. The results remain robust after controlling
2:40:2470:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:for other factors like geographic and other measures of economic proximity, economic and capital
2:41:2566:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:market development, market integration, market returns and correlation, and corporate governance.
2:42:2663:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:The information advantage effect is stronger for EM investors for which external portfolios exhibit
2:43:2762:14:42:72:230:420:12:Times:12:Times:a higher degree of concentration.

3:66:3200:0:28:108:188:706:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
3:67:3216:28:27:108:542:678:144:Times:144:Times:Emerging market economies are playing an increasingly prominent role in global finance, 
3:68:3304:27:28:72:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:with outflows   of financial capital from these economies rapidly gathering momentum. From 2000 
3:69:3400:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:to 2014, foreign exchange reserves of these economies increased by $7.5 trillion, with about half 
3:70:3498:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:of this buildup accounted for by China. These economies are now increasingly liberalizing private 
3:71:3596:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:outflows rather than accumulating more low-yielding assets on central bank balance sheets. Rising 
3:72:3694:28:27:72:544:540:144:Times:144:Times:domestic  incomes  have  increased  their  private  sector  demand  for  foreign  investments,  both  for  
3:73:3801:27:28:72:546:513:144:Times:144:Times:diversification purposes and for the acquisition of higher- quality assets. Institutional investors such 
3:74:3906:28:28:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:as  mutual  funds,  pension  funds,  and  insurance  companies  are  investment  vehicles  creating  ever 
3:75:4012:28:27:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:more avenues for portfolio diversification through outward investments. These factors, along with 
3:76:4110:27:28:71:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:continued capital account liberalization and domestic financial market development, are likely to 
3:77:4208:28:27:71:440:402:144:Times:144:Times:lead to further increases in private capital outflows from emerging markets.  
3:78:4285:27:28:107:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:The  portfolio  outflows  from  emerging  markets  are  still  relatively  small,  but  growing  
3:79:4382:28:28:71:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:rapidly. According to IMF data on external assets and liabilities, emerging markets’ share of global 
3:80:4483:28:27:71:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:external portfolio equity assets rose from 5 percent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2011. Official data on 
3:81:4584:27:28:71:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:international  investment  positions  show  that  emerging  markets’  external  portfolio  equity  assets  
3:82:4691:28:27:71:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:rose from $52 billion in 2000 to $347 billion in 2013. Inflows from emerging markets are playing 
3:83:4788:27:28:71:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:an  increasingly  important  role  in  external  portfolio  liabilities  of  even major  developed  market  
3:84:4896:28:28:71:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:economies. Indeed,  the  share  of  foreign  holdings  of  U.S.  equities  accounted  for  by  emerging  
3:85:5001:28:49:71:397:181:144:Times:144:Times:market investors rose from 2 percent in 2002 to 8 percent in 2013.1

3:87:5126:8:14:72:543:124:36:Times:81:Times:1 The  updated  Lane  and  Milesi-Ferretti  (2008)  database,  referred  to  as  “External  Wealth  of  Nations”  Dataset,  1970-2011,  is  
3:88:5266:14:10:71:542:110:81:Times:81:Times:available on the IMF website and that of Professor Philip R. Lane (http://www.philiplane.org/EWN.html). Data on international 
3:89:5392:10:11:72:542:100:81:Times:81:Times:investment  positions  are  from  the  IMF’s  International  Financial  Statistics.  The  source  for  U.S.  Treasury  data  is  the  Treasury 
3:90:5534:11:0:72:475:89:81:Times:81:Times:International Capital System (http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/index.aspx).  
4:91:5648:0:28:108:546:706:144:Times:144:Times:Our goal in this paper is to characterize comprehensively -  to the best of our knowledge for 
4:92:5742:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:the first time -   the global allocation of foreign portfolio equity assets of emerging market investors. 
4:93:5848:27:28:72:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:Part of our analysis is based on bilateral investment positions between countries, obtained from 
4:94:5945:28:28:72:546:623:144:Times:144:Times:the IMF’s  Coordinated  Portfolio  Investment  Survey  (CPIS).  But,  to  provide  an  alternative  
4:95:6045:28:27:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:perspective,  we  also use FactSet  Ownership  (formerly  referred  to  as  “Lionshares”),  a  database  
4:96:6150:27:28:72:545:568:144:Times:144:Times:covering  thousands  of  institutional  investors’  holdings  in  different  countries. By  using  two  
4:97:6254:28:27:72:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:different datasets, we are also able to extend previous authors’ analysis of the portfolio allocations 
4:98:6357:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:of developed markets, which has largely been based on the CPIS. In addition, our use of the latest 
4:99:6456:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:waves of data from both sources allows us to examine the effects of the global financial crisis on 
4:100:6555:28:27:72:503:457:144:Times:144:Times:the portfolio allocations of investors in both developed and emerging market economies.  
4:101:6644:27:28:108:546:430:144:Times:144:Times:We  study  the  behavior  of  institutional  investors  in  detail  given  their  importance  in  
4:102:6742:28:27:72:546:402:144:Times:144:Times:intermediating  portfolio  flows.  Prior  research  on  cross-border  equity  investment  patterns  of  
4:103:6846:27:28:72:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:institutional  investors  has  almost  entirely  focused  on  investments  among  developed  markets  or  
4:104:6952:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:from developed to emerging market economies. For instance, in an earlier study that we build on, 
4:105:7049:28:27:72:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:Chan, Covrig, and Ng (2005) examine the extent of foreign bias in mutual fund equity allocations 
4:106:7146:27:28:72:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:of 26 source countries that include only a couple of emerging markets. In another related paper, 
4:107:7243:28:27:72:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:Ferreira  and  Matos  (2008)  examine  which  firms  attract  institutional  investors  from  around  the  
4:108:7350:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:world using a dataset that has mostly developed and 3 emerging market source countries. We use 
4:109:7445:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:the existing body of research as a point of departure but emphasize the novelty of our analysis as 
4:110:7544:28:39:72:430:181:144:Times:144:Times:one of the first attempts to examine investments from emerging markets.2  
4:111:7618:39:8:72:217:142:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
4:112:7676:8:14:72:542:134:36:Times:81:Times:2 Other theoretical and empirical studies on the determinants of foreign investments are mostly based on data for developed market 
4:113:7807:14:10:71:543:120:81:Times:81:Times:economies.  Insider  holding  and  corporate  governance  have  been  found  to  limit  investments  by  foreign  investors  (Dahlquist,  
4:114:7945:10:10:71:542:110:81:Times:81:Times:Pinkowitz,  Stulz,  and  Williamson,  2003).  Information  asymmetry  leads  to  lower  foreign  investment  (Brennan  and  Cao,  1996).  
4:115:8083:10:11:71:543:100:81:Times:81:Times:Investors’  behavioral  biases  make  them  view  foreign  assets  mainly  as  vehicles  for  placing  risky  bets,  often  resulting  in  poor  
4:116:8228:11:0:71:542:89:81:Times:81:Times:portfolio  performance  (Bailey,  Kumar,  and  Ng,  2008).  Investors  avoid  investing  in  countries  with  less  liquid  financial  markets 
5:117:8373:0:28:108:545:706:144:Times:144:Times:A basic theoretical benchmark is that investors in all countries, including emerging markets, 
5:118:8467:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:should hold the same market capitalization-weighted basket of major stock market indexes—the 
5:119:8560:27:28:71:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:world  portfolio.  But  a  large  body  of  research  in  international  finance  has  documented  that  this  
5:120:8671:28:28:71:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark is violated in two dimensions. First, home bias is a pervasive phenomenon.3 Second, a 
5:121:8767:28:27:72:547:595:144:Times:144:Times:substantial  fraction  of  the  aggregate  outward  portfolio  investment  reveals  systematic  over-   and 
5:122:8875:27:28:71:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:under-weightings across countries – the so-called “foreign allocation bias” or “foreign bias” - that 
5:123:8976:28:27:71:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:tend to be driven by factors such as geographic proximity, linguistic similarity, cultural ties, and 
5:124:9077:27:28:71:358:513:144:Times:144:Times:other factors that reflect a “familiarity” (or regional) bias.4  
5:125:9142:28:28:108:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  foreign  bias  as  our  objective  is  to  study  foreign  portfolio  
5:126:9250:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:investment patterns  among  emerging  market  investors.  We  specifically  define  the  foreign 
5:127:9347:27:28:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:allocation bias as the extent to which international portfolio allocations across destination countries 
5:128:9451:28:27:72:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:deviate from their respective market-capitalization weights   in the world market portfolio. We find 
5:129:9552:27:28:72:542:375:144:Times:144:Times:emerging market investors’ portfolio allocations on average exhibit significantly greater overall 
5:130:9650:28:28:71:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:foreign allocation biases in absolute magnitudes and higher country concentrations than those of 
5:131:9747:28:27:72:546:319:144:Times:144:Times:developed  market  economies.  To guide  our  empirical  analysis,  we  turn  to  the  concept  of  
5:132:9847:27:28:72:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:information immobility proposed by van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009). Rather than relying 
5:133:9940:28:27:72:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:on information asymmetries, which should in principle decline over time, their theoretical model 
5:134:10037:27:28:72:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:recognizes that investors face a choice in deciding which assets to acquire information about when 
5:135:10136:28:46:71:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:there  are  multiple  risky  assets  in  the  investment  opportunity  set.  For  instance,  investors  have  a

5:137:10306:12:10:72:541:151:81:Times:81:Times:(Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk, 2012). Bartram, Griffin, Lim, and Ng (2013) document the effects of institutional investor ownership 
5:138:10436:10:7:72:244:141:81:Times:81:Times:on correlations of asset prices across the world. 
5:139:10485:7:14:72:542:134:36:Times:81:Times:3 See for example, French and Poterba (1991), Bohn and Tesar (1996), Baxter and Jermann (1997), Coval and Moskowitz (1999), 
5:140:10609:14:7:71:447:120:81:Times:81:Times:and Ahearne, Griever, and Warnock (2004). For a survey of the home bias literature, see Lewis (1999).  
5:141:10711:7:13:72:543:113:36:Times:81:Times:4 See,  among  many  others, Portes  and  Rey  (2005).  Karolyi  and  Stulz  (2003)  position  the  literature  on  the  home  bias  relative  to  
5:142:10858:13:11:72:542:100:81:Times:81:Times:theories on international portfolio choice. Cooper, Sercu, and Vanpeé (2013) furnish a useful up-to-date survey of the home and 
5:143:10986:11:0:72:153:89:81:Times:81:Times:foreign bias literature. 
6:144:11012:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:comparative advantage in learning about their domestic assets. Even as information about foreign 
6:145:11109:28:27:72:542:678:144:Times:144:Times:markets becomes easier to obtain, the initial information endowment leads investors to exert more 
6:146:11207:27:28:72:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:effort in  acquiring  additional  information  about  domestic  assets,  magnifying  their  comparative  
6:147:11312:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:advantage. Similarly, investors would prefer to invest in foreign countries where they had initial 
6:148:11411:28:27:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:information  endowment. This  provides  a  rationalization  for  the  persistence  of  home  bias  and  a  
6:149:11518:27:28:72:477:568:144:Times:144:Times:further prediction about where foreign allocation biases are likely to be most acute.  
6:150:11605:28:27:108:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:We propose empirical proxies on a country level and on an institutional investor level to 
6:151:11695:27:28:72:544:513:144:Times:144:Times:detect possible emerging market investors’ information endowments   for a particular destination 
6:152:11792:28:28:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:country for their outward investments. On a country level, the proxies are historical foreign direct 
6:153:11893:28:27:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:investment (FDI) and trade flows between the home and destination country for outward portfolio 
6:154:11989:27:28:71:545:430:144:Times:144:Times:investments.5 Such historical FDI  and  trade  flows  typically result  in  business  contacts  and  
6:155:12090:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:investment  relationships   that  could  serve  as  a  source  of  the initial  information  endowment. We 
6:156:12197:27:28:72:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:focus on trade as the main source of information endowments, as they have become dominant in 
6:157:12290:28:28:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:gross  inflows  into  emerging  markets  and  are  more  likely  to  have  information  content  for  those  
6:158:12399:28:27:72:326:319:144:Times:144:Times:countries’ institutional investors than debt inflows.6  
6:159:12455:27:28:107:545:292:144:Times:144:Times:On  an  institutional  investor level,  we  propose new empirical  proxies  for  information  
6:160:12549:28:27:71:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:endowments by exploiting the granularity of the FactSet LionShares data. Many emerging market 
6:161:12643:27:28:71:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:institutions are foreign subsidiaries of parent institutions headquartered abroad. Through corporate 
6:162:12744:28:77:71:547:209:144:Times:144:Times:relationships   between   parent   and   subsidiary   institutions,   these subsidiaries may build   up   
6:163:12850:77:9:72:217:132:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
6:164:12908:9:13:72:542:123:36:Times:81:Times:5 FDI as an information endowment proxy was used by Andrade and Chhaochharia (2010), drawing upon the theoretical work of 
6:165:13030:13:10:71:539:110:81:Times:81:Times:Razin, Sadka and Yuen (1998, 1999) and Goldstein and Razin (2006). As a motivation for the second proxy, Lane and Milesi-
6:166:13151:10:8:71:544:100:81:Times:81:Times:Ferretti (2008) find that bilateral trade in goods and services is an important determinant of cross-border portfolio equity holdings.  
6:167:13287:8:0:72:149:92:36:Times:81:Times:6 See Prasad (2012).  
7:168:13310:0:28:72:547:706:144:Times:144:Times:information endowments  on their parent institutions’ home country and on “Peer”   countries where 
7:169:13409:28:27:72:374:678:144:Times:144:Times:their parent institutions have set up other foreign subsidiaries.  
7:170:13476:27:28:108:546:651:144:Times:144:Times:We  find  strong and  robust  evidence  to  support  our  formulation  of  the  information  
7:171:13569:28:28:71:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:endowment hypothesis. More importantly, information endowments show themselves to play  an 
7:172:13660:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:even bigger role in explaining the investment patterns of emerging market allocations relative to 
7:173:13758:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:those  of  developed  markets  and  to  institutional  investors  domiciled  in  developed  markets.  The 
7:174:13864:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:results remain strong when we put the hypothesis to an even more rigorous test by examining the 
7:175:13960:27:28:72:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:investment patterns of specific institutional investors using information endowment proxies based 
7:176:14058:28:28:72:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:on the location of the parent company of emerging market institutional investors that are foreign 
7:177:14156:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:subsidiaries (for non-indigenous institutions) and the location of other foreign subsidiaries of the 
7:178:14257:27:28:72:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:parent  company.  Both  of  these  proxies  turn  out  to  be  important  determinants  of  the  allocation  
7:179:14366:28:27:72:320:402:144:Times:144:Times:patterns of emerging market institutional investors. 
7:180:14418:27:28:108:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:We  also  find  that  the  information  endowment  proxies  are  more  important  in  explaining  
7:181:14516:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:emerging market portfolio allocations when those portfolios are more concentrated. This finding 
7:182:14612:28:27:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:is  consistent  with  van Nieuwerburgh  and  Veldkamp’s  (2009,  2010)  concept  of  information  
7:183:14710:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:advantage, where investors who can first collect information systematically deviates from holding 
7:184:14808:28:27:72:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:a  diversified  portfolio.  These  findings  are  consistent  with those  of  Choi  et  al.  (2014),  who find 
7:185:14919:27:28:72:546:237:144:Times:144:Times:that—as  suggested  by  the  information  advantage  model—institutional  investors  with  higher  
7:186:15018:28:28:72:547:209:144:Times:144:Times:industry  and  country  concentration  in  their  investment  allocations  exhibit  better  portfolio  
7:187:15121:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:performance. Finally, we examine an ancillary implication of van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp’s 
7:188:15214:27:28:72:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:(2009)  model  that  the  information  endowment  effect  is  more  important  when  the  investment  
7:189:15316:28:27:72:544:126:144:Times:144:Times:destination  country  is  larger.  In  principle,  the  channels  for  securing  an  information  advantage  
7:190:15425:27:0:72:544:99:144:Times:144:Times:should become  more  important  in  affecting  portfolio  allocations  when  the  incentive  to  use  this  
8:191:15535:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:information, as measured by the size of the destination market, is larger. However, we do not find 
8:192:15634:28:27:72:247:678:144:Times:144:Times:evidence to support this hypothesis. 
8:193:15671:27:28:108:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:Our paper is most closely related to the work of Andrade and Chhaochharia (2010), Chan, 
8:194:15759:28:28:72:546:623:144:Times:144:Times:Covrig,  and  Ng  (2005),  and  others  cited  above,  but  it  contributes  to  the  larger  debate  in  
8:195:15865:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:international finance on what are the determinants of foreign portfolio choice. The work of Kang 
8:196:15962:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:and Stulz (1997), Ahearne et al. (2004), Gelos and Wei (2005) associate the home and/or foreign 
8:197:16058:28:27:72:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:biases revealed in foreign portfolio allocations to firm and country characteristics in the destination 
8:198:16162:27:28:72:544:513:144:Times:144:Times:market.  Grinblatt  and  Keloharju  (2001),  Hau  (2001),  Choe  et  al.  (2005),  Dvorak  (2005),  Massa  
8:199:16269:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:and Simonov (2006), and Ke et al. (2012) emphasize the role of common firm/country attributes 
8:200:16363:28:27:72:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:of the source countries of the investors and of the destination countries for their investments toward 
8:201:16466:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:understanding  familiarity-driven  or  informational  asymmetry  factors,  in  general  (and  thus  not 
8:202:16570:28:27:72:547:402:144:Times:144:Times:necessarily  in  the  context  of  information  endowments  or  information  immobility  of  van  
8:203:16668:27:28:72:252:375:144:Times:144:Times:Niewerburgh and Veldkamp, 2009).  
8:204:16702:28:28:108:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:We must acknowledge two recent, contemporaneous papers that draw on the theory of van 
8:205:16788:28:27:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:Niewerburgh  and  Veldkamp  (2009).  Schumacher  (2015)  uncovers  how  mutual  funds  in  their  
8:206:16886:27:28:72:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:foreign  investment  choices  overweight  industries  that  are  comparatively  large  in  their  domestic  
8:207:16994:28:27:72:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:markets,  with  which  they  are  well  familiar,  and  reveals  superior  investment  performance  that  
8:208:17100:27:28:72:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:arises. He, like us and like Choi et al. (2014), motivates this industry-based connection as a source 
8:209:17202:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:of information advantage in the spirit of van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009). Bekaert et al. 
8:210:17297:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:(2015) study international equity allocations of 3.8 million individuals in 401(k) plans in the U.S. 
8:211:17398:27:28:72:542:154:144:Times:144:Times:showing enormous cross-individual variation, strong cohort effects by age and geographic location 
8:212:17496:28:0:72:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:within the U.S. and the critical influence of financial advisors. The authors associate the individual 
9:213:17601:0:28:72:544:706:144:Times:144:Times:investor’s heterogeneity in preferences or background to familiarity and information asymmetry

9:215:17707:27:28:108:547:651:144:Times:144:Times:We  next  outline  our  data  and  methodology  in  Section  2.  Section  3  measures  the  
9:216:17799:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:pervasiveness of the foreign allocation bias across emerging and developed countries and Section 
9:217:17896:28:27:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:4  evaluates  the  primary  determinants  of  that  bias.  We  turn  our  attention  to  specific  tests  of  the  
9:218:18011:27:28:72:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:information  endowment  hypothesis  in  Section  5.  A  battery  of  robustness  tests  are  discussed  in  
9:219:18119:28:27:72:267:540:144:Times:144:Times:Section 6 before we conclude the paper.

9:221:18159:28:28:108:243:485:144:Times:144:Times:2. Data and Methodology  
9:222:18184:28:27:108:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:In this section, we provide an overview of the main data sources employed in our analysis, 
9:223:18275:27:28:72:491:430:144:Times:144:Times:which covers the period 2001-2011. We then outline the basic empirical methodology. 
9:224:18359:28:27:108:156:402:144:Times:144:Times:2.1 Data  
9:225:18369:27:28:108:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:We use two sources to construct data on country-level external portfolio investment stocks. 
9:226:18461:28:28:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:The first is the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), which provides data on 
9:227:18555:28:27:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate  bilateral  portfolio  equity  holdings  for  most  major  developed  and  emerging  market  
9:228:18658:27:28:72:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:economies.  This  dataset  has  been  employed  in  previous  studies,  mostly  for  analyzing  portfolio  
9:229:18765:28:27:72:252:264:144:Times:144:Times:allocations of developed economies.  
9:230:18802:27:28:108:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:The  second  and relatively more  novel  source that  we  use  is FactSet  Lionshares,  which 
9:231:18896:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:covers  tens  of  thousands  of  security-level  domestic  and  international  holdings  of  institutional 
9:232:19003:28:27:72:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:investors (mostly mutual funds and investment companies) around the world. LionShares contains 
9:233:19098:27:33:72:551:154:144:Times:144:Times:two main databases: aggregate institutional filings (similar to 13f in the U.S.),   and a    mutual fund 
9:234:19203:33:8:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
9:235:19261:8:13:72:543:113:36:Times:81:Times:7 Bekaert et al. (2015) further associate the intriguing finding in their study of the magnitude of foreign biases among individual 
9:236:19393:13:11:71:541:100:81:Times:81:Times:investors across the U.S. based on their working for international versus domestic firms to the same phenomenon in Brown, et al. 
9:237:19522:11:0:71:312:89:81:Times:81:Times:(2015) of an in-state equity bias for state pension plans in the U.S. 
10:238:19593:0:28:72:544:706:144:Times:144:Times:holdings database  (similar  to  N-CSR  mutual  fund  filings  in  the  U.S.).8 LionShares  provides  the  
10:239:19700:28:27:72:544:678:144:Times:144:Times:number of shares held by a fund or institution, as well as the total number of shares outstanding 
10:240:19798:27:28:72:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:for  each  stock  at  a  point  in  time.  In  order  to  maximize  data  coverage,  we use  the  institutional  
10:241:19911:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:database as our primary source but incorporate additional ownership data from the fund database 
10:242:20007:28:27:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:if  the  parent  institution’s  holdings  are  not  in  the  institutional  ownership  database.  We  carry  the  
10:243:20121:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:holdings  information  forward  to  the  next  available  report  date  for  up  to  three  quarters.  We 
10:244:20227:28:27:71:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:complement  this  with Datastream,  a  source  that  provides source  and  destination  country  index 
10:245:20330:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:returns. We also incorporate demographic, economic, and governance data from IMF and various 
10:246:20423:28:28:72:194:485:144:Times:144:Times:alternative data sources.  
10:247:20450:28:27:108:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:Both investment holdings datasets have their strengths and weaknesses. The CPIS is based 
10:248:20539:27:28:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:on reporting by country authorities and does not contain data for a few important countries such 
10:249:20636:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:as China as a source country. However, China does appear in the dataset as a destination country 
10:250:20733:27:28:72:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:since  other  countries  that  report  to  the  CPIS  include  it  in  their  own  portfolio  asset  allocations. 
10:251:20847:28:28:72:547:347:144:Times:144:Times:LionShares  provides  broader  country  coverage,  including  China,  although  the  coverage  of  
10:252:20946:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:institutions in some emerging markets is limited, especially in the early period of the sample. By 
10:253:21045:27:28:72:545:292:144:Times:144:Times:analyzing  both  sets  of  data,  which  no  other  authors  have  done,  we  aim  to  provide  a  more  
10:254:21150:28:27:72:545:264:144:Times:144:Times:comprehensive  and  reliable  picture  of  patterns  of  international  equity  allocations  of  emerging  
10:255:21257:27:28:72:119:237:144:Times:144:Times:markets.  
10:256:21266:28:28:108:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:We  start  with  a  sample  of  53  source  countries from  CPIS,  classified  into  26  developed 
10:257:21365:28:39:72:544:181:144:Times:144:Times:markets  and  27 emerging  markets  based  on  the  Morgan  Stanley  Capital  International  (MSCI)  
10:258:21466:39:8:72:217:142:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
10:259:21524:8:14:72:542:134:36:Times:81:Times:8 We follow the procedures outlined in Ferreira and Matos (2008) and Bartram, Griffin, Lim, and Ng (2015) for cleaning this dataset 
10:260:21656:14:10:71:541:120:81:Times:81:Times:and augment that with other standard checks for 13f filings. Thus, we obtain the historical FactSet LionShares database that is free 
10:261:21789:10:10:71:543:110:81:Times:81:Times:from  survivorship  bias.  FactSet  Ownership data  is  compiled  from  publicly  available  information:  filings  obtained  in  various  
10:262:21928:10:11:71:542:100:81:Times:81:Times:countries supplemented by companies’ annual reports. Wei (2010) analyzes the integrity of the data and finds that the U.S. and 
10:263:22055:11:0:71:311:89:81:Times:81:Times:U.K. account for slightly over 70 percent of non-domestic capital. 
11:264:22123:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:Index Market Classification framework as of 2011. Nine other emerging market countries appear 
11:265:22217:28:27:72:542:678:144:Times:144:Times:only  as  destination  countries.  Appendix  A  contains  the list  of  countries in  CPIS  and  their 
11:266:22320:27:28:71:374:651:144:Times:144:Times:categorization into developed or emerging market economies.  
11:267:22381:28:28:107:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:Panel A of Appendix B shows the availability of CPIS data on source country-destination 
11:268:22469:28:27:71:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:country  pairs,  where  the  source  countries  are  limited  to  the  group  of  emerging  markets.  We 
11:269:22574:27:28:71:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:dropped  countries  that  had  no  data  or  had missing  data  in  certain  years.  The  total  number  of  
11:270:22683:28:27:71:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:country-pair-year observations after applying these screens is 9,717, resulting in an average of 883 
11:271:22784:27:28:71:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:observations  per  year  (a  source-country destination-country pair  with  data  available  for  a  given  
11:272:22892:28:28:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:year  counts  as  one  observation).  About  two-third  of  the  observations  (6,335)  indicate  positive 
11:273:22999:28:27:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:holdings.  The  CPIS  distinguishes  between  zeroes  and  missing  observations,  so  the  remainder 
11:274:23100:27:28:71:323:430:144:Times:144:Times:(3,382 observations) constitutes true zero holdings.  
11:275:23154:28:27:107:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:Panel  B  of  Appendix B shows  the  extent  of  institutional  coverage  provided  by  FactSet 
11:276:23250:27:28:71:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:LionShares. Over the period 2001-2011, the average number (per year) of institutional investors 
11:277:23346:28:28:71:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:based in developed markets is 2,833 while the corresponding number for emerging markets is 73. 
11:278:23441:28:27:71:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:The  coverage  of  institutional  investors  in  both  sets  of  countries  increases  over  time,  with  3,330 
11:279:23553:27:28:71:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:institutions in developed markets and 151 in emerging markets in 2011. The bottom rows of this 
11:280:23648:28:27:71:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:panel  show  the  number  of  institution-destination  country  observations  by  year  for  institutions  
11:281:23755:27:28:71:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:based  in  emerging  markets.  The  total  number  over  the  full  sample  is  9,970 observations  (an 
11:282:23859:28:28:71:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:average  of  906 per  year).  If  we  assume  that  the  non-reported  institution-destination  country  
11:283:23964:28:27:71:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:observations in fact represent zero investments rather than missing observations, we add 34,510 
11:284:24060:27:28:71:542:154:144:Times:144:Times:observations (average of 3,147 per year) to yield a total of 44,480 observations (average of 4,044 
11:285:24159:28:27:71:543:126:144:Times:144:Times:per year). While it is plausible that missing observations are in fact zeroes, in the empirical work 
11:286:24260:27:0:71:385:99:144:Times:144:Times:we will examine the sensitivity of the results to this assumption.  
12:287:24331:0:28:108:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:We collected data on bilateral FDI, one of our key information endowment proxies, from 
12:288:24418:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:the website of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Among the 
12:289:24508:27:28:72:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:62 countries in our main sample, only 22 have profiles in the UNCTAD database. However, each 
12:290:24601:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:of these 22 country profiles often contains data on inward FDI from a source country of interest 
12:291:24698:28:27:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:that is not profiled. Analogously, each profile may contain data on outward FDI to a destination 
12:292:24795:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:country of interest that is not profiled. This allows us to obtain inward and outward FDI data for a 
12:293:24896:28:27:72:239:540:144:Times:144:Times:large fraction of our country list.9  
12:294:24934:27:28:108:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:Bilateral export and import data are available from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics 
12:295:25026:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:(DOTS).     We     use     the     version     of     these     data provided     by     Andrew     Rose     at 
12:296:25136:28:27:72:550:457:144:Times:144:Times:http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/   (Rose and   Spiegel,   2011). Data   for   the   country   
12:297:25237:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics  used  in  our  study  are  taken  from  Rose  (2005)  and  Karolyi  (2015). Appendix  C 
12:298:25342:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:contains a detailed description of all variables used in our empirical analysis, along with a fuller 
12:299:25443:27:28:72:209:375:144:Times:144:Times:description of data sources.  
12:300:25473:28:28:108:195:347:144:Times:144:Times:2.2 Methodology  
12:301:25490:28:27:108:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:We  begin  with  a  simple  cross-country  regression  framework  to  examine  international  
12:302:25584:27:29:71:334:292:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocations. The basic regression equation is: 
12:303:25641:29:30:230:420:263:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:퐼퐼푖푖,푗푗,푡푡=훼훼+훾훾1퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡1+⋯+훾훾푛푛퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡푛푛+휀휀푖푖,푗푗,푡푡. 
12:304:25695:30:29:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:The  independent  variables,  denoted  by 퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡,  represent  destination  country  characteristics.  The 
12:305:25801:29:83:71:542:204:144:Times:144:Times:dependent variable 퐼퐼푖푖,푗푗,푡푡 is defined as the “excess investment” by investors in source country i in 
12:306:25904:83:8:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
12:307:25962:8:13:72:542:113:36:Times:81:Times:9 The data are in FDI Country Profiles on the UNCTAD website. For each country profile, we collected both inward and outward 
12:308:26087:13:11:71:541:100:81:Times:81:Times:FDI data. When a country pair appears twice, once as inward and once as outward investment flows, we take whichever number is 
12:309:26213:11:0:71:99:89:81:Times:81:Times:larger.  
13:310:26224:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:destination  country j at  time  t. This  is  given  by  the  share  of  country  i’s  total  external portfolio 
13:311:26337:28:27:72:546:678:144:Times:144:Times:allocation accounted for by country j, with this share then expressed relative to a benchmark ratio.  
13:312:26439:27:28:108:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:The baseline benchmark ratio is a traditional measure used in the literature on international 
13:313:26533:28:28:72:551:623:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio  allocation: world market portfolio,  which  equals  the  s  tock  market  capitalization  of  
13:314:26638:28:27:71:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:destination country j scaled by world stock market capitalization (where “world” excludes country 
13:315:26736:27:28:71:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:i).  This benchmark is based on the concept that investors in every country should in theory hold 
13:316:26834:28:27:71:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:the  market  capitalization-weighted  world  portfolio.  Excess  investment  in  a  particular  country  is  
13:317:26943:27:28:71:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:then  a  measure  of  how  much  investors  in  a  given  home  country  overweight  or  underweight 
13:318:27043:28:28:72:431:485:144:Times:144:Times:investments in a particular destination country relative to that benchmark.  
13:319:27120:28:27:108:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:In our empirical work, we use a large set of control variables drawing on various strands 
13:320:27210:27:28:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:of the literature,  including the so-called “gravity approach” to modeling trade and financial flows. 
13:321:27312:28:27:72:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:The controls can be divided into the following categories: (1) Gravity variables, such as distance, 
13:322:27411:27:28:72:542:375:144:Times:144:Times:common  border,  common  colonial  heritage,  colonial  relationship,  and  common  language;  (2) 
13:323:27510:28:28:72:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:Market depth and size, including per capita GDP, the number of firms in the destination country, 
13:324:27607:28:27:72:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:the ratio of market capitalization to GDP, market turnover, and transaction fees in the destination 
13:325:27707:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:countries;  (3) Returns-based  measures,  such  as  the  differences  in  stock  market  returns  between  
13:326:27814:28:27:72:545:264:144:Times:144:Times:destination  and  source  countries in  the  past  year,  differences  in  stock  market  returns  between  
13:327:27922:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:destination and source countries over the past five years, the variance ratio of destination country 
13:328:28023:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:returns over the past five years divided by the variance of source country returns over the past five 
13:329:28125:28:27:72:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:years, and return correlations between the source and destination countries over the past five years; 
13:330:28227:27:28:72:545:154:144:Times:144:Times:(4) Market  integration  variables,  which  include  registration  restrictions  on  foreign  investors,  
13:331:28333:28:0:72:544:126:144:Times:144:Times:ownership  restrictions  on  foreign  investors,  and currency  convertibility  limits  in  the  destination  
14:332:28446:0:28:72:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:countries; and, (5) Governance indicators, including government effectiveness, regulatory burden, 
14:333:28544:28:27:72:283:678:144:Times:144:Times:and rule of law in the destination countries. 
14:334:28590:27:28:108:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:All  of  the  regressions  include  three  sets  of  fixed  effects—for  year,  source  country,  and  
14:335:28693:28:28:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:destination  country.  We  also  allow  for  heteroscedasticity-consistent  and  robust  standard  errors  
14:336:28800:28:27:72:385:595:144:Times:144:Times:with double clustering at the destination country and year levels. 
14:337:28867:27:28:108:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:Our  empirical  evaluation  of  the  information  endowment  hypothesis  involves  examining 
14:338:28960:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:how past inflows of FDI into an emerging market (indexed by i) from a particular foreign country 
14:339:29057:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:(indexed  by  j)  affect  portfolio  investment  from  that  emerging  market  into  that  specific  foreign 
14:340:29165:28:28:72:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:country. Alternatively,  the  information  endowment  could  be  created  by  a  historical  trading 
14:341:29266:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:relationship, proxied by the share of the relevant emerging market’s past trade accounted for by a 
14:342:29365:27:28:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:particular  foreign  country. More  specifically,  we  ask  if  bilateral  FDI  inflows  (from  country j to 
14:343:29474:28:27:72:540:402:144:Times:144:Times:country i)  or  bilateral  trade  (between  country  j and  country  i)  during a  reference  period  (1991-
14:344:29582:27:28:71:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:2000)  affect  portfolio  investment in  the  reverse  direction  (from  country  i  to  country  j) during  a  
14:345:29694:28:29:72:424:347:144:Times:144:Times:subsequent period (2000-2012).  The regression equation then becomes:  
14:346:29765:29:30:192:458:318:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:퐼퐼푖푖,푗푗,푡푡=훼훼+훽훽1퐼퐼퐸퐸푖푖,푗푗,91− 00+훾훾1퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡1+⋯+훾훾푛푛퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡푛푛+휀휀푖푖,푗푗,푡푡, 
14:347:29839:30:29:72:542:288:144:Times:144:Times:where 퐼퐼퐸퐸푖푖,푗푗,91− 00 denotes 푇푇푇푇푇푇푇푇푇푇푖푖,푗푗,91− 00 or 퐹퐹퐹퐹퐼퐼푖푖,푗푗,91− 00. Our use of lagged FDI inflows and trade 
14:348:29956:29:27:72:544:259:144:Times:144:Times:shares  as  information  endowment  proxies  partly obviates potential concerns  about  endogeneity.  
14:349:30058:27:28:72:543:232:144:Times:144:Times:The choice of a reference period of the 1990s is an arbitrary one based on data availability, but it 
14:350:30159:28:27:72:443:204:144:Times:144:Times:predates the period of evaluation of the foreign portfolio allocations (2000s). 
14:351:30239:27:28:108:543:177:144:Times:144:Times:Other than the aggregate-level analysis, we are also interested in examining the portfolio 
14:352:30330:28:28:72:543:149:144:Times:144:Times:allocation patterns of individual institutional investors using a similar empirical framework. The 
14:353:30429:28:28:72:273:121:144:Times:144:Times:regression then takes the following form: 
14:354:30471:28:0:192:458:93:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:퐼퐼푖푖,푗푗,푡푡=훼훼+훽훽1퐼퐼퐸퐸푖푖,푗푗,91− 00+훾훾1퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡1+⋯+훾훾푛푛퐶퐶푗푗,푡푡푛푛+휀휀푖푖,푗푗,푡푡, 
15:355:30548:0:28:72:545:706:144:Times:144:Times:where  the  dependent  variable now  represents  portfolio  investments  from  an  emerging  market  
15:356:30649:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:institution i into destination country j at time t. It is defined as follows: excess investment equals 
15:357:30751:27:28:72:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:the portfolio investment from emerging market institution i into destination country j divided by 
15:358:30848:28:28:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:the portfolio investment from emerging market institution i to all countries, minus the benchmark 
15:359:30945:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:ratio. The dependent  variable  thus  measures  whether  a  particular  emerging  market  institution’s 
15:360:31049:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:external portfolio equity investments are disproportionately weighted towards a specific foreign 
15:361:31146:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:country. The baseline benchmark remains the same as for the regressions using the aggregate data: 
15:362:31243:27:28:72:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:world market portfolio now equals the stock market capitalization of destination country j scaled 
15:363:31341:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:by world stock market capitalization, where “world” excludes the country in which institution i is 
15:364:31439:28:27:72:547:457:144:Times:144:Times:domiciled.   The   dependent   variable   captures   how   allocation   patterns   of   emerging   market   
15:365:31547:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:institutional  investors  deviate  from  the  market  capitalization-weighted  world  portfolio.  The 
15:366:31648:28:28:72:417:402:144:Times:144:Times:dependent variable is constructed using data for the period 2001-2011.

15:368:31720:27:28:108:339:347:144:Times:144:Times:3. How Pervasive is Foreign Allocation Bias? 
15:369:31764:28:27:108:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:We begin with a descriptive overview of patterns of external portfolio (equity) investment 
15:370:31855:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:from emerging market economies and compare them with the corresponding investment patterns 
15:371:31946:28:27:72:545:264:144:Times:144:Times:of developed  market  economies.10 We  define  foreign  allocation  bias  as  the  extent  to  which  
15:372:32048:27:54:71:545:237:144:Times:144:Times:countries  deviate  from  the  world market portfolio  in  their  foreign allocations. That  is,  once

15:374:32210:8:13:72:541:175:36:Times:81:Times:10 This  part  of  the  paper  is  related  to  the  broader  literature  on  emerging  market  countries’  capital  market  liberalizations.  Some 
15:375:32358:13:11:71:543:162:81:Times:81:Times:papers  study  the  asset  pricing  effects  of  market  integration  and  segmentation  (Errunza  and  Losq,  1985)  and  the  scope  of  
15:376:32497:11:10:71:542:151:81:Times:81:Times:international pricing (Harvey, 1991; Bekaert and Harvey, 1997, 2002, 2003; and Bekaert, Harvey, Lundblad, and Siegel, 2009). 
15:377:32622:10:10:71:542:141:81:Times:81:Times:Others examine the macroeconomic consequences of relaxation of capital constraints (see Prasad and Rajan, 2008, for a survey). 
15:378:32749:10:11:71:541:131:81:Times:81:Times:Our paper is also related to the literature on mutual fund investments in emerging markets. For instance, Kaminsky, Lyons, and 
15:379:32876:11:10:71:542:120:81:Times:81:Times:Schmukler  (2004)  look  at  strategies  of  mutual  funds  in  regard  to  their  investments  in  emerging  markets,  and  the  role  they  play  
15:380:33024:10:10:71:543:110:81:Times:81:Times:during  crises.  Jotikasthira,  Lundblad,  and  Ramadorai  (2011)  show  that  domestic  mutual  funds  can  dislocate  emerging  market  
15:381:33162:10:11:71:542:100:81:Times:81:Times:returns and induce higher correlations with developed markets. Again, almost all of this prior literature is about investments into 
15:382:33294:11:0:71:142:89:81:Times:81:Times:emerging markets.  
16:383:33316:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:investors in a country have decided how much of their total portfolio will be allocated to foreign 
16:384:33415:28:27:72:545:678:144:Times:144:Times:investments,  our aim  is  to  examine  how  much  that  cross-country  allocation  deviates  from  the  
16:385:33520:27:28:72:305:651:144:Times:144:Times:market capitalization-weighted world portfolio.  
16:386:33569:28:28:108:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:We  construct  a  measure  of  foreign  allocation  bias  for  each  country  as  follows.  We  first  
16:387:33672:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:evaluate  the  deviation  between  the  share  of  a  country’s  portfolio  allocated  to  a  particular 
16:388:33777:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:destination country and that destination country’s share in the world portfolio. We then sum up the 
16:389:33877:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:absolute values of that deviation for the home country relative to all of the potential destination 
16:390:33977:27:28:72:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:countries (including those countries where the home country might not have any investment at all). 
16:391:34076:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:To account for market size, this sum is adjusted so that each destination country’s weight is given 
16:392:34176:28:27:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:by  its  relative  market  capitalization  (measured  relative  to  the  global  total  market  capitalization,  
16:393:34289:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:expressed in a common currency and excluding the source country). All of these calculations are 
16:394:34385:28:27:72:175:402:144:Times:144:Times:based on CPIS data.  
16:395:34406:27:28:108:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:Figure  1  shows  the  absolute  magnitude  of foreign  allocation  bias  for  each  of  the  source 
16:396:34507:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:countries  covered  in  our  sample.  The  extent  of  foreign  allocation  bias  is generally  higher  for 
16:397:34614:28:27:72:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:emerging markets (Panel A) relative to developed markets (Panel B). The median of this measure 
16:398:34709:27:28:72:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:of foreign allocation bias is 0.11 for emerging markets and 0.08 for developed markets.11 A value 
16:399:34807:28:27:71:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:of 0.10 implies that, on average, the country’s portfolio overweights or underweights investments 
16:400:34905:27:28:71:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:in potential destination markets by 10 percent, with the weights of each of the potential destination 
16:401:35007:28:28:71:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:markets  in  that  formula  determined  by  their  respective  market  capitalization.  Among  emerging  
16:402:35112:28:27:71:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:markets,  foreign  allocation  bias  ranges  from  0.21  for  Venezuela  to  0.02  for  Slovenia.  Among 
16:403:35217:27:43:71:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:developed markets, this measure ranges from 0.17 for Hong Kong to 0.03 for the U.S. We do not 
16:404:35311:43:8:72:217:111:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
16:405:35369:8:14:72:541:103:36:Times:81:Times:11 This refers to the cross-country median of the foreign allocation bias for all home countries in their respective groups. The median 
16:406:35505:14:0:71:528:89:81:Times:81:Times:of the unweighted foreign allocation bias was 0.04 for emerging market economies and 0.02 for developed market economies. 
17:407:35629:0:28:72:544:706:144:Times:144:Times:have  a  well-defined  metric  for  characterizing  the  extent  of  foreign  allocation bias that we  have  
17:408:35738:28:27:71:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:documented as being small or large. But it is clearly quantitatively significant and is on average 
17:409:35837:27:28:71:362:651:144:Times:144:Times:larger for emerging markets than for developed economies.  
17:410:35896:28:28:107:547:623:144:Times:144:Times:A   complementary   approach   to   that   above   is   to   compute   concentration   ratios   for   
17:411:35998:28:27:71:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:international portfolios (Choi et al., 2014, Schumacher, 2015). This provides a summary measure 
17:412:36094:27:28:71:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:of how much a country’s portfolio allocation is concentrated among destination countries relative 
17:413:36192:28:27:71:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:to the benchmark of the market capitalization-weighted world market portfolio (results not shown 
17:414:36289:27:28:71:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:here). For emerging markets, the average concentration ratio was 0.90 in 2001, compared to 0.75 
17:415:36385:28:28:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:for developed economies, a statistically significant difference. The averages for the two groups of 
17:416:36485:28:27:71:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:countries rise to 1.08 and 0.86, respectively, by 2011 and the average is significantly higher for 
17:417:36584:27:28:71:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:emerging  markets  in  every  year  of  the  sample.  This  exercise  confirms  the  earlier  result  that  
17:418:36692:28:27:71:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:emerging markets’ international portfolios reveal higher absolute foreign allocation bias than those 
17:419:36793:27:28:71:184:375:144:Times:144:Times:of developed markets.  
17:420:36816:28:28:107:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:Next,  we  examine  if  there  are  certain  destination  countries  that  are  systematically 
17:421:36911:28:27:71:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:underweight or overweight (relative to the world market portfolio benchmark described above) in 
17:422:37007:27:28:71:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:the international portfolio allocation decisions of the countries in our sample. Figure 2 shows how 
17:423:37107:28:27:71:546:264:144:Times:144:Times:much a  given  destination  country  is  overweighted  (or  underweighted)  in  the  international  
17:424:37207:27:28:71:547:237:144:Times:144:Times:portfolios  of  developed and  emerging  market  countries,  respectively.  Only  the  destination  
17:425:37307:28:28:71:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:countries among the 10 largest in overweightings and 10 largest in underweightings are displayed. 
17:426:37405:28:27:71:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:For each destination country, we calculate the excess (positive or negative) investment ratio for 
17:427:37503:27:0:71:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:each source country in each year, and then take a weighted average across source countries and 
18:428:37601:0:28:72:545:706:144:Times:144:Times:years. Each source  country  is  weighted  by  its  share  of  the  total  market  capitalization  in  its  
18:429:37709:28:27:72:263:678:144:Times:144:Times:respective group of source countries.12  
18:430:37750:27:28:107:548:651:144:Times:144:Times:Among developed   market   economies   (   Panel   A),   there   seems   to   be   a   systematic   
18:431:37850:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:overweighting of many European countries in international portfolios. This could be the result of 
18:432:37948:28:27:72:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:a regional bias among these countries, which tend to invest heavily in each other’s markets. There 
18:433:38047:27:28:71:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:is  significant  underweighting  of  China,  Japan,  and  the  U.S.,  and  also  of the  major  emerging  
18:434:38153:28:27:71:545:540:144:Times:144:Times:markets. Emerging  markets  (Panel  B)  also  underweight  China,  Japan,  and  the  U.S.  in  their  
18:435:38255:27:28:71:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:international portfolios, although the extent of this underweighting of the U.S. is less severe than 
18:436:38356:28:28:72:283:485:144:Times:144:Times:in the case of developed market portfolios.  
18:437:38401:28:27:108:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 3 shows how the allocations of emerging market and developed market investors to 
18:438:38489:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:four major destination countries—U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany—have evolved over time. In 
18:439:38580:28:27:72:545:402:144:Times:144:Times:2001,  both  groups  of  source  countries  underweighted  the  U.S.  in  their  international  portfolios  
18:440:38688:27:28:72:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:(relative  to  U.S.  market  capitalization)  by  15%  and  35%,  respectively.  For  emerging  market  
18:441:38792:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:investors, investments in the U.S. account for a rising share of their portfolios over time. After a 
18:442:38893:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:downward  blip  in  2008,  the  trend  resumes  and  in  2010-11,  investors  from  these  countries  were 
18:443:39000:27:28:72:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:actually overweight U.S.  markets.  Developed  market  investors  have  remained  slightly  (5%) 
18:444:39097:28:27:72:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:underweight in U.S. markets as of 2011. Investors from both sets of countries have consistently 
18:445:39193:27:28:72:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:overweighted  the  U.K.  and  underweighted  Japan  in  their  foreign  investment  portfolios.  In  both  
18:446:39300:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:cases, the extent of the bias was larger in absolute terms for developed market investors. While 
18:447:39397:28:27:72:544:181:144:Times:144:Times:developed  market  investors  have  consistently  overweighted  Germany,  in  recent  years  emerging  
18:448:39500:27:33:72:527:154:144:Times:144:Times:market investors have alternated between being slightly overweight and slightly underweight.

18:450:39652:8:13:72:543:113:36:Times:81:Times:12 The  unweighted  results  are similar,  although  the  degree  of  over-   or  under-weighting  of  specific  destination  countries  was  in  
18:451:39798:13:11:72:194:100:81:Times:81:Times:general larger in absolute terms.   
18:452:39834:11:0:72:74:89:81:Times:81:Times: 
19:453:39837:0:28:108:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 reports the external equity investment positions by emerging and developed market 
19:454:39927:28:27:72:542:678:144:Times:144:Times:investors according to the top 20 destination markets averaged across the 2000-2011 period. This 
19:455:40024:27:28:72:541:651:144:Times:144:Times:is for the CPIS dataset only. In addition to the average investment (in current U.S. dollars millions), 
19:456:40128:28:28:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:we report the average investment ratio for that destination market, the average benchmark ratio 
19:457:40224:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:(according to the world market portfolio), and the average excess allocation. For both emerging 
19:458:40320:27:28:72:546:568:144:Times:144:Times:and  developed  market  investors,  the  U.S.  is  the  destination  market  with  the  largest  average  
19:459:40426:28:27:72:544:540:144:Times:144:Times:investment  ($43  billion  among  emerging,  $1.65  trillion  among  developed),  the  highest  average  
19:460:40531:27:28:72:546:513:144:Times:144:Times:investment  ratio,  but  also  strikingly  the  largest negative  excess  allocations  relative  to  the  
19:461:40637:28:28:72:545:485:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark  (-6.98%  for  emerging  markets,  -12.10%,  for  developed  markets).  Many  European  
19:462:40735:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:markets, such as the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, find themselves among the ranks 
19:463:40829:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:of the top destination markets for both sets of investors. But there are also important distinctions 
19:464:40930:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:between the two groups. The emerging market investors feature Bahrain, Singapore, UAE, Russia, 
19:465:41025:27:28:72:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:and  Turkey,  for  example,  none  of  which  make  the  top  20  markets  for  developed  investors. 
19:466:41127:28:28:72:539:347:144:Times:144:Times:Furthermore, there are destination countries, like Switzerland, which feature as an overweight (-
19:467:41224:28:27:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:0.29%) for emerging market investors and an overweight ( 0.72%) for developed market investors. 
19:468:41320:27:28:72:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:The  country  holdings  are  concentrated  among  the  top  20  destination  countries  for  both  sets  of  
19:469:41429:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:investor countries: the top 20 destination markets represent 94.7% of the $159 billion for emerging 
19:470:41529:27:28:72:377:237:144:Times:144:Times:markets and 94.3% of the $9.04 trillion for developed markets. 
19:471:41592:28:28:108:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:One interesting question is whether the global financial crisis led to a substantial reordering 
19:472:41688:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:of investment destinations in foreign portfolios. Appendix Table A1 lists the absolute amounts of 
19:473:41786:27:28:72:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:international  portfolio  equity  allocations  (based  on  the  CPIS  dataset)  in  2008-09. The  table  is  
19:474:41895:28:27:72:544:126:144:Times:144:Times:constructed  in  a  parallel  way  to  Table  1.  For  emerging  market  investors,  the  U.S  and  the  U.K.  
19:475:42006:27:0:72:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:remained by far the top destinations in terms of equity holdings. Relative to market capitalization 
20:476:42109:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:of these two markets, however, investments in the U.S. were underweight about 4 percent while 
20:477:42203:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:those in the U.K. were overweight about 8 percent. Developed market investors were 9 percent 
20:478:42296:27:28:71:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:underweight  the  U.S.  market  and  4  percent  overweight  the  U.K.  markets  during  this  turbulent 
20:479:42401:28:28:71:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:period. Investors from both groups of countries remained substantially overweight in Luxembourg 
20:480:42497:28:27:71:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:during  this  period.  A  number  of  emerging  markets  appear  among  the  list  of  top  20  destination  
20:481:42606:27:28:71:546:568:144:Times:144:Times:countries for emerging market portfolio holdings. By contrast, only three emerging markets (China, 
20:482:42705:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:Brazil, and India) appear in the list of top 20 destinations for developed economy equity holdings. 
20:483:42805:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:China is not a major destination for equity holdings of other emerging markets, possibly because 
20:484:42902:28:28:72:385:485:144:Times:144:Times:of restrictions on foreign investors’ access to its stock markets.13 
20:485:42970:28:27:108:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:The descriptive analysis in this section demonstrates that, consistent with the work of other 
20:486:43064:27:28:72:547:430:144:Times:144:Times:authors, developed  economies’  international  portfolio  holdings  show  a significant  foreign  
20:487:43162:28:27:72:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:allocation bias. We find that this bias is even greater for emerging markets. But we also uncover 
20:488:43260:27:28:72:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:that there is significant cross-country variation by destination country and over time that may be 
20:489:43359:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:distinctly different for emerging and developed market investors. Therefore, in the analysis that 
20:490:43457:28:27:72:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:follows, our intended contribution is not just to characterize the determinants of emerging markets’ 
20:491:43558:27:28:72:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocations but also to examine if there are systematic differences in the determinants of 
20:492:43659:28:27:72:547:264:144:Times:144:Times:those  allocations  relative  to  those  for  developed  economies  and  if  those  differences  are  
20:493:43761:27:28:72:334:237:144:Times:144:Times:meaningfully related to what existing theory predicts.

20:496:43875:9:13:72:542:123:36:Times:81:Times:13 As noted earlier, while China does not report data to the CPIS, meaning that it does not appear in the dataset as a source country, 
20:497:44010:13:10:71:542:110:81:Times:81:Times:other countries do report their holdings in China. Foreign equity investment in China is largely controlled through the Qualified 
20:498:44140:10:11:71:542:100:81:Times:81:Times:Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program. Sharma (2015) provides a detailed analysis of the QFII program and shows that most 
20:499:44270:11:0:71:212:89:81:Times:81:Times:QFIIs are based in developed markets. 
21:500:44310:0:28:108:466:706:144:Times:144:Times:4. Determinants of Emerging Markets’ External Portfolio Allocations 
21:501:44378:28:27:108:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:We now carry both the CPIS and FactSet Lionshares datasets forward to conduct a formal 
21:502:44465:27:28:72:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:analysis  of  the  determinants  of  the  portfolio  allocation  patterns  of  emerging  market  investors. 
21:503:44573:28:28:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 presents summary statistics for the variables used in our regression analysis.14 The analysis 
21:504:44675:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:that follows draws on various strands of existing literature documenting the importance of several 
21:505:44774:27:28:72:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:country  attributes  in  influencing  allocation  decisions.   There  are  some  important  aspects  of  the  
21:506:44884:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:data that are worthy of note. First, the number of country-pair-years for which we could conduct 
21:507:44981:27:28:72:544:513:144:Times:144:Times:our analysis with the CPIS data (Panel A) ranges between 12,000 and 18,000 depending on the 
21:508:45073:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:control variable of choice. But the sample declines based on the availability of the main dependent 
21:509:45173:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:variable of interest based on the excess allocations. [Note that there are summary statistics on two 
21:510:45274:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:additional benchmarks for these excess allocations shown in the table that will be introduced later 
21:511:45374:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:in the paper.] Among the control variables, those that are the most constraining for our analysis 
21:512:45472:27:28:72:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:will be those related to market size and market integration, but they will not be as binding as the 
21:513:45572:28:28:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:dependent  variable  of  interest.  The  sample  size  for  the  institution-country-years  in  the  FactSet  
21:514:45682:28:27:71:442:319:144:Times:144:Times:Lionshares dataset is much larger averaging well over 40,000 observations.   
21:515:45759:27:28:107:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 contains the baseline specifications using CPIS data. The first six columns of Panel 
21:516:45852:28:27:71:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:A report a set of regressions for emerging markets. As noted earlier, all of the regressions include 
21:517:45953:27:28:71:545:237:144:Times:144:Times:year  fixed  effects  as  well  as  source  country  and  destination  country  fixed  effects.  For  each  
21:518:46061:28:28:71:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:specification, we use the maximum available number of observations. This results in variations in 
21:519:46159:28:49:71:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:sample size across different specifications since not all variables are available for all countries.15  
21:520:46263:49:9:72:217:132:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
21:521:46321:9:10:72:534:123:36:Times:81:Times:14 Summary statistics for the developed country sample of home countries are not presented, but are available from the authors.  
21:522:46449:10:13:72:542:113:36:Times:81:Times:15 To ensure that differences in sample s ize do not affect the results, we also re-estimated each specification using a common sample 
21:523:46584:13:11:71:541:100:81:Times:81:Times:corresponding to the one used for the composite specification, listed as Model (6). It is based on 4,439 observations. Those results 
21:524:46717:11:0:71:272:89:81:Times:99:g_d0_f1:are not shown here but will be discussed briefly below. 
22:525:46775:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:Model (1) shows that, consistent with the results of other authors (e.g., Portes and Rey (2005)), 
22:526:46873:28:27:72:544:678:144:Times:144:Times:gravity variables that have been found to be strongly correlated with bilateral trade volumes are 
22:527:46971:27:28:72:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:also  important  for  portfolio  allocations.  The  level  of  excess  allocations  in  specific  destination  
22:528:47082:28:28:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:countries is negatively related to their distance from the source country, the existence of a common 
22:529:47183:28:27:72:548:595:144:Times:144:Times:border, and a common language. The latter two coefficients suggest that the notion of a “familiarity” 
22:530:47285:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:bias is not f ully supported by the data. A colonial relationship does increase the excess allocation 
22:531:47387:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:of emerging market investors to a former colonial power. A common colonial heritage also drives 
22:532:47483:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:up excess allocations. These are economically large effects: a one-standard deviation increase in 
22:533:47581:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:geographic distance (0.861) is associated with a 2.5% lower excess allocation, or about 28% of its 
22:534:47680:28:27:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:unconditional variation. Similar economic magnitudes obtain for the other familiarity variables, 
22:535:47777:27:28:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:but they are, of course, correlated with each other, in turn. The adjusted R2 in this first specification 
22:536:47883:28:27:71:345:402:144:Times:144:Times:reaches as high as 25.7% with the fixed effects in tow.16 
22:537:47940:27:28:108:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:Model  (2) controls  for  a  number  of destination  country  characteristics related  to  market  
22:538:48039:28:28:72:546:347:144:Times:144:Times:size  and  depth.  The  results  show  that  the  excess  allocation  among  destination  countries  is  
22:539:48144:28:27:72:544:319:144:Times:144:Times:negatively  related  to  the  number  of  listed  firms  adjusted  for  population  size  in  those  countries  
22:540:48256:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:and—somewhat surprisingly—positively related to the fee variable, which measures transaction 
22:541:48349:28:27:72:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:costs.  Variables  that  reflect  the  level  of  development  and  size  of  the  destination  country—per 
22:542:48457:27:28:72:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:capita GDP, the ratio of market capitalization to GDP, and market turnover—do not affect excess 
22:543:48553:28:28:72:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:allocations. Overall, the explanatory power from the market size proxies is lower with an adjusted 
22:544:48652:28:68:72:136:181:144:Times:144:Times:R2 of 19.9%. 
22:545:48665:68:9:72:217:113:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
22:546:48723:9:15:72:542:104:42:g_d0_f1:81:Times:16 We will discuss the explanatory power that comes from the source country, destination country, and year fixed effects later in 
22:547:48852:15:0:72:388:89:81:Times:81:Times:the paper. An appendix table describes the relative importance of each of them by type. 
23:548:48942:0:28:108:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:Model (3) controls for a set of financial market variables: differences between destination 
23:549:49034:28:27:72:546:678:144:Times:144:Times:and  source  countries  in  returns;  variance  ratios;  and  return correlations.  Return  differentials  
23:550:49141:27:28:72:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:between the destination and source countries do not seem to influence portfolio allocations.17 A 
23:551:49238:28:28:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:higher variance ratio—defined as the five-year volatility of stock returns in the destination country 
23:552:49340:28:27:71:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:relative to the five-year volatility of stock returns in the source country—is associated with a lower 
23:553:49443:27:28:71:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:excess  allocation.  Contrary  to  the  notion  of  improving  diversification  by  investing  in  foreign  
23:554:49551:28:27:71:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:markets  whose  returns  are  less  correlated  with  domestic  returns,  higher  correlations  with 
23:555:49652:27:28:71:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:destination country returns are in fact associated with larger excess allocations. Model (4) controls 
23:556:49754:28:28:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:for  market  integration  variables,  all  of  which  have  statistically  significant  coefficients  that look 
23:557:49866:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:reasonable. Registration and ownership restrictions as well as limits on currency convertibility are 
23:558:49967:27:28:72:545:430:144:Times:144:Times:associated  with  smaller  excess  allocations. This  group  of  variables  has  the  weakest  overall  
23:559:50071:28:27:72:303:402:144:Times:144:Times:explanatory power (adjusted R2 of only 18.7%). 
23:560:50118:27:28:108:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:Model (5) controls for country level governance variables. A higher regulatory burden has 
23:561:50208:28:28:72:546:347:144:Times:144:Times:a  negative  effect  on  excess  allocations  but  low  government  effectiveness  in  the  destination  
23:562:50313:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:countries does not seem to deter emerging market investors. In fact, a higher level of government 
23:563:50411:27:28:72:546:292:144:Times:144:Times:effectiveness  has  a  slightly  negative  effect  on  excess  allocations.  [F-tests  for  the  variables  
23:564:50519:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:examined in Models (1) to (5) indicated that each set of them was jointly statistically significant 
23:565:50619:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:at the 1 percent level.]   Model (6) is a composite one that includes all the variables considered in 
23:566:50721:28:28:72:546:209:144:Times:144:Times:the  previous  columns.  The  statistical  significance  of  the  key  coefficients  from  the  previous  
23:567:50827:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:regressions is mostly preserved although not all the gravity variables remain significant, the odd 
23:568:50926:27:54:72:542:154:144:Times:144:Times:positive effect of return correlations on excess allocations disappears, and the governance variables 
23:569:51028:54:8:72:217:100:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
23:570:51086:8:0:72:439:92:36:Times:81:Times:17 We also looked at one-year rather than five-year return differentials but that made little difference.  
24:571:51195:0:28:72:545:706:144:Times:144:Times:lose  their  significance.  We  replicated  Models  (1)  to  (5) using  the  common  sample  of  4,439  
24:572:51299:28:27:72:544:678:144:Times:144:Times:observations  for  which  we  had  data  on  all  control  variables.  There  were  few  major  differences  
24:573:51408:27:28:72:342:651:144:Times:144:Times:between those results and the results shown in Table 3.  
24:574:51465:28:28:108:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:The  remaining  columns  of  Table  3  in  Models  (6)  to  (12)  replicate  the  benchmark  CPIS  
24:575:51564:28:27:72:545:595:144:Times:144:Times:regressions but for developed  markets.  The  determinants  of  developed  markets’  international  
24:576:51664:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocations differ in some important ways from those of emerging markets. The gravity 
24:577:51760:28:27:71:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:variables as a group are strongly significant but, unlike in the case of emerging markets, a common 
24:578:51860:27:28:71:545:513:144:Times:144:Times:border  and  common  language  have  positive  effects  on  excess  allocations.  More  developed  
24:579:51959:28:28:71:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:countries, as proxied by their per capita GDP, seem to receive reliably negative excess allocations 
24:580:52058:28:27:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:from developed market investors. A larger difference in stock returns reduces allocations while, 
24:581:52155:27:28:72:545:430:144:Times:144:Times:as  in  the  case  of  emerging  market  allocations,  positive  return  correlations  are  associated  with  
24:582:52265:28:27:72:532:402:144:Times:144:Times:higher excess allocations, contrary to one criterion that ought to drive portfolio diversification.  
24:583:52366:27:28:108:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:The  statistical  significance  of  most  of  these  coefficients  is  preserved  in  the  composite  
24:584:52468:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:specification reported in Model (12). [Again, F-tests for the variables examined in Models (7) to 
24:585:52566:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:(11) indicated that each set of them was jointly statistically significant at the 1 percent level.] The 
24:586:52670:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:results in these columns were also largely preserved when we replicated them using the common 
24:587:52764:28:27:72:497:264:144:Times:144:Times:sample of 6,907 observations for which we had data on all of the explanatory variables.  
24:588:52852:27:28:108:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:Panel B of Table 3 contains estimates of the same twelve regressions as in Panel A but now 
24:589:52943:28:28:72:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:using the FactSet Lionshares data. The individual coefficient estimates are broadly consistent with 
24:590:53043:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:the results using CPIS but there are some differences. To investigate these further, we also run a 
24:591:53142:27:28:72:545:154:144:Times:144:Times:composite  specification  that  includes  all  independent  variables.  Comparing  the  full  composite  
24:592:53247:28:27:72:543:126:144:Times:144:Times:specifications for emerging market allocations using CPIS and LionShares in Model (6) in Panels 
24:593:53343:27:0:72:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:A and B shows considerable similarity in the results, although there are a few important differences 
25:594:53446:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:as well. Some of the gravity variables seem to have greater influence on the allocation decisions 
25:595:53544:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:of  institutional  investors  than  on  aggregate  country  allocations.  For  institutional  investors,  a 
25:596:53651:27:28:72:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:common colonial heritage and common language have positive effects on excess allocations but a 
25:597:53746:28:28:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:past  colonial  relationship  has  a  negative  effect.  Consistent  with  the  results  based  on  aggregate  
25:598:53857:28:27:72:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:allocations,  higher  transaction  fees  in  the  destination  country  are  associated  with  larger  excess  
25:599:53968:27:28:72:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:allocations by institutional investors but other market integration and market openness variables 
25:600:54066:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:do  not  affect  their allocations.  As  expected,  greater  government  effectiveness  and  a  lower 
25:601:54168:27:28:71:380:513:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory burden are associated with larger excess allocations.  
25:602:54234:28:28:107:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:The remaining columns present results for institutional investors in developed markets. For 
25:603:54326:28:27:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:these investors as well, the gravity variables seem to have strong effects on portfolio allocation. In 
25:604:54429:27:28:71:541:430:144:Times:144:Times:addition, measures of destination market size and depth have a positive effect on excess allocations 
25:605:54530:28:27:71:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:while market  restrictions  have  a  negative  effect.  In  other  words,  developed  market  institutional  
25:606:54639:27:28:71:540:375:144:Times:144:Times:investors seem to be more responsive to market factors than their emerging market counterparts.  
25:607:54736:28:28:107:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:One  question  at  this  juncture  is  whether,  notwithstanding  some  statistically  significant 
25:608:54835:28:27:72:546:319:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients, most of the explanatory power in our regressions comes from the various fixed effects. 
25:609:54936:27:28:72:545:292:144:Times:144:Times:To  address  this  concern,  we  ran  regressions  just  on  each  set  of  fixed  effects.  The  results  are  
25:610:55048:28:58:71:237:264:144:Times:144:Times:reported in Appendix Table A3.18 
25:611:55080:58:9:72:217:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
25:612:55138:9:15:72:530:197:42:g_d0_f1:81:Times:18 We only summarize the key conclusions here. For emerging market allocations, the year fixed effects have little explanatory 
25:613:55264:15:10:72:532:182:81:Times:81:Times:power. In the CPIS data, the source country fixed effects account for about 25% of the adjusted R2 of the composite regression 
25:614:55391:10:10:72:535:172:81:Times:81:Times:while the destination country fixed effects account for about 44%. When we switch to the FactSet LionShares data, the year and 
25:615:55518:10:11:72:541:162:81:Times:81:Times:source country fixed effects become unimportant explanatory factors while the destination country fixed effects account for about 
25:616:55648:11:10:72:506:151:81:Times:81:Times:two-thirds of the overall explanatory power of the composite regression. Our interpretation of these results is that, while 
25:617:55772:10:10:72:531:141:81:Times:81:Times:destination country fixed effects are clearly very important in the overall adjusted R2 of the composite specifications, the other 
25:618:55903:10:11:72:503:131:81:Times:81:Times:control variables in our regressions together still add considerable explanatory power. When we repeat this exercise for 
25:619:56024:11:10:72:526:120:81:Times:81:Times:developed markets, the year and source country fixed effects turn out to be unimportant. The destination country fixed effects 
25:620:56151:10:10:72:536:110:81:Times:81:Times:account for about 75% of the adjusted R2 of the composite specification using CPIS data and 83% using the FactSet LionShares 
25:621:56276:10:11:72:515:100:81:Times:81:Times:data. Thus, the residual explanatory power of the variables other than the fixed effects in explaining international portfolio 
25:622:56403:11:0:72:360:89:81:Times:99:g_d0_f1:allocations is slightly greater for emerging markets than for developed markets. 
26:623:56486:0:28:108:545:706:144:Times:144:Times:Our  main  conclusion  from  the  baseline  regressions  based  on  the  CPIS  and  LionShares  
26:624:56582:28:27:72:545:678:144:Times:144:Times:datasets  is  that  country  attributes  previously  documented  in  other  papers  based  on  developed  
26:625:56688:27:28:72:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:economy  data  (e.g.,  Chan,  Covrig,  and  Ng,  2005)  are  important  for  emerging  market  portfolio  
26:626:56794:28:28:72:545:623:144:Times:144:Times:allocations  as  well.  Interestingly,  there  seem  to  be  few  destination  country  characteristics  that  
26:627:56905:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:robustly influence EM international portfolio allocation decisions in a manner different from those 
26:628:57005:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:of DM allocations.19 Variables that capture (i) market size and depth and (ii) market integration of 
26:629:57106:28:27:72:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:destination countries seem to have differential effects, although few of these results are fully robust 
26:630:57210:27:28:72:379:513:144:Times:144:Times:across different datasets and different regression specifications.

26:632:57276:28:27:108:370:457:144:Times:144:Times:5. Testing the Information Endowment Hypothesis 
26:633:57323:27:28:108:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:The results in the previous section suggest a limited explanatory role for certain economic 
26:634:57415:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:determinants of portfolio allocations that, based on theoretical priors, should be important. Gravity 
26:635:57517:27:28:72:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:variables  matter  strongly,  despite  the  potential  benefits  from  optimal  portfolio  diversification.  
26:636:57626:28:28:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, there appear to be only a few differences in the determinants of the allocation patterns 
26:637:57725:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:of developed  market  and  emerging  market  investors.  These latter results,  in  particular,  are 
26:638:57825:27:28:72:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:surprising given that portfolio outflows from emerging market economies are a relatively recent 
26:639:57921:28:27:72:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:phenomenon, with many of these economies freeing up capital outflows only in the last decade or 
26:640:58017:27:28:72:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:two, and also because investors in these economies are presumably less sophisticated than those 
26:641:58113:28:28:72:197:209:144:Times:144:Times:in developed economies.  
26:642:58138:28:27:108:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:In  view  of  their  limited  exposure  to  international  financial  markets  and  their  nascent 
26:643:58237:27:33:72:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:information  processing  abilities,  it  is  plausible  that  emerging  market  investors  rely  to  a  greater  
26:644:58350:33:8:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
26:645:58408:8:13:72:543:113:36:Times:81:Times:19 We also directly confirmed this by running regressions for emerging market portfolio allocations using as the benchmark the 
26:646:58535:13:11:71:541:100:81:Times:81:Times:portfolio allocations of developed markets within the same region as the relevant emerging market source country. These results 
26:647:58663:11:0:71:276:89:81:Times:81:Times:are not reported here but are available from the authors.  
27:648:58724:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:extent on information endowments accumulated through earlier trade and financial relationships. 
27:649:58820:28:27:72:544:678:144:Times:144:Times:This is the central hypothesis that guides us through this study. To explore this further, we now 
27:650:58918:27:28:72:547:651:144:Times:144:Times:turn   to   an   empirical   implementation   of   the   information   endowment   hypothesis   of   van   
27:651:59025:28:28:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009). Given that investors in developed markets presumably have 
27:652:59117:28:27:72:545:595:144:Times:144:Times:better  channels  for  information  gathering  and  processing,  our  analysis  of  emerging  market  
27:653:59219:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:economies’  outward  investments  and  the  comparison  of  emerging  versus  developed  economy 
27:654:59316:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:investors together offer a more powerful test of the information endowment hypothesis than the 
27:655:59411:27:28:72:200:513:144:Times:144:Times:existing literature to date.  
27:656:59441:28:28:108:303:485:144:Times:144:Times:5.1 Measuring information endowments 
27:657:59478:28:27:108:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:We now examine whether emerging market countries allocate a larger proportion of their 
27:658:59565:27:28:72:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:external  equity  portfolios  to  countries  that  have  served  as  important  trading  partners  or  major  
27:659:59675:28:27:72:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:sources of  FDI  inflows.  Past  trade  linkages can  be  seen  as  an  important  basis  for  information  
27:660:59783:27:28:72:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:endowments. To  capture  financial  linkages,  we  focus  on  FDI  inflows,  which  have  become  
27:661:59881:28:28:72:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:dominant in gross inflows into emerging markets (Prasad, 2012). By the mid-2000s, FDI liabilities 
27:662:59979:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:accounted for more than half of external liabilities of emerging markets. Portfolio equity liabilities 
27:663:60082:27:28:72:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:account for less than 10 percent of external liabilities of emerging markets economies, many of 
27:664:60178:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:which still have relatively underdeveloped equity markets. Debt flows are usually intermediated 
27:665:60274:27:28:72:545:237:144:Times:144:Times:through  foreign  and  domestic  financial  institutions  such  as  banks  and  have  lower  information  
27:666:60380:28:28:72:424:209:144:Times:144:Times:content from the perspective of portfolio investors in emerging markets.  
27:667:60454:28:27:108:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:We construct two proxy measures to capture the notion of an information endowment: (1) 
27:668:60540:27:28:72:542:154:144:Times:144:Times:Trade, which equals the sum of all trade flows between emerging market i and country j during 
27:669:60634:28:27:71:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:the 1991-2000 period divided by the sum of emerging market i’s total external trade during that 
27:670:60730:27:0:71:542:99:144:Times:144:Times:same 1991-2000 period;  and,  (2)  FDI, which  equals  the  sum of  FDI  flows from  country  j  into 
28:671:60834:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:emerging market i during 1991-2000 divided by the sum of all FDI inflows into emerging market 
28:672:60928:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:i during 1991-2000. Since we use data on trade and FDI shares from the prior decade to explain 
28:673:61023:27:28:71:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio holdings during the 2000s, our regressions are unlikely to be affected by endogeneity (or 
28:674:61123:28:28:72:213:623:144:Times:144:Times:reverse causality) problems.  
28:675:61153:28:27:108:3832:595:144:Times:144:Times:5.2 Country-level regressions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
28:676:62375:27:28:108:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:Table 4 reports the results from CPIS regressions that include the full set of controls used 
28:677:62468:28:27:72:545:540:144:Times:144:Times:in  Table  3  as  well  as  each  of  the  information  endowment  proxies.  The  coefficient  on  the  
28:678:62572:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:information endowment variable in Model (1) is statistically significant and large. The coefficient 
28:679:62672:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:indicates that a 1 percentage point increase in the past level of the home country’s trade (exports 
28:680:62772:28:27:72:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:plus imports) accounted for by a particular trading partner is associated with an increase of nearly 
28:681:62873:27:28:72:545:430:144:Times:144:Times:0.5  percentage  points  in  the  excess  allocation  of  the  source  emerging  market’s  international  
28:682:62979:28:27:72:540:402:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio  to  that  destination  country  (relative  to  the  destination  country’s  market  capitalization-
28:683:63089:27:28:71:262:375:144:Times:144:Times:weighted share in the world portfolio).  
28:684:63130:28:28:107:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:The  coefficient  on  the  other  information  variable,  captured  by  past  FDI,  is  reported  in  
28:685:63232:28:27:71:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:Model (2) and is also significantly positive, although smaller. A one percentage point increase in 
28:686:63331:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:the share of FDI from a particular country to the relevant emerging market subsequently increases

28:688:63525:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:points. The standard deviation of the FDI share is about four times that of the trade share variable 
28:689:63626:28:28:72:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:(0.028  versus  0.006,  see  Table  A2),  so  the  quantitative  significance  of  these  two  information  
28:690:63734:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:endowment variables is in fact somewhat closer than suggested by the simple calculations above. 
28:691:63830:27:28:72:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:These results together constitute prima facie evidence in support of the information endowment 
28:692:63925:28:0:72:132:126:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesis.  
29:693:63941:0:28:108:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:In Models (3) and (4), we compare these results with those for developed market portfolio 
29:694:64031:28:27:72:548:678:144:Times:144:Times:allocations. The   coefficients   on   both   information   endowment   variables   are   positive   and   
29:695:64138:27:28:71:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant, suggesting that these endowments play an important role in determining 
29:696:64236:28:28:71:383:623:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocations even of reasonably sophisticated investors.

29:698:64365:27:28:107:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:One  question  is  whether  the  results  are  driven  by  our  use  of  a  benchmark  based  on  the  
29:699:64468:28:27:71:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:market-capitalization weighted world market portfolio. A large body of work has documented that 
29:700:64564:27:28:71:544:513:144:Times:144:Times:country  characteristics  such  as  investability,  market  liquidity,  quality  of  corporate  and  public  
29:701:64673:28:28:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:governance, political stability, and stability of macroeconomic policies affect both the volume and 
29:702:64773:28:27:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:composition of a country’s external liability portfolio. It is possible that both emerging market and 
29:703:64875:27:28:71:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:developed market portfolio allocations are driven by these factors in a way that we have failed to 
29:704:64974:28:27:71:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:control for in our various specifications, so our use of the world market portfolio weights as the 
29:705:65073:27:28:72:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark for  the  foreign  allocation  bias  might  throw  a  veil  over  interesting  differences  in  the  
29:706:65184:28:28:71:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocation patterns of emerging market and developed market investors. To address this 
29:707:65281:28:27:71:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:point,  we  now  present  results  using  two  alternative  benchmarks  that  also  provide  a  more  direct  
29:708:65391:27:28:71:323:292:144:Times:144:Times:comparison with the results for developed markets.  
29:709:65443:28:27:107:545:264:144:Times:144:Times:We  first  construct  a  measure  that  directly  compares emerging  market  allocations  in  a  
29:710:65540:27:28:71:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:particular destination country  relative  to  the  allocations  of developed  markets  (within  the  same  
29:711:65647:28:28:71:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:region as the source country) in that destination country. In other words, we ask whether, relative 
29:712:65747:28:27:71:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:to their regional developed market counterparts, emerging market investors overweight a particular 
29:713:65845:27:28:71:548:154:144:Times:144:Times:country  in  their  portfolios.  This  provides   a  direct  comparison  between  the  external  investment  
29:714:65954:28:27:71:543:126:144:Times:144:Times:patterns of emerging market investors and their developed market counterparts, with the implicit 
29:715:66051:27:0:71:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:assumption  that  investors  from  both  types  of  economies  care  about  the  same  set  of  destination  
30:716:66163:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:country characteristics when making their portfolio allocation decisions. We call this benchmark, 
30:717:66261:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:Benchmark  2,  a regional  developed-market benchmark, which  we  compute  as  the  portfolio 
30:718:66354:27:28:72:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:investment from all developed markets within the region of emerging market i to country j divided 
30:719:66452:28:28:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:by the portfolio investment from all developed markets within the region of emerging market i to 
30:720:66549:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:all  countries.  The  dependent  variable  now captures  how  emerging  market  foreign  allocation 
30:721:66649:27:28:72:318:568:144:Times:144:Times:patterns differ from those of developed markets.20  
30:722:66701:28:27:108:544:540:144:Times:144:Times:Models  (5)  and  (6) show  the  results  from  regressions  using  regional developed  market  
30:723:66797:27:28:72:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark. The coefficient on the trade variable is positive and significant. The estimate indicates 
30:724:66898:28:28:72:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:that a one percentage point increase in the home country’s share of past trade accounted for by a 
30:725:66996:28:27:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:particular  trading  partner  country  has  a  0.6  percentage  point  higher  effect  on  average  emerging  
30:726:67106:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:market portfolio allocations to that trading partner country relative to average developed economy 
30:727:67205:28:27:72:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:allocations  to  that  country.  The  FDI  ratio,  by  contrast,  does  not  have  differential  effects  on  the  
30:728:67320:27:28:72:399:375:144:Times:144:Times:allocation patterns of emerging versus developed market investors.  
30:729:67388:28:28:108:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:Next,  instead  of  using  developed  markets  in  the  same  regions,  we  create  an  alternative 
30:730:67487:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark,  which  we  call  Benchmark  3,  based  on  propensity  score  matching  between  a  given  
30:731:67590:27:28:72:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:emerging  market  and all developed  markets  in  the  sample  using a  set  of  variables  that  include  
30:732:67697:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:physical distance, a dummy for a common border, common language, common colonial heritage, 
30:733:67788:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:previous colonial relationship, and participation in a regional trade agreement. The allocations of 
30:734:67888:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:the propensity-score matched developed market i are then used as the benchmark against which 
30:735:67981:28:27:72:540:181:144:Times:144:Times:the  concerned  emerging  market’s  allocations  are  evaluated.  Specifically,  the  propensity  score-
30:736:68085:27:43:72:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:matched benchmark is equal to the portfolio investment from propensity score-matched developed 
30:737:68180:43:8:72:217:111:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
30:738:68238:8:14:72:542:103:36:Times:81:Times:20  Depending on whether the regressions are based on CPIS or LionShares data, the benchmark is based on CPIS data or LionShares 
30:739:68367:14:0:71:218:89:81:Times:81:Times:data aggregated up to the country level.  
31:740:68412:0:28:72:539:706:144:Times:144:Times:market i to  destination  country j  divided  by  the  portfolio  investment  from  propensity  score-
31:741:68514:28:27:72:290:678:144:Times:144:Times:matched developed market i to all countries.  
31:742:68560:27:28:108:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:Models (7) and (8) show the results from regressions based on propensity score-matched 
31:743:68647:28:28:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:Benchmark  3.  In  this  case,  the  coefficients  on  both  the  trade  and  FDI  ratios  are  significantly  
31:744:68758:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:positive,  confirming  that  the  information  endowments  have  a  bigger  effect  on  the  allocation 
31:745:68862:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:patterns of emerging markets relative to developed markets. The coefficients   on the trade ratio in 
31:746:68963:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:Model (7) and the FDI ratio in Model (8) are about the same as in the benchmark regressions in 
31:747:69058:27:28:72:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:Models (1) and (2), respectively, although the interpretation of the coefficients is not exactly the 
31:748:69159:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:same. The regression in Model (8) indicates that a 1 percentage point increase in the past share of 
31:749:69259:28:27:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:FDI  inflows  from  a  particular  foreign  country  results  in  the  average  emerging  market  directing  
31:750:69368:27:28:72:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:0.03 percentage points more of its allocation to that country relative to the allocation of the average 
31:751:69472:28:27:72:177:402:144:Times:144:Times:developed economy.  
31:752:69492:27:28:108:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:Although we do not report the coefficients on other controls here, it is worth pointing out 
31:753:69584:28:28:72:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:that relatively few of the other coefficients were significant in Models (5) to (8) in this table. This 
31:754:69688:28:27:72:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:means that, other than the information endowment variables, the remaining explanatory variables 
31:755:69784:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:do not have markedly differential effects on emerging market versus developed economy foreign 
31:756:69878:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocations. When we include both information endowment variables simultaneously, the 
31:757:69974:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:trade share variable tends to dominate and the coefficient on the FDI ratio often turns insignificant. 
31:758:70077:28:28:72:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:These results suggest strongly that the information endowment hypothesis is of greater relevance 
31:759:70174:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:for portfolio allocations of emerging market economies than it is for those of developed economies. 
31:760:70274:27:28:72:489:154:144:Times:144:Times:The differences are not just statistically significant but also economically meaningful.  
31:761:70364:28:27:108:543:126:144:Times:144:Times:We  conducted  two  further robustness  tests for  our  baseline  results.  First,  we  used  an 
31:762:70461:27:0:71:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:alternative measure of trade that includes only imports. That is, the import share is computed as 
32:763:70562:0:28:72:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:the sum of imports of emerging market i from trading partner country j during 1991-2000 divided 
32:764:70658:28:27:71:539:678:144:Times:144:Times:by the sum of total imports of emerging market i from all trading partner countries during 1991-
32:765:70754:27:28:71:544:651:144:Times:144:Times:2000. The  second  robustness  test  is  related  to  the  large  number  of  missing  observations  in  our  
32:766:70864:28:28:71:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:dataset on account of the limited availability of FDI data. It is possible that some of these missing 
32:767:70966:28:27:71:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:observations in fact represent zeroes. We checked our main results by substituting zeroes for the 
32:768:71064:27:28:71:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:missing observations. These tests, whose results we do not report here, confirmed the robustness 
32:769:71161:28:27:71:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:of our main results regarding the effect of information endowments on portfolio allocations and 
32:770:71257:27:28:71:231:513:144:Times:144:Times:we do not pursue them further.21 
32:771:71289:28:28:107:263:485:144:Times:144:Times:5.4 Institution-level regressions 
32:772:71322:28:27:107:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:Next, we undertake a more rigorous test of the information endowment hypothesis using 
32:773:71408:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:institution-level data. To exploit the granularity of the LionShares dataset, we use characteristics 
32:774:71509:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:of the specific institutions in our dataset. The first information endowment proxy we construct is 
32:775:71608:27:28:72:542:375:144:Times:144:Times:a dummy variable called Parent Country that takes the value one if the destination country j is the 
32:776:71708:28:28:72:546:347:144:Times:144:Times:country  where  the  emerging  market  institution’s  parent  is  located.  The  second  information  
32:777:71810:28:27:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:endowment is a dummy variable called Peer Country that takes the value one if the destination 
32:778:71904:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:country j contains a foreign subsidiary of the parent institution of emerging market institution i.22 
32:779:72005:28:27:72:545:264:144:Times:144:Times:We  propose  these  two  variables  as information  endowment  proxies  that  are  specific  to  each  
32:780:72108:27:54:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:institution, which is potentially more relevant to their allocation patterns than aggregate trade or 
32:781:72209:54:8:72:217:183:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
32:782:72267:8:10:72:243:175:36:Times:81:Times:21 These results are available from the authors.  
32:783:72316:10:14:72:543:165:36:Times:81:Times:22 Creating  these  information  endowment  variables  involved  a  matching  exercise  based  on  hand-collected  information  from  
32:784:72450:14:10:71:543:151:81:Times:81:Times:websites.  For  each  of  the  emerging  market  institutional  investors  in  FactSet Lionshares,  we  started  by  using  institution  names,  
32:785:72595:10:10:71:542:141:81:Times:81:Times:complemented by website reviews, to uncover evidence of subsidiary-parent relationships. These classifications are available from 
32:786:72725:10:11:72:543:131:81:Times:81:Times:the  authors  upon  request.  Once  we  determine  that  a  particular  emerging  market  institution  is  the  foreign  subsidiary  of  a  parent  
32:787:72873:11:10:72:542:120:81:Times:81:Times:institution,  we  identify  the  country  where  its  parent  institution  is  domiciled.  We  then use  the  same  procedure  of  a  name-based 
32:788:73018:10:10:72:542:110:81:Times:81:Times:search and a website search of parent company information to identify other emerging market countries where the parent institution 
32:789:73149:10:11:72:163:100:81:Times:81:Times:has foreign subsidiaries.  
32:790:73175:11:0:72:74:89:81:Times:81:Times: 
33:791:73178:0:28:72:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:FDI flows. The dependent variable and the baseline benchmark for the institution-level regressions 
33:792:73277:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:are as described above. The controls include the full set of destination country characteristics used 
33:793:73379:27:28:72:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:in the baseline regressions in Table 3, as well as year, source country, and destination country fixed 
33:794:73482:28:28:72:545:623:144:Times:144:Times:effects. Given  how  the  information  endowment  proxies  are  constructed,  we  can  not  include  
33:795:73583:28:27:72:233:595:144:Times:144:Times:institution-specific fixed effects.  
33:796:73619:27:28:108:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:The results   are presented in Panel B of Table 4. Using the world market portfolio weights 
33:797:73711:28:27:72:545:540:144:Times:144:Times:for  the  benchmark  ratio  to  compute  excess  allocations,  Models  (1)  and  (2)  show  that  both  
33:798:73815:27:28:72:545:513:144:Times:144:Times:information  endowment  variables  are  statistically  significant.  Institutions  in  emerging  markets  
33:799:73921:28:28:72:547:485:144:Times:144:Times:tend to have an average excess allocation of 3.2 percentage points   in the country that their parent 
33:800:74023:28:27:72:545:457:144:Times:144:Times:institution  is  located  in.  Interestingly,  the  peer  effect  is  quantitatively  larger  than  this  parent  
33:801:74137:27:28:71:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:institution  effect.  For  an  emerging  market  institutional  investor,  the  existence  of  a  foreign 
33:802:74243:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:subsidiary of the same parent institution is associated with a 5.3 percentage point increase in the 
33:803:74343:27:28:72:546:375:144:Times:144:Times:excess  investment  allocation  in  that  country  relative  to  that  country’s  share  in  the  market  
33:804:74449:28:28:72:269:347:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization-weighted world portfolio.  
33:805:74491:28:27:108:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:Next,  we  examine  whether  the  allocations  of  individual  institutional  investors  based in 
33:806:74589:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:emerging markets are on average more or less influenced by such information endowments than 
33:807:74681:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:the allocations of institutional investors based in developed market economies. Since developed 
33:808:74777:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:market institutional investors are likely to have longer investment histories and other channels of 
33:809:74877:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:information acquisition, one would expect that the information endowments matter less for their 
33:810:74973:28:27:72:544:181:144:Times:144:Times:allocation  decisions.  We  first  use  Benchmark  2 for  which  the  excess  investment  allocation  is  
33:811:75078:27:28:72:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:calculated relative to the average investment allocations (ratios) of developed market in the same 
33:812:75177:28:0:72:543:126:144:Times:144:Times:region as the home country of institution i. The results, shown in Models (3) and (4) of Panel B, 
34:813:75278:0:28:72:546:706:144:Times:144:Times:indicate  that  the  information  endowment  effect  on  allocation  patterns  is  much  greater  for  
34:814:75381:28:27:72:468:678:144:Times:144:Times:institutional investors in emerging markets relative to those in developed markets. 
34:815:75464:27:28:108:542:651:144:Times:144:Times:We  also  computed  the  excess  investment  allocation  relative  to  another  benchmark, 
34:816:75555:28:28:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:Benchmark 3, based on the propensity-score matched developed market economies (similar to the 
34:817:75649:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:earlier aggregate analysis using the CPIS data). The results, presented in the last two columns of 
34:818:75748:27:28:72:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:Panel  B  in  Table  4,  confirm  the  greater  importance  of  information  endowments  in  determining  
34:819:75854:28:27:72:477:540:144:Times:144:Times:allocations of emerging market relative to developed market institutional investors.  
34:820:75940:27:28:108:543:513:144:Times:144:Times:The main conclusion from this section is that information endowments play an important 
34:821:76027:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:role in driving differences between the outward portfolio allocation patterns of emerging markets 
34:822:76124:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:relative to developed economies. The results hold up both at the country level and for individual 
34:823:76222:27:28:72:184:430:144:Times:144:Times:institutional investors.

34:826:76282:27:28:108:445:347:144:Times:144:Times:6.1 Portfolio Concentration and the Role of Information Endowments 
34:827:76349:28:27:108:547:319:144:Times:144:Times:One  issue  worth  exploring  is  whether  there  is  a  relationship  between  information  
34:828:76442:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:endowments and the degree of portfolio concentration. Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2010) 
34:829:76533:28:27:72:546:264:144:Times:144:Times:propose there  are  two  types  of  learning  strategies:  deepening  knowledge  and  broadening  
34:830:76631:27:28:72:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:knowledge.  According  to  them,  investors  who  deepen  their  knowledge  would  hold  more  assets  
34:831:76734:28:28:72:546:209:144:Times:144:Times:initially  familiar  to  them,  while  investors  who  broaden  their  knowledge  would  learn  about  
34:832:76837:28:27:72:544:181:144:Times:144:Times:unfamiliar  assets,  undo  initial  advantages  and  reduce  portfolio  bias  imparted  by  differences  in  
34:833:76946:27:28:72:542:154:144:Times:144:Times:initial information. We test this implication by showing when the portfolio allocation of a country 
34:834:77046:28:27:72:544:126:144:Times:144:Times:or  institutional  investor  is  less  diversified,  information  endowments  could  play  a  more  decisive  
34:835:77156:27:0:72:544:99:144:Times:144:Times:role  in  determining  allocations.  We  do  not take  a  stand  on  whether  information  endowments  
35:836:77262:0:28:72:547:706:144:Times:144:Times:generate  or  reduce  concentration  in  a  causal  sense.  Rather,  we  ask  whether  information  
35:837:77362:28:27:72:503:678:144:Times:144:Times:endowments influence allocations more given different levels of portfolio concentration.  
35:838:77452:27:28:108:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:For each country, we compute a Herfindahl index of the country-level external allocations. 
35:839:77543:28:28:71:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:We construct a dummy variable that takes the value one if the index is above the median level of 
35:840:77640:28:27:71:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:the index among all source countries in that year. We then interact the concentration dummy with 
35:841:77737:27:28:71:539:568:144:Times:144:Times:the  information  endowment  variables.  If  the  excess  allocations  of  countries  with  more-than-
35:842:77839:28:27:72:546:540:144:Times:144:Times:average  concentrated  portfolios  were  more  influenced  by  information  endowments,  then  the  
35:843:77939:27:28:72:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients on the interaction terms would be positive. This is exactly what we find, as shown in 
35:844:78038:28:28:72:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:the first two columns of Table 5, Panel A, where the excess allocations are measured relative to 
35:845:78135:28:27:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:world  portfolio  benchmark,  the  market  capitalization  weighted  world  portfolio.  The  interaction  
35:846:78241:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients remain positive and statistically significant when we use regional developed market 
35:847:78338:28:27:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark, which examines emerging market allocations relative to the allocations of developed 
35:848:78433:27:28:72:470:375:144:Times:144:Times:markets that are in the same region as the home country, as in Models (3) and (4).  
35:849:78517:28:28:108:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:We conducted a similar experiment to evaluate the effects of information endowments on 
35:850:78604:28:27:72:544:319:144:Times:144:Times:the allocations of institutional investors with different degrees of portfolio concentration. In this 
35:851:78706:27:28:72:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:case,  the  concentration  dummy  takes  the  value  one  if  the  Herfindahl  index  of  the  country-level 
35:852:78815:28:27:72:543:264:144:Times:144:Times:allocation of the source institution portfolio in a given year is above the median among all source 
35:853:78915:27:28:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:institutions (based in emerging markets) in that year. We allow this dummy variable to interact 
35:854:79011:28:28:72:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:with  the  parent  country  and  peer  country  dummies  that  were  used  as  information  endowment  
35:855:79114:28:27:72:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:proxies in the previous exercise.  The only significant interaction coefficient in Panel B of Table 
35:856:79214:27:28:72:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:5 is that on the Peer Country × Concentration interaction variable in Model (2). That is, among 
35:857:79309:28:0:72:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:emerging market institutional investors with more-than-average concentrated external portfolios, 
36:858:79409:0:28:72:544:706:144:Times:144:Times:there is a stronger positive effect on allocations towards countries where a foreign subsidiary of 
36:859:79508:28:27:72:275:678:144:Times:144:Times:the investor’s parent company is located.  
36:860:79551:27:28:108:437:651:144:Times:144:Times:6.2 Parsing Information Endowments by Size of Destination Market 
36:861:79616:28:28:108:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:An under-explored implication of van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp’s (2009) model is that 
36:862:79702:28:27:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:the potential benefits of acquiring information about an investment destination increases with the 
36:863:79801:27:28:72:545:568:144:Times:144:Times:relative  size  of  the  destination  country  (with  the  size  measured  relative  to  that  of  the  source  
36:864:79913:28:27:72:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:country). We now examine whether the relative size of investment destinations compared to the 
36:865:80007:27:28:72:285:513:144:Times:144:Times:source country affects allocation decisions.  
36:866:80052:28:28:108:545:485:144:Times:144:Times:We  use  two  measures  of  size—GDP  and  equity  market  capitalization.  To  focus  on  
36:867:80143:28:27:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:substantive size differences relative to the home country, we express each of these variables as a 
36:868:80242:27:28:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:ratio of the corresponding variable in the home country. We then construct dummy variables that 
36:869:80338:28:27:72:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:equal one if this ratio is above the median ratio among all source-destination country pairs in a 
36:870:80436:27:28:72:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:given  year.  In  the  regressions,  we  interact  these  dummies  with  the  information  endowment  
36:871:80538:28:28:72:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:variables and, of course, also include levels of information endowment variables and size dummies. 
36:872:80637:28:27:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:Using  a  similar  dummy  variable  approach,  we  also  examine  whether  return  volatility  in  the  
36:873:80741:27:28:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:destination country relative to the home country affects how information endowments influence 
36:874:80835:28:27:72:214:264:144:Times:144:Times:allocation decisions, in turn.  
36:875:80867:27:28:108:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:These results, using the CPIS dataset, are reported in Table 6. In none of the cases do we 
36:876:80958:28:28:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:find significant coefficients on the interaction terms. In other words, information endowments do 
36:877:81056:28:0:72:545:181:144:Times:144:Times:not  have  differential  effects  on emerging  market  portfolio  allocations  to  large  versus  small  
37:878:81164:0:28:72:545:706:144:Times:144:Times:destination  countries  or  across  different  levels  of  destination  market  relative  to  home  country  
37:879:81273:28:27:72:164:678:144:Times:144:Times:return volatility.23

37:881:81295:28:28:107:277:623:144:Times:144:Times:6.3 Results Using Raw Allocations 
37:882:81328:28:27:108:546:595:144:Times:144:Times:To  this  point,  we  have  used  different  benchmarks  against  which  we  measure  excess  
37:883:81422:27:28:72:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:allocations  in  each  potential  destination  country.  We  now  examine  if  information  endowments  
37:884:81526:28:27:72:546:540:144:Times:144:Times:matter  for  explaining  raw  allocations  that  are  not  measured  with  reference  to  any  of  these  
37:885:81632:27:28:72:546:513:144:Times:144:Times:benchmarks.  That  is,  for  each  emerging  market  source  country  we  just  regress  the  external  
37:886:81736:28:28:72:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio  shares  of  each  potential  destination  country  on  the  destination  country  characteristics,  
37:887:81847:28:27:72:378:457:144:Times:144:Times:information endowment variables, and full set of fixed effects.  
37:888:81912:27:28:108:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:The results are presented in Table 7. Panel A, which contains the CPIS results, shows that 
37:889:82003:28:27:72:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:past  trade  and  FDI  relationships  have  a  significant  positive  effect  on  raw  allocations.  Panel  B,  
37:890:82115:27:28:72:542:375:144:Times:144:Times:which contains the LionShares results, shows that the parent country and peer country information 
37:891:82213:28:28:71:547:347:144:Times:144:Times:endowment   proxies   have   strong   positive   effects   on   raw   allocations   of   emerging   market   
37:892:82322:28:27:71:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:institutional investors. Thus, the raw investment ratios confirm the earlier results that information 
37:893:82424:27:28:71:412:292:144:Times:144:Times:endowments do have a positive effect on portfolio allocation patterns.  
37:894:82496:28:27:107:282:264:144:Times:144:Times:6.4 Additional Tests and Extensions 
37:895:82532:27:28:107:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:We conducted a variety of additional tests to check the robustness of our main results and 
37:896:82623:28:28:71:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:to consider extensions. Since these results in general confirmed our main results, we only briefly 
37:897:82722:28:70:71:184:181:144:Times:144:Times:summarize them here.  
37:898:82743:70:8:72:217:111:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:                                                           
37:899:82801:8:14:72:543:103:36:Times:81:Times:23 We  found  similar  results,  though  they  are  not  reported  here,  when  we  examined  the  allocation  patterns  of  emerging  market  
37:900:82944:14:0:71:288:89:81:Times:81:Times:institutional investors using the FactSet LionShares dataset. 
38:901:83008:0:28:108:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:The regressions we have presented thus far show average results across a large and varied 
38:902:83098:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:group of emerging market economies. We also ran regressions separately for each country to look 
38:903:83194:27:28:71:545:651:144:Times:144:Times:for patterns in  the  estimated  coefficients  on  the  information  endowment  variables  that  were  
38:904:83297:28:28:71:545:623:144:Times:144:Times:systematically  related  to  specific  country  characteristics.  The  small  sample  sizes  for  some  
38:905:83401:28:27:71:546:595:144:Times:144:Times:countries  meant  that  the  coefficients  were  less  precisely  estimated.  The  coefficients  on  the  
38:906:83507:27:28:71:543:568:144:Times:144:Times:information  endowment  variables  were  in  general  positive  using  either  the  CPIS  or  LionShares  
38:907:83613:28:27:71:543:540:144:Times:144:Times:data. However, we did not find consistent evidence across all countries to support the secondary 
38:908:83710:27:28:71:544:513:144:Times:144:Times:proposition  of  the  information  endowment  hypothesis—that  the  information  endowment  should  
38:909:83810:28:28:71:513:485:144:Times:144:Times:have stronger explanatory power when the relative size of the destination country is larger.  
38:910:83904:28:27:107:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:The global financial  crisis  is  likely  to  have  caused  a  reassessment  of  perceived  risk  and  
38:911:84007:27:28:71:546:430:144:Times:144:Times:return  characteristics  of  different  markets  and,  therefore,  could  have  affected  international  
38:912:84112:28:27:71:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio allocations. We re-estimated the main regressions using data for the period 2009-11. The 
38:913:84211:27:28:72:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients on the information endowment variables mostly remained statistically significant for 
38:914:84309:28:28:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:emerging market allocations (see Appendix Table A4). In the post-crisis period, the coefficients 
38:915:84406:28:27:71:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:estimated using the CPIS data were smaller than those for the pre-crisis period or the corresponding 
38:916:84507:27:28:71:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:ones from the full sample regressions. In other words, the effects of information endowments on 
38:917:84603:28:27:71:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:external  portfolio  allocations  became  attenuated  after  the  crisis.  By  contrast,  in  the  LionShares  
38:918:84714:27:28:71:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:regressions, the coefficient on the FDI relationship information endowment proxy was higher in 
38:919:84809:28:28:71:331:209:144:Times:144:Times:the post-crisis period relative to the pre-crisis period.  
38:920:84868:28:27:107:542:181:144:Times:144:Times:There were some interesting results related to other control variables when we used the two 
38:921:84960:27:28:71:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:alternative benchmarks,  which  allow  for  a  direct  comparison  between  the  determinants  of  the  
38:922:85064:28:27:71:544:126:144:Times:144:Times:allocation  patterns  of  emerging  market  versus  developed  market  allocations  (results  not  shown  
38:923:85170:27:0:71:540:99:144:Times:144:Times:here). Market liquidity entered with a significant positive coefficient, indicating that in the post-
39:924:85274:0:28:72:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:crisis period this variable played a larger role in emerging markets’ allocations relative to those of 
39:925:85377:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:developed  markets.  The  coefficient  on  the  control  of  corruption  variable  turned significantly 
39:926:85481:27:28:72:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:negative in both CPIS and LionShares regressions. This could reflect emerging market investors 
39:927:85576:28:28:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:pulling back on their allocations to developed markets, which were undergoing macroeconomic 
39:928:85668:28:27:72:352:595:144:Times:144:Times:and equity market collapses in the aftermath of the crisis.

39:931:85750:27:28:107:544:513:144:Times:144:Times:Our  objective  in  this  paper  was  to  characterize  external portfolio  equity  allocations  of  
39:932:85851:28:28:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:emerging markets and analyze their determinants. This subject has received little attention in the 
39:933:85950:28:27:72:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:existing  literature,  most  of  which  has  been  focused  on  portfolio  investments  among developed 
39:934:86054:27:28:71:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:markets  or in emerging  markets.  The  topic of  our  paper  is  important given  the  rapidly  rising  
39:935:86159:28:27:71:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:prominence  of  emerging  markets  in  global  financial  flows  and  rising  foreign  portfolio  asset  
39:936:86264:27:28:71:213:375:144:Times:144:Times:holdings of these economies. 
39:937:86293:28:28:107:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:Our main result is that emerging market’s foreign investment patterns are consistent with 
39:938:86383:28:27:71:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:the  information  endowment  hypothesis.  External  equity  investments  from  specific  emerging  
39:939:86482:27:28:71:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:markets  tend  to  be  disproportionately  allocated  towards  countries  that  in  the  past  had  served  as  
39:940:86594:28:27:71:542:264:144:Times:144:Times:major trading partners or were important sources of FDI inflows. The results are robust to a variety 
39:941:86695:27:28:71:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:of  controls  that  measure  financial  market  development,  economic  size,  macroeconomic  factors,  
39:942:86799:28:28:71:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:and institutional quality. We also exploited a detailed database on institution-level data to test a 
39:943:86900:28:27:71:543:181:144:Times:144:Times:stricter  version  of  the  information  endowment  hypothesis.  We  found  that  institutional  investors  
39:944:87008:27:28:71:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:based  in  emerging  markets  tend  to  have  larger  excess  allocations  of  their  foreign  investment  
39:945:87115:28:27:71:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:portfolios in countries where the institution’s parent is located or if the destination country contains 
39:946:87220:27:0:71:299:99:144:Times:144:Times:a foreign subsidiary of the institution’s parent.  
40:947:87274:0:28:108:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:Information endowments seem to be more important for determining the external portfolio 
40:948:87362:28:27:72:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:allocations of emerging markets (or emerging market institutional investors) relative to developed 
40:949:87461:27:28:72:543:651:144:Times:144:Times:markets (or developed market institutional investors). Information endowments also seem to play 
40:950:87557:28:28:72:545:623:144:Times:144:Times:a  larger  role  in  explaining  the  allocations  of  countries  that  have  more  concentrated  external  
40:951:87665:28:27:72:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:portfolios. While we use a large array of control variables based on alternative theories, we do not 
40:952:87766:27:28:72:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:use a nested model that formally tests the information endowment hypothesis against alternatives. 
40:953:87864:28:27:72:544:540:144:Times:144:Times:Nevertheless,  we  believe  the  results  are  interesting  enough  to  warrant  further  theoretical  and

45:1106:95987:19:11:72:722:510:81:Times:81:Times:Table 1 shows the top investment destinations for external portfolio equity investments from emerging market (EM, left panel) and developed market (DM, right panel) economies. 
45:1107:96163:11:12:71:721:499:81:Times:81:Times:Each destination country is classified as an EM or DM economy, and the regions of the destination countries are broadly classified as North America (NA), Asia Pacific (AP), Eastern 
45:1108:96344:12:11:71:722:487:81:Times:81:Times:Europe, Middle East & Africa (EEMEA),  and Latin America (LA). For each destination market, we compute average total equity investments across the years 2000-2011 in US 
45:1109:96513:11:11:71:722:476:81:Times:81:Times:dollar millions from emerging markets Panel A and from developed markets in Panel B.  Destination markets are ranked by average total equity investment across years and the top 
45:1110:96690:11:11:71:722:465:81:Times:81:Times:twenty destination countries are displayed. The average investment ratio is calculated as follows. In each year, we calculate the investment ratio from a particular source country to 
45:1111:96873:11:11:71:721:454:81:Times:81:Times:a destination country as the ratio of total investment from the source country to that destination country, divided by the total investment from the source country to all destination 
45:1112:97056:11:11:71:721:443:81:Times:81:Times:countries.  For each destination country, we take the equal-weighted average of the investment ratio across all source countries from each group (EMs in the left panel, DMs in the 
45:1113:97236:11:12:71:722:432:81:Times:81:Times:right panel) to compute the average investment ratio.  In the left panel, the average benchmark for a destination country is calculated as follows. For each destination country in each 
45:1114:97421:12:11:71:725:420:81:Times:81:Times:year, we first compute the ratio of its market capitalization relative to world market capitalization minus a particular EM source country’s market capitalization.  This calculation is 
45:1115:97606:11:11:71:722:409:81:Times:81:Times:repeated for each EM source country relevant to that destination country in that same year. For each destination country, we then take the equal-weighted average of the investment 
45:1116:97786:11:11:71:723:398:81:Times:81:Times:ratios   across all EM source countries.  Then we take the average of the benchmark ratios over the years 2000 to 2011. The difference between the average investment ratio and 
45:1117:97962:11:11:71:722:387:81:Times:81:Times:average  benchmark  gives  the  average  excess  allocation  (or  under  allocation)  for  each  destination  country.  In  the  right  panel,  we  repeat  the  same  calculations  using  DM  source 
45:1118:98161:11:19:71:385:376:81:Times:99:Times:countries. In both panels, we use CPIS data to compute country-pair investment data.

47:1227:104141:11:10:72:723:499:81:Times:81:Times:upon five different groups of variables. In each year, we calculate the excess allocation from one emerging market to a destination country as the investment ratio,  or the ra tio of total 
47:1228:104330:10:10:71:723:489:81:Times:81:Times:investment from an emerging market country to a given destination country divided by the total investment from the emerging market country to all countries, less one of three

69:2340:157078:11:11:72:723:454:81:Times:81:Times:investment ratio from a particular source country to a destination country as the ratio of total investment from the source country to that destination country, divided by the total 
69:2341:157260:11:11:72:722:443:81:Times:81:Times:investment from the source country to all destination countries.  For each destination country, we take the equal-weighted average of the investment ratio across all source countries 
69:2342:157443:11:12:72:723:432:81:Times:81:Times:from  each  group  (EMs  in  the  left  panel,  DMs  in  the  right  panel)  to  compute  the  average  investment  ratio.  In  the  left  panel,  the  average  benchmark  for  a  destination  country  is  
69:2343:157649:12:11:72:722:420:81:Times:81:Times:calculated as follows. For each destination country in each year, we first compute the ratio of its market capitalization relative to world market capitalization minus a particular EM 
69:2344:157833:11:11:72:723:409:81:Times:81:Times:source country’s market capitalization. This calculation is repeated for each EM source country relevant to that destination country in that same year. For each destination country, 
69:2345:158015:11:11:72:721:398:81:Times:81:Times:we then take the equal-weighted average of the investment ratios across all EM source countries.  Then we take the average of the benchmark ratios over the years 2000 to 2011. The 
69:2346:158195:11:11:72:722:387:81:Times:81:Times:difference between the average investment ratio and average benchmark gives the average excess allocation (or under allocation) for each destination country. In the right panel, we 
69:2347:158376:11:19:72:554:376:81:Times:99:Times:repeat the same calculations using DM source countries. In both panels, we use CPIS data to compute country-pair investment data.

71:2451:162742:0:19:72:453:709:122:Times:122:Times:Appendix Table A3. How important are fixed effects in our baseline regressions? 
71:2452:162821:19:11:72:541:690:81:Times:81:Times:In  this  table,  we  evaluate  the  explanatory  power  of  the  fixed  effects  relative  to  other  controls  that  are  used  in  the  composite 
71:2453:162970:11:12:72:542:679:81:Times:81:Times:specifications in Table 3. Panel A is based on country-level CPIS regressions and Panel B is based on LionShares institution-level 
71:2454:163101:12:11:72:542:667:81:Times:81:Times:regressions. The first five columns of Panel A are regressions for the CPIS sample of emerging market source countries. Columns 
71:2455:163229:11:11:72:542:656:81:Times:81:Times:1-5 show the R2 contributions of the control variables (excluding the fixed effects); the year fixed effects; the source country fixed 
71:2456:163364:11:11:71:542:645:81:Times:81:Times:effects; destination country fixed effects; and, finally, all of these right hand side variables (control variables and all three sets of 
71:2457:163502:11:11:71:543:634:81:Times:81:Times:fixed effects). The fifth column is the same composite specification as Column 6 in Table 3 Panel A. The next five columns in 
71:2458:163628:11:11:71:541:623:81:Times:81:Times:Panel A repeat this exercise using regressions for the CPIS sample of developed market source countries. The tenth column is the 
71:2459:163757:11:12:71:542:612:81:Times:81:Times:same composite specification as Column 12 in Table 3 Panel A. Panel B conducts a similar exercise using LionShares data. The 
71:2460:163882:12:11:71:543:600:81:Times:81:Times:fifth  column  is  the  same  composite  specification  as  Column  6  in  Table  3  Panel  B.  The  tenth  column  is  the  same  composite  
71:2461:164024:11:19:71:243:589:81:Times:81:Times:specification as Column 12 in Table 3 Panel B.
