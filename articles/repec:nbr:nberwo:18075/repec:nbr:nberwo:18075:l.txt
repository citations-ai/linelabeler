2:31:1681:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:The higher education system in the United States is characterized by a large degree of quality heterogeneity,
2:32:1790:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:and there is a growing literature suggesting students attending higher quality universities have better
2:33:1893:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:educational and labor market outcomes. In this paper, we use NLSY97 data combined with the difference
2:34:1994:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:in the timing and strength of the housing boom across cities to examine how short-run home price
2:35:2090:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:growth affects the quality of postsecondary schools chosen by students. Our findings indicate a $10,000
2:36:2193:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:increase in a family’s housing wealth in the four years prior to a student becoming of college-age increases
2:37:2301:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the likelihood she attends a flagship public university relative to a non-flagship public university by
2:38:2404:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.0 percent and decreases the relative probability of attending a community college by 1.6 percent.
2:39:2503:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:These effects are driven by relatively lower and middle-income families. We show that these changes
2:40:2602:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:are due to the effect of housing wealth on where students apply, not on whether they are admitted.
2:41:2700:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:We also find that short-run increases in home prices lead to increases in direct quality measures of
2:42:2800:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the institutions students attend. Finally, for the lower-income sample, we find home price increases
2:43:2900:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:reduce student labor supply and that each $10,000 increase in home prices is associated with a 1.8%
2:44:2999:14:42:72:304:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:increase in the likelihood of completing college.

3:59:3323:35:23:72:554:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The higher education system in the United States is characterized by a large degree of strat-
3:60:3416:23:24:72:554:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ification across sectors in both resources and student outcomes. The labor market returns to
3:61:3508:24:23:72:554:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:graduating from an elite public or private institution are high and have grown substantially
3:62:3600:23:23:72:554:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over time (Brewer, Eide and Ehrenberg, 1999; Black and Smith, 2004, 2006; Hoekstra, 2009;
3:63:3689:23:23:72:554:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Andrews, Li and Lovenheim, 2011).1The higher level of resources at elite public and private
3:64:3780:23:24:71:553:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutions also translate into more favorable student outcomes, including higher completion
3:65:3873:24:23:71:553:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates (Bound, Lovenheim and Turner, 2010) and lower time to degree (Bound, Lovenheim and
3:66:3961:23:23:71:553:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Turner, forthcoming). Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that the type of institution
3:67:4055:23:23:71:553:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which students initially enter the postsecondary education system affects the likelihood of
3:68:4149:23:24:71:225:476:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:graduation and future wages.2
3:69:4178:24:23:86:553:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Given these large returns to college quality, little work has been done examining how students
3:70:4272:23:23:71:553:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make decisions about which college to attend and, in particular, what role household finances
3:71:4365:23:23:71:553:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:play in this decision. There is ample evidence that low-income students are under-represented
3:72:4458:23:24:71:553:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at elite private and state flagship universities (Bowen, Kurzweil and Tobin, 2005; Pallais and
3:73:4552:24:23:71:553:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Turner, 2006 and 2007). Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), previous
3:74:4640:23:23:71:553:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:work has estimated sizable income gradients in the two-year, four-year decision as well as in
3:75:4733:23:23:71:554:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four-year college quality (Belley and Lochner, 2007; Kinsler and Pavan, 2010)3and has shown
3:76:4824:23:24:71:553:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that higher income students attend schools with higher SAT scores (Light and Strayer, 2000).
3:77:4916:24:23:71:553:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There also is evidence that students are highly responsive to college quality differences among
3:78:5011:23:23:71:553:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutions (Long, 2004; Avery and Hoxby, 2004). Though informative of many of the factors
3:79:5102:23:23:71:553:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that influence college choices, there still is a poor understanding of the causal effect of household
3:80:5203:23:15:71:343:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resources on the college quality decisions of students.
3:81:5258:15:13:83:554:182:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:1Daleand Krueger (2002) find no return to attending a higher average SAT university overall but show sizeable impacts for
3:82:5379:13:9:72:554:169:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:students from lower-income families. All of the studies estimating the returns to education quality are subject to identification
3:83:5508:9:10:72:554:160:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:concerns (Hoxby, 2009), but the identification assumptions across studies vary sufficiently that the sum total of the evidence points
3:84:5641:10:9:72:87:150:8:g_d0_f4:6:g_d0_f5:F:strongly to a significant earnings return to college quality.2
3:85:5703:9:10:87:554:141:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:For evidence on the negative effect of beginning college at a two-year school, see Reynolds (2009), Kurlaender and Long (2009),
3:86:5830:10:9:72:554:131:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:and Rouse (1995). Bound, Lovenheim and Turner (2010) also show that even conditional on institutional resources, BA completion
3:87:5956:9:10:72:554:122:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:rates are much lower at community colleges and less selective four-year public schools than at elite public and private institutions.
3:88:6089:10:9:72:554:112:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:Light and Strayer (2000) show similar negative effects on the likelihood of graduating from attending schools lower in the SAT
3:89:6215:9:9:72:554:103:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:score distribution, although they additionally highlight the importance of “match quality” between the quality of the school and
3:90:6343:9:7:72:223:94:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the academic preparation of the student.
3:91:6383:7:12:83:554:87:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:3In contrast to Belley and Lochner (2007), Lovenheim and Reynolds (2011) show less evidence of income gradients in the two-
3:92:6506:12:10:72:554:75:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:year, four-year margin in the NLSY97. Much of this difference can be attributed to the different models used and the decision to
3:93:6634:10:0:72:291:65:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:include or exclude high school graduates from the analysis.
4:94:6694:0:23:86:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Thispaper examines how household resources influence the quality of postsecondary schools
4:95:6783:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which students enroll, focusing specifically on the role of housing wealth because of the central
4:96:6883:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:importance of this form of wealth to the majority of families. For most American families, the
4:97:6977:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:home is the largest single asset, and for many households it is their only substantial asset.
4:98:7070:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For example, in the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, 48% of homeowners had less than
4:99:7155:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:$10,000 in non-housing assets. Among homeowners with AGI less than $75,000, the median
4:100:7241:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-housing wealth amount was $6,300.  Median home equity among these households was
4:101:7325:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:$80,000. In contrast, for households with AGI over $125,000, median non-housing wealth was
4:102:7415:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:$146,600 and median home equity was $293,500. Thus, for the lower and middle class, housing
4:103:7506:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth is an extremely important component of total resources. An additional reason to focus
4:104:7598:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on housing wealth is that there has been substantial variation in home prices in recent years
4:105:7691:24:23:72:415:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we argue generates exogenous variation in household finances.
4:106:7757:23:23:86:553:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use a virtually identical source of variation in home prices as Lovenheim (2011) and
4:107:7844:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lovenheim and Mumford (forthcoming), which exploits differences across cities over time in
4:108:7934:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the size and timing of the housing boom to identify how housing wealth influences postsec-
4:109:8024:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ondary choices. Lovenheim (2011) shows that students who came of college age in areas that
4:110:8114:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experienced recent large home price increases are more likely to go to college, while Lovenheim
4:111:8209:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Mumford show that female homeowners who experience home price growth are more likely
4:112:8297:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to have a child. Although both of these papers exploit the same source of home price variation
4:113:8391:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as used in this analysis, we make several contributions to the existing literature. First, we focus
4:114:8490:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on identifying the impact of housing wealth on the quality of schools students attend (i.e., the

4:116:8681:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the likelihood a student attends a flagship public university, a private university or a two-
4:117:8777:24:23:72:554:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year college, all relative to the likelihood of enrolling in a non-flagship public university. This
4:118:8876:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the first paper to explicitly estimate how family resources affect students’ choices between all
4:119:8975:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the different types of schools available to them, rather than focusing only on the two-year,
4:120:9070:23:24:72:554:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four-year margin or on the extensive margin of college enrollment. Second, both Lovenheim
4:121:9159:24:23:72:554:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2011) and Lovenheim and Mumford (forthcoming) use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
4:122:9244:23:0:72:554:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(PSID). While the PSID has detailed housing wealth data, it does not contain rich information
5:123:9338:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:oncollege enrollment timing or on pre-collegiate academic ability. The current analysis uses
5:124:9430:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the NLSY97, which allows us to examine how sensitive the results in Lovenheim (2011) are to
5:125:9521:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the inclusion of student ability measures as well as to the use of another sample. Third, our use
5:126:9618:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the NLSY97 allows us to dig more deeply into the ways in which housing wealth influences
5:127:9709:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:postsecondary choices and student outcomes. We estimate the effect of home price variation
5:128:9799:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on student application decisions, the delay between high school and college, BA receipt and
5:129:9890:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:student labor supply while enrolled in college. These outcomes provide a more complete picture
5:130:9984:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of how wealth in general and housing wealth in particular affect students’ paths through the
5:131:10076:23:23:72:186:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:postsecondary system.
5:132:10097:23:23:86:553:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the majority of previous work examining college choices and family resources es-
5:133:10186:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:timates conditional income gradients (e.g., Kinsler and Pavan, 2010). Instead, we use quasi-
5:134:10278:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experimental variation in home prices generated by the most recent housing boom to identify
5:135:10369:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of household wealth on college choice. Our approach allows one to assess the va-
5:136:10460:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lidity of the assumption made in the income gradient literature that income is conditionally
5:137:10552:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous. Furthermore, how housing wealth variation influences the intensive margin of col-
5:138:10644:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lege choice is of high policy interest in its own right given the evidence suggesting large labor
5:139:10741:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market and educational returns to attending different types of colleges combined with the large
5:140:10836:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fluctuations in home prices in the United States over the past decade. The decision of where to
5:141:10931:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:go to college may be at least as important for future labor market outcomes as is the decision
5:142:11025:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of whether to attend college,4so identifying how family resources in general and housing wealth
5:143:11120:23:23:72:498:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in particular affect college choices on the intensive margin is of central importance.
5:144:11206:23:23:86:553:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We quantify the effect of individual-level home price growth that is driven by MSA-level home
5:145:11299:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price changes on college choice using restricted-use NLSY97 data that provide detailed infor-
5:146:11392:24:23:72:554:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mation on post-secondary institutions attended and the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
5:147:11482:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which the student’s family lived in 1997 as well as AFQT scores and student demographic
5:148:11572:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics. We estimate multinomial logit models among homeowners of the likelihood of
5:149:11663:23:24:72:554:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attending a flagship state university, a private university or a community college, with non-
5:150:11756:24:15:72:554:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship public four-year schools as the omitted category, as a function of home price growth in
5:151:11852:15:12:83:554:77:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:4For example, both Hoekstra (2009) and Brewer, Eide and Ehrenberg (1999) find earnings returns from attending more elite
5:152:11972:12:10:72:554:65:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:public universities on the order of 25%. Kane and Rouse (1995) also show substantial earnings penalties of attending a community
5:153:12100:10:0:72:208:55:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:college relative to a four-year school.
6:154:12140:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thefour years prior to a student turning 18. We also control for a detailed set of student back-
6:155:12236:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ground characteristics that include AFQT scores and state fixed effects. Our empirical strategy
6:156:12331:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is to compare the college choices of students within states or cities who come of college age in
6:157:12427:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different years and thus who experience housing price increases of varying magnitudes when
6:158:12517:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they are in high school. The main identifying assumptions are that housing price changes at
6:159:12608:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the state or MSA level as well as initial home price and homeownership status are conditionally
6:160:12703:23:24:72:534:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous. We present detailed evidence that our results are robust to these assumptions.
6:161:12792:24:23:86:553:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find that home price variation affects college quality. A $10,000 increase in home prices
6:162:12884:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the four years prior to turning 18 increases the relative probability of attending a public
6:163:12978:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship by 0.0019 percentage points, or 2.0 percent, and decreases the probability of attending
6:164:13074:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a community college by 0.0059 percentage points, or 1.6 percent. We split our sample into
6:165:13163:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three income groups and find that the effect of short-run housing wealth changes on enrollment
6:166:13257:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decisions is largest for students from lower and middle-class households earning less than $75,000
6:167:13355:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per year. Similar to Lovenheim (2011), we also find that home price changes affect the extensive
6:168:13451:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:margin of college enrollment, and we show these results are robust to including controls for pre-
6:169:13548:24:23:72:209:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collegiate academic ability.
6:170:13576:23:23:86:553:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The changes in college sector choices we find suggest that students are reacting to home price
6:171:13670:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes by altering application and enrollment decisions. Using application data, we show that
6:172:13764:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:home price changes lead to increases in the total number of applications and to applications to
6:173:13859:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both flagship and non-flagship four-year schools. However, conditional on applying, there is no
6:174:13954:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strong relationship between home price changes and admission, which suggests that the college
6:175:14047:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector effects we estimate are coming from changes in student behavior, not from changes in
6:176:14138:23:24:72:245:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutional admissions decisions.
6:177:14173:24:23:86:553:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The effect of home price changes on selection across sectors leads to increases in observable
6:178:14266:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutional quality and resources for affected students.  These effects also are largest for
6:179:14360:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families with household income below $75,000 per year.  Finally, we present evidence that
6:180:14449:23:24:72:554:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:short-run housing price growth in the time period prior to children being of college age is
6:181:14540:24:23:72:554:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positively associated with the likelihood of obtaining a BA for the lowest-income households in
6:182:14635:23:0:72:554:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our sample, increasing BA attainment rates by 1.8% for each $10,000 increase in home prices
7:183:14727:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duringhigh school. We also find student labor supply is negatively affected by home family
7:184:14817:23:23:72:513:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price growth, which together with the school quality effect likely drives the BA result.
7:185:14905:23:24:86:553:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The sum total of the evidence presented in this paper indicates that the quality of colleges
7:186:14997:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students attend is affected by short-run variation in families’ housing wealth.  This finding
7:187:15090:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has important implications given the collapse of the housing market in many areas and the
7:188:15179:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:severe reduction in home price growth in others. To the extent decisions about where to attend
7:189:15273:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:influence the likelihood of graduation, which both we and previous literature present evidence
7:190:15367:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they do, the burst of the housing bubble could have long-run consequences for the national

7:194:15512:31:23:72:554:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The data we use for this analysis come from the restricted-access National Longitudinal Survey
7:195:15606:23:23:72:554:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), which is a nationally-representative survey of children age 12 through
7:196:15700:23:24:72:554:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:18 in 1997. Respondents are interviewed initially in 1997 and then yearly thereafter until 2008,
7:197:15796:24:23:72:299:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which is the most recent follow-up available.
7:198:15841:23:23:86:553:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The NLSY97 data contain detailed family background and student demographic information,
7:199:15928:23:23:72:554:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including parental education levels, family income in 1997, and home value. For mother’s and
7:200:16020:23:24:72:554:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:father’s education, we include dummy variables indicating highest level of schooling completed:
7:201:16115:24:23:72:554:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no high school diploma, high school diploma (or GED), some college, and BA or more. One
7:202:16202:23:23:72:554:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the major advantages of the NLSY97 is that respondents were given the Armed Forces
7:203:16287:23:23:72:554:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Qualifying Test (AFQT) in 1997, which is a comprehensive test of cognitive skills. Together
7:204:16378:23:24:72:554:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with controls for parental education and income, these test scores allow us to control for the
7:205:16472:24:23:72:554:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ability level of students, which is correlated with college choices and potentially with housing
7:206:16568:23:23:72:139:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price growth.
7:207:16581:23:23:86:553:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The NLSY97 data include a significant amount of item non-response. For example, 10.8%
7:208:16666:23:24:72:554:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the sample do not have a valid father’s education level, approximately 16.6% of the sample
7:209:16759:24:23:72:554:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is missing family income information and 23% of respondents do not have valid AFQT scores.
7:210:16849:23:0:72:554:48:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Many previous analyses drop respondents without valid income and AFQT scores (e.g., Belley
8:211:16940:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:andLochner, 2007; Cameron and Taber, 2004; Carneiro and Heckman, 2002). However, if such
8:212:17028:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information is not missing at random conditional on the observables in the model, dropping
8:213:17118:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these observations can bias the estimates. Thus, we use the multiple imputation by chained
8:214:17208:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation (MICE) method developed by Van Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook (1999).5The cred-
8:215:17294:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ibility of multiple imputation with the NLSY97 is enhanced by the large volume of observable
8:216:17386:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics with which to impute missing values. In addition to all of the covariates used
8:217:17480:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our empirical analysis, we use MSA-level means of all covariates, college type attended,
8:218:17571:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high school GPA, the PIAT math exam scores and household income when students are 17.
8:219:17656:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Another value of multiple imputation is that no respondents are dropped due to item non-
8:220:17744:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response, which yields a larger sample size for our analysis. Estimates that drop those with
8:221:17836:23:24:72:466:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:missing income and AFQT scores are similar and are available upon request.
8:222:17910:24:23:86:553:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We further limit our sample to those who are under 18 in 1997 and who attend college within
8:223:18001:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two years of high school graduation.6In the NLSY97, 8.7% of respondents who attend college

8:225:18180:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:college within two years of high school graduation is so we can more directly link home price
8:226:18273:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes while respondents are in high school to their subsequent college choices. Given the
8:227:18364:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small number of students who delay attendance beyond two years, this restriction has little
8:228:18455:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect on our results and conclusions.  Finally, throughout most of this analysis, we restrict
8:229:18549:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our data to include only the 78.5% of our sample who are homeowners in 1997. We include
8:230:18636:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this restriction because homeowners and renters are likely to have different responses to home
8:231:18730:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price increases, with renters becoming worse off when local home prices rise. Our estimates
8:232:18821:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are virtually identical when we include renters, which is supported by the evidence we present
8:233:18915:23:40:72:517:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below that renters do not alter their college choices in response to home price changes.
8:234:19003:40:31:72:257:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.2  Measuring Housing Prices
8:235:19032:31:24:72:554:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The main variable of interest in this analysis is the four-year home price change of students’
8:236:19126:24:15:72:554:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families prior to the student turning 18. We focus on this variable rather than on home price
8:237:19219:15:12:83:554:99:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:5We use the STATA module “ICE” (Royston, 2004) to implement the MICE procedure. MICE is an iterative imputation method,
8:238:19338:12:10:72:554:87:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:whereby missing values of all variables are first randomly filled in using the posterior distribution. Then, a cycle of regressions
8:239:19469:10:9:72:554:77:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:is estimated using each variable with missing responses as a dependent variable and replacing the previously missing information
8:240:19597:9:9:72:554:68:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:with the predicted values. A cycle of ten was used for each imputation, and the imputation was done five separate times, with the
8:241:19726:9:7:72:409:59:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:reported results representing averages over the results estimated on each imputed data set.
8:242:19817:7:0:83:509:52:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:A:6Less than half a percent of the sample is 18 in 1997, so this restriction has negligible consequences for our results.
9:243:19937:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:levels because the price of a home can bear little relationship to the amount of equity a family
9:244:20033:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has in a home.7Since all home price changes are capitalized into equity, and because we lack
9:245:20125:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:direct home equity measures, we examine the four-year change in home prices during the high
9:246:20216:24:23:72:137:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:school years.
9:247:20229:23:23:86:553:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the NLSY97, housing information only is collected in 1997. We take the self-reported 1997
9:248:20321:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:home prices reported by the parents and calculate predicted home values in each calendar year
9:249:20414:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using the MSA-level Conventional Mortgage Housing Price Index (CMHPI). The CMHPI is a
9:250:20499:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:home price index created from all mortgages securitized by Fannie-Mae and Freddie-Mac for
9:251:20588:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:repeat-sale, single family homes. It is a widely used home price index in the housing literature
9:252:20684:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and provides a consistent measure of the MSA-average home price change in each year. Since
9:253:20774:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:migration tends to occur across cities with similar home price growth rates (Sinai and Souleles,
9:254:20870:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2009), the 1997 MSA-level home price growth is likely to be an accurate measure of the actual
9:255:20963:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:city-level home price growth experienced by each household. The home price of homeowneri

9:261:21206:23:23:72:554:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a given year.  Instead, all growth rate variation is coming from differential home price
9:262:21297:23:24:72:554:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes across MSAs and within MSAs over time. We calculate the four-year change in home
9:263:21385:24:23:72:554:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price for each homeowner in 1997 asˆPimt-ˆPimt-4. Because our home price change measure
9:264:21472:23:23:72:554:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:requires information about aggregate MSA-level home prices, we additionally limit the sample
9:265:21564:23:15:72:553:222:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:to respondents who live in an identified MSA. Our final analysis sample contains 2,801 students.8
9:266:21661:15:13:83:554:207:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:7BothLovenheim (2011) and Lovenheim and Mumford (forthcoming) find little behavioral response to home price levels but
9:267:21779:13:9:72:554:194:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:show that families respond to variation in home price changes. This finding is consistent with the importance of measuring housing
9:268:21909:9:7:72:198:185:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:wealth, not simply housing prices.
9:269:21943:7:12:83:554:178:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:8An alternative method of measuring home price changes would be to use the within-MSA percentage change in home prices
9:270:22061:12:9:72:554:166:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:only. Measuring home price growth in this way leads to similar results (see Appendix Table A-1), but we favor the measure given
9:271:22188:9:10:72:554:157:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:by equation (1) because it relates postsecondary decisions to financial gains rather than to percentage gains in home prices. Using
9:272:22319:10:9:72:554:147:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:dollar values also is more common in the literature on home prices and education decisions (e.g., Lovenheim, 2011; Dynarski, 2003),
9:273:22450:9:0:72:526:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:so this measure of housing wealth change allows our estimates to be more directly comparable to those in existing studies.

10:275:22621:31:23:72:554:689:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We categorize students into four mutually exclusive sectors of higher education: non-flagship
10:276:22714:23:23:72:554:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:public four-year schools, flagship public universities, private four-year institutions and commu-
10:277:22811:23:24:72:554:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nity colleges. Each student’s assignment is not a function of her state of residence in 1997, as
10:278:22907:24:23:72:554:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we do not distinguish between out-of-state and in-state attendees. However, we also investigate
10:279:23002:23:23:72:554:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether housing wealth changes affect the likelihood of out-of-state college attendance.9As-
10:280:23094:23:23:72:554:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:signment to institution type is based on the UNITID code of the first postsecondary institution
10:281:23189:23:24:72:554:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at which a student enrolled after high school. Only college attendees therefore are included
10:282:23281:24:23:72:554:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our main sample. This restriction could bias our estimates, as college enrollment is respon-
10:283:23376:23:23:72:554:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sive to housing wealth changes (Lovenheim, 2011). We show evidence below that including
10:284:23463:23:23:72:554:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-attendees has little effect on our estimates, so we exclude non-attenders from our main
10:285:23554:23:24:72:554:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis in order to have a consistent sample for the multinomial logit analysis and for the
10:286:23646:24:23:72:554:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis that uses observed college quality measures (for which there is no information among

10:288:23756:23:23:86:553:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For each initial institution attended by a respondent, we merge in a set of mean institutional
10:289:23850:23:24:72:554:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality characteristics using Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data
10:290:23939:24:23:72:554:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from 1997 through 2003, corresponding to the years in which respondents turn 18 in our sample.
10:291:24033:23:23:72:554:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We construct averages over time of all measures within institutions in order to guard against
10:292:24126:23:23:72:554:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the possibility that institutional quality responds to home price variation. While there is no
10:293:24220:23:24:72:554:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence in the data that this is so, we also present estimates using lagged quality measures
10:294:24313:24:23:72:407:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that demonstrate any such relationship is not driving our results.
10:295:24379:23:23:86:553:224:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:A:The quality measures we use are 25thand 75thpercentile of institutional SAT scores,11
10:296:24464:23:15:71:553:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:faculty-student ratios, total expenditures per student, instructional expenditures per student,
10:297:24559:15:13:83:554:186:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:9Previouswork has demonstrated that there are capacity constraints at flagship institutions – when demand increases, students
10:298:24684:13:9:72:554:173:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:flow into less selective universities and community colleges (Bound and Turner, 2007). To the extent that home price increases
10:299:24810:9:10:72:554:164:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:generate demand increases, total enrollment at less selective schools should increase by more than at flagship universities. However,
10:300:24943:10:9:72:554:154:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the composition of flagship students may change to favor those with more recent housing wealth growth. Such capacity constraints
10:301:25071:9:9:72:554:145:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:should mute somewhat any effect of home price growth on flagship enrollment, because these schools are less likely to increase total
10:302:25203:9:7:72:494:136:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:enrollment slots when demand increases. We find effects on the flagship margin despite such capacity constraints.
10:303:25316:7:12:79:554:129:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:10In three states, there is not a designated flagship university. In California, the University of California system is considered a
10:304:25448:12:10:72:554:117:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:flagship system, but we assign University of California at Berkeley and University of California at Los Angeles as the two flagship
10:305:25579:10:9:72:554:107:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:universities in the state. In Texas, there are two flagship universities – University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M – College
10:306:25707:9:10:72:554:98:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:Station. Finally, in New York, we assign the statutory colleges of Cornell University as the flagships as well as State University of
10:307:25840:10:7:72:547:88:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:New York at Binghamton, the latter because it has the highest average SAT score and graduation rate of all the SUNY schools.
10:308:25964:7:12:79:554:81:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:11For those schools only supplying ACT scores, ACT scores were converted to SAT equivalents using the top-value of the SAT

11:311:26235:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:legiate resources and quality because no one variable constitutes an accurate proxy for quality
11:312:26330:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Black and Smith, 2006). Table 1 presents means of these measures by our four higher educa-
11:313:26421:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion sectors, which are undergraduate-enrollment weighted averages across all higher education
11:314:26515:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutions in the IPEDS surveys. Focusing on the first two columns, there is a clear qual-
11:315:26607:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ity difference between flagship public schools and non-flagship public four-year schools. The
11:316:26700:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship institutions have higher SAT scores, with a 71 point difference in the 75thpercentile.
11:317:26795:24:23:71:553:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Faculty-student ratios are 54% higher in the flagship public schools, and both total and in-
11:318:26887:23:23:71:553:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structional expenditures per student are substantially larger as well. These large resource and
11:319:26982:23:23:71:553:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality differences across schools, even within the public four-year sector, are consistent with
11:320:27078:23:24:71:553:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the high returns to attending a flagship public university found in previous studies (Hoekstra,

11:322:27262:23:23:71:336:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students select across different types of institutions.
11:323:27317:23:23:86:553:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Critically, the flagship public institutions also are more expensive to attend, with an in-state
11:324:27413:23:24:71:553:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tuition difference of $1,210 per year and an out-of-state tuition difference of $4,104 per year.
11:325:27509:24:23:71:553:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Although this calculation omits financial aid, these means suggest students must pay more to
11:326:27601:23:23:71:488:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:access the higher quality and resources available at the state’s flagship university.
11:327:27686:23:23:86:553:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There also are substantive differences across public and private schools as well as between
11:328:27777:23:24:71:553:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two- and four-year schools that are evident in Table 1. Due to sample size limitations, we do
11:329:27870:24:23:71:553:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not split the private sector by selectivity. For the direct resource measures, the four-year private
11:330:27970:23:23:71:553:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schools on average are very similar to the public schools. However, they are significantly more

11:332:28157:23:24:71:553:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by a lower cost of attendance than the four-year sector. Focusing on the public sector, moving

11:334:28347:23:23:71:553:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the relevant choice set for most students, entails significant increases in per-student resources
11:335:28444:23:15:71:474:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and institutional quality while raising attendance costs through higher tuition.

12:341:28878:24:23:72:554:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households are those with real income above $125,000.13Although the low-income group ex-
12:342:28966:23:23:72:554:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tends high up into the income distribution, it outlines the group of middle-class students whose
12:343:29062:23:23:72:554:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families likely qualify for little aid and thus for whom differences in college costs probably are
12:344:29160:23:24:72:164:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the most relevant.
12:345:29178:24:23:86:553:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The mean four-year home price change among homeowners in the sample is $53,310, with
12:346:29262:23:23:72:554:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a standard deviation larger than the mean. These tabulations underscore the large variation
12:347:29353:23:23:72:554:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in home prices that occurred over this time period.  While these increases were largest for
12:348:29444:23:24:72:554:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the highest income households, both lower and middle income homeowners experienced large
12:349:29532:24:23:72:442:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative home price increases of about $33,890 and $49,890, respectively.
12:350:29605:23:23:86:553:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 also shows the distribution of attendance patterns across the four sectors of higher
12:351:29697:23:23:72:554:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:education we examine.  Within the four-year sector, public non-flagship schools enroll the
12:352:29787:23:24:72:554:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:largest proportion of students, followed by the private sector and then the flagship publics. For
12:353:29884:24:23:72:554:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, while 33.0% of attendees enroll in a non-flagship public school, only 9.4% enroll in a
12:354:29979:23:23:72:554:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship. The largest single sector is comprised of community colleges, at 37.8%. Enrollment
12:355:30071:23:23:72:554:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trends across the income distribution largely conform to expectations, with community college
12:356:30164:23:24:72:554:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment declining with family income and flagship enrollment rising. For the lowest income
12:357:30257:24:23:72:554:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample, flagship enrollment is 4.7%, while for the highest income sample it is 18.7%, a fourfold
12:358:30353:23:23:72:554:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase across groups. The income differences in college selection patterns lead to significant
12:359:30449:23:23:72:554:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disparities in institutional quality and resource measures, which also are shown in Table 2.
12:360:30541:23:24:72:554:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Some of these differences likely are due to the positive correlations among family income,
12:361:30631:24:23:72:554:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:AFQT scores, parental education and admission to higher-quality schools, but they are at least
12:362:30725:23:15:72:502:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggestive of a role for family resources in affecting where students enroll in college.

13:364:30900:0:35:72:262:720:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3Empirical Methodology
13:365:30922:35:23:72:554:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A straightforward human capital model predicts that students will enroll in the school that
13:366:31013:23:24:72:554:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:maximizes their net rate of return. With perfect access to credit, changes in family resources
13:367:31107:24:23:72:554:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should not affect this decision – students are able to borrow at their internal rate of return to the
13:368:31208:23:23:72:554:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment. However, because one cannot collateralize human capital, it may not be possible
13:369:31299:23:23:72:554:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to borrow at one’s rate of return, which creates the possibility for a binding credit constraint
13:370:31395:23:24:72:554:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to affect college choice. Changes to parental resources through changes in home values thus
13:371:31486:24:23:72:554:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:could impact the types of schools students choose to attend. If there is consumption value to
13:372:31579:23:23:72:554:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schooling, and in particular to college quality, then home price changes also can influence college
13:373:31678:23:23:72:554:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment through an income effect, regardless of whether there are liquidity constraints. The
13:374:31773:23:24:72:554:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goal of this analysis is to identify the causal effect of short-run home price changes on students’
13:375:31872:24:23:72:554:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:college enrollment decisions. This is an important policy parameter independent of whether it
13:376:31965:23:23:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is driven by liquidity constraints or an income effect, especially given recent large fluctuations
13:377:32063:23:23:72:188:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the housing market.
13:378:32085:23:24:86:553:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The time period of our analysis, which uses home price variation over the period 1993
13:379:32170:24:23:72:554:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(four years prior to the 17-year-old cohort turning 18) to 2003 (when the 12-year-old cohort
13:380:32262:23:23:72:554:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turns 18), is particularly appropriate to identify the effect of housing wealth on the college
13:381:32356:23:23:72:554:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choices of students because it coincides with a large increase in home prices in many areas.
13:382:32448:23:24:72:554:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Between 1993 and 2003, the CMHPI increased by 121% nationally and did so unevenly across
13:383:32536:24:23:72:554:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cities. Furthermore, housing wealth also became much more liquid over this time period. This
13:384:32628:23:23:72:554:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased liquidity has been well documented by researchers and in the popular press; towards
13:385:32721:23:23:72:554:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the turn of the millennium, it became much easier for families to extract the wealth from their
13:386:32816:23:24:72:554:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:homes using cash out refinances, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit. Home
13:387:32905:24:23:72:554:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equity extractions as a percent of per-capita income rose from 2.16 in 1990 to 11.67 in 2004,
13:388:32998:23:23:72:554:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an increase of over 439 percent (Greenspan and Kennedy, 2005). Thus, if enrollment decisions
13:389:33090:23:23:72:554:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are sensitive to housing wealth fluctuations, it should be most apparent in the time period we

14:401:34013:23:23:71:554:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fixed effects (ψ). Note that because cohorts are defined as of 1997, one can interpret the cohort
14:402:34110:23:24:71:553:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fixed effects as year fixed effects that describe national economic and higher education conditions
14:403:34209:24:23:71:553:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when respondents first become eligible for college enrollment. The state fixed effects control for

14:405:34402:23:23:71:553:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different across states in a way that may be correlated with short-run home price changes.
14:406:34492:23:24:71:553:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ideally, we would control for MSA fixed effects, but with only 2,801 observations, we were not

14:412:35008:23:23:86:553:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Equation (2) is estimated using the four school type categories discussed in Section 2.3.
14:413:35097:23:23:71:553:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For all estimates, the non-flagship public sector is the omitted category.  The parameter of
14:414:35189:23:24:71:553:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest in this analysis is the marginal effect of a $10,000 change in home values over the four

14:416:35381:23:23:71:553:152:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:marginal effect is a function of theβ1estimate for each outcome.15In order to claim thatβ1

14:419:35688:13:9:72:554:101:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:While this is a difficult assumption to test, the primary sampling unit used by the BLS for the survey is the MSA. This sampling
14:420:35816:9:7:72:517:92:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:frame is suggestive that the data are representative of the population in each, once sampling weights have been applied.

14:425:36179:7:10:72:554:60:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:effect is a function not only of the parameter value for that specific option but also of the average of all parameter values for that

15:427:36324:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pricechanges at the MSA level must be conditionally uncorrelated with unobserved factors that
15:428:36417:23:23:72:175:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affect college choice.
15:429:36439:23:24:86:553:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Arguing that home price changes at the MSA-level are exogenous is complicated by the fact
15:430:36528:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that there still is little understanding of why home prices increased dramatically in some areas
15:431:36624:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at specific times. Housing price dynamics are a function of supply and demand forces, most of

15:433:36807:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is coming from average price growth differences within MSAs over time, which combined with
15:434:36897:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the structure of our data and the extensive set of student-level background controls creates

15:439:37327:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the most promising because it is based solely on differences over time within cities in the
15:440:37421:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:size of average home price changes. For example, between 1993 and 2003 home prices in New
15:441:37510:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:York City increased by 90% but only increased by 20% in Rochester and by 19% in Syracuse.
15:442:37599:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Furthermore, the timing of steep home price increases varied across cities. Miami home prices
15:443:37692:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased by 14% between 1993 and 1996, by 17% between 1996 and 2000 and by 45% between
15:444:37779:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2000 and 2003. In San Francisco, however, home prices remained flat between 1993 and 1996,
15:445:37869:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rose by 67% between 1996 and 2000 and increased by 23% between 2000 and 2003. Figure
15:446:37953:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 shows the extent of such variation in our data. The figure presents percentage home price
15:447:38044:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes by MSA from 1994-1998 (the pre-housing boom period) versus from 1999-2003 (the
15:448:38130:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing boom period in our data). The 45 degree line also is shown – points above the line
15:449:38220:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have higher home price growth in the later period than in the earlier period, and vice versa.
15:450:38313:24:23:72:554:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 1 demonstrates that there is a large amount of cross-sectional and within-city over time
15:451:38408:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variation in home price growth rates. While the majority of cities experienced large home price
15:452:38503:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth in the 1999-2003 period, the magnitude of this growth is quite varied and is unrelated
15:453:38596:23:16:72:554:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to growth in the earlier period. Furthermore, there is a non-trivial number of MSAs that had
15:454:38688:16:12:79:554:100:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:16Asof yet, there is no consensus in the literature regarding why the housing boom varied across cities and over time. Gyourko,
15:455:38815:12:9:72:554:88:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:Mayer and Sinai (2006) and Glaeser, Gyourko and Saks (2005) suggest that local supply constraints are an important cause of
15:456:38938:9:10:72:554:79:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:these differences. To the extent that these housing supply constraints are responsible for the temporal and geographic variation in
15:457:39069:10:9:72:554:69:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the housing boom, it indicates home price changes are exogenous because such MSA-level constraints are unlikely to be directly
15:458:39195:9:0:72:221:60:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:related to individual collegiate selection.
16:459:39240:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higherhome price growth in the 1990s than in the early 2000s (such as San Francisco). It is
16:460:39331:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these differential rates of home price changes within MSAs over time as well as across MSAs in
16:461:39425:23:24:72:368:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each year that our identification strategy seeks to exploit.
16:462:39485:24:23:86:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using only within-city variation in home price changes over time,β1would be identified
16:463:39571:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:solely off of the fact that in our data different age cohorts within each city come of college age
16:464:39669:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at different times and thus are exposed to different home price changes. Controlling for the
16:465:39761:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:city in which one lives and the timing of coming of college age, any endogenous selection must
16:466:39855:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be based on families with higher unobserved preferences for or access to higher quality schools
16:467:39950:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sorting into MSAs pre-1997 that will have the highest housing price growth when their children
16:468:40044:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are in high school. Recall that because we are able to control for strong measures of student
16:469:40137:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:academic ability, such as AFQT scores and parental education, any such selection would have
16:470:40228:24:23:72:233:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be residual to these controls.
16:471:40261:23:23:86:553:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The variation due to the first two sources of home price variation could be more problematic.
16:472:40354:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, 1997 home price levels could be proxying for an unobserved component of ability
16:473:40448:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or for permanent income.  However, in Section 4.5 and in Appendix Table A-1, we present
16:474:40535:24:23:72:453:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence that neither source of variation appears to be driving the results.
16:475:40611:23:23:86:553:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The structure of the data also allows us to guard against the main threats to identification
16:476:40703:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from potential endogeneity of home price changes. First, because each respondent’s location
16:477:40794:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is fixed as of 1997, no endogenous moving occurs in our sample. Combined with the location
16:478:40884:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fixed effects, this restriction allows us to control for any fixed differences across households
16:479:40980:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in college choice and home price changes that are a function of household location. Second,
16:480:41071:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because homeownership status is fixed throughout our sample, families cannot endogenously
16:481:41160:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:switch in and out of home ownership based on local market forces that may be related to college
16:482:41255:24:23:72:554:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choice. However, it is possible that fixed homeownership status is endogenous. Home ownership
16:483:41348:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates for our sample are very high, at 79%. The proportion of the sample potentially affected
16:484:41441:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by endogenous home ownership thus is small. Furthermore, for homeowner endogeneity to be
16:485:41529:23:24:72:554:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:driving our results it would have to be the case that families with higher unobserved likelihood
16:486:41625:24:23:72:554:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of attending a higher quality school are more likely to own a home in 1997 in the MSAs in
16:487:41714:23:0:72:420:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which home prices will rise more when their kids are in high school.
17:488:41784:0:23:86:553:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Therichness of our data combined with the source of housing price variation makes it
17:489:41868:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unlikely that our results are plagued by selection of students with higher unobserved ability
17:490:41961:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into areas that have higher home price growth when they are in high school. However, any
17:491:42049:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factor affecting both home price growth and expected returns to different college types could
17:492:42142:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bias our estimates. For example, high-skilled labor demand shocks could both increase home
17:493:42232:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices and increase the returns to college quality.  The existence of such shocks is unlikely
17:494:42325:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since there was a negative relationship between MSA-level home price changes and real income
17:495:42417:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per capita during the housing boom (Mian and Sufi, 2010). However, in order to address this
17:496:42508:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential source of bias, we control for real income per capita and the unemployment rate at the
17:497:42604:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:MSA-by-cohort level. We also control for the state-by-cohort mean of average college graduate
17:498:42697:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages relative to both high school wages and associate’s degree wages, calculated from CPS
17:499:42787:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Outgoing Rotation Group data.17These wage ratios control for the possibility of high-skilled
17:500:42879:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor demand shocks that likely impact individuals’ college enrollment decisions and could be
17:501:42972:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with home price growth. We only control for these shocks at the state-level, which
17:502:43065:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is problematic if the relevant variation is within-state. However, high-skilled labor demand is
17:503:43160:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not highly localized within states (Bound, Groen, Kezdi and Turner, 2004). Insofar as local
17:504:43251:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand shock affects all students in the state roughly equally, within-state changes will not
17:505:43344:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bias our estimates. Finally, we control for the number of schools of each type within each MSA
17:506:43438:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because the presence of universities may drive housing price growth, and students who live
17:507:43528:24:23:72:417:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closer to universities are more likely to attend college (Card, 1995).
17:508:43598:23:23:86:553:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Because higher education sector is an incomplete measure of college quality, we also estimate
17:509:43691:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:OLS models that examine the relationship between housing wealth and the direct resource and
17:510:43782:23:40:72:478:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:school quality measures students experience at their first postsecondary school:

17:513:43999:15:13:79:554:114:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:17We construct the ratio of hourly wages of 25-55 year olds with a bachelor’s degree (BA) to the hourly wages of 25-55 year olds
17:514:44127:13:9:72:554:101:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:with an associate’s degree (AA) in the state. We construct a similar wage ratio for those with a BA compared to those whose
17:515:44250:9:10:72:554:92:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:highest level of educational attainment is a high school diploma. We also control for real need-based aid per student provided by
17:516:44379:10:9:72:554:82:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the state, calculated from National Association of State Student Aid Providers (NASSGAP) surveys. All state and MSA variables
17:517:44504:9:9:72:554:73:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:are measured as of when each respondent is 18 years old. These variables all vary at the state or MSA by cohort level, where each
17:518:44633:9:0:72:235:64:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:cohort is defined by respondent age in 1997.

18:521:44865:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes before they turn 18 due to the differential timing and strength of the housing boom
18:522:44956:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across cities. This model is identified by comparing college choices within cities among students
18:523:45053:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who were different ages in 1997 and thus who experienced different home price variation when
18:524:45145:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they were 14 through 18 years old. The identifying assumptions underlying identification of
18:525:45236:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:β1in equation (3) are similar to those in equation (2), but we have removed the variation
18:526:45325:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across MSAs within states. Now, any selection on unobservables would have to be occurring
18:527:45414:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by families with children of different ages who have unobserved characteristics that make them
18:528:45508:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to go to a higher quality university selecting into MSAs prior to 1997 that will have
18:529:45605:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher home price growth rates during the child’s high school years. While it is not possible to
18:530:45701:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:test for such selection with our data, given the richness of the characteristics we observe about
18:531:45798:23:48:72:303:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students we believe such selection is unlikely.

18:546:47000:23:0:86:553:48:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Given the substantial variation in home prices over the past decade, these marginal effects
19:547:47093:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implylarge changes in college selection. The average homeowner in our sample experienced a
19:548:47183:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four-year home price increase of $53,310, which leads to a 10.7% increase in the probability of
19:549:47278:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attending a state flagship university and a decrease in the likelihood of attending a community
19:550:47373:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:college of 8.5%. These average effects mask a significant change across cohorts: the average
19:551:47465:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four-year home price increase was $72,621 for the sample of 12-year-olds in 1997.  For this
19:552:47556:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cohort, home price changes increased attendance at flagship universities by 14.5% and decreased
19:553:47651:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:community college attendance by 11.6%. The marginal effects for housing price growth in Table

19:555:47842:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:public sector, which has important implications given the recent large declines in home prices
19:556:47936:23:23:72:222:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in many areas of the country.
19:557:47965:23:24:86:553:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find no effect of home price changes on selection into private universities. This result
19:558:48056:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:most likely is due to the fact that private universities are more likely to “tax” home equity
19:559:48149:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the purposes of financial aid and that they are considerably more expensive than public
19:560:48240:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:universities.18Most students need to access additional aid to finance private university atten-
19:561:48335:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dance, even when their parent’s home gains in value. Table 3 thus indicates that housing wealth
19:562:48430:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes affect sorting within the public sectors of higher education, not across the public and
19:563:48525:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:private sectors. This finding reinforces the importance of examining how family resources affect
19:564:48621:23:23:72:495:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:college selection within the public sector, which previous work largely has ignored.
19:565:48705:23:24:86:553:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In our characterization of school sectors, we did not distinguish between in-state and out-
19:566:48796:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of-state enrollment. Some students may decide to attend a public or private university outside
19:567:48890:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their home state, which could increase institutional quality and/or match quality but would
19:568:48981:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entail higher attendance costs.  Using a dummy variable for out-of-state attendance as the
19:569:49071:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dependent variable in equation (2), we estimate that a $10,000 increase in home prices while in
19:570:49166:24:23:72:554:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high school increases the likelihood of leaving one’s home state for college by 0.0035 percentage
19:571:49263:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points, or 2.0%. This result provides further evidence that housing wealth increases lead to the
19:572:49359:23:23:72:304:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purchase of more expensive higher education.
19:573:49403:23:24:86:553:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The average effects in Table 3 may mask heterogeneity across the income distribution in the
19:574:49494:24:15:72:554:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response of college choice to family resources, particularly if credit constraints play a role in
19:575:49591:15:12:79:554:77:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:18In1992, the federal government exempted home equity from federal financial aid calculations. See Dynarski (2003) for more
19:576:49714:12:10:72:554:65:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:details on this change. Institutions still can include family housing wealth as a part of institutional support, and although systematic
19:577:49850:10:9:72:554:55:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:data on which institutions engage in this practice are unavailable, conversations with financial aid officers at various universities
19:578:49983:9:0:72:462:46:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:suggest private universities are more likely to account for home equity when calculating institutional aid.
20:579:50092:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drivingthese results. A potential problem with examining heterogeneity by household income
20:580:50182:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that the MSA average home price changes we use may not equal the home price changes
20:581:50268:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experienced by different income groups within MSA. However, using the Panel Study of In-
20:582:50356:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:come Dynamics (PSID), we found little evidence that households with different income levels
20:583:50447:23:23:72:388:627:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:experienced different home price growth rates within MSAs.19
20:584:50507:23:23:86:553:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To examine differences in the effect of home prices by family income, we estimate a modified
20:585:50599:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:version of equation (2) in which we interact home price changes with income group indicators:
20:586:50692:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less than $75,000 (low income), $75,000 to $125,000 (middle income) and greater than $125,000
20:587:50785:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(high income). Table 4 shows these estimates, which come from one multinomial logit regression.
20:588:50880:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The results indicate that most of the estimated effect of home price changes in Table 3 is coming
20:589:50977:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from lower-income households. The probability a student attends a public flagship increases by
20:590:51071:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.0039 percentage points, or 8.3%, for every $10,000 four-year home price increase for families
20:591:51166:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with income under $75,000. Families earning between $75,000 and $125,000 also are more likely
20:592:51259:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to send their child to a flagship university, although the marginal effect is smaller at 0.0032
20:593:51354:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points, or 3.9%. We find a small and statistically insignificant effect of home price
20:594:51450:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth on flagship attendance among families with incomes over $125,000, and the low and high
20:595:51543:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income estimates are statistically distinguishable from each other at approximately the 3% level.
20:596:51640:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It is only among lower-income families that community college attendance is influenced by home
20:597:51734:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price changes. The estimated marginal effect is large, however, suggesting a $10,000 increase in
20:598:51830:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four-year home price growth leads to a 0.0180 percentage point, or 3.8%, decline in community
20:599:51923:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:college enrollment.  This estimate is statistically distinguishable from the other two income
20:600:52016:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:groups at the 1% level. Even for the private sector, the marginal effect is consistent with a
20:601:52109:23:24:72:543:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive impact of home prices on private school enrollment, but it is imprecisely estimated.
20:602:52202:24:23:86:553:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Multiplying these marginal effects by the average four-year home price change for the lower-
20:603:52294:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income sample of $33,890 (see Table 2) yields an average relative increase in the likelihood of
20:604:52389:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship enrollment of 28.1% and an average relative decrease in the likelihood of community
20:605:52481:23:16:72:554:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:college enrollment of 12.9%. Among twelve-year-olds in 1997, the average home price increase
20:606:52573:16:12:79:554:100:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:19Inparticular, we used the 2001, 2003 and 2005 samples and focused on households with children age 18 or 19. We regressed
20:607:52695:12:9:72:554:88:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the four-year percentage home price change on income group dummies and MSA fixed effects, using the same income groups as
20:608:52816:9:10:72:554:79:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:in the analysis below. The coefficient on the middle-income dummy variable is -0.051(0.049) and is -0.071(0.055) for the highest-
20:609:52945:10:9:72:554:69:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:income dummy. Thus, the lower-income groups experienced slightly larger percentage changes in home prices within MSA, but the
20:610:53070:9:0:72:311:60:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:differences are small and are not statistically different from zero.
21:611:53140:0:23:72:554:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was $44,622, which leads to a 37.0% increase in flagship enrollment and a 17.0% decrease in
21:612:53231:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:community college enrollment relative to non-flagship public enrollment. Table 4 demonstrates
21:613:53324:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the housing boom caused significant changes among lower and middle income families in
21:614:53414:24:40:72:345:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sectors in which their children enrolled in college.

21:616:53501:31:23:72:554:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Using the PSID, Lovenheim (2011) shows that the type of housing wealth variation we use in

21:618:53690:23:23:72:554:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in housing wealth increases the likelihood of college enrollment by 0.0071 percentage
21:619:53784:23:24:72:554:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points. In Table 5, we conduct a similar analysis using the NLSY97 data. In order to explore the
21:620:53880:24:23:72:554:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:importance of controlling for student academic ability, which is not available in the PSID, we
21:621:53974:23:23:72:554:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate the model both with and without AFQT scores. In column (i), we find each $10,000 in
21:622:54066:23:23:72:554:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing wealth leads to a 0.0092 percentage point increase in college enrollment. This estimate
21:623:54161:23:24:72:554:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is very similar to Lovenheim (2011).20In the next column, we control for AFQT scores and
21:624:54249:24:23:71:553:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the estimate drops to 0.0072. This result is suggestive of a small upward bias from excluding
21:625:54342:23:23:71:553:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pre-collegiate ability measures, but the bias is small and column (ii) still points to a positive
21:626:54439:23:23:71:471:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and statistically significant effect of home price changes on college enrollment.
21:627:54520:23:24:86:553:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In columns (iii) and (iv), we allow the estimates to vary by household income. Similar to
21:628:54609:24:23:71:553:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 4, we find the lower-income sample to be most responsive to home price changes.  A

21:630:54790:23:23:71:553:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of attending college, which is statistically different from the highest income group estimate at
21:631:54886:23:24:71:553:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 1% level in both columns. The estimates change little when AFQT scores are included.
21:632:54974:24:23:71:553:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, these results are smaller than in Lovenheim (2011), who finds a marginal effect of
21:633:55065:23:23:71:553:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.0567 for each $10,000 change in home equity. These differences could be due to differences in
21:634:55160:23:23:71:553:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when income is measured with respect to when students turn 18, differences in the timing of the
21:635:55255:23:24:71:553:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample, differences in the samples themselves, or differences in how housing wealth is measured.
21:636:55351:24:23:71:553:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Despite the fact that the estimates are somewhat smaller for the lower income sample in Table
21:637:55444:23:15:71:553:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:5, they still point to a rather large and statistically significant effect of home price changes on
21:638:55543:15:12:79:554:76:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:20Notethat Lovenheim (2011) estimates instrumental variables models in which four-year home equity changes are used to
21:639:55661:12:10:72:554:64:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:instrument for contemporaneous home equity. We cannot use this method with the NLSY97 data because we do not have information
21:640:55786:10:0:72:337:54:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:on home equity changes. He also includes renters in his baseline model.

22:647:56340:23:23:72:554:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may impact application behavior.  In Table 6, we examine the effects of housing wealth on

22:649:56522:23:24:72:554:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth influences college choices.21In Panel A, we estimate poisson regressions of the number
22:650:56615:24:23:72:554:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of applications at four-year institutions by sector, where the control variables are the same as
22:651:56711:23:23:72:554:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those in equation (2) in addition to MSA fixed effects.22Each column is a separate regression,
22:652:56805:23:23:72:554:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and we find that each $10,000 increase in home prices leads to a 1% increase in applications.
22:653:56898:23:24:72:554:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The effects are larger for non-flagship and flagship applications, at 2.7 and 3.3% respectively.
22:654:56994:24:23:72:554:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Consistent with our findings above, home price changes are uncorrelated with private school
22:655:57085:23:23:72:554:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applications.  The final column in Table 6 shows logit estimates of the effect of home price
22:656:57177:23:23:72:554:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes on the likelihood of applying to a two-year school. Even though two-year attendance
22:657:57268:23:24:72:554:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:falls with home price increases, the likelihood of applying to one does not.  Thus, students
22:658:57360:24:23:72:554:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whose families experience home price increases while in high school submit more applications
22:659:57452:23:23:72:508:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overall and submit more in particular to public four-year schools, including flagships.
22:660:57539:23:23:86:553:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Panel B, we show the relationship between admissions and home price changes. These
22:661:57624:23:24:72:554:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates include the change in applications shown in Panel A, and they are very similar to those
22:662:57721:24:23:72:554:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates. This similarity suggests the admissions effect is being driven by the applications,
22:663:57815:23:23:72:554:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not by the relative likelihood of being admitted conditional on applying. Panel C shows these
22:664:57908:23:23:72:554:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional likelihoods, and while the estimates for flagships and non-flagships are positive,
22:665:58002:23:16:72:554:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they are much smaller than the estimates in Panel A. This is particularly true for the flagship
22:666:58097:16:12:79:554:122:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:21We examine the number of applications in order to see whether the choice set of students expands when parental resources
22:667:58219:12:9:72:554:110:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:increase. Such an expansion would come about if students believe that they will be better able to afford enrollment at a higher
22:668:58346:9:7:72:237:101:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:quality school, which induces them to apply.
22:669:58390:7:12:79:554:94:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:22Applications only are available for the sample of respondents who were 12-14 years old. We cannot exclude renters from the
22:670:58514:12:10:72:554:82:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:application regressions because the sample size is too small to achieve convergence. We include renters, assigning them zeros for
22:671:58643:10:9:72:554:72:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:home price growth, and include a dummy variable for home ownership status. Given that all of our previous estimates are robust
22:672:58769:9:0:72:408:63:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:to including renters in this manner, including renters is unlikely to impact these estimates.
23:673:58864:0:23:72:553:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates,which indicate that family resource changes while in high school affect applications to
23:674:58961:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more elite public institutions that students are qualified to attend. An actual or perceived lack
23:675:59058:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of resources appears to dissuade at least some students from applying to, and thus attending,
23:676:59151:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship state universities. We argue below in Section 4.5 that this result is not being driven
23:677:59246:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by changes in investments during high school or in high school quality. Rather, the evidence
23:678:59338:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points to family resources when students are in high school directly affecting application and
23:679:59432:23:40:72:495:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attendance decisions of students in a manner that affects higher education quality.
23:680:59515:40:31:72:315:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.4  Direct Resource and Quality Effects
23:681:59555:31:24:72:554:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because college sector is an imperfect proxy for college resources and because students may be
23:682:59649:24:23:72:554:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changing their selection behavior within our four sectors when home prices change, we examine
23:683:59742:23:23:72:554:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of housing price changes on direct quality and resource measures in Table 7. In the
23:684:59836:23:23:72:554:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:table, each cell for the full sample results comes from a separate regression of equation (3), and
23:685:59934:23:24:72:427:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the results by income, each row comes from a separate regression.
23:686:60003:24:23:86:553:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The estimates suggest that students attend higher quality and resource institutions when
23:687:60091:23:23:72:554:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their parents’ home value increases over the previous four years. For example, a $10,000 increase
23:688:60188:23:23:72:554:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in four-year home prices increases the 75thpercentile SAT scores of the attending university by
23:689:60283:23:24:72:554:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.80 points, the student-faculty ratio by 0.0003, expenditures per student by $289.92, instruc-
23:690:60378:24:23:72:554:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional expenditures per student by $63.56, and the six-year BA graduation rate of the university
23:691:60474:23:23:72:554:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by 0.001. Although many of these marginal effects are modest, each of these measures is at
23:692:60564:23:23:72:554:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:best a partial proxy for the underlying quality of the institution. Furthermore, when multiplied
23:693:60660:23:24:72:554:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the average changes in home prices shown in Table 2, these marginal effects translate into
23:694:60753:24:23:72:554:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sizeable institutional quality changes experienced by students, which are driven by changing
23:695:60845:23:23:72:554:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment decisions. Table 7 also shows that home price changes have at most a small effect on
23:696:60940:23:23:72:554:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:posted tuition.23Given that most students are likely to receive federal, state and institutional
23:697:61036:23:24:72:548:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aid, however, posted tuition may be a poor measure of the amount actually paid by families.
23:698:61127:24:23:86:553:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The remaining columns in Table 7 present estimates that vary by income group. As with
23:699:61212:23:15:72:554:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the multinomial logit results, the effects are largest for the lowest income group. All estimates
23:700:61309:15:12:79:554:76:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:23We define tuition as posted in-state tuition if a student attends in the state in which she lived in 1997 and as out-of-state
23:701:61436:12:0:72:253:64:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:tuition if the student attends in a different state.
24:702:61490:0:23:72:553:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exceptfor tuition are positive and are statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 or
24:703:61588:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:10% level. Although students from both lower and middle income families attend institutions
24:704:61679:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with higher SAT scores and with higher graduation rates when home prices increase, there
24:705:61767:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is no significant effect among families with income over $125,000 per year. The multinomial
24:706:61858:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logit estimates are suggestive that at least some of these results are being driven by the higher
24:707:61955:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood of both lower and middle income families to send their children to flagship public
24:708:62048:23:40:72:484:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schools that have higher resources when they experience housing price increases.
24:709:62128:40:31:72:215:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.5  Robustness Checks
24:710:62150:31:24:72:554:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Interpreting the estimates in Tables 3-7 as causal relies on several assumptions about the
24:711:62240:24:23:72:554:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogeneity of home price changes that were discussed in Section 3. In this section, we show
24:712:62331:23:23:72:554:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a series of robustness checks in order to assess the sensitivity of our results to many of these
24:713:62427:23:23:72:554:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions. In column (i) of Table 8, we show estimates from equations (2) and (3) using
24:714:62516:23:24:72:554:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only renters.24We assign each renter the 4-year percentage change in the CMHPI for his MSA.
24:715:62607:24:23:72:554:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These regressions are informative because they check whether unobserved factors at the MSA
24:716:62697:23:23:72:554:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level, such as high-skilled labor demand, are affecting both home prices and college selection for
24:717:62795:23:23:72:554:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all residents. Furthermore, these estimates show whether it is appropriate to restrict our main
24:718:62890:23:24:72:554:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis to home owners. Table 8 presents evidence that renters do not alter their school choices
24:719:62987:24:23:72:554:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in response to MSA-level home price changes. In neither panel is any estimate statistically
24:720:63078:23:23:72:554:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different from zero at conventional levels, and the estimates are universally small in magnitude.
24:721:63175:23:23:86:553:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The estimates for renters suggest that our results are not being driven by home price changes
24:722:63268:23:24:72:554:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:influencing K-12 education quality, as such quality changes would be experienced by both renters
24:723:63364:24:23:72:554:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and home owners. In order to explore this issue further, we examine whether four-year home
24:724:63454:23:23:72:554:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price changes while in high school impact the likelihood of attending a private school, the size
24:725:63550:23:23:72:554:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of one’s high school, teacher-student ratios, high school GPA, the number of AP tests taken and
24:726:63645:23:24:72:554:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hours worked while in high school. We also investigated the impact of housing price changes
24:727:63736:24:23:72:554:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the likelihood of high school completion in the full sample. In no case is there a statistically
24:728:63835:23:23:72:554:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or economically significant relationship between home price changes and these variables, which
24:729:63929:23:15:72:554:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests our estimates are not being driven by differential investment in human capital while
24:730:64022:15:0:79:419:53:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:?:24Descriptive statistics by home owner status in 1997 are presented in Appendix Table A-2.
25:731:64114:0:23:72:344:720:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inhigh school. All results are available upon request.
25:732:64168:23:23:86:553:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In column (ii) of Table 8, we control for 1997 home prices.  These estimates distinguish
25:733:64256:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the effects of owning an expensive home and the effect of being exposed to home price
25:734:64349:24:23:72:554:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes based on one’s location and age. The results in both columns are qualitatively and
25:735:64439:23:23:72:554:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quantitatively similar to those in Tables 3 and 7. Overall, the estimates indicate that MSA-level
25:736:64536:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:home price changes are the main driver of our results, which supports many of our identification
25:737:64632:23:24:72:425:581:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:assumptions because this source is the most likely to be exogenous.25
25:738:64701:24:23:86:553:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout much of this analysis, we have excluded non-attenders from the sample in order
25:739:64790:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to make the multinomial logit and the school resource samples the same. However, as shown in
25:740:64882:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 5 and in Lovenheim (2011), the extensive margin also is affected by home price changes.
25:741:64975:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In column (iii), Panel A of Table 8, we include non-attendance as its own category in our
25:742:65064:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multinomial logit model.  The marginal effects are very similar to those in Table 3, which
25:743:65154:23:23:72:472:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests the exclusion of this group is not driving our results and conclusions.
25:744:65234:23:23:86:553:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Furthermore, our categorization of college sectors may be problematic because some non-
25:745:65321:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flagship state universities are of higher quality than some flagship universities in other states.
25:746:65419:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In order to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to the way in which we categorize schools,
25:747:65513:23:23:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:column (iv) of Table 8 shows estimates that use the top 50 public universities according to the
25:748:65608:23:23:72:554:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2005 U.S. News and World Report ranking instead of the state flagship. While the result for
25:749:65699:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:top-50 attendance is less precisely estimated, primarily because we are identifying this effect
25:750:65794:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:off of fewer states and MSAs due to school location differences, the estimates are qualitatively
25:751:65890:23:23:72:350:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and quantitatively the same as our baseline estimates.
25:752:65944:23:23:86:553:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One important distinction between the multinomial logit and direct resource estimates is
25:753:66032:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the latter include MSA fixed effects and the former include state fixed effects. Estimat-

25:760:66722:12:10:72:554:65:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:price growth measure has no effect on college choice when four-year home price growth during high school also is included in the

26:763:66959:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:MSA-level selection in our multinomial logit models, the strong correlation between sector and
26:764:67053:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our resources/quality measures (see Table 1) makes it unlikely that state fixed effects would

26:770:67590:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from 1992-1994. Note that SAT and graduation rate data were not collected in these years.
26:771:67679:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, for the data that overlap, the estimates are very similar to those from Table 7. This
26:772:67773:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similarity is unsurprising given the high correlation between the lagged and contemporaneous
26:773:67865:24:23:72:379:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measures (between 0.8 and 0.97 depending on the variable).
26:774:67923:23:23:86:553:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Tables A-3 and A-4 of the Appendix present additional robustness checks. In Table A-3, we
26:775:68012:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show there there is at most a weak relationship between housing price changes and institutional
26:776:68107:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resources.  Table A-4 presents evidence that state-level home prices growth did not lead to
26:777:68198:24:23:72:554:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases in financial aid. These results, together with with the estimates from Table 8, suggest

26:783:68674:24:23:72:554:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial resources brought about by home price increases, affect students’ postsecondary out-
26:784:68768:23:23:72:554:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comes? In Table 9, we present estimates of the effect of home price changes in the four years

26:787:69046:24:23:72:554:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of family resources on collegiate outcomes, using wealth variation generated by the
26:788:69140:23:15:72:554:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing boom rather than conditional income gradients. Note that because we only observe
26:789:69228:15:12:79:554:76:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:26From a budgeting perspective, this story is unlikely because property taxes are not used to fund four-year schools and only are
26:790:69357:12:0:72:246:64:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:used to fund two-year schools in certain states.

27:792:69499:23:23:72:554:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students eventually obtain a four-year degree.27We show estimates for the full sample in Panel
27:793:69593:23:24:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A and by income groups in Panel B that include state fixed effects in the odd columns and
27:794:69682:24:23:72:271:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:MSA fixed effects in the even columns.
27:795:69720:23:23:86:553:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The estimates in the first two columns show little evidence that housing price increases
27:796:69808:23:23:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affect the length of time between high school and college for either the full sample or across
27:797:69902:23:24:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income groups. In Panel B, a $10,000 home price increase among the lowest income families
27:798:69991:24:23:72:554:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases the likelihood of obtaining a BA by between 0.004 and 0.006 percentage points. Table
27:799:70085:23:23:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2 shows the baseline graduation rate for the lower-income sample is 31.2%, which implies that
27:800:70178:23:23:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the probability of graduating increases by 1.8% for every $10,000 increase in home prices, using
27:801:70274:23:24:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates with MSA fixed effects. Multiplying by the average change in home prices among
27:802:70366:24:23:72:554:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these households leads to a change in BA receipt of 6.2%. This represents a large change in
27:803:70457:23:23:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the BA completion rate of lower-income families over this time period, and we find no effect of
27:804:70552:23:23:72:554:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing wealth on BA completion rates for middle and high income families. Importantly, these
27:805:70645:23:24:72:554:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates are suggestive of potential reductions in the BA attainment rate among lower-income
27:806:70738:24:23:72:380:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families due to the housing market bust that began in 2006.
27:807:70797:23:23:86:553:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As student labor supply has grown markedly in recent years (Scott-Clayton, forthcoming;

27:809:70970:23:24:72:554:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to reduced academic success (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2003; Kalenkoski and Pabilonia,
27:810:71063:24:23:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2010), we next examine the effect of home price changes on student working behavior.  As
27:811:71151:23:23:72:554:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shown in the final two columns of Table 9, while there is little evidence of an overall effect, for
27:812:71250:23:23:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low income students, a $10,000 home price increase while a student is in high school reduces
27:813:71342:23:24:72:554:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average weekly hours worked by between -0.21 and -0.31 hours.  The median lower-income
27:814:71428:24:23:72:554:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:student works 15.9 hours per week in the sample, so these marginal effects are modest relative
27:815:71522:23:23:72:554:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the baseline. However, they do indicate that increased family resources cause a reduction in
27:816:71617:23:23:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:student labor supply for lower-income students, which together with the school quality effects
27:817:71711:23:16:72:432:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:documented above, lead to higher BA attainment rates for this group.
27:818:71779:16:12:79:554:100:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:27Whenwe restrict the sample to students who are over 13 in 1997, our results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar, which
27:819:71908:12:0:72:332:88:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:suggests we are not simply identifying an “on-time” graduation effect.

28:824:72272:23:23:72:554:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This paper uses quasi-experimental evidence from the housing boom to examine whether fam-

28:826:72458:23:24:72:554:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:becoming of college-age due to the fact that they live in a high home price growth city make
28:827:72550:24:23:72:554:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:systematically different decisions about where to send their children to college.  Employing
28:828:72642:23:23:72:554:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:restricted-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), we find
28:829:72731:23:23:72:554:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a $10,000 increase in a family’s housing wealth in the four years prior to a student becom-
28:830:72822:23:24:72:554:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing of college-age increases the likelihood he attends a flagship public university relative to a
28:831:72919:24:23:72:554:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-flagship public university by 2.0% and decreases the relative probability of attending a
28:832:73011:23:23:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:community college by 1.6%. There is no effect of home price growth on selection into private
28:833:73103:23:23:72:554:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:universities, however. By splitting our sample into different income groups, we show these ef-
28:834:73197:23:24:72:554:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fects are driven by relatively low-income families. Similar to Lovenheim (2011), we also show
28:835:73290:24:23:72:554:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that housing prices affect the extensive margin of college enrollment and present evidence that
28:836:73385:23:23:72:554:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing wealth impacts the number and quality of the schools to which students apply. Finally,
28:837:73479:23:23:72:554:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we demonstrate a link between housing price growth and direct resource/quality measures and
28:838:73570:23:24:72:554:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that lower-income students living in homes that appreciate in value while they are in high
28:839:73665:24:23:72:315:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:school are more likely to graduate from college.
28:840:73713:23:23:86:553:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These results have particular importance for current policy as housing prices have fallen
28:841:73802:23:23:72:554:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about 35% in the United States since their peak in 2006.  These declines have been even
28:842:73889:23:24:72:554:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more dramatic in certain metro areas in which the housing bubble was most severe.  Our
28:843:73975:24:23:72:554:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates are suggestive that these home price declines will have an effect on the quality and
28:844:74069:23:23:72:554:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector of postsecondary schools students attend and that the attendance decisions of lower-
28:845:74160:23:23:72:554:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income students will be most affected. To the extent that these changes in attendance decisions
28:846:74255:23:24:72:554:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:translate into declines in graduation and labor market outcomes, the housing bust may have
