3:46:2293:0:37:72:208:721:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:47:2308:37:14:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Residential mortgages are of Örst-order importance for households, for Önancial institutions,
3:48:2401:14:15:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and for macroeconomic stability.  The typical household in a developed economy has one
3:49:2487:15:14:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dominant asset ñ a house ñ and one dominant liability ñ a mortgage.  Mortgages are a
3:50:2571:14:14:72:540:641:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:major fraction of bank assets, despite Önancial innovations that allow banks to securitize
3:51:2661:14:15:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage pools.  And the Önancial crisis that began in 2007 has made it abundantly clear
3:52:2749:15:14:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that problems in mortgage lending have the potential to destabilize the Önancial system and
3:53:2840:14:26:72:139:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the economy.
3:54:2852:26:14:89:540:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Despite their importance, mortgages have traditionally been a specialty topic in Önance,
3:55:2940:14:14:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and most mortgage research has been published in real estate and housing Önance journals,
3:56:3029:14:15:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not general-interest Önance or economics journals. In this paper I argue that to understand
3:57:3120:15:14:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage markets we need a much broader perspective that integrates insights from across
3:58:3208:14:15:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our discipline: not only from Öelds within Önance such as asset pricing, behavioral Önance,
3:59:3299:15:14:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Önancial intermediation, but also from urban economics and macroeconomics. Each of
3:60:3385:14:15:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these Öelds can be compared to the proverbial blind man groping an elephant, accurately
3:61:3472:15:14:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recording one aspect of the phenomenon but unable to perceive the whole.  Here I attempt
3:62:3560:14:25:72:230:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a sketch of the whole elephant.
3:63:3591:25:15:89:540:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is striking variation in mortgage market structure across countries.  An obvious
3:64:3677:15:14:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:question is whether this variation has deep fundamental causes or is the result of historical
3:65:3770:14:15:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accident.  To the extent that not all cross-country di§erences are attributable to di§erent
3:66:3861:15:14:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:circumstances, it may be possible to identify best practices in mortgage markets and transfer
3:67:3954:14:15:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:them from one country to another.  A theme of this paper is that the United States, in
3:68:4040:15:25:72:438:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particular, has much to learn from practices in certain parts of Europe.
3:69:4112:25:14:89:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To set the stage, I graphically summarize key properties of mortgage markets in a range
3:70:4199:14:15:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of developed countries.  Figure 1 plots the ratio of residential mortgage debt to GDP in
3:71:4287:15:14:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2009 against the homeownership rate (the fraction of properties that are owner-occupied in
3:72:4377:14:15:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the most recently available data from each country), for sixteen developed countries studied
3:73:4469:15:14:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by the International Monetary Fund (IMF 2011).  The United States is middle-of-the-road
3:74:4556:14:15:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in both respects.   The lowest homeownership rates are in northern European countries,
3:75:4642:15:14:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particularly Germany whose homeownership rate is only 43%, while the highest rates are
3:76:4728:14:14:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in southern European countries such as Greece, Italy, and Spain with about 80%  home-
3:77:4813:14:15:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ownership. The lowest level of mortgage debt (22% of GDP) is in Italy, while the highest
3:78:4901:15:14:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:levels (above 100%  of GDP) are in Denmark and the Netherlands.  It may at Örst seem
3:79:4985:14:15:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:surprising that homeownership rates are not positively correlated with levels of mortgage
3:80:5074:15:14:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt; this reáects cross-country variation in house prices, patterns of homeownership (with
3:81:5165:14:15:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many southern European homes owned either by foreigners or by locals who own rural
3:82:5247:15:14:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:homes and rent urban apartments), and reliance on family and life-cycle savings to Önance
3:83:5336:14:0:72:154:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:homeownership.
4:84:5351:0:14:89:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Although the US has roughly average levels of homeownership (67%) and mortgage debt
4:85:5434:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(72% of GDP), it is unusual in two other respects.  Figure 2 plots the average number of
4:86:5522:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:years that a mortgage carries a Öxed rate. The lowest values (around 1 year) are in southern
4:87:5614:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and Italy, where adjustable-rate mortgages
4:88:5700:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predominate.   The UK and Ireland similarly rely heavily on adjustable-rate mortgages.
4:89:5786:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The average Öxed-rate period is 5 years in Canada, 7-10 years in Belgium, France, and
4:90:5871:14:15:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Germany, almost 20 years in Denmark, and 27 years in the US reáecting a roughly 90%
4:91:5954:15:14:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market share for 30-year nominal Öxed-rate mortgages. These instruments, which are taken
4:92:6042:14:15:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for granted in the US, are anomalous within the global mortgage system.  The dominance
4:93:6128:15:14:72:540:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of long-term Öxed-rate mortgages in the US is likely the result both of a relatively stable
4:94:6219:14:25:72:407:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ináation history, and of public policy promoting these mortgages.
4:95:6284:25:15:89:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 3 plots an index of government participation in housing Önance, constructed by
4:96:6369:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the IMF (2011), against the homeownership rate. The IMF index combines information on
4:97:6454:14:15:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsidies to home purchases, government funding or guarantees for mortgage loans, prefer-
4:98:6543:15:14:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ential tax treatment for mortgage interest or capital gains on housing, and the existence of a
4:99:6637:14:14:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dominant state-owned mortgage lender.  The Ögure shows that US housing policy is highly
4:100:6724:14:15:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interventionist, more so than any other country illustrated except Singapore. The high value
4:101:6816:15:14:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the government participation index for the US results from subsidies to low and middle
4:102:6905:14:15:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income homebuyers, subsidized mortgage guarantees by the government sponsored entities
4:103:6991:15:14:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(GSEs), and favorable tax treatment of mortgage borrowing and housing capital gains. The
4:104:7079:14:15:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:main stated goal of much US housing policy is to increase the homeownership rate, but
4:105:7164:15:14:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as previously noted the US has only average homeownership, and more generally there is
4:106:7250:14:15:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only a very weak positive cross-country correlation between housing market intervention and
4:107:7341:15:25:72:157:378:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:homeownership.2
4:108:7356:25:14:89:540:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The remainder of this paper summarizes the literature on mortgages within speciÖc sub-
4:109:7442:14:15:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Öelds. In section 2 I begin with urban economics, a Öeld that emphasizes externalities from
4:110:7533:15:14:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:homeownership and from mortgage foreclosures.  Such externalities provide an important
4:111:7619:14:15:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rationale for public policy towards mortgages. In section 3 I present insights from asset pric-
4:112:7714:15:14:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ing, which regards mortgages as ways to share risks between borrowers and lenders.  From
4:113:7802:14:15:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this point of view, mortgage defaults and foreclosures are merely another way to allocate
4:114:7891:15:14:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risks.  Section 4 turns to behavioral Önance, a Öeld that takes seriously variation across
4:115:7981:14:14:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households in personal circumstances (such as the propensity to move) and Önancial sophis-
4:116:8071:14:15:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tication.  Behavioral Önance can also be used to justify consumer Önancial protection in
4:117:8159:15:25:72:167:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage markets.
4:118:8176:25:15:89:540:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mortgage loans need to be funded, and the problem of assuring a reliable supply of capital
4:119:8266:15:14:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for mortgage lending is a topic in Önancial intermediation.  I review insights from this Öeld

5:126:8850:14:25:72:190:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages in section 6.
5:127:8873:25:15:89:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Section 7 combines these insights to evaluate the current state of the US mortgage system,
5:128:8963:15:14:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and options for reform. Section 8 brieáy concludes. I argue that there is a legitimate public
5:129:9056:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest in a stable, e¢ cient mortgage system and that this is a propitious moment to exper-
5:130:9149:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:iment with mortgage market design, not only through importing design features from other
5:131:9237:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:successful mortgage markets, but also by considering innovations that have been suggested
5:132:9326:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by Önancial economists. Although our theoretical understanding of mortgage markets is still
5:133:9417:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weak relative to the theory that underpins classic applications of market design (to auctions

5:135:9597:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cal research will be important for this enterprise.  Thus mortgage research o§ers Önancial

5:137:9765:51:37:72:251:501:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:2  Urban Economics
5:138:9783:37:15:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An important theme of urban economics is that household decisions about the location,
5:139:9868:15:14:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ownership, and Önancing of their residence can have spillover e§ects on other households in
5:140:9959:14:14:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the same community.  These spillover e§ects are hard to measure and hard for society to
5:141:10046:14:15:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:handle through the assignment of property rights.  Accordingly there may be geographical
5:142:10134:15:25:72:303:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externalities that justify policy interventions.
5:143:10182:25:15:89:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Traditionally, US politicians have emphasized positive externalities from homeownership,
5:144:10270:15:14:72:540:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pointing to the fact that homeowners have a greater incentive than renters to take uncompen-
5:145:10362:14:14:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sated actions that beneÖt the community.  There is indeed some evidence of stronger civic
5:146:10451:14:15:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:engagement among homeowners (DiPasquale and Glaeser 1999, Ja§ee and Quigley 2011),
5:147:10533:15:14:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:although this could just reáect a greater value placed on homeownership by civically minded
5:148:10624:14:15:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:people and does not prove that policies to increase homeownership strengthen civic engage-
5:149:10714:15:14:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment.  Also, there are countervailing negative environmental externalities arising from the
5:150:10805:14:15:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dispersed and energy-intensive nature of owner-occupied housing (Glaeser 2011). Nonethe-
5:151:10893:15:14:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:less the positive view of homeownership has typically prevailed and has been used to justify
5:152:10985:14:25:72:355:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government involvement in the housing Önance system.

5:154:11052:26:14:89:540:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Here I focus on a di§erent type of externality arising from the fragile nature of single-
5:155:11141:14:15:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:family housing. Houses need diligent maintenance and are vulnerable to vandalism. Owner
5:156:11228:15:14:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:occupancy is the dominant form of ownership for single-family houses because owner occu-
5:157:11316:14:14:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pants have an incentive to maintain and protect their houses and can do so at lower cost
5:158:11404:14:26:72:185:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than absentee owners.
5:159:11425:26:0:89:540:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When an owner occupant becomes Önancially distressed, the incentive system no longer
6:160:11510:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:works so well.  A distressed homeowner may neglect her property because she fears losing
6:161:11598:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it to the mortgage lender in a foreclosure ñin which case the mortgage lender will reap the
6:162:11689:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:beneÖt of maintenance expenditures ñor because she is tightly borrowing constrained and
6:163:11776:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:e§ectively discounts the future beneÖts of maintenance at a high rate (Melzer 2011).  If
6:164:11864:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreclosure does occur, the mortgage lender faces the challenges of absentee ownership until
6:165:11956:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it can sell the house to a new owner occupant.  These challenges are particularly severe
6:166:12044:14:15:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in bad neighborhoods where vacant properties may be vandalized, and where Öxed costs of
6:167:12131:15:25:72:351:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:protecting houses are large relative to property values.
6:168:12187:25:14:89:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Campbell et al. (2011a), using Massachusetts data from the 1980s through 2009, compare
6:169:12273:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the prices of houses sold by mortgage lenders after foreclosure with the prices of comparable
6:170:12366:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:properties sold by owner occupants, and Önd an average foreclosure discount of 27%.  The
6:171:12454:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discount is larger for cheaper houses in neighborhoods with low house prices, suggesting the
6:172:12546:15:25:72:383:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relevance of vandalism and the costs of protecting against it.
6:173:12608:25:25:89:198:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Foreclosure spillovers
6:174:12630:25:15:89:540:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While these costs of foreclosure are borne by mortgage lenders, and thus will be reáected
6:175:12719:15:14:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the structure and pricing of mortgage contracts, Campbell et al. also present evidence
6:176:12808:14:15:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that foreclosures have negative spillover e§ects on the pricing of neighboring properties.
6:177:12898:15:14:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Spillover e§ects are hard to prove conclusively, because negative shocks to the health of a
6:178:12989:14:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:local economy will both lower house prices and increase foreclosures in an area, even if there
6:179:13083:14:15:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is no causal linkage from foreclosures to house prices. To get around this problem, Campbell
6:180:13175:15:14:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:et al. argue that local economic shocks should not have di§erential e§ects within a small area
6:181:13269:14:15:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such as a circle with a radius of a quarter-mile. They also argue that reverse causality from
6:182:13362:15:14:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house prices to foreclosures will show up in house price declines that precede foreclosures
6:183:13453:14:25:72:213:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rather than following them.
6:184:13480:25:15:89:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Accordingly, Campbell et al. use a di§erence-in-di§erence methodology, showing that a
6:185:13565:15:14:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distance-weighted index of recent foreclosures within 0.1 mile of a house sale predicts the sale
6:186:13661:14:15:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price negatively, after controlling for foreclosures within a quarter mile, and more so than an
6:187:13756:15:14:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:index of future foreclosures within 0.1 mile. Their preferred estimate of the causal spillover
6:188:13850:14:15:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:e§ect is that a typical nearby foreclosure lowers the price of a house by about 1%.  This
6:189:13939:15:14:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:e§ect, like the direct value loss in foreclosure, is stronger in low-priced neighborhoods, and
6:190:14033:14:15:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it appears to be long-lasting because it remains signiÖcant even after lagging the foreclosure
6:191:14127:15:14:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:index by a year. These empirical patterns once again suggest that vandalism and crime are
6:192:14216:14:14:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:involved in the negative externality from foreclosures.  Immergluck and Smith (2006) and
6:193:14304:14:26:72:537:202:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:Ellen et al. (2011) present direct evidence linking local criminal activity with foreclosures.3
6:194:14399:26:14:89:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Negative spillovers from foreclosures are particularly destructive in circumstances where
6:195:14488:14:18:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house prices are already depressed, because then falling house prices readily stimulate more
6:196:14580:18:16:85:539:144:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3Lin et al. (2009) emphasize another channel for the spillover e§ect: foreclosed houses sold at depressed
6:197:14685:16:12:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:prices are used as comparables by real estate brokers and appraisers.  See also Anenberg and Kung (2012)

7:199:14816:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:defaults and foreclosures, which drive down prices further. This mechanism appears to have
7:200:14906:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been operative in the US during the Great Depression.  In the late 1920s, US mortgages
7:201:14992:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:were often short-term balloon loans that required frequent reÖnancing.  Low house prices
7:202:15080:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and reduced bank lending capacity in the early 1930s prevented many homeowners from
7:203:15163:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reÖnancing, causing a wave of foreclosures that exacerbated the Depression. This experience
7:204:15254:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was an important motivation for the widespread adoption of long-term amortizing Öxed-rate
7:205:15343:14:25:72:533:635:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:nominal mortgages which have dominated the US mortgage market for the past 70 years.4
7:206:15428:25:15:89:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:More recently, the fear of a foreclosure spiral has motivated the Obama Administrationís
7:207:15516:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:programs to modify mortgage terms for borrowers with negative home equity.   In 2009
7:208:15600:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the administration justiÖed its Making Home A§ordable plan as follows: ìIn the absence
7:209:15686:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of decisive action, we risk an intensifying spiral in which lenders foreclose, pushing area
7:210:15777:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:home prices still lower, reducing the value of household savings, and making it harder for all
7:211:15871:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:families to reÖnance. In some studies, foreclosure on a home has been found to reduce the
7:212:15960:14:51:72:433:523:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:prices of nearby homes by as much as 9 percentî(US Treasury 2009).5
7:213:16027:51:37:72:215:472:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:3  Asset Pricing
7:214:16043:37:14:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Asset pricing economists view mortgages as contracts that share various types of risk between
7:215:16136:14:15:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage lenders and borrowers.  Long-term mortgages protect borrowers against deteri-
7:216:16222:15:14:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:orations in their own creditworthiness or in credit market conditions.  That is, borrowers
7:217:16312:14:15:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with existing mortgages are not required to put up more collateral if they enter Önancial
7:218:16401:15:14:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distress, or if the standards for underwriting new mortgages become tighter. These protec-
7:219:16491:14:15:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions are taken for granted by mortgage and other retail borrowers, but they do not exist in
7:220:16583:15:14:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other types of collateralized borrowing used by corporations and Önancial institutions, such
7:221:16675:14:15:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as repurchase agreements.  Presumably the reason has to do with the often limited access
7:222:16763:15:14:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of mortgage borrowers to unsecured credit markets, and the high costs of foreclosures as

7:226:16984:15:14:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditions, there remain numerous questions about the distribution of other risks, speciÖcally
7:227:17078:14:15:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real interest rate, ináation, and house price risks.  To understand how di§erent mortgages
7:228:17168:15:18:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can allocate these risks di§erently, consider two simple cases: a nominal Öxed-rate mortgage
7:229:17260:18:15:85:539:193:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4Amortizing Öxed-rate mortgages did exist before the Great Depression, and were particularly favored
7:230:17360:15:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by savings and loans institutions which had a large market share in mortgage origination (Morton 1956,
7:231:17462:12:12:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Chapter 2).  However, average maturities were considerably shorter than they are today (Grebler, Blank,
7:232:17565:12:8:72:212:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and Winnick 1956, Chapter 15).
7:233:17595:8:16:85:539:146:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:5There is also the possibility that foreclosures encourage neighbors to default, not by lowering their house
7:234:17703:16:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:prices but through a direct mechanism such as learning or a reduction of the stigma associated with default

8:236:17835:0:25:72:362:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(FRM) and a nominal adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).
8:237:17886:25:14:89:540:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A standard FRM has a level path of nominal payments designed to pay o§ the principal
8:238:17970:14:15:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:balance as well as interest over the life of the mortgage. The stream of payments is invariant
8:239:18064:15:14:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to changes in the level of real interest rates, and in this sense the borrower is protected against
8:240:18163:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real interest rate shocks (although of course the present discounted value of the payments,
8:241:18254:15:25:72:417:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the market value of the liability, does vary with real interest rates).
8:242:18325:25:14:89:540:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The main uncertainty that a§ects a nominal FRM borrower concerns the ináation rate
8:243:18407:14:15:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over the life of the mortgage. If ináation accelerates, the real value of the payments declines
8:244:18502:15:14:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rapidly and the borrower beneÖts in real terms while the lender su§ers.   This was the
8:245:18588:14:15:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:situation in the US during the late 1960s and 1970s.  If ináation decelerates, or in the
8:246:18676:15:14:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:extreme if the economy experiences deáation, then the outcome depends on prepayment
8:247:18759:14:15:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:penalties and house prices. If there are no prepayment penalties, as is normally the case in
8:248:18851:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the US, and if nominal house prices are su¢ ciently high, then borrowers can reÖnance their
8:249:18942:14:14:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nominal FRMs to lower rates and they do not su§er from low ináation. However if there are
8:250:19031:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prepayment penalties, as is typical in Germany, or if nominal house prices decline to a level
8:251:19124:15:14:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that prevents reÖnancing, then FRM borrowers are required to make higher real payments
8:252:19210:14:26:72:176:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as ináation declines.
8:253:19231:26:14:89:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The initial mortgage rate compensates lenders for the balance of risks that they bear.
8:254:19317:14:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:With volatile ináation and low prepayment penalties, nominal FRMs are one-sided bets on
8:255:19404:14:26:72:365:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ináation and become extremely expensive in equilibrium.
8:256:19459:26:14:89:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A standard ARM requires a borrower to pay a áoating nominal interest rate, indexed
8:257:19541:14:15:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the general level of short-term interest rates, together with small additional payments to
8:258:19634:15:14:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amortize the principal balance.  In practice, ARMs often have especially low initial rates
8:259:19724:14:14:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(ìteaser ratesî), but for now consider a plain-vanilla ARM without any teaser period. This
8:260:19814:14:15:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage is a áoating-rate note with a relatively stable real market value (since short-term
8:261:19906:15:14:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uncertainty about ináation is small, so most ináation shocks are compensated by variation
8:262:19995:14:15:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the nominal interest rate).  However, the stream of payments is subject to signiÖcant
8:263:20083:15:25:72:133:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uncertainty.
8:264:20095:25:14:89:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If real interest rates increase, then required payments also increase although their present
8:265:20187:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value does not.   If ináation increases, then the timing of the payment stream changes,
8:266:20274:15:14:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with higher real payments early in the life of the mortgage (the result of higher short-term
8:267:20366:14:15:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nominal interest rates), and lower real payments later once ináation has eroded the real
8:268:20454:15:14:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value of the mortgage principal. A mortgage borrower with unused borrowing capacity can
8:269:20541:14:15:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compensate for the increase in early payments by borrowing to Önance them, repaying the
8:270:20628:15:14:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:additional loan with the additional real income available later in the life of the mortgage. A
8:271:20722:14:15:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage borrower who is constrained, however, faces signiÖcant risk to consumption from
8:272:20810:15:14:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the uncertainty about the timing of repayment implied by an ARM. Campbell and Cocco
8:273:20893:14:15:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2003) refer to this as ìincome riskî and contrast it with the ìwealth riskî that ináation
8:274:20983:15:0:72:225:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creates for an FRM borrower.
9:275:21012:0:14:89:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because the term structure of interest rates is normally upward sloping, both the initial
9:276:21101:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payments and the expected stream of future payments are normally lower for an ARM than
9:277:21187:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for a FRM. For this reason, binding current borrowing constraints tend to lead mortgage
9:278:21274:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers to prefer ARMs. However, the anticipation of future borrowing constraints makes
9:279:21363:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ARMs risky and may lead borrowers to prefer FRMs.  Overall, the preference for ARMs
9:280:21446:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should be greatest among mortgage borrowers with rapidly increasing income who are buying
9:281:21535:14:15:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large houses relative to their current income.   Campbell and Cocco (2003) develop an
9:282:21620:15:14:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimizing life-cycle model of mortgage choice with these predictions, and Johnson and Li
9:283:21709:14:25:72:531:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2011) present evidence that ARM borrowers tend to be currently borrowing-constrained.
9:284:21795:25:15:89:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Both the yield spread between short- and long-term bonds and the rational expectation
9:285:21880:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of future excess returns on long bonds vary over time.  These two variables are positively
9:286:21970:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but not perfectly correlated. If the risk preferences and personal circumstances of mortgage
9:287:22062:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers have a cross-sectional distribution that is unchanged over time, rational borrowers
9:288:22155:14:15:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with binding constraints are more likely to choose ARMs when the yield curve is steep, to
9:289:22244:15:14:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:minimize initial payments, while other borrowers should shift to ARMs when the rational
9:290:22331:14:14:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expectation of long bond returns is high. Campbell and Cocco (2003) emphasize the former
9:291:22419:14:15:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:e§ect, while Koijen et al. (2009) argue that the latter explains much of the time-variation
9:292:22510:15:25:72:285:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the market share of ARMs in US data.
9:293:22549:25:25:89:126:440:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Default
9:294:22556:25:15:89:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The analysis above considers the possibility of reÖnancing a mortgage but not the possi-
9:295:22644:15:14:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bility of default.  However, the current housing downturn has brought default to the center
9:296:22735:14:26:72:208:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the mortgage literature.
9:297:22762:26:14:89:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The attractiveness of default to a borrower should vary with ìrecourseî, the ability of
9:298:22849:14:14:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the mortgage lender to pursue a defaulted borrower for the balance of the mortgage after
9:299:22937:14:15:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreclosing on the house. Most European countries have recourse mortgages, as do most US
9:300:23025:15:14:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states with some important exceptions including California. In the US, the practical impact
9:301:23116:14:15:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of recourse varies across states (with details of state law) and over time (with the federal
9:302:23208:15:14:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:law governing personal bankruptcy, which can be used to escape recourse). It appears that
9:303:23297:14:15:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:US mortgage lenders are less likely to pursue borrowers, even in recourse states, than are
9:304:23387:15:14:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:European mortgage lenders.  However Ghent and Kudlyak (2011) compare default rates
9:305:23469:14:15:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:across US states and Önd lower default rates in recourse states, particularly for higher-
9:306:23558:15:14:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:priced homes whose owners are likely to have other Önancial resources that can be seized by
9:307:23649:14:25:72:163:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage lenders.
9:308:23666:25:15:89:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Even without recourse, default imposes some costs on the borrower: at a minimum, the
9:309:23750:15:14:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cost of moving and damage to the borrowerís credit score.6A defaulted borrower will have
9:310:23838:14:15:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:little access to credit for a period of time, making it di¢ cult to buy another house and
9:311:23927:15:17:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forcing a period of rental occupancy.  These costs imply that borrowers should not default
9:312:24017:17:16:85:539:130:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:6Guiso et al. (2009) emphasize that default imposes additional psychic costs on borrowers who regard
9:313:24117:16:0:72:211:114:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:default as immoral or shameful.
10:314:24149:0:14:72:541:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if they have positive home equity (since in this case they can sell the house and pay o§
10:315:24237:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the mortgage without incurring default costs), and even with negative home equity should
10:316:24325:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not default until negative home equity becomes su¢ ciently large.  Default is the exercise
10:317:24415:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of a ìreal optionî (Deng et al. 2000), and thus the trigger level of negative home equity
10:318:24504:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should depend not only on default costs but also on the stochastic process for house prices.
10:319:24596:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SpeciÖcally, high expected price growth and high volatility of price shocks should both delay
10:320:24689:14:25:72:391:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default by increasing the trigger level of negative home equity.
10:321:24753:25:15:89:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Borrowing constraints are also highly relevant for the default decision.  As borrowing
10:322:24839:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constraints bind, they increase the marginal utility of consumption today relative to future
10:323:24931:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marginal utility, and thus increase the e§ective rate at which households discount the future.
10:324:25025:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since default has immediate beneÖts (the cessation of burdensome mortgage payments) and
10:325:25112:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some delayed costs, it will be more attractive when borrowing constraints are binding. That
10:326:25203:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is, borrowing constraints accelerate default by decreasing the trigger level of negative home
10:327:25296:14:15:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity.7Foote et al. (2008) present a two-period model and Campbell and Cocco (2012)
10:328:25380:15:25:72:358:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:calibrate a multi-period life-cycle model of these e§ects.
10:329:25438:25:14:89:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This theoretical framework implies that negative home equity is a necessary but not
10:330:25521:14:15:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a su¢ cient condition for mortgage default.  At low levels of negative home equity, only
10:331:25609:15:14:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Önancially distressed borrowers with depleted assets and low incomeó perhaps the result of
10:332:25699:14:15:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unemploymentó will default.  As house prices fall, more borrowers will reach the level of
10:333:25788:15:14:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:negative home equity that triggers default, and in the extreme, all borrowers will strategically
10:334:25884:14:15:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default.  Campbell and Cocco (2012) verify this pattern in simulated data with rational
10:335:25971:15:14:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers.  They Önd that at modest levels of negative home equity, default rates are low
10:336:26060:14:14:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and defaulters are more distressed than non-defaulters in the sense that their mortgage
10:337:26147:14:15:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payments are larger relative to their current income.  At higher levels of negative home
10:338:26235:15:14:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity, default rates increase and the di§erence in Önancial distress between defaulters and

10:342:26529:14:15:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the reform of the US bankruptcy code in 2005 made it harder for borrowers to escape

10:344:26706:14:15:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bankruptcy reform decreased the trigger level of negative home equity and increased defaults

10:348:26986:15:18:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage types, but these defaults occur in di§erent circumstances.  While both types of
10:349:27074:18:15:85:539:169:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:7The practitioner literature discusses a ìdual-triggerî model of default, in which both negative home
10:350:27175:15:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:equity and Önancial distress are required for default. It is more accurate to think of a single negative-equity
10:351:27286:12:9:72:317:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:trigger whose location is ináuenced by Önancial distress.
10:352:27343:9:15:85:539:133:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:8Mitman (2011) presents a theoretical analysis of the interaction between the bankruptcy code and
10:353:27440:15:0:72:254:118:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mortgage default that predicts this e§ect.
11:354:27483:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages generate high default rates if house prices decline far enough, in states of the
11:355:27573:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:world with modest levels of negative home equity, FRM defaults occur when interest rates
11:356:27661:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are low (since old FRMs are expensive relative to rental housing), whereas ARM defaults
11:357:27748:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:occur when interest rates are high (since their required payments increase).  FRMs are
11:358:27834:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also somewhat more likely to generate default waves, as idiosyncratic income shocks are less
11:359:27926:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important drivers of default for FRM borrowers so their default decisions tend to be more
11:360:28015:14:25:72:161:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highly correlated.
11:361:28033:25:15:89:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To summarize, the possibility of default shifts the balance of risks in a mortgage contract.
11:362:28125:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Lenders bear the risk of extremely low house prices, because borrowers with non-recourse
11:363:28213:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages e§ectively have a put option on their house.  The default option also caps the
11:364:28301:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:potential gains to lenders from favorable interest rate movements in states of the world with
11:365:28394:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:moderately low house prices.  Naturally these risks are also priced into mortgage interest
11:366:28484:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates, which will be higher when lenders believe that default is likely or that default tends
11:367:28577:14:50:72:440:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to occur in bad states of the world with high marginal utility of wealth.
11:368:28650:50:37:72:264:473:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:4  Behavioral Finance
11:369:28671:37:14:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Behavioral Önance confronts the fact that borrowers vary in their personal circumstances,
11:370:28760:14:15:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and in their ability to manage their Önancial a§airs in their own long-run interest.  Three
11:371:28851:15:14:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particularly important types of heterogeneity are in moving propensity, Önancial sophistica-
11:372:28943:14:26:72:258:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion, and present-biased preferences.
11:373:28980:26:25:89:182:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Moving propensity
11:374:28997:25:14:89:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is nothing irrational, of course, about moving from one house to another.  But
11:375:29081:14:15:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-economic considerations are often important motivations for moves, so it is natural to
11:376:29171:15:25:72:467:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:classify the desire to move as a behavioral ináuence on the mortgage market.
11:377:29247:25:14:89:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:With limited exceptions, mortgages in the US are not assumable.  That is, a mortgage
11:378:29331:14:15:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:collateralized by a speciÖc house cannot be transferred by a departing homeowner to the new
11:379:29422:15:14:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:owner of the house.  Instead, the departing homeowner must pay o§ the old mortgage and
11:380:29508:14:15:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the new owner must obtain a new mortgage.  This fact implies that moves have economic
11:381:29593:15:14:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consequences when existing mortgages are more advantageous to borrowers than are new
11:382:29677:14:25:72:127:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages.
11:383:29687:25:15:89:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Such discrepancies between the terms of old and new mortgages are unimportant for
11:384:29768:15:14:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:plain-vanilla ARMs, but can be very signiÖcant for FRMs in an environment of rising interest
11:385:29860:14:15:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates that makes old FRMs cheaper than new ones.  In such an environment movers su§er
11:386:29945:15:14:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative to continuing homeowners, if movers are forced to prepay their mortgages at face
11:387:30034:14:26:72:258:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value and reÖnance at a higher rate.
11:388:30070:26:0:89:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The asymmetric treatment of movers and continuing homeowners in FRM systems is im-
12:389:30153:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portant for several reasons. First, to the extent that moves are random events for households
12:390:30246:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(forced by job changes or other exogenous life events), FRM systems create idiosyncratic eco-
12:391:30339:14:26:72:459:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nomic risks that are di¢ cult to insure and a§ect household welfare ex ante.
12:392:30415:26:14:89:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, uncertainty about the aggregate moving propensity of households is one impor-
12:393:30500:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tant determinant of prepayment risk, a major factor in pricing mortgage-backed securities.
12:394:30590:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:FRM borrowers have an incentive to avoid moving when interest rates rise, but the magni-
12:395:30678:14:25:72:407:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tude of this ìlock-inîe§ect can be hard for investors to estimate.
12:396:30744:25:15:89:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, asymmetry of information about the moving propensity of individual households
12:397:30828:15:14:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can ináuence the structure of the mortgage market. Mortgage lenders have incentives to
12:398:30914:14:15:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:separate borrowers by their moving propensity, for example by o§ering lower interest rates
12:399:31004:15:14:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in exchange for an up-front fee or ìpointsîin US terminology (Brueckner 1994, Stanton and
12:400:31093:14:15:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Wallace 1998).  To the extent that some market participants have more information than
12:401:31179:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:others about the moving propensity of borrowers, mortgage-backed securities markets may
12:402:31266:14:25:72:533:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:become illiquid as investors fear trading with counterparties who may be better informed.
12:403:31355:25:15:89:540:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A unique feature of the Danish mortgage system, which has traditionally been dominated
12:404:31441:15:14:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by FRMs, is that it avoids treating movers and continuing homeowners asymmetrically.
12:405:31525:14:15:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Borrowers are allowed to prepay their mortgages at face value without penalty, as in the US
12:406:31616:15:14:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:system; but they can also extinguish their mortgage debt by buying mortgage bonds, which
12:407:31704:14:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is economically equivalent to buying back their mortgages at market value. This avoids the
12:408:31794:14:15:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lock-in e§ect in an environment of rising interest rates. In addition, Danish mortgages are
12:409:31885:15:25:72:491:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:typically assumable so that new homeowners can take on mortgages from movers.
12:410:31962:25:25:89:211:375:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Financial sophistication
12:411:31986:25:15:89:540:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A great variety of mortgages are available, some of which have complex features that are
12:412:32074:15:14:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:di¢ cult even for Önancial professionals to thoroughly understand. Mortgage costs appear
12:413:32162:14:15:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in a number of forms, not all of which are straightforward to measure. Households take out
12:414:32252:15:14:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages relatively infrequently, and often negotiate them at the same time that they are
12:415:32342:14:15:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:undergoing a major life transition by moving homes. Under these circumstances it is not
12:416:32429:15:14:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:surprising that households, particularly those with less Önancial sophistication, sometimes
12:417:32520:14:25:72:306:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make decisions that appear to be suboptimal.
12:418:32564:25:15:89:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is some direct evidence that mortgage borrowers fail to understand the terms of
12:419:32649:15:14:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their mortgages.  Campbell (2006) and Schwartz (2006) use the American Housing Survey
12:420:32734:14:15:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(AHS) to show that some self-reported FRM rates are implausibly low given the years in
12:421:32820:15:14:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which the mortgages were taken out.  Such misstated rates are more common among less
12:422:32904:14:15:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:educated households. Bucks and Pence (2008) compare survey evidence on the adjustability
12:423:32992:15:14:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of ARM rates to administrative data on ARM terms, and show that households collectively
12:424:33079:14:25:72:383:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:underestimate the extent to which their ARM rates can rise.
12:425:33138:25:15:89:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Many observers have been concerned that borrowers pay excessive fees to mortgage bro-
12:426:33223:15:0:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:kers. Woodward (2004) and Woodward and Hall (2012) show that complex mortgage terms
13:427:33308:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are associated with higher fees paid to mortgage brokers, especially by less educated house-
13:428:33400:14:25:72:102:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:holds.
13:429:33406:25:15:89:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The decision to reÖnance a FRM is challenging for many households. Campbell (2006)
13:430:33488:15:14:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presents evidence that in the late 1990s and early 2000s many households, particularly poorer
13:431:33581:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and less educated ones, paid higher mortgage rates than necessary. In AHS data, 12-14% of
13:432:33670:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households were paying more than 2 percentage points above the prevailing mortgage interest
13:433:33761:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate in the late 1990s and early 2000s; this Ögure rose above 25% in 2003 after steep drops
13:434:33852:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in interest rates made reÖnancing particularly advantageous.  These results are unlikely to
13:435:33943:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be explained by credit deterioration (proxies for which are measured in the AHS) or lack of
13:436:34034:14:26:72:386:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:home equity given the buoyant housing market of the period.
13:437:34093:26:14:89:542:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ReÖnancing is also important for borrowers with ARMs that o§er low initial ìteaserî
13:438:34176:14:15:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates. Such features are common in both the US and the UK, and they create an economic
13:439:34262:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentive to reÖnance ARMs at the end of the teaser period.  Miles (2004) shows that in
13:440:34349:14:14:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the early 2000s, about a third of UK borrowers had not reÖnanced and were paying higher
13:441:34436:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ìstandardîrates.  In the economic environment of the time, it is unlikely that more than
13:442:34524:15:14:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a fraction of these borrowers were prevented from reÖnancing by negative home equity or
13:443:34611:14:26:72:486:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income shocks; instead, this was likely a mistake by less sophisticated borrowers.
13:444:34693:26:14:89:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is also possible that borrowers make mistakes when choosing between ARMs and FRMs.
13:445:34778:14:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Campbell (2006) argues that lagged changes in long-term interest rates ináuence the market
13:446:34868:14:15:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share of ARMs in a way that is hard to rationalize, although Koijen et al. (2009) argue that
13:447:34960:15:25:72:348:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a rational model of mortgage choice Öts US data well.
13:448:35013:25:15:89:540:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mistakes by mortgage borrowers have several important implications for equilibrium in
13:449:35098:15:14:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the mortgage market.   Random variation in the incidence of these mistakes creates an
13:450:35183:14:14:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:artiÖcial risk that must be managed by mortgage investors.  It is ironic that prepayment

13:452:35360:15:14:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the 1990s and 2000s, is caused by consumersíinability to handle the excessively complex
13:453:35447:14:26:72:332:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prepayment option built into a conventional FRM.
13:454:35495:26:14:89:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The proÖts generated by mortgage mistakes are competed away in a competitive market
13:455:35578:14:14:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for mortgage origination.  One e§ect is that originators and brokers pay high marketing
13:456:35665:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs as they compete for the business of naive mortgage borrowers. A second e§ect is that
13:457:35755:15:14:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage rates fall, so sophisticated borrowers beneÖt at the expense of unsophisticated
13:458:35843:14:26:72:98:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ones.
13:459:35848:26:14:89:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Gabaix and Laibson (2006) have argued that this second e§ect can inhibit useful Önancial
13:460:35936:14:15:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:innovation. Consider an entrepreneur who designs and markets an automatically reÖnancing
13:461:36024:15:14:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:FRM. Such a FRM would be socially beneÖcial because it would eliminate the transactions
13:462:36111:14:14:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs of conventional reÖnancing, and would protect naive borrowers who fail to reÖnance
13:463:36199:14:15:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conventionally at the right time.  However, the new product would be more expensive for
13:464:36286:15:14:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sophisticated borrowers, since it would not o§er any cross-subsidy from naive borrowers.
13:465:36374:14:0:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:And if the entrepreneur attempted to market the new product to naive borrowers, he might
14:466:36464:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Önd instead that the marketing e§ort converted naive borrowers into sophisticated borrowers,
14:467:36556:14:25:72:297:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who would then decline to buy the product.
14:468:36598:25:26:89:222:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Present-biased preferences
14:469:36624:26:14:89:540:656:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Households with present-biased preferences (Laibson 1997) favor the present over the
14:470:36708:14:14:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:future more than they discount the near future relative to the distant future.  In other
14:471:36796:14:26:72:375:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:words, they plan to be patient but succumb to temptation.
14:472:36853:26:14:89:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Khandani et al. (2009) argue that present-biased mortgage borrowers are likely to extract
14:473:36942:14:15:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:home equity when they reÖnance their mortgages, at the expense of their long-run Önancial
14:474:37031:15:14:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wellbeing.  This temptation exists in all forms of mortgages, but the nominal FRM, with
14:475:37118:14:14:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its strong rational incentive to reÖnance in an environment of rising house prices and falling
14:476:37212:14:15:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rates, provides frequent opportunities to succumb.  On the other hand Chen et
14:477:37298:15:14:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:al. (2011) argue that cash-out reÖnancing tends to occur when local economic conditions
14:478:37385:14:15:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deteriorate (so long as house prices are high enough to permit it), which is consistent with
14:479:37477:15:25:72:327:501:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:rational consumption-smoothing by homeowners.9
14:480:37523:25:14:89:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The same arguments apply to mortgage innovation that increases credit available to
14:481:37605:14:15:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Örst-time homebuyers. If borrowers are rational and have time-consistent preferences, such
14:482:37695:15:14:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:innovation helps them smooth their consumption of goods and housing services over the life
14:483:37785:14:15:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cycle (Piskorski and Tchistyi 2010, 2011).  If not, the availability of additional credit may
14:484:37878:15:51:72:438:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worsen the temptation to consume too much early in life (Ghent 2011).
14:485:37947:51:37:72:311:367:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:5  Financial Intermediation
14:486:37974:37:14:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mortgage loans must be funded, and this requires the involvement of Önancial intermediaries
14:487:38065:14:14:72:540:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who originate loans and either hold them or repackage them for sale to ultimate investors.
14:488:38155:14:15:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Other intermediaries may provide guarantees, insuring certain mortgage risks.  Whatever
14:489:38242:15:14:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risks borrowers do not bear must be allocated to originators, ultimate investors, or guarantee
14:490:38336:14:26:72:429:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:providers.  Di§erent mortgage systems allocate these risks di§erently.
14:491:38406:26:14:89:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The allocation of mortgage risks is important not only because it determines the distri-
14:492:38494:14:15:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bution of gains and losses ex post and the pricing of mortgages ex ante, but also because it
14:493:38586:15:14:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ináuences the incentives of Önancial intermediaries. A successful mortgage system must give
14:494:38677:14:14:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intermediaries incentives to underwrite properly, gauging the credit risk of borrowers and
14:495:38767:14:15:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:setting mortgage rates in relation to that risk.  It must also give intermediaries incentives
14:496:38860:15:14:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to modify mortgages if borrowers enter Önancial distress and modiÖcation is in the interest
14:497:38951:14:18:72:176:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of mortgage holders.
14:498:38971:18:16:85:539:143:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:9In a similar spirit Gerardi et al. (2010) show that mortgage innovation has improved the relationship
14:499:39073:16:0:72:513:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:between housing choice and future income, consistent with a rational consumption-smoothing model.
15:500:39172:0:14:89:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mortgage systems can be classiÖed into three main categories, which allocate risks and
15:501:39258:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provide incentives in di§erent ways. The oldest system isdeposit-Önanced lending, in which
15:502:39348:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:originators hold loans and issue deposits to Önance them.  This system has the great merit
15:503:39438:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that solvent originators have strong incentives both to underwrite mortgages carefully and,
15:504:39529:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if necessary, to modify them.  However, deposit-Önanced lending also has several serious
15:505:39617:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disadvantages. First, mortgage supply tends to be limited by the local availability of deposit
15:506:39711:14:15:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:funding.  Second, deposit-Önanced lending involves liquidity transformation, since deposits
15:507:39802:15:14:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can be withdrawn on demand while mortgages cannot. This makes deposit-Önanced lenders
15:508:39887:14:15:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vulnerable to bank runs, particularly in systems without government insurance of retail
15:509:39974:15:14:72:540:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deposits and in cases where deposits have been attracted from wholesale money markets
15:510:40059:14:14:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(the UK mortgage lender Northern Rock being a spectacular recent example).   Third,
15:511:40142:14:15:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deposit-Önanced lending usually involves an element of maturity transformation, particularly
15:512:40234:15:14:72:540:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when mortgages are Öxed-rate.  This exposes mortgage lenders to fundamental risk from
15:513:40319:14:15:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes in interest rates. Fourth, the incentives of mortgage lenders can become misaligned
15:514:40410:15:14:72:540:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if a negative fundamental shock, from a weak economy or rising interest rates, puts these
15:515:40499:14:15:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intermediaries into Önancial distress.  The most famous example of this is the US savings
15:516:40588:15:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and loan crisis of the 1980s, in which S&Ls, distressed after interest rates increased during
15:517:40681:14:15:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the early 1980s, made risky loans in the knowledge that further losses would be covered by
15:518:40771:15:25:72:404:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deposit insurance while gains would accrue to S&L shareholders.
15:519:40834:25:14:89:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:In the years since the S&L crisis, the US has largely shifted to asecuritized mortgage
15:520:40920:14:15:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:system. In this model, originators package mortgages into pools that can be sold to ultimate
15:521:41012:15:14:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investors.  A natural concern in such a system is that originators have better information
15:522:41102:14:15:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about credit risks than mortgage investors do.  To handle this, the US system has relied
15:523:41190:15:14:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:heavily on credit guarantees provided by the government sponsored entities (GSEs), Fannie
15:524:41279:14:15:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mae and Freddie Mac.  Ultimate investors bear interest rate risk, prepayment risk, and
15:525:41365:15:14:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:residual credit risk for types of mortgages not covered by public guarantees.  During the
15:526:41454:14:14:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1990s and 2000s, this system allowed US mortgages to become liquid assets funded by global
15:527:41544:14:26:72:316:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital markets rather than by local depositors.
15:528:41592:26:14:89:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The securitized system also has disadvantages that became glaringly obvious after the
15:529:41677:14:15:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:onset of the global Önancial crisis in 2007.  First, if ultimate investors are ignorant about
15:530:41770:15:14:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit risk or if credit guarantees are mispriced, originators no longer have the incentives to
15:531:41865:14:14:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:underwrite properly.  The US experience suggests that government credit guarantees are
15:532:41951:14:15:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particularly hard to price correctly and are vulnerable to political distortion.  Underpriced
15:533:42044:15:14:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:guarantees encourage originators to make excessively risky loans and pass the losses to tax-
15:534:42136:14:15:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payers.  Keys et al. (2010, 2012) present evidence that securitized mortgages were poorly
15:535:42225:15:25:72:231:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:underwritten in the mid-2000s.
15:536:42255:25:14:89:540:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, while in principle a securitized system does not expose mortgage originators to
15:537:42342:14:15:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fundamental mortgage risks, in practice originators often hold mortgage-backed securities on
15:538:42434:15:14:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their books either as inventory for their MBS distribution business or because bank capital
15:539:42525:14:15:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regulation favors these investments. Thus originators can become distressed in a securitized
15:540:42617:15:0:72:454:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:system just as they can in the traditional deposit-Önanced lending system.
16:541:42693:0:14:89:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, the problem of capital áight can also reappear in a securitized system if public
16:542:42780:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit guarantees are not fully explicit or credible. This problem a≠ icted the GSEs in 2007
16:543:42872:14:26:72:460:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 2008 and ultimately forced a government takeover of these institutions.
16:544:42947:26:14:89:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, a securitized system may not give mortgage servicers the proper incentives to
16:545:43033:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:modify mortgages in a housing downturn, both because servicers bear modiÖcation costs
16:546:43118:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:without receiving beneÖts, and because the ultimate owners of mortgage-backed securities
16:547:43206:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may have divergent interests.   The scale of this problem in the recent crisis is actively
16:548:43296:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debated: Adelino et al.  (2009) and Foote et al.  (2010) minimize its importance, while
16:549:43383:15:25:72:443:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Agarwal et al. (2011) and Piskorski et al. (2011) argue that it is serious.
16:550:43458:25:15:89:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The last major mortgage system, common in Europe, usescovered bondsto address
16:551:43535:15:14:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some of the problems described above.  Covered bonds are claims on originators but are
16:552:43621:14:15:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:collateralized by pools of mortgages. Importantly, the underlying mortgages remain on the
16:553:43710:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:books of originators, who must replenish the collateral pool when individual mortgages in
16:554:43799:14:14:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the pool default.  Thus originators continue to have strong incentives both to underwrite
16:555:43888:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages carefully and to modify them when that is in the interest of mortgage lenders.
16:556:43976:15:14:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Covered bond systems permit maturity transformation (when the maturity of the bonds
16:557:44059:14:15:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:di§ers from the maturity of the underlying mortgages), and this can create problems similar
16:558:44150:15:14:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to those of a deposit-Önanced lending system.   However, in countries that have limited
16:559:44237:14:25:72:473:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maturity transformation, covered bond systems have been impressively stable.
16:560:44313:25:15:89:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In both securitized and covered bonds systems, it is essential that Önancial instruments
16:561:44401:15:14:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:backed by mortgages trade in liquid markets.  To maintain liquidity, these systems must
16:562:44488:14:15:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:minimize information asymmetries.   Ways to do this include packaging mortgages into
16:563:44572:15:14:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large, diversiÖed pools; designing mortgages to limit their exposure to personal circum-
16:564:44660:14:15:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stances and behavioral uncertainties; tranching pools of mortgages to create instruments
16:565:44748:15:14:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that are protected against prepayment or default; and providing public credit guarantees.
16:566:44837:14:15:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Many observers have praised the Danish mortgage system, which emphasizes the Örst two

16:568:44933:50:37:72:241:263:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:6  Macroeconomics
16:569:44950:37:15:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The form of the mortgage system has the potential to ináuence macroeconomic outcomes,
16:570:45035:15:14:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:principally by altering the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and the political
16:571:45122:14:15:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constraints on the central bank.  In turn, the macroeconomic history of a country has a
16:572:45209:15:25:72:290:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:powerful ináuence on its mortgage system.
16:573:45250:25:14:89:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Increases in interest rates have di§erent e§ects on homeowners with FRMs and ARMs.
16:574:45332:14:15:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The mortgage payments of FRM borrowers remain unchanged when current interest rates
16:575:45415:15:14:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase, so in a FRM system monetary policy has a direct e§ect only on new borrowers
16:576:45500:14:0:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(although existing borrowers are of course a§ected by house prices and other consequences
17:577:45591:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of monetary policy). In an ARM system, on the other hand, all existing homeowners make
17:578:45677:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher payments when interest rates increase. This can have a powerful e§ect on household
17:579:45766:14:26:72:532:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consumption, especially if a signiÖcant fraction of homeowners are borrowing-constrained.
17:580:45855:26:14:89:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For the same reason, the political economy of monetary policy varies with the nature of
17:581:45942:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the mortgage system.  In a FRM system where mortgages are Önanced through maturity
17:582:46024:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transformation, as in the traditional US system of deposit-Önanced lending, the central bank
17:583:46116:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may be reluctant to raise interest rates for fear of creating Önancial distress among mortgage
17:584:46210:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lenders. This may have been one reason for the weak Fed response to rising ináation during
17:585:46300:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the 1970s.  In an ARM system, on the other hand, increases in interest rates can be highly
17:586:46390:14:26:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unpopular with homeowners and this may create political pressure to keep interest rates low.
17:587:46482:26:14:89:540:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ARM and FRM systems also generate di§erent patterns of default in an environment with
17:588:46567:14:15:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:declining house prices.  If the central bank responds to such an environment by lowering
17:589:46655:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rates, ARM borrowers beneÖt from lower required mortgage payments, but FRM
17:590:46738:14:14:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers do not if negative home equity prevents them from reÖnancing their mortgages.
17:591:46825:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this respect it is unfortunate that the US, with unusually low interest rates in the recent
17:592:46919:15:14:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:downturn, has a predominantly Öxed-rate mortgage system so that only homeowners with
17:593:47003:14:26:72:444:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positive home equity can beneÖt from the low interest-rate environment.
17:594:47074:26:14:89:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On the other hand, ARM systems can generate default waves when ináationary shocks
17:595:47155:14:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:force the central bank to increase interest rates.  Figure 4 illustrates two waves of Önancial
17:596:47249:14:15:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distress experienced in the UK, where ARMs predominate.  The Ögure plots bankruptcy
17:597:47332:15:14:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:orders, rather than mortgage defaults, as this series is readily available over a long period
17:598:47425:14:15:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of time and positively correlated with mortgage defaults and foreclosures. The bankruptcy
17:599:47514:15:14:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:series spikes up in the early 1990s, shortly after an increase in ináation and nominal interest
17:600:47609:14:15:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates at the end of the 1980s that increased the required payments on ARMs.  The bank-
17:601:47695:15:14:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ruptcy series also spikes up in the late 2000s, despite the fact that ináation and interest rates
17:602:47792:14:15:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:were low, because declining house prices and poor macroeconomic conditions outweighed the
17:603:47881:15:25:72:265:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payment relief on ARMs at this time.
17:604:47917:25:14:89:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:All these considerations make it awkward to run a common monetary policy in an area
17:605:48000:14:15:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with heterogeneous mortgage systems. In the early 2000s, British concern about this prob-
17:606:48089:15:14:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lem was one justiÖcation for the UK to keep its own currency rather than joining the euro,
17:607:48179:14:15:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the Miles Report (2004) was originally commissioned by Chancellor Gordon Brown to
17:608:48264:15:14:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:study whether the UK should try to harmonize its mortgage system with those of major
17:609:48348:14:25:72:176:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:eurozone economies.
17:610:48367:25:15:89:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Conversely, the variation in mortgage systems across developed countries appears to be
17:611:48453:15:14:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:related to their macroeconomic history. SpeciÖcally, a history of volatile ináation is strongly
17:612:48548:14:15:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated with the use of ARMs, as shown in Figure 5.  Because many of the countries
17:613:48633:15:14:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:included in the Ögure are members of the eurozone, ináation volatility is calculated over the
17:614:48726:14:15:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pre-euro period of 1977-1999.  A natural explanation for the pattern shown in Figure 5 is
17:615:48815:15:0:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that volatile ináation makes nominal FRMs with prepayment options excessively risky for
18:616:48904:0:25:72:335:721:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:lenders and therefore too expensive for borrowers.10
18:617:48956:25:14:89:540:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Of course, this raises the interesting question of why mortgage systems in southern Europe
18:618:49046:14:15:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have remained ARM-dominated even after the introduction of the euro.  It appears that
18:619:49131:15:14:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is substantial inertia in mortgage systems, possibly resulting from the di¢ culty and
18:620:49222:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expense of educating borrowers about mortgage contracts that may be unfamiliar to them
18:621:49308:15:50:72:250:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:even if common in other countries.

18:623:49381:37:14:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper I have presented insights from Öve di§erent Öelds ñ urban economics, asset
18:624:49469:14:15:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pricing, behavioral Önance, Önancial intermediation, and macroeconomics ñabout the oper-
18:625:49557:15:14:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ations of mortgage systems. I conclude by using these insights to discuss future prospects for
18:626:49651:14:15:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the US mortgage system. In turn, I will discuss lessons from the credit boom; the challenge
18:627:49742:15:14:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of modifying mortgages to reduce foreclosures; alternative forms for mortgage contracts;
18:628:49830:14:25:72:504:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consumer Önancial protection; and Önally alternatives for funding mortgage lending.
18:629:49913:25:26:89:237:454:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Lessons from the credit boom
18:630:49941:26:14:89:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The preceding analysis provides the necessary ingredients to understand recent problems
18:631:50028:14:15:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the housing market. These problems arose from a boom and subsequent collapse in both
18:632:50115:15:14:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house prices and mortgage lending, and the e§ects of the collapse on leveraged borrowers
18:633:50203:14:25:72:533:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and mortgage lenders.  There is an active debate about the deeper causes of these events.
18:634:50292:25:15:89:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Some economists, notably Foote et al.  (2012), emphasize overoptimistic expectations
18:635:50376:15:14:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about the future path of house prices during the boom, and downplay institutional features of
18:636:50469:14:15:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the housing Önance market as being either static or changing merely in response to optimistic
18:637:50562:15:25:72:168:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price expectations.
18:638:50581:25:14:89:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second view is that excessive household leverage was encouraged by longstanding US
18:639:50665:14:15:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policies, particularly the tax subsidy to mortgage-Önanced owner occupancy.  Economists
18:640:50752:15:14:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have long questioned the appropriateness of subsidizing leveraged homeownership in this way
18:641:50843:14:25:72:215:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Glaeser and Shapiro 2003).
18:642:50870:25:15:89:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A third view is that the problems had recent institutional origins in looser underwriting
18:643:50959:15:14:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards (Mayer et al. 2009) that increased the supply of mortgage lending (Mian and
18:644:51044:14:15:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SuÖ 2009), and in mortgage innovation during the credit boom of the early and mid 2000s.
18:645:51132:15:14:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At this time many new types of mortgages appeared (Committee on the Global Financial
18:646:51216:14:18:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:System 2006, Scanlon et al.  2008).   While terminology varies from country to country
18:647:51302:18:16:81:539:147:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:10An alternative response to a volatile ináation history is to denominate mortgages in foreign currency.
18:648:51406:16:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:During the credit boom, foreign-currency mortgages were popular in countries such as Iceland, Poland, and
18:649:51511:12:11:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Russia.  Domestic-currency depreciation during the Önancial crisis made these mortgages una§ordable for
18:650:51614:11:0:72:231:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:borrowers, many of whom defaulted.
19:651:51650:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(frequently used terms include interest-only, hybrid, áexible, and option mortgages), the
19:652:51739:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:common feature of these new mortgages is that required payments are low initially ñbecause
19:653:51829:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the initial interest rate is low, and often also because principal is not initially repaid ñand
19:654:51924:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:then payments increase discretely after a few years.   Lower required payments make it
19:655:52010:14:15:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:possible to increase the amount borrowed if banks apply a Öxed ratio of mortgage payments
19:656:52099:15:14:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to income to judge mortgage a§ordability.  Amromin et al. (2011) show that in the US
19:657:52183:14:15:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market, these new mortgages were typically used by prime borrowers buying large houses
19:658:52269:15:25:72:195:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative to their income.
19:659:52294:25:14:89:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mortgages of this sort create a strong incentive to reÖnance at the moment when re-
19:660:52377:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quired payments increase.  Anticipating that creditworthy borrowers will reÖnance, mort-
19:661:52465:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gage lenders set high rates for those who do not. In an environment with fully rational and
19:662:52556:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time-consistent borrowers and lenders, and no foreclosure externalities, this structure can be
19:663:52650:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a good approximation to the solution of an optimal dynamic contracting problem (Piskorski
19:664:52739:14:15:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Tchistyi 2010, 2011).  However, it can create several problems if these assumptions
19:665:52826:15:14:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fail.  First, borrowers with present-biased preferences may borrow and consume too much
19:666:52913:14:14:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when o§ered larger mortgages (Ghent 2011, Mian and SuÖ 2009).  Second, unsophisticated
19:667:52999:14:15:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers who fail to reÖnance when they can do so will cross-subsidize more sophisticated
19:668:53089:15:14:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrowers, the problem identiÖed by Miles (2004). Third, the system relies on the availabil-
19:669:53181:14:15:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ity of reÖnancing.  It breaks down when house prices fall and credit conditions deteriorate,
19:670:53273:15:14:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and in these circumstances lenders may have to protect their interests by foreclosing. Thus
19:671:53364:14:15:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the new mortgages of the 2000s are similar to the Öve-year balloon mortgages of the 1920s
19:672:53453:15:25:72:445:407:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:in their potential to generate economically damaging foreclosure waves.11
19:673:53526:25:25:89:203:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mortgage modiÖcation
19:674:53546:25:15:89:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is a great deal of concern about the high level of foreclosures since 2007.  Some
19:675:53633:15:14:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observers argue that given the loss of value in foreclosure, private lenders should slow fore-
19:676:53727:14:15:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:closures, or modify mortgages to reduce payments for a period of time, or even write down
19:677:53816:15:14:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:principal.  An obvious objection is that if this were optimal for lenders, they would do it
19:678:53907:14:25:72:320:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:voluntarily.  This can be countered in two ways.
19:679:53955:25:15:89:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A Örst argument is that securitized mortgages create conáicts of interest between mort-
19:680:54042:15:14:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gage servicers and ultimate investors; servicers bear more of the costs of modiÖcation, while
19:681:54135:14:15:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investors receive more of the beneÖts, and this agency problem causes insu¢ cient modiÖca-
19:682:54225:15:14:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion.  Several recent papers compare modiÖcation rates and outcomes for securitized and
19:683:54312:14:14:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:directly held mortgages (Adelino et al. 2009, Agarwal et al. 2011, Foote et al. 2010, Piskorski
19:684:54407:14:26:72:134:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:et al. 2011).
19:685:54420:26:17:89:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second argument is that negative externalities from foreclosures make the socially

19:687:54602:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:et al. (2012) point out that the decline in short-term Treasury bill rates during the Önancial crisis o§set
19:688:54709:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the increase in credit spreads caused by mortgage rate resets; however, it is still the case that rate resets
19:689:54818:12:11:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:prevented borrowers from beneÖting from falling interest rates as they would have done if they had taken
19:690:54922:11:0:72:177:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:out plain-vanilla ARMs.
20:691:54947:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimal foreclosure rate lower than the privately optimal one.  Mian et al. (2011) argue
20:692:55035:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that US states that slow down foreclosures have recently performed better than those that
20:693:55124:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allow rapid foreclosures; Gerardi et al.  (2011) counter that slower foreclosures still take
20:694:55216:15:14:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:place eventually, generating the same or perhaps even greater external e§ects as houses are
20:695:55307:14:26:72:362:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:occupied for longer periods of time by distressed owners.
20:696:55364:26:14:89:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Whatever the ultimate outcome of this debate, it is clear that mortgage modiÖcation
20:697:55447:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is much more costly ñand perhaps prohibitively so ñif undistressed borrowers who would
20:698:55533:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:otherwise pay their mortgages in full manage to obtain modiÖcation (Mayer et al. 2011). To
20:699:55623:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:avoid this, White (2009) suggests using the bankruptcy courts, allowing bankruptcy judges
20:700:55712:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to modify mortgages in bankruptcy when this would be in the interest of mortgage holders.
20:701:55801:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Congress discussed this as a retroactive measure (ìcramdownî) during the global Önancial
20:702:55889:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:crisis, but ultimately rejected such an ex post alteration of mortgage contracts.  However,
20:703:55980:15:25:72:409:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it may well make sense as a standard feature of future mortgages.
20:704:56045:25:14:89:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Whether mortgages are modiÖed by lenders or by bankruptcy judges, an important issue
20:705:56129:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is how to structure such modiÖcations to minimize the probability of subsequent re-default.
20:706:56220:15:14:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Das (2011) argues that principal reduction is most e§ective in this regard, and Doviak and
20:707:56310:14:15:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:MacDonald (2011) and Haughwout et al. (2010) provide supporting empirical evidence for
20:708:56396:15:25:72:133:454:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:this claim.12
20:709:56409:25:14:89:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is also room for policy to reduce the externalities created by those foreclosures
20:710:56496:14:15:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that do occur. To the extent that externalities result from vacant properties, it is appealing
20:711:56590:15:14:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to try to rent out foreclosed homes rather than selling them to new homeowners.  The US
20:712:56677:14:15:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government is actively exploring ways to encourage such transitions from owner occupancy
20:713:56765:15:14:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to rental housing. This is consistent with a new appreciation of the economic advantages of
20:714:56856:14:25:72:316:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a vibrant rental sector in residential real estate.
20:715:56907:25:26:89:165:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mortgage form
20:716:56920:26:14:89:540:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:US borrowers and regulators retain a strong attachment to long-term Öxed-rate mortgages
20:717:57007:14:15:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with minimal prepayment penalties. These traditional FRMs have an overwhelming market
20:718:57092:15:14:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share, especially after the extremely poor performance of complex adjustable-rate mortgages
20:719:57183:14:14:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that were issued during the credit boom of the 2000s.  The US system will continue to
20:720:57268:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rely primarily on FRMs unless a catastrophic increase in ináation volatility makes them
20:721:57355:15:25:72:139:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:una§ordable.
20:722:57367:25:15:89:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The popularity of FRMs does not, however, justify subsidizing these mortgages through
20:723:57452:15:14:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government intervention.  As Lea and Sanders (2011) point out, countries with a greater
20:724:57539:14:15:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reliance on ARMs have just as high homeownership rates as the US, and have done no
20:725:57621:15:17:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worse in the recent downturn.  ARMs have the advantage that lower interest rates reduce
20:726:57708:17:16:81:539:148:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:12Edmans (2010) proposes a variant of principal reduction, structured as a cash payment to a borrower
20:727:57809:16:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:at mortgage maturity if all payments are made, and therefore not requiring any modiÖcation of the original
20:728:57915:12:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mortgage terms.  Mulligan (2010) criticizes federal mortgage modiÖcation programs for favoring interest
20:729:58018:12:0:72:476:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reductions over principal reductions and for e§ectively increasing marginal income tax rates.
21:730:58113:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:defaults even when house price declines prevent mortgage borrowers from reÖnancing. And
21:731:58200:14:25:72:430:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regulation can limit the complexity of ARMs without favoring FRMs.
21:732:58266:25:15:89:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Beyond this, economists have suggested several alternative mortgage forms that have
21:733:58349:15:14:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attractive properties relative to standard FRMs and ARMs.  First, an automatically reÖ-
21:734:58436:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nancing FRM with no home equity extraction would address several problems that behav-
21:735:58521:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ioral economists have highlighted with the conventional FRM. By automatically lowering
21:736:58607:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:required monthly payments when long-term nominal interest rates decline su¢ ciently, such
21:737:58696:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a mortgage would eliminate reÖnancing costs, reÖnancing mistakes, and the temptation to
21:738:58783:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deplete home equity at reÖnancing dates.  Second, an ináation-indexed FRM, whose nom-
21:739:58868:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inal payments vary in proportion to the price level (not the ináation rate or the nominal
21:740:58957:15:14:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rate), would eliminate the ináation sensitivity of a nominal FRM without creating
21:741:59047:14:15:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the instability of payment streams implied by an ARM. Third, a compromise between an
21:742:59131:15:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ARM and a FRM could be constructed by gradually adjusting both nominal payments and
21:743:59214:14:15:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the nominal principal balance in response to variation in short-term nominal interest rates.
21:744:59306:15:14:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Such a compromise mortgage would be less ináation-sensitive than a conventional FRM and
21:745:59393:14:25:72:385:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would have more stable payments than a conventional ARM.
21:746:59449:25:15:89:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:More radically, some economists have advocated mortgages with principal balances that
21:747:59534:15:14:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:automatically adjust to the regional level of house prices (Shiller et al. 2011). This transfers
21:748:59630:14:25:72:533:440:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:house price risk from borrowers to lenders without relying on costly foreclosures to do so.13
21:749:59723:25:26:89:243:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Consumer Önancial protection
21:750:59751:26:14:89:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A related aspect of mortgage policy is regulation to ensure that borrowers, who are often
21:751:59840:14:15:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Önancially unsophisticated, understand the choices they are o§ered and the fees that go along
21:752:59933:15:14:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with them.  Consumer Önancial regulation can take several forms surveyed by Campbell et
21:753:60020:14:25:72:132:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:al. (2011b).
21:754:60032:25:15:89:540:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, regulation can simplify cost comparison of alternative mortgages, in the spirit of
21:755:60121:15:14:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the 1968 Truth in Lending Act (TILA). One way to do this, suggested by Thaler and Sun-
21:756:60207:14:15:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stein (2008, Chapter 8), is to require that mortgage terms be made available electronically
21:757:60298:15:14:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in standardized form to permit the development of online sites for comparison shopping. If
21:758:60388:14:14:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:housing tenure and prepayment data were also made available, more realistic cost compar-
21:759:60476:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:isons could be based on historical average behavior, possibly for subgroups of the population,
21:760:60570:15:14:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rather than on arbitrary assumptions such as the standard assumption that a mortgage is
21:761:60657:14:26:72:159:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:held to maturity.
21:762:60674:26:14:89:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, regulation can facilitate risk evaluation. In this regard it is key to o§er house-
21:763:60764:14:19:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:holds measures of risk as well as expected cost. Standard annual percentage rate (APR)
21:764:60850:19:15:81:539:161:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:13There is a debate about whether homeowners should wish to lay o§ house price risk; Sinai and Souleles
21:765:60953:15:12:72:540:146:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2005) argue that they should not, because houses provide a known stream of housing services to long-term
21:766:61058:12:12:72:540:134:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:residents of an area and therefore insure their housing consumption against áuctuations in rents.  However,
21:767:61165:12:12:72:540:122:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this motivation for bearing house price risk does not apply to homeowners who plan to downsize, or to move
21:768:61271:12:0:72:442:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to a distant location whose house prices are uncorrelated with their current location.
22:769:61359:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:calculations are helpful for comparing mortgages with similar risks, but not for comparing
22:770:61449:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:FRMs with ARMs, or for comparing ARMs with di§erent initial Öxed-rate periods, interest
22:771:61536:14:26:72:268:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate caps, and other complex features.
22:772:61574:26:14:89:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, regulation can promote standard mortgages. The case for doing this is that one or
22:773:61662:14:15:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two standard mortgages may be reasonable choices for most households; if these mortgages
22:774:61750:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are o§ered as a default option, many households will choose them and this may reduce the
22:775:61838:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incidence of Önancial mistakes. The existence of standard mortgages also simpliÖes the task
22:776:61929:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of cost comparison, since households can concentrate on standard mortgage terms rather
22:777:62015:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than considering a vast array of special features.  Woodward (2004) and Woodward and
22:778:62099:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hall (2012) present evidence that simple mortgage forms are associated with lower fees,
22:779:62186:15:25:72:298:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particularly for less sophisticated borrowers.
22:780:62232:25:15:89:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the past, US government sponsorship of the GSEs subsidized long-term nominal FRMs
22:781:62316:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and helped them become de facto standard mortgages. The disadvantages of this approach
22:782:62402:14:14:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have been discussed above. A more explicit regulatory policy favoring certain mortgages, for
22:783:62494:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:example by lowering capital requirements on banks holding them, or by requiring consumers
22:784:62583:15:25:72:446:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to qualify for non-standard mortgages, would be a preferable alternative.
22:785:62656:25:15:89:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A fourth response to the problems consumers face in choosing mortgage products is to
22:786:62740:15:14:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regulate the mortgage origination process. The Safe Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 aims
22:787:62827:14:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to establish minimum state standards for licensing mortgage originators. A more drastic
22:788:62914:14:15:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:approach would be to establish a Öduciary duty for mortgage brokers ñthat is, a legal duty
22:789:63004:15:25:72:465:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that they use their best judgment in acting in the best interest of borrowers.
22:790:63082:25:15:89:540:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given the limitations of existing mortgage contracts, it is important that regulation of
22:791:63170:15:14:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages should not be so heavy-handed that it precludes experimentation with new ideas.
22:792:63259:14:14:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One possible role for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is to encourage small-scale
22:793:63349:14:15:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experimentation with promising new mortgage forms.  Consumer Önancial protection may
22:794:63433:15:14:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also help constructive mortgage innovation indirectly, by reducing the cross-subsidies from
22:795:63524:14:15:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:naive to sophisticated borrowers that help to entrench confusing but commonly used forms
22:796:63612:15:25:72:141:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of mortgages.
22:797:63625:25:25:89:179:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mortgage funding
22:798:63641:25:15:89:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The funding model that developed in the US during the 1990s and 2000s has become
22:799:63721:15:14:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependent on a level of government intervention that is probably unsustainable. The GSEs
22:800:63809:14:15:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have been in government conservatorship since September 2008, but they continue to hold
22:801:63896:15:14:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large mortgage portfolios and to provide credit guarantees. There is consensus among many
22:802:63985:14:15:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economists that a way must be found to restore private funding of mortgages with less
22:803:64070:15:25:72:244:165:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:reliance on taxpayer guarantees.14
22:804:64104:25:17:89:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Under these circumstances I agree with Lea (2011) that it is wise to look overseas to see
22:805:64193:17:15:81:539:123:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:14See for example Acharya et al (2011), Baily (2011), Fuster and Vickery (2012), Ja§ee and Quigley (2011),
22:806:64299:15:0:72:414:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and US Treasury and Department of Housing and Urban Development (2011).
23:807:64372:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if lessons from foreign markets can be applied to the US. A particularly promising model
23:808:64460:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is the Danish mortgage system, because Denmark has traditionally used FRMs with no
23:809:64542:14:15:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prepayment penalties, much like those favored in the US, and because the Danish system
23:810:64628:15:25:72:517:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:proved relatively stable even during the global Önancial crisis (Gyntelberg et al. 2012).
23:811:64717:25:15:89:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Danish model has several appealing features.  First, mortgages are funded using
23:812:64800:15:14:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:callable covered bonds with strict limits on maturity transformation. As mortgage demand
23:813:64888:14:14:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has shifted towards shorter-term bonds in the last few years, mortgage bond maturities have
23:814:64979:14:15:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:declined in parallel.  The use of covered bonds exposes Danish mortgage lenders to credit
23:815:65068:15:14:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risk, which has desirable incentive e§ects, while interest-rate risk is transferred away from
23:816:65161:14:15:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deposit-Önanced institutions and towards long-term investors who are better able to bear
23:817:65249:15:25:72:83:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it.
23:818:65252:25:15:89:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, the Danish system treats movers and continuing homeowners equally, by allowing
23:819:65338:15:14:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:movers either to buy back mortgage bonds in the market or to pass their mortgages on to
23:820:65425:14:14:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:new homeowners when rates increase. These provisions eliminate the e§ects of idiosyncratic
23:821:65515:14:15:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:moving uncertainty on individual welfare, and an important source of aggregate uncertainty
23:822:65605:15:14:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in pricing mortgage bonds.  The ability of homeowners to e§ectively reÖnance by buying
23:823:65691:14:15:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage bonds also provides a source of liquidity for the mortgage market in a crisis; if
23:824:65781:15:14:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investors dump mortgage bonds, homeowners can buy them just as companies can buy back
23:825:65866:14:25:72:247:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their stock during a market crash.
23:826:65900:25:15:89:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, the Danish system constructs large, nationally diversiÖed mortgage pools that
23:827:65984:15:14:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:therefore are relatively liquid because there is little incentive to obtain private information
23:828:66079:14:26:72:239:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about the underlying mortgages.
23:829:66110:26:14:89:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, defaults and foreclosures have been a less serious problem in Denmark, despite a
23:830:66199:14:14:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large recent decline in house prices, because of a combination of strict regulation, conservative
23:831:66296:14:15:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:underwriting incentivized by the covered bond system, and the use of recourse mortgages.
23:832:66384:15:14:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:During the Önancial crisis, the central bank did have to intervene to ensure adequate funding
23:833:66477:14:15:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of mortgage lenders, but the degree of intervention appears to have been much smaller than
23:834:66567:15:25:72:193:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was required in the US.
23:835:66590:25:14:89:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The US has had some limited experience with covered bonds, notably those issued by
23:836:66672:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Washington Mutual (Bergstresser et al.  2009).  WaMuís covered bonds paid o§ in full,
23:837:66757:15:14:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:despite the originatorís bankruptcy in September 2008.  Congress has recently considered
23:838:66845:14:15:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:legislation to provide a statutory framework for covered bonds in the US. One challenge is
23:839:66935:15:14:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:how to reconcile the protection of covered bondholders with the obligation of the Federal De-
23:840:67028:14:15:72:539:191:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:posit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to resolve failed banks at minimum cost to taxpayers.15
23:841:67118:15:18:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In addition, since covered bonds keep credit risk on the books of mortgage originators, they
23:842:67210:18:15:81:539:158:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:15See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2011) and US Treasury (2008) for recent statements on
23:843:67308:15:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:covered bond design issues in the US context.  The key issue is whether, upon the failure of a mortgage
23:844:67411:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:originator, the collateral for covered bonds is sequestered for the life of the bonds, or whether the FDIC has
23:845:67521:12:0:72:533:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the right to pay o§ the covered bonds at par and reclaim the collateral as it resolves the failed originator.
24:846:67632:0:14:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imply that Önancial institutions are exposed to the risk of an aggregate house price decline.
24:847:67725:14:14:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If the US moves towards greater use of covered bonds, it may be useful to develop derivatives
24:848:67818:14:51:72:526:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:markets to allow US Önancial institutions to hedge their aggregate house price exposure.
24:849:67906:51:37:72:194:642:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:8  Conclusion
24:850:67919:37:15:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is a strong public interest in an e¢ cient and stable housing Önance system.  An un-
24:851:68009:15:14:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regulated system may generate ine¢ ciencies in several ways, including negative externalities
24:852:68102:14:15:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from foreclosures, Önancial system instability, and high costs for unsophisticated borrowers.
24:853:68195:15:14:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The US has a complex regulatory and tax regime for mortgages that has evolved with the pri-
24:854:68286:14:14:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mary goal of promoting homeownership, but is not obviously successful in this regard. This
24:855:68376:14:15:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regime has many unintended consequences that have become particularly obvious during the
24:856:68464:15:25:72:182:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recent Önancial crisis.
24:857:68487:25:15:89:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the long run, it may be possible for economists to solve the optimal dynamic contract-
24:858:68576:15:14:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ing problem and recommend an ideal mortgage system on this basis. At this time, however,
24:859:68664:14:15:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it is too hard to do this exercise without assuming away the market failures that justify
24:860:68753:15:14:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage regulation in the Örst place. For now, mortgage market design must proceed in a
