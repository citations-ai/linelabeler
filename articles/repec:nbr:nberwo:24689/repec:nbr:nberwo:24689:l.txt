2:26:1152:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We review the evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is having a large effect on the economy. 
2:27:1250:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Across a variety of statistics—including robotics shipments, AI startups, and patent counts—there 
2:28:1347:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:is evidence of a large increase in AI-related activity. We also review recent research in this area 
2:29:1446:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:which  suggests that  AI  and  robotics  have  the  potential  to  increase  productivity  growth  but  may 
2:30:1553:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:have  mixed  effects on  labor,  particularly  in  the  short  run.  In  particular,  some  occupations  and 
2:31:1661:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:industries may do well while others experience labor market upheaval. We then consider current 
2:32:1755:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:and potential policies around AI that may help to boost productivity growth while also mitigating 
2:33:1852:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:any  labor  market  downsides  including evaluating  the  pros  and  cons  of  an  AI  specific  regulator, 
2:34:1959:14:14:71:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:expanded  antitrust  enforcement,  and  alternative strategies  for  dealing  with  the  labor-market 
2:35:2060:14:42:71:444:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:impacts of AI, including universal basic income and guaranteed employment.

3:46:2354:0:30:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:47:2370:30:21:108:544:678:144:Times:144:Times:A:Artificial intelligence (AI) has been advancing rapidly in recent years, measured both in 
3:48:2460:21:21:72:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of the amount of resources devoted to it and also in terms of its outputs.2 The Economist 
3:49:2554:21:20:72:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated  that  AI-related  mergers  and  acquisitions  were  26  times  larger  in  2017  than  in  2015.3 
3:50:2662:20:21:72:543:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:Increased investment has been driven by and also contributed to rapid increases in the technical 
3:51:2759:21:21:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). For example, according to the AI Index, error rates for 
3:52:2861:21:20:72:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:image  recognition  has  dropped  from  29  percent  to  less  than  3 percent  between  2010  and  2017,  
3:53:2968:20:21:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:surpassing human performance levels.4 These rapid advancements apply not just AI, but also to 
3:54:3062:21:21:72:542:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:robotics, sensors, and the connection of them all via digitization (also known as “Industry 4.0”). 
3:55:3161:21:20:72:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:These advancements have started to manifest themselves in a variety of applications, including AI 
3:56:3259:20:21:72:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:beating humans at complex strategy games,5 the creation of chatbots and virtual assistants such as 
3:57:3358:21:31:72:451:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alexa and Siri,6 and Amazon’s new cashier-less and cash-less grocery stores.7 
3:58:3435:31:20:108:545:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  has  led  both  to  excitement  about  the  capability  of  technology  to  boost  economic  
3:59:3534:20:21:72:543:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth and to concern about the fate of human workers in a world in which computer algorithms 
3:60:3628:21:21:72:542:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:can perform many of the functions that a human can (e.g., Frey and Osborne 2017, Furman 2016a). 
3:61:3724:21:21:72:542:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:Some have taken more extreme views. For example, Elon Musk has stated his belief that “AI is a 
3:62:3819:21:30:72:355:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.”8  
3:63:3879:30:21:107:543:327:144:Times:144:Times:A:Throughout  history,  there  has  been  a concern  that  automation,  including  mechanization,  
3:64:3976:21:21:71:542:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:computing, and more recently AI and robotics, would kill jobs and generate irreversible damage 
3:65:4071:21:20:71:545:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  the  labor  market.  For  example,  Keynes  (1930)  described  technological  unemployment  as  
3:66:4171:20:29:71:543:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:“unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the 
3:67:4263:29:9:215:217:236:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
3:68:4321:9:15:72:525:227:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 Artificial Intelligence is a loose term used to describe a range of advanced technologies that exhibit human-like 
3:69:4437:15:12:72:535:212:99:Times:99:Times:F:intelligence, including machine learning, autonomous robotics and vehicles, computer vision, language processing, 
3:70:4551:12:8:72:217:200:99:Times:99:Times:F:virtual agents and neural networks.

4:82:5490:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:pace at which we can find new uses for labour.” Similarly, Leontief (1983), observing the dramatic 
4:83:5589:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:improvements in the processing power of computer chips, worried that people would be replaced 
4:84:5683:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:by machines, just as horses were made obsolete by the invention of internal combustion engines. 
4:85:5778:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the past, automation has often substituted for human labor in the short term, but has led to the 
4:86:5878:21:21:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:creation of complementary jobs in the long term (Autor 2015). Historically, automation appears to 
4:87:5976:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:have had different effects by occupation. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s middle-skill jobs 
4:88:6072:21:20:71:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:were displaced  by  automation,  leading  to  labor  market  polarization  (Autor,  Kearney  and  Katz,  
4:89:6177:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:2006), though there is some evidence that labor market polarization has not continued in the last 
4:90:6275:21:31:72:335:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:decade or two (Schmitt, Shierholz, and Mishel, 2013). 
4:91:6329:31:20:107:542:512:144:Times:144:Times:A:Despite  the  complex  effects  of  automation  on  labor,  there  is  ample  evidence  that, 
4:92:6423:20:21:72:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:historically,  automation  fosters  productivity  growth.  For  example,  Crafts  (2004)  documents  the  
4:93:6529:21:21:71:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects  of  steam  engine  technology  on  productivity  in  the  UK  in  the  19th  Century.  Rosenberg 
4:94:6635:21:21:72:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1983) and Schurr (1983) document the effect of electrification on manufacturing productivity in 
4:95:6732:21:20:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:the early 20th Century. More recently, information technology (IT) has been credited with broad 
4:96:6828:20:21:72:542:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive impacts on productivity (e.g., Oliner, Sichel, and Stiroh, 2007; Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 
4:97:6929:21:21:72:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:2008). Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2012) show that better management of IT explains part of 
4:98:7022:21:30:72:352:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:the difference in productivity between US and UK firms.  
4:99:7079:30:21:108:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:A:Recent productivity and labor trends highlight the importance of understanding the effect 
4:100:7169:21:21:71:542:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:of AI on the economy. Slowing economic growth over the past decade underscores the importance 
4:101:7263:21:20:71:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:of AI to deliver on its potential productivity benefits. Furman (2017) reports that 36 of 37 advanced 
4:102:7365:20:21:72:543:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:economies  had  slower  productivity  growth  in  2006-2016  compared  to  1996-2006. Across  these  
4:103:7466:21:21:72:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:B:economies, growth has slowed from a 2.7 percent average growth rate in the earlier decade to a 
4:104:7561:21:20:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:1.0 percent average annual growth rate in the past decade. In order to boost productivity growth, 
4:105:7659:20:21:72:543:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:it will be important to ensure that there are policies in place supporting efficient AI development 
4:106:7759:21:31:72:299:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:and use, by both incumbent firms and startups. 
4:107:7806:31:21:108:543:161:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another important trend is the long term decline in the male labor force participation rate, 
4:108:7899:21:20:72:542:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:which has fallen from a high of 98 percent in the 1950s to 89 percent in 2016 (Council of Economic 
4:109:7998:20:21:72:543:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:Advisers 2016). This decline is concentrated among men with a high school degree or less. The 
4:110:8092:21:21:72:545:99:144:Times:144:Times:B:decline in  participation  is  concerning  because  it  suggests  that  individuals  are  experiencing  
4:111:8196:21:0:72:543:78:144:Times:144:Times:B:difficulty learning new skills and transitioning from one occupation to another (indeed, there has 
5:112:8296:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:also been a long term decline in labor market transitions and geographic mobility (Molloy, Smith, 
5:113:8394:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:Wozniak, 2014)). To the extent that AI innovations lead to changes in occupations, then it will be 
5:114:8493:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:important for the workforce to learn new skills to enable continued employment or transition to 
5:115:8589:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:new employment. One particular concern with AI is that the changes will happen so quickly that 
5:116:8684:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:there will be sustained periods of time in which large segments of the population are not working 
5:117:8782:21:21:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:(see Goolsbee (2017) for a discussion of speed of adoption and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016) for 
5:118:8878:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:a useful model). These rapid changes, and the potential disruption to the workforce, suggest it is 
5:119:8977:20:31:72:434:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:important that there are policies in place to support workers and retraining. 
5:120:9055:31:21:108:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:A:The paper proceeds as follows. The first part of Section 2 provides a number of basic facts 
5:121:9147:21:20:72:544:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:about  AI  investment,  robotics  shipments,  and  patents  for  robots  and  AI.  We  focus  some  of  our  
5:122:9256:20:21:72:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:attention on robotics as they are easier to measure and have some clear analogies to AI. The second 
5:123:9356:21:21:72:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:part of Section 2 provides a brief overview of research on the links between AI (and robotics) and 
5:124:9455:21:21:72:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic outcomes including labor and productivity. Sections 3 and 4 then discuss specific recent 
5:125:9553:21:20:71:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy proposals, discussing the tradeoffs and issues raised by them, with Section 3 focusing on 
5:126:9650:20:21:72:544:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:AI  and  competition  policy  and  with Section  4  focusing  on  AI  and  the  labor  market. Section  5

5:130:9883:30:31:71:192:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:2. What Do We Know? 
5:131:9903:31:30:71:168:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.1. Basic Statistics 
5:132:9924:30:21:107:545:245:144:Times:144:Times:A: There are multiple metrics tracking the ability of AI to perform certain specific functions.  
5:133:10018:21:21:71:543:224:144:Times:144:Times:B:For  example,  as  reported  in  Felten,  Raj  and  Seamans  (2018)  seven  different  metrics  track  AI’s  
5:134:10127:21:20:71:547:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance   for   image   recognition.   Across   all   these   metrics,   performance   has   increased   
5:135:10236:20:21:71:544:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:dramatically  over  the  past  decade.  Similar  increases  in  performance  are  found  across  multiple  
5:136:10343:21:21:71:545:162:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories,  including real-time  video  games,  abstract  strategy  games  (e.g.,  Chess,  Go),  video  
5:137:10448:21:21:71:544:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:recognition,  reading  comprehension,  translation,  and  others.9  Many  of  the  these  performance  
5:138:10551:21:22:71:543:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases  are  due  to  breakthroughs  in  various  machine  learning  techniques,  and,  as  described

6:142:10843:0:21:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:below,  these  scientific  breakthroughs  are  starting  to  find  their  way  to  commercial  applications.  
6:143:10953:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, some have argued that while there has been rapid progress on the scientific front in the 
6:144:11051:21:31:72:512:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:past decade, there may be limits to what current techniques can accomplish (Marcus 2018). 
6:145:11141:31:20:107:542:636:144:Times:144:Times:A:Aggregate statistics provide ample evidence that the deployment and use of AI and other 
6:146:11229:20:21:71:544:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:advanced  technologies  has  increased  over  the  past  decade.  The  AI  Index,  a  non-profit  project  
6:147:11336:21:21:71:550:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:designed to track activity and progress in AI,   provides a number of interesting facts designed to 
6:148:11436:21:20:71:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:track  the  scientific  progress  in  and  impact  of  artificial  intelligence  and  robotics.10  For  example,  
6:149:11550:20:21:71:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:academic  papers  focused  on  AI  have  increased  9  times  since  1996;  in  comparison,  computer  
6:150:11653:21:21:71:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:science  papers  have  increased  6  times  since  1996.  The  number  of  students  enrolled  in  artificial  
6:151:11764:21:20:71:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:intelligence and machine learning courses at Stanford has increased 11 times since 1996; similar 
6:152:11861:20:21:71:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends  are  observed  at  other  universities  including  UC  Berkeley,  University  of  Illinois,  Georgia  
6:153:11971:21:21:71:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tech, and others. The share of jobs requiring AI skills has increased almost 5 times since 2013 
6:154:12067:21:21:71:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and  growth  is  especially  rapid  in  Canada  and  the  UK).  There  appears  to  be  particularly  high  
6:155:12176:21:20:71:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand  for  workers  with  machine  learning  or  deep  learning  skills.  The  statistics  collected  and  
6:156:12285:20:21:71:542:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:published  by  the  AI  Index  provide  a  useful  snapshot  of  progress  in  AI  related  research  and  its 
6:157:12396:21:31:71:336:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:growing impact on society, particularly the workforce. 
6:158:12451:31:20:107:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:A:By many measures, investment in AI, both by established firms and by venture capitalists 
6:159:12540:20:21:71:544:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  startups,  has  increased.  The  McKinsey  Global  Institute  (MGI  Report  2017)  estimates  that  
6:160:12645:21:21:71:543:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:established firms spent between $18 and $27 billion on internal corporate investment in AI-related 
6:161:12744:21:20:71:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:projects  in  2016. Such  firms  also  spend  money  on  AI-related  investments  in  the  form  of  
6:162:12845:20:21:71:544:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:acquisitions.  Facebook,  Google,  Amazon  and  Apple  have  bought  up  hundreds  of  innovative  
6:163:12944:21:21:71:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:B:startups over the past decade, including ones that focus on AI or AI-related technologies.11 MGI 
6:164:13041:21:30:72:506:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:also notes that established firms spent $2 to $3 billion on AI-related M&A in 2016 alone.  
6:165:13132:30:21:108:543:203:144:Times:144:Times:A:While less in dollar value, investment in AI-related startups has also been increasing. An

8:192:14975:28:20:108:543:455:144:Times:144:Times:A:This rapid increase is likely due to a combination of factors including a decrease in robot

8:195:15264:21:21:71:542:393:144:Times:144:Times:B:and an increase in number and skill of robot integrators. Graetz and Michaels (2015) estimate that 
8:196:15363:21:20:71:543:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:robot prices decreased 50-80 percent between 1990 and 2005. According to Green Leigh and Kraft 
8:197:15457:20:21:72:544:352:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2017)  integrators—firms  which  specialize  in  designing  and  building  automation  solutions  for

8:204:16131:21:21:71:542:207:144:Times:144:Times:B:into the U.S. automotive sector; this figure has been more or less constant over time. Acemoglu 
8:205:16227:21:21:71:543:186:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Restrepo (2017) estimate that automotive purchasers account for about 39 percent of the stock 
8:206:16324:21:20:71:543:165:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  robots  in  the  United  States.  Shipments  into  the  automotive  sector  have  increased  about  90

10:232:18266:21:21:72:543:383:144:Times:144:Times:B:Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb. A wide variety of topics are covered, including for example the 
10:233:18361:21:20:71:542:362:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects  of  AI  on  competition  policy  (Varian 2017),  on  innovation  (Cockburn, Henderson,  and

10:236:18659:21:20:71:543:300:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristic of the EAI handbook chapters is the reliance on theoretical models and aggregate, 
10:237:18756:20:21:71:542:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:national level statistics, rather than firm-level data. This is because there is currently a paucity of 
10:238:18860:21:21:71:542:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:data about the use of AI, robotics, and other advanced technologies at the firm level. Mitchell and

10:241:19142:30:21:107:544:187:144:Times:144:Times:A: Economists  are  generally  enthusiastic  about  the  prospects  of  AI  on  economic  growth.  
10:242:19238:21:21:71:542:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:Economic literature has linked innovation to economic growth (Romer 1990). Many believe that 
10:243:19331:21:20:71:542:145:144:Times:144:Times:B:AI and other forms of advanced automation, including robots and sensors, can be thought of as a 
10:244:19427:20:21:71:542:125:144:Times:144:Times:B:general purpose technology (GPT) that enable lots of follow-on innovation that ultimately leads to 
10:245:19526:21:21:71:542:104:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity growth (Cockburn, Henderson, and Stern, 2017). However, if this theory is true, then 
10:246:19624:21:0:71:543:83:144:Times:144:Times:B:it  begs  the  question  why,  despite  recent  rapid  technological  progress  in  AI,  there  are  not  (yet)  
11:247:19739:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponding increases in productivity gain.  In a recent paper, Brynjolfsson, Rock and Syverson 
11:248:19837:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2017) explore this question and argue this is due to a notable lag between technological progress 
11:249:19936:21:20:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the commercialization of new innovative ideas building on this progress which often rely on 
11:250:20032:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary investments. The authors argue that lags of this sort are particularly notable in the 
11:251:20132:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:case of GPTs, citing historical examples of electrification and the integrated circuit. On the other 
11:252:20233:21:21:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:hand,  Robert  Gordon  (2014)  reminds  us  that  even  though  Moore’s  Law  has  led  to  exponential  
11:253:20338:21:20:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:improvement  in  computing  performance,  there  has  been  no  such  analogous  improvement  in  
11:254:20436:20:21:72:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity. Moreover,  Bloom,  Jones,  Van  Reenen,  and  Webb (2017)  document  the  many  
11:255:20530:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:domains  in  which  ideas  are  getting  harder  to  find—that  is  larger  research  inputs  are  needed  to  
11:256:20641:21:30:72:271:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:produce additional productivity outputs.  
11:257:20683:30:21:108:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:A: The case for productivity growth from AI can look to empirical research on robotics for 
11:258:20771:21:21:72:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:support.  According  to  Graetz  and  Michaels  (2015),  robotics  added  an  estimated  0.4  percentage 
11:259:20876:21:21:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:points  of  annual  GDP  growth  between  1993  and  2007  on  average  for  the  17  countries  in  their  
11:260:20984:21:20:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample (accounting for about one-tenth of GDP growth during this time period). The authors note 
11:261:21080:20:21:72:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:that these effects are of similar magnitude to the impact of steam engines on growth in the United 
11:262:21179:21:21:72:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kingdom. Other  studies  have  generally  found  a  positive  effect  of  robotics  on  productivity.  For  
11:263:21287:21:20:72:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:example,  in  what  appears  to  be  the  first  study  of  robots  on  firm-level  productivity  growth,  The 
11:264:21398:20:21:71:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:European Commission Report on Robotics and Employment (2016) finds evidence that the use of 
11:265:21490:21:21:71:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:industrial  robots  is  correlated  with  significantly  higher  levels  of  labor  productivity  among  the  
11:266:21600:21:30:71:278:305:144:Times:144:Times:B:3,000 manufacturing firms they surveyed.  
11:267:21642:30:31:71:74:275:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
11:268:21642:31:31:71:157:244:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.3 AI and Labor 
11:269:21658:31:20:107:542:213:144:Times:144:Times:A: To date AI has been too small a component of the overall economy to have a significant 
11:270:21745:20:21:71:545:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact  on  labor  markets.  In  fact,  in  the  last  decade  job  growth  has  generally  outperformed  
11:271:21851:21:21:71:543:172:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectations  while  GDP  growth  has  fallen  below  expectations—precisely  the  opposite  of  what  
11:272:21954:21:21:71:543:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be expected if automation were replacing significant amounts of labor. As just discussed, 
11:273:22050:21:20:71:542:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:however,  AI  has  been  growing  rapidly.  To  the  degree  this  leads  to  increases  in  output  per  hour 
11:274:22160:20:0:71:544:110:144:Times:144:Times:B:going  forward,  there  is  still  a  question  of  whether  higher  productivity  will  result  in  a  change  in  
12:275:22278:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:work hours. If hours are unaffected, output would rise, but it is also possible that hours could fall, 
12:276:22381:21:31:72:202:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:leaving output unchanged. 
12:277:22407:31:21:108:542:657:144:Times:144:Times:A: Three different perspectives, a theoretical perspective, an empirical/historical perspective, 
12:278:22501:21:20:72:542:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:and attempts to make granular predictions about nascent technologies, can each offer insight into 
12:279:22599:20:21:72:543:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:the effects of AI on labor market. A reasonable inference from these three perspectives is that, to 
12:280:22699:21:21:71:544:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:a first approximation, AI will not be labor displacing, but could still pose significant downsides 
12:281:22798:21:30:71:193:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:and raise other concerns. 
12:282:22824:30:21:107:543:544:144:Times:144:Times:A:From a theoretical perspective, innovation has four effects on labor markets. The first is 
12:283:22915:21:21:71:544:523:144:Times:144:Times:B:that automation can directly displace labor in the affected sector. The second is that automation 
12:284:23013:21:20:71:540:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:can create new jobs in new areas. Mandel (2017), for example, finds that job losses at brick-and-
12:285:23110:20:21:71:542:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortar department stores were more than made up for by new opportunities at fulfillment and call 
12:286:23207:21:21:71:543:461:144:Times:144:Times:B:centers.  Third,  higher  incomes  increase  demand  for  jobs  throughout  the  economy,  including  in  
12:287:23313:21:20:71:542:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:ways that are not directly linked to technology. For example, the share of workers in leisure and 
12:288:23411:20:21:71:544:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospitality in the United States has steadily trended upward as household incomes have risen as 
12:289:23507:21:21:71:543:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in Figure 5, enabling people to afford more restaurants and travel. Finally, technology may 
12:290:23605:21:21:71:542:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:replace specific tasks rather than entire jobs—leaving substantial room for human employment in 
12:291:23701:21:30:71:425:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:jobs that will be changed by worker’s having a new tool at their disposal.

12:293:23784:226:0:450:453:101:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
13:294:23786:0:21:108:546:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Past  experiences  bear  out  these  different  channels.  Bessen  (2018) argues  that  new  
13:295:23879:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:technologies should have a positive effect on employment if they improve productivity in markets 
13:296:23976:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:where there is a large amount of unmet demand. In the context of robotics and automation, Bessen 
13:297:24073:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that new computer technology is associated with employment declines in manufacturing, 
13:298:24168:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:where demand has generally been met, but is correlated with employment growth in less saturated, 
13:299:24265:21:21:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-manufacturing industries. If AI is similar to other types of automation, then one might expect 
13:300:24364:21:20:72:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar positive job creation spillovers. Dauth, Findeisen, Südekum, and Wößner (2017) combines 
13:301:24460:20:21:71:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:German  labor  market  data  with  IFR  robot  shipment  data  and  finds  that  while  each  additional  
13:302:24566:21:21:71:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:industrial robot leads to the loss of two manufacturing jobs, enough new jobs are created in the 
13:303:24663:21:20:71:547:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:service industry to offset and in some cases over-c ompensate for the negative employment effect 
13:304:24760:20:21:71:542:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:in manufacturing. Other evidence is more mixed. Graetz and Michaels (2015) find a noisy effect 
13:305:24855:21:21:71:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:of robot adoption in an industry on employment in that industry, whereas Acemoglu and Restrepo 
13:306:24950:21:21:71:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2017)  find  a  significant  negative  effect  of  robot  adoption  in  the  U.S.  automotive  sector  on  
13:307:25058:21:30:71:202:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment in that sector. 
13:308:25084:30:21:107:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  literature  has  also  taken  the  task  perspective,  including  applying  it  to  AI  specifically.  
13:309:25190:21:21:71:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:Such  an  approach  was  taken  by  Autor,  Levy  and  Murnane  (2003)  to  study  how  computer  use  
13:310:25293:21:20:71:545:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:affects  demand  for  occupational  skills.  For  example,  an  OECD  Report  (Arntz,  Gregory  and  
13:311:25394:20:21:71:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:Zierahn,  2016)  argues  that  there  may  be  task  variation  between  individuals  within  the  same  
13:312:25499:21:21:71:545:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:occupation.  For  example,  managers  of  different  firms  may  treat  shop-floor  labor  differently,  
13:313:25604:21:20:71:542:305:144:Times:144:Times:B:depending on whether they view workers as partners in the production process or as inputs into a 
13:314:25701:20:21:71:542:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:production function (Helper, Martins, and Seamans 2018). More generally, there is much evidence 
13:315:25797:21:21:71:544:264:144:Times:144:Times:B:that management practices vary across firms (Bloom et al. 2017), and prior research has shown 
13:316:25891:21:30:71:507:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the use of technology varies by management technique (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2000).  
13:317:25980:30:21:107:546:213:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  recent  study  by  Felten,  Raj,  and  Seamans  (2018)  links  past  advances  in  AI  to  
13:318:26074:21:21:71:542:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:occupational abilities, and finds some evidence that the Bureau of Labor Statistics was more likely 
13:319:26174:21:21:71:542:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:to update the definitions of occupations that were more impacted by advances in AI. Felten, Raj 
13:320:26270:21:20:71:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Seamans (2018) provide a method that could be used by other researchers and policymakers 
13:321:26363:20:21:72:544:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:to identify which occupations will be most affected by advances in different aspects of AI. In a 
13:322:26460:21:21:72:543:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:related paper, Brynjolfsson, Mitchell and Rock (2018) provide a rubric for calculating which tasks 
13:323:26559:21:0:72:264:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:are most affected by machine learning.  
14:324:26600:0:21:108:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Part of how all of these theoretical channels operate is through relative wages. For example, 
14:325:26694:21:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:a technology that replaces unskilled workers and complements skilled workers would result in a 
14:326:26789:21:20:72:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative  wage  decline  for  unskilled  workers,  maintaining  employment  in  both  sectors  but  at  a  
14:327:26896:20:21:72:542:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:different equilibrium price. In other words, employment may be preserved but at the cost of greater 
14:328:26996:21:31:72:126:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:inequality. 
14:329:27008:31:21:108:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:From an empirical perspective, there is both cross-sectional and time series evidence on 
14:330:27097:21:20:71:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:the impact of technology on labor markets. The cross-sectional evidence is that there is there no 
14:331:27195:20:21:71:542:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship between the level of productivity and the rate of employment as shown in Figure 6. 
14:332:27291:21:21:71:544:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:Luxembourg  has  much  higher  output  per  hour  than  Italy,  but  this  does  not  manifest  itself  in  
14:333:27399:21:20:71:544:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences  in  hours  per  person—instead  it  means  that  output  in  Luxembourg  is  higher.  The  
14:334:27503:20:21:71:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:historical evidence also shows that the unemployment rate has not exhibited an upward trend as 
14:335:27598:21:21:71:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology has advanced and, in fact, in the United States it has cycled around 4 or 5 percent for 
14:336:27697:21:21:71:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:more than a century. The historical evidence, however, is more nuanced when it comes to labor 
14:337:27791:21:20:71:541:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:force participation which has been declining for prime age men in the United States since the 1950s 
14:338:27891:20:21:71:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:as shown in Figure 7. Most of the advanced economies have experienced declines, but the large 
14:339:27985:21:21:71:541:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneity of those declines with no apparent relationship to automation again strongly suggests 
14:340:28085:21:31:71:440:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:that they are a function of much more than simply the degree of automation.

15:346:28179:28:20:108:543:455:144:Times:144:Times:A:Looking forward, a number of efforts have tried to isolate how AI itself will substitute for 
15:347:28272:20:21:72:542:435:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific occupations or tasks. The question these efforts are asking is, in effect, will the experience 
15:348:28376:21:21:72:542:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:with AI be different than with previous technologies. This could either happen if the pace of change 
15:349:28477:21:21:72:544:393:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  much  more  rapid  than  with  previous  technological  changes,  affecting  employment  across  the  
15:350:28583:21:20:72:543:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:entire economy at once.  In this case, while the long-run equilibrium points about labor markets 
15:351:28680:20:21:72:544:352:144:Times:144:Times:B:may operate in theory as discussed above, in practice it may take decades for the adjustment to 
15:352:28776:21:21:72:543:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:happen—with substantial increases in unemployment in the interim. AI could also be different if 
15:353:28872:21:30:72:505:310:144:Times:144:Times:B:it replaces a wider-range of what had previously been uniquely human skills and abilities. 
15:354:28963:30:21:108:543:280:144:Times:144:Times:A:For these scenarios to play out AI would need to develop along a very different trajectory 
15:355:29054:21:21:72:544:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:than  it  has  to  date,  turning  into  more  of  a  “general  AI”  or  “true  AI”  that  can  work  across  the  
15:356:29169:21:20:72:542:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy.  To  date,  AI  has  largely  been  about  lowering  the  cost  of  prediction  through  machine 
15:357:29275:20:21:71:543:218:144:Times:144:Times:B:learning  (Agrawal,  Gans  and  Goldfarb  2018  and  forthcoming).  This  would  suggest  a  trajectory  
15:358:29380:21:21:71:539:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:more like what we have seen in the past when, for example, computation became much cheaper—
15:359:29471:21:21:72:547:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:which   is   to   say,   a   sequence   of   sector-specific   and   skill-specific   disruptions   without   an   
15:360:29586:21:30:71:248:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:unprecedented economywide effect. 
15:361:29619:30:21:107:542:125:144:Times:144:Times:A:In either case, it is important to understand the types of workers that will likely be affected. 
15:362:29716:21:21:71:544:104:144:Times:144:Times:B:Frey  and  Osborne  (2017)  use  a  panel  of  experts  to  categorize  tasks  by  their  susceptibility  to  
15:363:29826:21:0:71:543:83:144:Times:144:Times:B:automation, link these tasks to occupation, employment and wage data, and find that 47 percent of 
16:364:29926:0:21:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S. employment is at high risk of automation. In contrast, the OECD Report described above uses 
16:365:30023:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual level data to predict how susceptible occupations may be to automation, and finds that 
16:366:30121:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:9 percent of jobs in the U.S. and across OECD countries will be highly susceptible to automation. 
16:367:30219:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:The MGI Report (2017) estimates that at least 30 percent of activities are automatable in about 60 
16:368:30317:21:21:72:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent  of  occupations.  But,  the  MGI  Report  also  cautions  that  such  automation  will  not  
16:369:30419:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily substitute for labor, and reports that less than a fifth of respondents said AI was being 
16:370:30521:21:20:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:adopted  to  reduce  labor  costs.  Rather,  respondents  report  that  AI  is  used  to  improve  capital  
16:371:30629:20:31:72:266:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficiency or enhance existing products. 
16:372:30669:31:21:107:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  all  of  these  cases,  however,  there  is  a  strong  relationship  between  the  occupations  or  
16:373:30774:21:20:71:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:skills that can be automated and income or education. CEA (2016) used the Frey and Osbourne 
16:374:30866:20:21:71:542:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:characterizations and found that jobs making less than $20 per hour had an 83 percent probability 
16:375:30964:21:21:71:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:of automation while jobs making over $40 per hour only had a 4 percent probability of automation, 
16:376:31062:21:21:71:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:as shown in Figure 8. Although the levels are very different in the OECD study, the gradient is the 
16:377:31162:21:20:71:542:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:same—with jobs that require a high school degree or less much more likely to be automatable than 
16:378:31259:20:21:71:542:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:jobs with a college or graduate degree, as shown in Figure 9. This highlights that going forward it 
16:379:31359:21:21:71:541:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:is reasonable to expect that to the degree that AI does not displace labor, part of that will be because 
16:380:31464:21:20:71:542:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative wages adjust, in other words that inequality rises. In addition, the pressure on lower-skilled 
16:381:31568:20:21:71:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:jobs  risks  the  continuation  of  the  same  trend  that  has  contributed  to  declining  labor  force  
16:382:31675:21:31:71:251:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation for prime-age workers.

17:389:31825:21:21:72:543:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:disruptions to the workforce on the other, it will be important to ensure that there are appropriate 
17:390:31926:21:21:72:544:393:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies in place. We next consider current and potential new policies that aim to address these 
17:391:32023:21:30:72:106:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:issues.

17:394:32067:31:20:108:542:280:144:Times:144:Times:A:A number of economists document that the U.S. economy has become highly concentrated 
17:395:32152:20:21:72:543:260:144:Times:144:Times:B:in a number of sectors (e.g., De Loecker and Eeckhout, 2017; Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017). AI 
17:396:32248:21:21:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:and digitization more broadly has the potential to increase competition in many ways, but at the 
17:397:32345:21:21:72:545:218:144:Times:144:Times:B:same  time,  changing  technology  will  bring  new  sources  of  concentration,  including  powerful  
17:398:32448:21:30:72:240:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:network effects (e.g., Khan 2017). 
17:399:32483:30:31:72:75:167:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
17:400:32483:31:31:72:370:136:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.1 Impact of the Digital Economy on Concentration Broadly 
17:401:32542:31:20:108:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:A:So far, internet markets have tended to favor large digital platforms that hold high market 
17:402:32634:20:0:72:543:85:144:Times:144:Times:B:shares,  a  characteristic  that  is  traditionally  associated  with  low  competition  in  brick-and-mortar 
18:403:32746:0:21:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets.  However,  understanding  the  competitive  implications  of  these  new  markets  requires  a  
18:404:32851:21:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:closer  analysis.  The markets  of  the  digital  economy  are  in  many  ways  different  from  “old  
18:405:32954:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy” markets. Some of those differences are differences of degree—the internet lowers many 
18:406:33049:20:21:72:542:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs for small businesses, increasing their ability to rapidly and inexpensively scale up, collect 
18:407:33149:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on potential consumers, and create new products and ideas. These differences do not 
18:408:33245:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:transform the structure of the market; instead, they merely lower the cost of doing business. Other 
18:409:33345:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences, however, are differences of type: business models may be dramatically different due 
18:410:33442:20:31:72:411:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:to digitization. These differences of type warrant closer consideration. 
18:411:33515:31:21:108:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:A:One type of business model that has flourished with digitization is the “platform” model, 
18:412:33605:21:20:72:540:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  relies  heavily  on  direct  and  indirect  network  effects  to  grow.  Direct  network  effects—
18:413:33710:20:21:72:544:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:whereby the value to a customer is increasing in the number of other customers using the same 
18:414:33804:21:21:72:545:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:platform—are particularly  important  for social  media  platforms  like  Facebook,  Twitter  and  
18:415:33903:21:21:72:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:LinkedIn because  the  primary benefit  to  any  customer  is  access  to  other  customers.  Switching 
18:416:34007:21:20:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs for customers are particularly high in these markets—no one wants to be the first and only 
18:417:34104:20:31:72:527:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:user of a social media platform—and these direct network effects can act as a barrier to entry.  
18:418:34201:31:21:108:544:378:144:Times:144:Times:A:Indirect  network  effects—where  the  value  to  a  customer  is  increasing  in  the  number  of  
18:419:34301:21:20:72:545:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:customers  on  the  other  side  of  the  platform—are  also  important.  As  a  result  of  these  indirect  
18:420:34411:20:21:72:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:network effects, companies may subsidize one side of the market by profiting from the other side 
18:421:34508:21:21:72:544:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the market (Rochet and Tirole, 2003; 2006). For example, social media sites often offer free 
18:422:34604:21:20:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:services  to  users  and  charge  for  ads.  This  provides  a  challenge  when  trying  to  determine  the 
18:423:34712:20:21:72:545:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal level of competition in these new markets.  Usually, economists use prices as indicators of 
18:424:34812:21:21:72:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:B:the level of competition, but price is insufficient in this case given the low prices on one side of 
18:425:34913:21:20:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:the platform’s market. The lack of high prices for consumers does not mean that consumer harms 
18:426:35008:20:21:72:544:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:or  other  risks  could  not  occur.  Industry  watchers  have  raised  concerns  about  whether  the  large  
18:427:35118:21:21:72:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:companies that dominate search and social networking may be able to acquire inefficient power in 
18:428:35215:21:21:72:542:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:ads or control people’s access to news. Another concern is that instead of raising prices or reducing 
18:429:35317:21:20:72:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantity, these companies may reduce innovation. Firms holding quasi-monopolies may lose the 
18:430:35410:20:31:72:419:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentive to keep improving the quality of their products (Arrow 1962). 
18:431:35482:31:21:108:544:99:144:Times:144:Times:A:Switching costs are traditionally an indicator of competition, and many may assume that 
18:432:35570:21:0:72:548:78:144:Times:144:Times:B:switching costs in internet markets are virtually zero because competition is just a “click”   away. 
19:433:35673:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:This may have been true in the early ages of the internet, but may be less true now. For example, 
19:434:35771:21:21:72:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the original search engines were merely directories of websites, and their quality did not depend 
19:435:35869:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:on how many users they had. However, search engines today collect data on the behavior of their 
19:436:35965:20:21:72:544:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:users  and  use  it  to  improve  their  services  and  tailor  those  services  to  individual  users.  Thus,  in  
19:437:36081:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:order for other firms to be competitive, they need a large user base and the data that comes with it. 
19:438:36183:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:Furthermore, for each individual user looking to switch services, the incumbent, with its existing 
19:439:36282:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge of that user, has a significant advantage over a competitor that does not yet know the 
19:440:36379:20:31:72:334:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:user and therefore cannot tailor services to him or her. 
19:441:36435:31:21:108:544:533:144:Times:144:Times:A:Lastly, digitization could bring a new level of opacity to businesses. Traditionally, price 
19:442:36527:21:20:72:544:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixing  and  collusion  could  be  detected  in  the  communications  between  businesses.  The  task  of  
19:443:36634:20:21:72:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:detecting undesirable price behavior becomes more difficult with the use of increasingly complex 
19:444:36731:21:21:72:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:algorithms for setting prices. This type of algorithmic price setting can lead to undesirable price 
19:445:36831:21:21:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior, sometimes even unintentionally. The use of advanced machine learning algorithms to 
19:446:36924:21:30:72:429:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:set prices and adapt product functionality would further increase opacity.  
19:447:37000:30:31:72:75:399:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
19:448:37000:31:31:72:270:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.2 Large Datasets as a Barrier to Entry 
19:449:37041:31:20:108:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:A:A related concern is the effect that concentration of digital assets among a few dominant 
19:450:37131:20:21:72:542:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:platforms may have on AI-enabled startups. Large datasets are a critical input for firms that want 
19:451:37230:21:21:72:543:296:144:Times:144:Times:B:to create or use AI systems. Even the best AI algorithms are useless without a large dataset because 
19:452:37331:21:20:72:545:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:these datasets  are  needed  for  the  initial  training  and  fine-tuning  of  AI  algorithms.  This  is  a  
19:453:37441:20:21:72:543:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular concern given the hope that development and commercialization of AI-related products 
19:454:37537:21:21:71:542:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:and services will result in greater productivity growth. Absent competition from startups and other 
19:455:37637:21:30:71:380:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:entrants, the economy may get less of this productivity growth.  
19:456:37702:30:21:107:543:183:144:Times:144:Times:A:Antitrust enforcement officials in the U.S. and Europe recognize the challenges that may 
19:457:37791:21:21:72:545:162:144:Times:144:Times:B:arise  when  large  technology  firms  control  the  vast  majority  of  such  data.  For  example,  FTC  
19:458:37897:21:21:71:543:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:Commissioner Terrell McSweeny says, “It may be that an incumbent has significant advantages 
19:459:37989:21:0:71:543:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:over new entrants when a firm has a database that would be difficult, costly, or time consuming 
20:460:38087:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:for a new firm to match or replicate.”14 However, we still need more research to understand the 
20:461:38183:21:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions  under  which  large  amounts  of  data  may  provide  advantages  to  incumbents  over  
20:462:38283:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:entrants. For example, using data from Amazon, Bajari et al (2018) provide evidence that data on 
20:463:38380:20:21:72:544:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger number of products does not improve forecast errors, but data over more time periods for 
20:464:38476:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:these products does (though at a diminishing rate). Similarly, Chiou and Tucker (2017) find little 
20:465:38575:21:21:72:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence  that  search  engine’s  use  of  longer  data series  allows  for  better  search  results.  The  
20:466:38683:21:20:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:implications of these studies are twofold: first, there is limited evidence of increasing returns to 
20:467:38784:20:21:72:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:scale  for  data  and,  second,  restrictions  on  data  storage  and  use  are  not  likely  to  harm  large  
20:468:38895:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology  platforms.  As  Chiou  and  Tucker  state:  “Our  results  also  suggest  that  limits  on  data  
20:469:39005:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:retention may impose fewer costs in instances where overly long data retention leads to privacy 
20:470:39101:21:30:72:347:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:concerns such as an individual's ‘right to be forgotten.’”  
20:471:39160:30:21:108:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  the  extent  that  data  is  a  critical  resource  for  entrants,  new  enforcement  policies  and  
20:472:39265:21:21:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  strategies  such  as  data  portability  may  be  needed  to  ensure  that  both  incumbent  and  
20:473:39375:21:20:72:543:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential  entrant  firms  have  access  to  the  datasets  they  need  to  innovate  in  the  AI  domain. 
20:474:39482:20:21:72:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, as pointed out by Himel and Seamans (2017), there are a range of existing policies and 
20:475:39578:21:21:72:544:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:other  approaches  that  may  be  useful  in  aiding  entry  of  AI-enabled  startups,  including  litigation  
20:476:39689:21:20:72:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategies against large technology platforms alleging anticompetitive conduct or consumer harm. 
20:477:39786:20:21:72:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:As describe above, a challenge in such cases is the two-sided nature of the platforms, on which the 
20:478:39886:21:21:72:542:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:consumer side typically involves a low or “free” price. There is a need, therefore, for research that 
20:479:39988:21:20:72:543:305:144:Times:144:Times:B:carefully assesses the benefits and drawbacks of using existing policies, regulations, and litigation 
20:480:40090:20:31:72:417:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategies to address the myriad concerns that arise from the rise of AI.  
20:481:40164:31:21:108:542:254:144:Times:144:Times:A:Data  portability  allows  customers  to  take  their  data  from  one  provider  to  another.  The 
20:482:40264:21:20:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:concept is not unique to digital platforms; it could be used for banking data as well, for example. 
20:483:40364:20:21:72:544:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:The idea  is  similar  to  telephone-number  portability  from  the  Telecom  Act  of  1996  which  gave  
20:484:40470:21:21:72:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:customers  a  greater  ability  to  leave  a  telephone  company  for  a  rival.  Guy  Rolnick  and  Luigi  
20:485:40578:21:51:72:543:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:Zingales from  the  University  of  Chicago  argued  in  an  op-ed  in  the  New  York  Times  for the

20:487:40739:8:15:72:534:112:42:Times:99:Times:F:14 Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, Opening Remarks for a Panel Discussion, “Why Regulate Online Platforms?: 
20:488:40846:15:12:71:526:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:Transparency, Fairness, Competition, or Innovation?” at the CRA Conference in Brussels, Belgium, at 5 (Dec. 9, 
20:489:40957:12:11:71:437:85:99:Times:99:Times:F:2015), https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/903953/mcsweeny_-

21:491:41083:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:portability  of  social  graphs  which  would  allow  users  to  take  all  of  the  digital  connections  they 
21:492:41195:21:31:71:377:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:create on a platform like Facebook to another rival platform.15  
21:493:41260:31:21:108:548:657:144:Times:144:Times:A:In principle, data portability helps   increase competition between established firms in the 
21:494:41353:21:20:72:544:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:market,  because  any  potential  customer  could  easily  shift  her  data  from  one  established  firm  to  
21:495:41464:20:21:72:543:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:another.  However,  it  is  unlikely  that  data  portability  alone  would  increase  competition  from 
21:496:41568:21:21:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:startups that may need access to large datasets to train their AI algorithms. Under a data portability 
21:497:41671:21:30:72:530:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:model, startups would need to induce multiple individual users to port their data to the startup.  
21:498:41770:30:21:108:543:544:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another issue with data portability is where the customer’s data would reside, which has 
21:499:41859:21:21:72:543:523:144:Times:144:Times:B:implications for the data’s security, and for the consumer’s privacy. One issue around privacy is 
21:500:41957:21:20:72:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:the extent of control that a consumer has not just over their own sensitive information, which they 
21:501:42057:20:21:72:543:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:may choose or not to share with different companies, but over the inferences that an AI algorithm 
21:502:42155:21:21:72:544:461:144:Times:144:Times:B:can make about the consumer by comparing patterns in the individual behavior to patterns seen 
21:503:42249:21:21:72:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:across  similar  populations  of  individuals.  Law  and  economics  scholars  have  provided  in  depth  
21:504:42355:21:30:72:381:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatments of privacy in a digital age (Tucker 2012; Calo 2017). 
21:505:42420:30:21:108:543:389:144:Times:144:Times:A:Trusted third parties can potentially play a role to safeguard consumer information while 
21:506:42510:21:21:72:542:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:allowing conditional access to large datasets for AI-enabled startups. There may be other benefits 
21:507:42609:21:20:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  use  of  trusted  third  parties,  including  the  creation  of  standardized  training  datasets.16  For 
21:508:42719:20:21:71:545:327:144:Times:144:Times:B:example,  Mitchell  and  Brynjolfsson  (2017)  argue  that  when  AI-related  data  is  collected  from  
21:509:42824:21:21:71:543:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:diverse sources and integrated together it may allow for the identification of bias or skew in the 
21:510:42923:21:20:71:543:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:data. An open question is “who” exactly would play the role of the trusted third party. Potential 
21:511:43021:20:21:71:543:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:solutions include a university consortium, an existing or new government agency—the running of 
21:512:43116:21:21:71:544:244:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  would  be  a  potential  role  for  an  “AI-specific Agency”   explored  in  a  later  section—or  a  
21:513:43225:21:20:71:545:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:public-private  partnership  or  non-profit  entity  whose  sole  mission  is  the  collection,  curation,  
21:514:43333:20:21:71:543:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:protection of large scale datasets. More generally, the competition policy issues described above 
21:515:43431:21:31:71:495:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be an area that could potentially fall under the domain of an AI-specific Agency.

22:521:43791:0:30:72:481:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:4. AI and Labor Markets: UBI, wage supplements and guaranteed employment 
22:522:43863:30:21:108:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:A:AI has the potential to continue or possibly even exacerbate trends towards declining labor 
22:523:43955:21:21:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:force  participation  and  increased  inequality.  Fears  about  these  changes  have  helped  to  motivate  
22:524:44064:21:20:72:541:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:and expand interest in the centuries old idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) that would partially 
22:525:44165:20:21:72:544:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:or  completely  replace  existing  safety  net  programs  with  a  single,  unconditional  cash  transfer  to  
22:526:44276:21:21:72:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:every adult in the United States. Although less often framed as a response to AI, two other larger 
22:527:44375:21:20:72:543:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:ideas that have grown in interest in recent years could serve as alternatives to UBI: the first is a 
22:528:44476:20:21:72:542:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:large-scale system of wage subsidies to help create an incentive for work and increase the reward 
22:529:44574:21:21:72:542:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:to work (e.g., Phelps 1997) and the second is guaranteed Federal employment (e.g., Mitchell 1996; 
22:530:44672:21:30:72:471:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mosler 1998). This section reviews some of the pros and cons of these three ideas. 
22:531:44755:30:21:108:544:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  understanding  how  policy  should  respond  to  labor  market  changes,  it  is  important  to  
22:532:44856:21:21:72:540:461:144:Times:144:Times:B:understand whether artificial intelligence is more like a macroeconomic shock or a series of sector-
22:533:44956:21:20:72:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific  shocks.  The  more  it  is  like  a  series  of  sector-specific  shocks,  the  more  that  a  response  
22:534:45071:20:21:72:544:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:should be targeted and focused, building on successful past efforts rather than an unprecedented 
22:535:45168:21:31:72:122:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach. 
22:536:45178:31:31:72:75:368:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
22:537:45178:31:30:72:208:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.1 Universal Basic Income 
22:538:45204:30:21:108:543:307:144:Times:144:Times:A: A universal basic income has three characteristics. First it is available nearly universally, 
22:539:45298:21:21:72:543:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited only by criteria such as citizenship or possibly age, but generally not by income or by other 
22:540:45400:21:20:72:543:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:factors,  like  disability  or  employment  status.  Second,  it  provides  cash,  not  in-kind  benefits  like 
22:541:45512:20:21:72:542:245:144:Times:144:Times:B:many existing programs that target food, heating oil, housing and the like. Third, it is unconditional 
22:542:45615:21:21:72:543:224:144:Times:144:Times:B:so unlike many existing programs does not require the applicant to be working, looking for work, 
22:543:45712:21:21:72:544:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:attending  school, or  other  forms  of  conditioning.  Most  UBI  proposals  are  also  intended  to  be  
22:544:45819:21:30:72:405:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:substantial enough to raise people to something like the poverty line. 
22:545:45890:30:21:108:539:152:144:Times:144:Times:A:For example, Andrew Stern and Lee Kravitz (2016) have proposed $12,000 for every non-
22:546:45975:21:21:72:543:131:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly adult U.S. citizen while Charles Murray has proposed $10,000 for every U.S. citizen aged 
22:547:46072:21:20:72:543:110:144:Times:144:Times:B:21 and older (2006). Generally, UBI proposals have focused on replacing existing means-tested 
22:548:46166:20:0:72:544:90:144:Times:144:Times:B:programs  (e.g.,  food  assistance,  housing  subsidies,  and  cash  welfare)  but  differ  in  whether they 
23:549:46277:0:21:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:would  also  replace  Social  Security  retirement  income  and  health  programs  like  Medicare  and  
23:550:46381:21:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicaid.  With  these  offsets  a  UBI  would  require  about  $1  trillion  in  additional  financing  
23:551:46486:21:31:72:311:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:annually, for example through revenue increases. 
23:552:46535:31:20:108:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:A:Some of the arguments for UBI are unrelated to technological developments, for example 
23:553:46622:20:21:72:543:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:the claim that a single streamlined program would be more efficient to administer than a variety 
23:554:46719:21:21:72:542:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:of programs with different rules and conditions. In addition, some of the claims (e.g. Thomas Paine 
23:555:46819:21:20:72:542:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:1797) are more grounded in moral premises than specific efficiency statements. These arguments, 
23:556:46915:20:21:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, have been advanced with greater force along with new arguments related to AI and the 
23:557:47009:21:21:72:544:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:future  of  work.  One  argument  is  that  UBI  would  be a  solution  to  mass  joblessness,  helping  to  
23:558:47118:21:20:71:542:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:ensure a basic income floor for people. A related argument is that UBI is a way to share the benefits 
23:559:47220:20:21:71:546:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  the  increased  output  associated  with  AI.  In  addition,  another  argument  made  by  Mark  
23:560:47321:21:21:71:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:Zuckerberg (and echoed by many others) is that UBI can help to “give everyone a cushion to try 
23:561:47416:21:30:71:235:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:new things.” (Zuckerberg 2017).  
23:562:47449:30:21:107:543:420:144:Times:144:Times:A:UBI also has a number of drawbacks. The first is the cost of the program. An additional 
23:563:47537:21:21:71:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:roughly  $1  trillion  in  annual  financing  would  require  approximately doubling  existing  payroll  
23:564:47642:21:21:71:542:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:taxes or a roughly 50 percent increase in existing individual income taxes. Given the limited tax 
23:565:47740:21:20:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:appetite,  particularly  in  the  United  States,  the  feasibility  of  such  a  substantial  program  may  be  
23:566:47853:20:31:71:158:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:called into doubt. 
23:567:47872:31:21:107:542:306:144:Times:144:Times:A:A second question about UBI is whether or not it is the optimal way to handle the tradeoffs 
23:568:47964:21:20:71:543:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:inherent in targeting. UBI is likely to result in smaller net transfers to households that get larger 
23:569:48066:20:21:71:539:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:transfers today, either by virtue of their lower incomes, larger number of children, or situation—
23:570:48164:21:21:71:542:244:144:Times:144:Times:B:for example, disability status. This may raise equity concerns for some. In addition, it could also 
23:571:48264:21:20:71:544:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:raise  efficiency  issues.  For  example,  unemployment  insurance  receipt  is  conditional  on  being  
23:572:48369:20:21:71:542:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:unemployed—which increases moral hazard but also helps households smooth their consumption. 
23:573:48461:21:21:71:543:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:Shifting  to  unconditional  transfers  would  reduce  the  moral  hazard  associated  with  substitution  
23:574:48568:21:21:71:542:161:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects, but at the expense of the consumption smoothing currently provided by the existing safety 
23:575:48667:21:30:71:92:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:net. 
23:576:48672:30:21:107:541:110:144:Times:144:Times:A:A third issue is with the argument that UBI may stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation. 
23:577:48763:21:0:71:543:89:144:Times:144:Times:B:There  are  strong  arguments  for  policies  that  stimulate  entrepreneurship,  given  that  rates  of  new  
24:578:48876:0:21:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:business  entry  have  declined  over  the  past  three  decades  (Decker,  Haltiwanger,  Jarmin,  and  
24:579:48980:21:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:Miranda 2014).  But  there  is  little  evidence  of  heightened  entrepreneurship  and  innovation  in  
24:580:49085:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:regions with UBI-like programs, such as oil-rich areas which provide income to most residents, 
24:581:49180:20:21:72:546:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:including  in  Alaska,  Norway  and  some  Gulf  states.  Moreover,  the  argument  for  increased  
24:582:49280:21:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:entrepreneurship  and  innovation  relies  on  the  assumption  that  entrepreneurs  and  inventors  will  
24:583:49387:21:21:72:540:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:take more risk. But there may be a countervailing force, in that lenders, wary of increased risk-
24:584:49484:21:20:71:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:taking by entrepreneurs, may cut back on lending. There is some evidence of this type of behavior 
24:585:49582:20:31:71:458:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the economics of bankruptcy literature (e.g., Berkowitz and White, 2004).

24:587:49662:31:30:71:201:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.2 Employment Subsidies 
24:588:49686:30:21:107:542:472:144:Times:144:Times:A: An alternative to UBI is employment subsidies. These would also be provided in cash, but 
24:589:49775:21:21:71:543:451:144:Times:144:Times:B:unlike  UBI  they  would  be  not  be  universally  available  and  would  be  conditional  on  work,  and  
24:590:49883:21:20:71:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially  other  circumstances.  Currently  the  largest  such  program  is  the  Earned  Income  Tax  
24:591:49989:20:21:71:542:410:144:Times:144:Times:B:Credit (EITC). For a head of household with two children, the EITC provides a subsidy of $0.40 
24:592:50084:21:21:71:543:389:144:Times:144:Times:B:for every $1 earned up to a maximum subsidy of $5,616 in 2017. The subsidy starts phasing out at 
24:593:50181:21:21:71:544:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:$0.2106  for  each  $1  earned  above  $18,340 in  2017  and  is  eliminated  when  household  income  
24:594:50284:21:20:71:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:reaches $45,007.  These  parameters  are  adjusted  to  result  in  a  somewhat  smaller  subsidy  for  
24:595:50388:20:21:71:542:327:144:Times:144:Times:B:households with 1 child, a somewhat larger subsidy for households with 3 or more children, and a 
24:596:50485:21:31:71:518:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:very small subsidy—with a maximum of $510—for households without qualifying children. 
24:597:50571:31:20:107:542:275:144:Times:144:Times:A: There are two types of proposals to expand employment subsidies. The first would use the 
24:598:50660:20:21:71:543:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:EITC-structure, administering the subsidy through the tax code, paying it directly to households, 
24:599:50758:21:21:71:542:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:and making it contingent on household circumstances. One proposal, made by both House Speaker 
24:600:50852:21:20:71:542:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:Paul Ryan and President Barack Obama, would have been to substantially increase the EITC for 
24:601:50945:20:21:71:543:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:households without qualifying children. These proposals are grounded in the academic evidence 
24:602:51039:21:21:71:543:172:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the EITC increases participation in the workforce (e.g., Eissa and Liebman 1996 and Hotz, 
24:603:51134:21:31:71:362:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mullin, and Scholz 2006) as well as distributional concerns. 
24:604:51195:31:20:107:544:120:144:Times:144:Times:A: An  alternative  approach  was  put  forward  by  Phelps  (1997)  and  would  be  a  subsidy  for  
24:605:51294:20:21:71:542:100:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers, a considerably larger version of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) in the law 
24:606:51388:21:0:71:545:79:144:Times:144:Times:B:today.  This  employment  subsidy  could,  for  example,  provide  an  additional  $7  per  hour  for  
25:607:51493:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:households making the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, phasing down the subsidy as earnings 
25:608:51584:21:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:rose. All of the administration would be undertaken by the employer and the tax authority, with 
25:609:51680:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:the employee just seeing a higher wage. The alternative approach is partly motivated by liquidity 
25:610:51778:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:concerns and administrative concerns, ensuring that the worker would be paid regularly with no 
25:611:51873:21:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:administrative effort on her part. In addition, it could address any stigma associated with taking 
25:612:51972:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:advantage of a tax and transfer program. On the other hand, wage subsidies would lose the ability 
25:613:52070:21:30:72:446:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:to target—for example, based on overall household income or circumstances. 
25:614:52145:30:21:108:545:554:144:Times:144:Times:A: Like  UBI,  employment  subsidies  would  also  have  a  fiscal  cost  that  would  need  to  be  
25:615:52243:21:21:72:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:financed   in   some   manner.   Moreover,   because   employment   subsidies   are   conditional, 
25:616:52342:21:20:72:543:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:administrative costs would be higher relative to UBI and also increases the incentives for fraud, 
25:617:52440:20:21:72:543:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:for example misreporting earnings or hours. Because the subsidies would be conditional on work 
25:618:52535:21:21:72:539:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:and would phase out at higher incomes, the overall cost would be considerably smaller than UBI—
25:619:52630:21:21:72:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:with some proposals to expand the EITC for households without qualifying children costing about 
25:620:52726:21:20:72:544:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:$5 billion  annually.  Unlike  UBI,  however,  employment  subsidies  would  act  as  an  incentive  for  
25:621:52832:20:31:72:468:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment and would send a signal that work was still central to social support.  
25:622:52915:31:31:72:78:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:  
25:623:52917:31:30:72:213:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.3 Guaranteed Employment 
25:624:52942:30:21:108:544:317:144:Times:144:Times:A: Support  is  also  growing  for  some  sort  of  guaranteed  employment,  potentially  a  Federal  
25:625:53041:21:21:72:542:296:144:Times:144:Times:B:backstop or guaranteed job that would provide payment but only in exchange for labor services. A 
25:626:53138:21:20:72:545:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:few  specific  proposals  or  concepts  have  been  put  forward  including  by  Center  for  American  
25:627:53242:20:21:72:543:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:Progress and Jeff Spross (Paul, Darity, and Hamilton 2018; Spross 2017). These proposals have 
25:628:53336:21:21:72:543:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:generally not been motivated by AI, and in fact use 1930s era programs as an inspiration, but they 
25:629:53435:21:21:72:544:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:would  functionally  provide  a  third  approach  for  addressing  the  concerns  raised  by  AI  on  labor  
25:630:53544:21:30:72:166:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:force participation. 
25:631:53564:30:21:107:543:162:144:Times:144:Times:A: Like UBI and wage subsidies, such a proposal could have a substantial fiscal cost. If the 
25:632:53654:21:21:71:542:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:guaranteed job paid $15 per hour and 10 million people took it up, then that would be about $300 
25:633:53751:21:20:71:543:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:billion or more in annual costs, although it is possible that the associated labor would also yield 
25:634:53851:20:21:71:542:100:144:Times:144:Times:B:some public benefits. Such an employment guarantee would have the advantage of being the most 
25:635:53945:21:0:71:545:79:144:Times:144:Times:B:direct  way  to  subsidize  work,  potentially  keeping  people  in  the  labor  force  and  improving  
26:636:54051:0:21:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:countercyclical fiscal responses. On the other hand, such a program would also have to grapple 
26:637:54146:21:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  substantial  administrative  complexity,  the  danger  of  trapping  people  in  lower-wage  jobs  
26:638:54251:21:31:71:436:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:without career advancement prospects, and the distortions to labor markets. 
26:639:54327:31:20:107:542:636:144:Times:144:Times:A: Additional research and experimentation with UBI, employment subsidies, and guaranteed 
26:640:54414:20:21:71:539:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment would all be worthwhile, especially in understanding how these, in some cases long-
26:641:54508:21:31:72:477:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:standing proposals, would interact with likely labor market changes going forward.  
26:642:54592:31:31:72:75:564:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
26:643:54592:31:30:72:260:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:5. Is an AI-Specific Agency Needed? 
26:644:54627:30:21:108:543:503:144:Times:144:Times:A:As noted by Ryan Calo (2017), an overarching policy challenge is how to best introduce 
26:645:54714:21:20:72:544:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:expertise  about  AI,  robotics and  other  advanced  technologies  into  all  branches  and  levels  of  
26:646:54820:20:21:72:543:462:144:Times:144:Times:B:government to aid decision making. This need has led to calls for specific commissions on AI and 
26:647:54917:21:21:72:543:441:144:Times:144:Times:B:robotics (e.g., Calo 2014) or even a new agency tasked with overseeing AI, either to maximize its 
26:648:55015:21:30:72:285:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits or minimize any associated harms.  
26:649:55059:30:21:108:543:390:144:Times:144:Times:A:Calo (2014) reminds us that the Federal government forms new departments and agencies 
26:650:55145:21:21:72:542:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:from time to time, depending on circumstance. For example, the Department of Homeland Security 
26:651:55240:21:21:72:544:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:(DHS) was formed in 2002 in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and several 
26:652:55334:21:20:72:543:327:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing agencies such as Immigration and Naturalization Service were re-organized under DHS 
26:653:55427:20:21:72:543:307:144:Times:144:Times:B:instead of the Department of Justice (DOJ). Likewise, the Department of Energy was formed by 
26:654:55520:21:21:72:542:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:consolidating the Energy Research and Development Administration, Federal Power Commission, 
26:655:55612:21:30:72:523:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Federal Energy Administration in 1977, in response to the oil crisis earlier in the 1970s.   
26:656:55709:30:21:108:546:235:144:Times:144:Times:A:There  are  multiple  challenges  with  creating  a  new  commission  or  agency,  including  
26:657:55803:21:21:72:545:214:144:Times:144:Times:B:defining  the  mission  or  scope  of  the  new  agency  and  reorganizing  existing  agencies.  When  
26:658:55906:21:20:72:543:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:considering the mission of the agency, it is useful to consider first whether the agency would have 
26:659:56006:20:21:72:544:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:any  enforcement  authority,  similar  to  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC),  DOJ  or  Securities  and  
26:660:56111:21:21:72:543:152:144:Times:144:Times:B:Exchange Commission (SEC), or whether the agency would instead provide more of an advisory 
26:661:56202:21:21:72:544:131:144:Times:144:Times:B:function.  In  the  first  case,  the  relevant  thought  experiment  is  whether  the  existing  enforcement  
26:662:56313:21:20:72:543:110:144:Times:144:Times:B:agencies could perform a similar role or not; that is, is there something specific about robotics and 
26:663:56415:20:0:72:543:90:144:Times:144:Times:B:AI  that  necessitates  a  dedicated  enforcement  authority.  In  the  second  case,  the  relevant  thought  
27:664:56528:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:experiment is whether a standalone agency is needed to provide an advisory function, or whether 
27:665:56624:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:each agency can address its own perceived needs via hiring of dedicated staff as the FTC did in 
27:666:56720:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:creating the position of “Chief Technologist” and as the Obama White House did when it created 
27:667:56815:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  Chief  Technology  Officer  position  within  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy.  In 
27:668:56921:21:21:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:some cases this may require the creation of a “technology office” if one does not already exist. For 
27:669:57022:21:21:71:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, there have been recent calls for Congress to revive the Office of Technology Assessment 
27:670:57119:21:20:71:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Graves and Kosar, 2018). Regardless of the bureaucratic structure, there is a need for the Federal 
27:671:57219:20:21:71:542:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:government to assess existing policy and evaluate proposals for new policy tools as we have done 
27:672:57316:21:31:71:196:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the preceding sections. 
27:673:57343:31:20:107:542:512:144:Times:144:Times:A:Other key questions in evaluating this issue are whether AI should be thought of as a new 
27:674:57433:20:21:71:542:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:area or instead as a tool that is used in a variety of areas. From the former perspective, one agency 
27:675:57535:21:21:71:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:would have to distinguish between automation due to AI and automation due to other causes and 
27:676:57629:21:21:71:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:apply its analysis in a disparate set of domains. From the latter perspective, the goal would be to 
27:677:57729:21:20:71:547:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:get   AI   experts   in   key   positions   in,   for   example,   the   National   Highway   Traffic   Safety   
27:678:57842:20:21:71:541:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:Administration (NHTSA) and the SEC to look at automated driving systems and automated trading 
27:679:57936:21:31:71:506:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:respectively—rather than to have one body that looks at automation applied to both areas. 
27:680:58025:31:26:72:75:357:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
27:681:58025:26:30:72:144:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:6. Conclusion 
27:682:58039:30:21:108:544:301:144:Times:144:Times:A:Artificial  intelligence  has  the  potential  to  dramatically  change  the  economy.  On  the  one  
27:683:58141:21:21:72:543:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:hand, the potential for increased productivity growth is welcome given the decades-long slowing 
27:684:58237:21:20:71:542:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:in productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies. On the other hand, the 
27:685:58334:20:21:71:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential  for  AI-induced  labor  disruptions  could  potentially  exacerbate  existing  problems  in  the  
27:686:58443:21:21:71:543:218:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor force, including the decades-long decline in male labor force participation rate. Economic 
27:687:58540:21:20:71:541:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:research has only started to assess these issues. Early research findings suggest that AI and robotics 
27:688:58643:20:21:71:542:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:do indeed boost productivity growth, and that effects on labor are mixed. However, more empirical 
27:689:58741:21:21:71:545:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:research  is  needed  in  order  to  confirm  existing  findings  on  the  productivity  benefits,  better  
27:690:58849:21:20:71:545:135:144:Times:144:Times:B:understand  conditions  under  which  AI  and  robotics  substitute  or  complement  for  labor,  and  
27:691:58952:20:21:71:545:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:understand  regional  level  outcomes.  For  these  reasons,  a  number  of  others  have  called  for  
27:692:59056:21:0:71:542:94:144:Times:144:Times:B:systematic collection and dissemination of establishment level data (e.g., Raj and Seamans, 2017; 
28:693:59156:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mitchell and Brynjolfsson, 2017) to address the need for publicly available data on the deployment 
28:694:59255:21:31:72:421:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:and use of robotics and AI in manufacturing and service establishments. 
28:695:59327:31:21:108:541:657:144:Times:144:Times:A: A variety of policy solutions—ranging from an AI-specific commission, to data portability, 
28:696:59418:21:20:71:543:636:144:Times:144:Times:B:to UBI and other strategies—have been suggested to address actual and perceived issues arising 
28:697:59513:20:21:71:543:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:from increased use of AI and robotics in the economy. Any assessment of these policies should 
28:698:59607:21:21:71:545:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:compare  how  they  might  address  potential  AI-related  issues  relative  to  current  policies.  For  
28:699:59713:21:20:71:542:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:universal basic income in particular, it would appear that there are a number of other proven and 
28:700:59811:20:21:71:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:effective policies, such as an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit or the establishment of 
28:701:59908:21:21:71:542:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage subsidies, might achieve the goals of increasing labor participation with fewer spillovers on 
28:702:60007:21:20:71:542:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:other aspects of the economy. Also, while we have assessed data portability in light of the need to 
28:703:60107:20:21:71:542:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:continue to spur growth and investment in AI, it is worth pointing out that it might address other 
28:704:60206:21:21:71:542:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition policy issues more generally, such as the increase in concentration observed across a

28:706:60339:30:21:107:542:420:144:Times:144:Times:A:When weighing the tradeoffs of various policy approaches, it will be useful to consider the 
28:707:60431:21:21:71:542:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:speed with which AI may or may not affect the economy. As highlighted above, on one hand, AI’s 
28:708:60526:21:21:71:542:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance in certain limited areas, such as image recognition and abstract strategy games, has 
28:709:60623:21:20:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:improved dramatically in recent years. On the other hand, AI may be hitting performance limits 
28:710:60718:20:21:71:542:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Marcus 2018), and commercial applications have not yet had any dramatic impact on economic
