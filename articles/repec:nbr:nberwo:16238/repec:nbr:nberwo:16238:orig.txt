2:47:3032:16:14:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Social experiments are powerful sources of information about the effectiveness of interventions. In
2:48:3131:14:14:72:540:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:practice, initial randomization plans are almost always compromised. Multiple hypotheses are frequently
2:49:3234:14:14:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tested. "Significant" effects are often reported with p-values that do not account for preliminary screening
2:50:3342:14:14:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from a large candidate pool of possible effects.  This paper develops tools for analyzing data from
2:51:3441:14:22:72:298:530:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:experiments as they are actually implemented. 
2:52:3487:22:14:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We apply these tools to analyze the influential HighScope Perry Preschool Program. The Perry program
2:53:3587:14:14:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:was a social experiment that provided preschool education and home visits to disadvantaged children
2:54:3686:14:14:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:during their preschool years. It was evaluated by the method of random assignment. Both treatments
2:55:3784:14:22:72:364:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and controls have been followed from age 3 through age 40. 
2:56:3843:22:14:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Previous analyses of the Perry data assume that the planned randomization protocol was implemented.
2:57:3942:14:14:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In fact, as in many social experiments, the intended randomization protocol was compromised. Accounting
2:58:4045:14:14:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for compromised randomization, multiple-hypothesis testing, and small sample sizes, we find statistically
2:59:4150:14:14:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:significant and economically important program effects for both males and females. We also examine
2:60:4248:14:24:72:269:388:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the representativeness of the Perry study.

3:93:4949:0:36:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:1    Introduction
3:94:4966:36:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Social experiments can produce valuable information about the effectiveness of interventions.
3:95:5059:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:However, many social experiments are compromised by departures from initial randomization
3:96:5148:24:24:72:539:624:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:plans.1Many have small sample sizes.  Applications of large sample statistical procedures
3:97:5237:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:may  produce  misleading  inferences.   In  addition,  most  social  experiments  have  multiple
3:98:5333:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:outcomes.  This creates the danger of selective reporting of “significant” effects from a large
3:99:5428:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:pool of possible effects, biasing downward reportedp-values.  This paper develops tools for
3:100:5519:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:analyzing the evidence from experiments with multiple outcomes as they are implemented
3:101:5605:24:23:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:rather  than  as  they  are  planned.   We  apply  these  tools  to  reanalyze  an  influential  social
3:102:5708:23:24:72:132:481:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:experiment.
3:103:5719:24:24:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The HighScope Perry Preschool program, conducted in the 1960s, was an early childhood
3:104:5804:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:intervention that provided preschool education to low-IQ, disadvantaged African-American
3:105:5892:24:24:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:children living in Ypsilanti, Michigan.  The study was evaluated by the method of random
3:106:5980:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:assignment.  Participants were followed through age 40 and plans are under way for an age-
3:107:6070:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:50 followup.  The beneficial long-term effects reported for the Perry program constitute a
3:108:6160:24:24:72:534:337:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:cornerstone of the argument for early childhood intervention efforts throughout the world.
3:109:6250:24:24:89:539:313:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Many analysts discount the reliability of the Perry study.  For example, Hanushek and
3:110:6335:24:24:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Lindseth (2009), among others, claim that the sample size of the study is too small to make
3:111:6426:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:valid  inferences  about  the  program.   Herrnstein  and  Murray  (1994)  claim  that  estimated
3:112:6523:24:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:effects of the program are small and that many are not statistically significant.  Others ex-
3:113:6616:23:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:press the concern that previous analyses selectively report statistically significant estimates,
3:114:6712:24:24:72:373:194:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:biasing the inference about the program (Anderson, 2008).
3:115:6769:24:24:89:539:170:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:There  is  a  potentially  more  devastating  critique.   As  happens  in  many  social  experi-
3:116:6865:24:24:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ments,  the  proposed  randomization  protocol  for  the  Perry  study  was  compromised.   This
3:117:6961:24:24:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:compromise casts doubt on the validity of evaluation methods that do not account for the
3:118:7049:24:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:compromised  randomization  and  calls  into  question  the  validity  of  the  simple  statistical

4:120:7240:0:24:72:370:708:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:procedures previously applied to analyze the Perry study.2
4:121:7298:24:24:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In addition,  there is the question of how representative the Perry population is of the
4:122:7386:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:general African-American population.  Those who advocate access to universal early child-
4:123:7475:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:hood programs often appeal to the evidence from the Perry study, even though the project
4:124:7563:24:24:72:370:612:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:only targeted a disadvantaged segment of the population.3
4:125:7620:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:This paper develops and applies small-sample permutation procedures that are tailored
4:126:7705:24:24:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to test hypotheses on samples generated from the less-than-ideal randomizations conducted
4:127:7794:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in many social experiments.  We apply these tools to the data from the Perry experiment.
4:128:7882:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We correct estimated treatment effects for imbalances that arose in implementing the ran-
4:129:7971:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:domization protocol and from post-randomization reassignment.  We address the potential
4:130:8058:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:problem that arises from arbitrarily selecting “significant” hypotheses from a set of possible
4:131:8152:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:hypotheses using recently developed stepdown multiple-hypothesis testing procedures.  The
4:132:8241:24:24:71:523:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:procedures we use minimize the probability of falsely rejecting any true null hypotheses.
4:133:8330:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Using these tools, this paper demonstrates the following points:  (a) Statistically signifi-
4:134:8422:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:cant Perry treatment effects survive analyses that account for the small sample size of the
4:135:8513:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:study.  (b) Correcting for the effect of selectively reporting statistically significant responses,
4:136:8612:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:there  are  substantial  impacts  of  the  program  on  males  and  females.   Results  are  stronger
4:137:8713:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for females at younger adult ages and for males at older adult ages.  (c) Accounting for the
4:138:8805:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:compromised randomization of the program strengthens the evidence for important program
4:139:8892:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:effects compared to the evidence reported in the previous literature that neglects the imbal-
4:140:8985:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ances created by compromised randomization.  (d) Perry participants are representative of a
4:141:9076:24:23:71:360:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:low-ability, disadvantaged African-American population.
4:142:9131:23:18:89:539:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:This  paper  proceeds  as  follows.   Section  2  describes  the  Perry  experiment.   Section  3
4:143:9228:18:16:85:539:164:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:2This problem is pervasive in the literature.  For example, in the Abecedarian program, randomization
4:144:9329:16:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:was also compromised as some initially enrolled in the experiment were later dropped (Campbell and Ramey,
4:145:9434:12:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:1994).  In the SIME-DIME experiment, the randomization protocol was never clearly described.  See Kurz
4:146:9536:12:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and Spiegelman (1972).  Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999) chronicle the variety of “threats to validity”
4:147:9641:12:8:72:249:112:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:encountered in many social experiments.

5:155:10183:54:36:71:484:558:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:2    Perry:  Experimental Design and Background
5:156:10230:36:24:71:539:522:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The HighScope Perry Program was conducted during the early- to mid-1960s in the district
5:157:10318:24:23:71:539:498:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of the Perry Elementary School, a public school in Ypsilanti, Michigan, a town near Detroit.
5:158:10410:23:24:71:539:475:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The sample size was small: 123 children allocated over five entry cohorts. Data were collected
5:159:10504:24:24:71:539:451:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:at age 3, the entry age, and through annual surveys until age 15, with additional follow-ups
5:160:10596:24:24:71:539:427:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:conducted at ages 19, 27, and 40.  Program attrition remained low through age 40, with over
5:161:10687:24:24:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:91% of the original subjects interviewed.  Two-thirds of the attrited were dead.  The rest
5:162:10777:24:24:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:were missing.5Numerous measures were collected on economic, criminal, and educational
5:163:10862:24:24:71:539:355:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:outcomes over this span as well as on cognition and personality.  Program intensity was low
5:164:10953:24:24:71:540:331:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:compared to that in many subsequent early childhood development programs.6Beginning at
5:165:11039:24:24:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:age 3, and lasting 2 years, treatment consisted of a 2.5-hour educational preschool on week-
5:166:11131:24:24:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:days during the school year, supplemented by weekly home visits by teachers.7HighScope’s
5:167:11219:24:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:innovative curriculum, developed over the course of the Perry experiment, was based on the
5:168:11309:24:23:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:principle of active learning,  guiding students through the formation of key developmental
5:169:11399:23:24:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:factors using intensive child-teacher interactions (Schweinhart et al. 1993, pp. 34–36; Weikart
5:170:11494:24:24:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:et al. 1978, pp. 5–6, 21–23).  A more complete description of the Perry program curriculum
5:171:11584:24:17:72:224:164:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:is given in Web Appendix A.8

5:173:11645:12:12:85:539:135:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:5There are two missing controls and two missing treatments.  Five controls and two treatments are dead.
5:174:11748:12:16:85:539:123:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:6The Abecedarian program is an example (see, e.g., Campbell et al., 2002).  Cunha, Heckman, Lochner,
5:175:11848:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and Masterov (2006) and Reynolds and Temple (2008) discuss a variety of these programs and compare their
5:176:11952:12:8:72:111:95:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:intensity.
5:177:11962:8:12:85:510:87:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:7An exception is that the first entry cohort received only 1 year of treatment, beginning at age 4.

6:179:12126:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:Eligibility CriteriaThe program admitted five entry cohorts in the early 1960s, drawn
6:180:12211:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:from the population surrounding the Perry Elementary school.  Candidate families for the
6:181:12299:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:study were identified from a survey of the families of the students attending the elementary
6:182:12391:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:school, by neighborhood group referrals, and through door-to-door canvassing. The eligibility
6:183:12484:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:rules for participation were that the participants should (i) be African-American; (ii) have
6:184:12576:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:a low IQ (between 70 and 85) at study entry,9and (iii) be disadvantaged as measured by
6:185:12662:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:parental  employment  level,  parental  education,  and  housing  density  (persons  per  room).
6:186:12758:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The Perry study targeted families who were more disadvantaged than most other African-
6:187:12844:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:American families in the United States.  but were representative of a large segment of the
6:188:12934:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:disadvantaged African-American population.  We discuss the issue of the representativeness
6:189:13024:24:23:72:498:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of the program compared to the general African-American population in Section 6.
6:190:13104:23:24:89:539:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Among children in the Perry Elementary School neighborhood, Perry study families were
6:191:13189:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:particularly  disadvantaged.   Table  1  shows  that  compared  to  other  families  with  children
6:192:13288:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in the Perry School catchment area, Perry study families were younger, had lower levels of
6:193:13378:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:parental education, and had fewer working mothers.  Further, Perry program families had
6:194:13465:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:fewer educational resources, larger families, and greater participation in welfare, compared
6:195:13557:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to the families with children in another neighborhood elementary school in Ypsilanti,  the
6:196:13647:24:24:72:475:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Erickson school, situated in a predominantly middle-class white neighborhood.
6:197:13724:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  do  not  know  whether,  among  eligible  families  in  the  Perry  catchment,  those  who
6:198:13818:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:volunteered  to  participate  in  the  program  were  more  motivated  than  other  families,  and
6:199:13916:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:whether this greater motivation would have translated into better child outcomes.  However,
6:200:14007:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:according to Weikart, Bond, and McNeil (1978, p. 16), “virtually all eligible children were
6:201:14098:23:41:72:470:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:enrolled in the project,” so this potential concern appears to be unimportant.
6:202:14176:41:24:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:Randomization ProtocolThe randomization protocol used in the Perry study was com-
6:203:14257:24:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:plex.  According to Weikart et al. (1978,  p. 16),  for each designated eligible entry cohort,
6:204:14351:18:16:85:539:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:9Measured by the Stanford-Binet IQ test (1960s norming).  The average IQ in the general population is
6:205:14452:16:0:72:502:83:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:100 by construction.  IQ range for Perry participants is 1–2 standard deviations below the average.

8:247:16295:34:24:86:540:650:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1.  In any entering cohort, younger siblings of previously enrolled families were assigned
8:248:16385:24:34:101:360:626:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:the same treatment status as their older siblings.10
8:249:16437:34:24:86:539:592:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:2.  Those remaining were ranked by their entry IQ scores.11Odd- and even-ranked subjects
8:250:16525:24:34:101:347:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:were assigned to two separate unlabeled groups.
8:251:16572:34:24:89:539:534:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Balancing  on  IQ  produced  an  imbalance  on  family  background  measures.   This  was
8:252:16661:24:37:72:363:510:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:corrected in a second, “balancing”, stage of the protocol.
8:253:16719:37:23:86:540:473:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:3.  Some individuals initially assigned to one group were swapped between the unlabeled
8:254:16806:23:24:101:540:450:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:groups to balance gender and mean socio-economic (SES) status, “with Stanford-Binet
8:255:16889:24:34:101:278:426:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:scores held more or less constant.”
8:256:16924:34:24:86:540:392:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:4.  A  flip  of  a  coin  (a  single  toss)  labeled  one  group  as  “treatment”  and  the  other  as
8:257:17026:24:34:101:151:368:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:“control.”
8:258:17036:34:24:86:540:334:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:5.  Some individuals provisionally assigned to treatment, whose mothers were employed
8:259:17121:24:24:101:540:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:at the time of the assignment, were swapped with control individuals whose mothers
8:260:17203:24:24:101:540:286:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:were not employed.  The rationale for these swaps was that it was difficult for working
8:261:17290:24:24:101:540:262:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:mothers  to  participate  in  home  visits  assigned  to  the  treatment  group  and  because
8:262:17383:24:24:101:540:238:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  transportation  difficulties.12A  total  of  five  children  of  working  mothers  initially
8:263:17479:24:17:101:352:214:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:assigned to treatment were reassigned to control.
8:264:17528:17:16:81:539:197:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:10The rationale for excluding younger siblings from the randomization process was that enrolling children
8:265:17633:16:12:72:540:181:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:in the same family in different treatment groups would weaken the observed treatment effect due to within-
8:266:17739:12:8:72:145:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:family spillovers.
8:267:17757:8:12:81:249:161:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:11Ties were broken by a toss of a coin.
8:268:17796:12:16:81:539:149:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:12The following quotation from an early monograph on Perry summarizes the logic of the study planners:
8:269:17898:16:12:72:539:133:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f13:“Occasional exchanges of children between groups also had to be made because of the inconvenience of half-day

8:271:18115:12:12:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f9:for  transportation  or  full-day  care,  and  special  arrangements  could  not  always  be  made.”  (Weikart, Bond,
8:272:18232:12:0:72:180:97:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and McNeil, 1978, p. 17)
9:273:18257:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Even  after  the  swaps  at  stage  3  were  made,  pre-program  measures  were  still  somewhat

9:278:18514:36:23:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Drawing valid inference from the Perry study requires meeting three statistical challenges: (i)
9:279:18609:23:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:small sample size; (ii) compromise in the randomization protocol; and (iii) the large number
9:280:18701:24:24:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  outcomes  and  associated  hypotheses,  which  creates  the  danger  of  selectively  reporting

9:284:18991:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:many outcome measures call into question the validity of classical tests, such as those based
9:285:19084:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:on thet-,F-,  andχ2-statistics.13Classical statistical tests rely on central limit theorems
9:286:19175:24:23:72:463:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and produce inferences based onp-values that are only asymptotically valid.
9:287:19250:23:24:89:539:302:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A substantial literature demonstrates that classical testing procedures can be unreliable
9:288:19339:24:24:72:539:278:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:when  sample  sizes  are  small  and  the  data  are  non-normal.14Both  features  characterize
