2:32:1758:28:14:72:548:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:We  explore  the  educational  response  to  fracking,  a  recent  technological  breakthrough  in  the  oil 
2:33:1867:14:14:72:547:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:and gas  industry,  taking  advantage  of  the  timing  of  its  diffusion  and  spatial  variation  in  shale 
2:34:1977:14:14:72:547:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:reserves. We  show  that  fracking  has  significantly  increased  relative  demand  for  less-educated 
2:35:2080:14:14:72:547:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:male labor and high school dropout rates of male teens, both overall and relative to females. Our 
2:36:2177:14:14:72:547:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:estimates  imply  that, absent  fracking,  the  teen  male  dropout  rate  would  have  been  1  percentage 
2:37:2284:14:14:72:547:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:point lower over 2011-15 in the average labor market with shale reserves, implying an elasticity 
2:38:2380:14:14:72:547:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:of  school  enrollment  with  respect to  earnings  below  historical  estimates.  Fracking  increased 
2:39:2482:14:14:72:547:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:earnings  more  among  young  men  than  teenage boys,  suggesting  that  educational  decisions 
2:40:2578:14:14:72:547:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:respond  to  improved  earnings  prospects,  not  just  opportunity costs.  Other  explanations  for  our 
2:41:2683:14:14:72:547:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:findings,  like  changes  in  school  quality,  migration,  or  demographics, receive  less  empirical

3:57:3033:0:27:72:176:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:I.  Introduction 
3:58:3050:27:28:108:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:Technological change, much of it complementary to skilled labor, has defined the U.S. 
3:59:3136:28:28:72:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy for more than a century. Its effects have not been confined to labor markets. By 
3:60:3225:28:27:72:526:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing the return to education, skill-biased technological change (SBTC) spurred stunning 
3:61:3319:27:28:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth in educational attainment through cohorts born in the mid-20th century (Goldin and Katz, 
3:62:3415:28:27:72:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:2008). In more recent generations, however, increases in the relative demand for skill have 
3:63:3507:27:28:72:492:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistently outstripped increases in its relative supply, suggesting that the elasticity of 
3:64:3600:28:28:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:educational attainment with respect to the skill premium may now be low and contributing to 
3:65:3692:28:27:72:543:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:rising wage inequality (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Goldin and Katz, 2008). Yet, producing credible 
3:66:3787:27:28:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:micro-level evidence on how SBTC affects educational investment decisions is difficult given 
3:67:3880:28:27:72:349:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:the typically widespread nature of technological change.  
3:68:3938:27:28:108:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper estimates the educational response to a recent technological breakthrough in a 
3:69:4028:28:28:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific industry – oil and gas extraction. By pumping large quantities of fluids at high pressure 
3:70:4127:28:27:72:506:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:down a wellbore into horizontal wells in a target rock formation, hydraulic fracturing – or 
3:71:4219:27:28:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:“fracking” – has made it possible to extract oil and natural gas from shale plays unreachable 
3:72:4313:28:27:72:510:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:through conventional technologies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2013). Recent 
3:73:4400:27:28:72:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:research suggests that the local employment impacts of fracking have been sizable and extend 
3:74:4493:28:28:72:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:beyond oil and gas extraction, expanding industries like mining, transportation, and construction 
3:75:4591:28:27:72:509:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:that disproportionately employ less-educated men (Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote, 2017).1 
3:76:4679:27:28:72:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:Additionally, labor markets that have tightened due to fracking have seen employers in other 
3:77:4772:28:27:72:510:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors cut education and experience requirements to fill positions (Modestino, Shoag, and 
3:78:4863:27:29:72:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Balance, 2017). There is also direct evidence that labor demand shocks from fracking have

3:80:5000:10:16:72:519:90:63:Times:102:Times:F:1 For general employment effects, see also Bartik et al. (forthcoming) and Maniloff and Mastromonaco (2017). 
3:81:5109:16:22:71:389:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:Krupnick and Echarte (2017) provide a recent review of the broader literature.  
4:82:5190:22:14:306:309:52:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
4:83:5190:14:0:72:75:38:144:Times:144:Times:B:

4:85:5284:27:28:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:documenting that fracking has improved the labor market prospects of male high school dropouts 
4:86:5379:28:28:72:497:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:by more than any other group. Fracking thus provides a case study in “less” skill-biased 
4:87:5468:28:27:72:534:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:technological change, with implications for education that are the reverse of the standard SBTC 
4:88:5564:27:28:72:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:story: if responsive to the skill premium, educational investments should have fallen due to 
4:89:5657:28:27:72:118:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking. 
4:90:5667:27:28:108:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:We explore the evolution of educational outcomes across areas with different shale oil 
4:91:5754:28:28:72:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:and gas endowments as fracking has spread.2 Because of the identification challenges posed by 
4:92:5848:28:27:72:539:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:the migratory response to fracking, we focus on high school enrollment and dropout decisions of 
4:93:5944:27:28:71:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:teenagers, measured in both survey and administrative data (the Census/American Community 
4:94:6034:28:27:71:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Survey (ACS) and the Common Core of Data (CCD), respectively). Our empirical approach is to 
4:95:6126:27:28:71:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:compare local labor markets – commuting zones (CZs) – with different shale oil and gas reserves 
4:96:6222:28:28:71:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:over time.3 We focus on 14 states with major shale plays,4 and our preferred models are 
4:97:6310:28:27:72:525:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:demanding, removing bias from time-varying shocks to enrollment that vary across states and 
4:98:6402:27:28:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:across CZs with different pre-fracking observables. Like Bartik et al. (forthcoming), our models 
4:99:6499:28:75:72:535:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:also allow fracking’s impacts to phase-in gradually. We assume that they begin to unfold across 
4:100:6595:75:9:216:219:219:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                
4:101:6642:9:17:72:538:210:63:Times:102:Times:F:2 Our approach is methodologically similar to that of Michaels (2011), which estimates the long-term consequences 
4:102:6756:17:9:72:524:193:102:Times:102:Times:F:of oil abundance in the U.S. South, including impacts on educational attainment in the resident adult population. 
4:103:6870:9:16:72:526:184:63:Times:102:Times:F:3 CZs are collections of contiguous counties (possibly crossing state boundaries) that were strongly linked on the 
4:104:6985:16:12:72:537:168:102:Times:102:Times:F:basis of commuting patterns in the 1990s (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996). Like metropolitan areas, CZs have been used in 
4:105:7100:12:11:72:526:156:102:Times:102:Times:F:past research to define local labor markets (e.g., Autor and Dorn, 2013; Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013a, 2013b; 
4:106:7212:11:12:72:535:145:102:Times:102:Times:F:Chetty et al., 2014), but they have the relative advantage of covering the entire United States, including rural areas. 
4:107:7332:12:11:72:522:133:102:Times:102:Times:F:CZs are thus ideal for our analysis, since fracking is largely a rural phenomenon. Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote 
4:108:7445:11:12:72:530:122:102:Times:102:Times:F:(2017) also find that CZs do a good job of capturing the local economic impacts of fracking, which do not respect 
4:109:7559:12:9:72:151:110:102:Times:102:Times:F:county boundaries. 
4:110:7578:9:16:72:540:101:63:Times:102:Times:F:4 Shale plays are shale formations with similar geologic and geographic properties that have significant quantities of 
4:111:7697:16:11:71:534:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:natural gas. We define major plays as those shale plays that have reserve estimates reported by Energy Information 
4:112:7812:11:22:71:219:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:Administration. See Data Appendix.

5:116:7940:27:28:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in timing and to allowing fracking opportunities to arise nationwide at an earlier date.  
5:117:8040:28:28:108:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:We find that fracking has slowed the rate of decline in high school dropout among male 
5:118:8127:28:27:72:538:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:teenagers since the early 2000s. Our estimates imply that, due to fracking, the dropout rate of 17-
5:119:8226:27:28:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:18-year-old boys (as measured in the Census/ACS) was 1.1 percentage points higher and the 
5:120:8316:28:27:72:489:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratio of 11th and 12th grade enrollment (as measured in the CCD) to the 17-18-year-old 
5:121:8403:27:28:71:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:population 1.4 percentage points lower over 2011-15 in the average community with shale gas 
5:122:8495:28:28:71:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:and/or oil reserves. This substantive conclusion is robust to how we estimate reserves and, as 
5:123:8590:28:27:71:529:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:noted, to changes in timing the onset of fracking’s diffusion. We also show in the Census/ACS 
5:124:8684:27:28:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the estimates are accounted for largely by boys who have not recently migrated, suggesting 
5:125:8780:28:27:72:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:that fracking has changed educational decisions among teenagers, rather than their residential 
5:126:8875:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:choices. Controlling for changes in the demographics of teen boys and allowing for increases in 
5:127:8971:28:28:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:compulsory schooling ages to have disparate effects in CZs with larger shale endowments also 
5:128:9064:28:27:72:524:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence these findings very little. Estimates for girls are indistinguishable from zero, but we 
5:129:9162:27:28:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:can often rule out effects as large as we find for boys, consistent with the incidence of fracking’s 
5:130:9263:28:27:72:182:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor market impacts.  
5:131:9286:27:28:108:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:These estimates are reduced-form, however, leaving causal mechanisms uncertain. Labor 
5:132:9372:28:28:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand shocks from fracking could have encouraged boys to drop out not just by increasing the 
5:133:9466:28:27:72:531:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:longer-term earnings prospects of male high school dropouts, but also by raising the short-term 
5:134:9562:27:28:72:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:opportunity cost of staying in school. While we cannot rule out a role for increased opportunity 
5:135:9659:28:27:72:537:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs, we show that fracking improved labor market outcomes significantly more for young men 
5:136:9752:27:28:72:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:than teenage boys, suggesting a change in the perceived return to schooling contributed to the 
5:137:9847:28:49:72:519:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:male dropout response. Even so, perceptions of this return based on older cohorts may differ

6:140:9941:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the actual return for affected cohorts, since fracking may affect that return through other 
6:141:10038:27:28:72:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:channels – by reducing school quality, for instance. Though recent research has found male 
6:142:10129:28:28:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling choices to be more sensitive to school quality (Autor et al., forthcoming), we can rule 
6:143:10227:28:27:72:531:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:out even small effects of fracking on overall per-pupil school spending and average class sizes, 
6:144:10324:27:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggesting that male schooling choices would have to be considerably more sensitive to quality 
6:145:10419:28:27:72:387:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures orthogonal to school resources to explain our findings.  
6:146:10485:27:28:108:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:These conclusions diverge from those of Weber (2014), who finds that natural gas 
6:147:10566:28:28:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking in four states has increased the share of the adult population with a high school degree 
6:148:10664:28:27:72:519:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:and reduced the dropout share. The difference may owe to migration: fracking has generated 
6:149:10755:27:28:72:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:modest, but consistent net in-migration of working-age adults (Bartik, 2018; Wilson, 2017). By 
6:150:10850:28:27:72:535:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:focusing on a younger, less mobile population, we attempt to isolate educational decisions from 
6:151:10946:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:residential ones, like previous studies of resource booms and busts (Black, McKinnish, and 
6:152:11037:28:28:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sanders, 2005; Emery, Ferrer, and Green, 2012; Morissette, Chan, and Lu, 2015), and as noted, 
6:153:11131:28:27:72:539:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:our survey data allow us to rule out migration as a confounder. By incorporating more states and 
6:154:11228:27:28:72:505:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:multiple data sources, our analysis is also more comprehensive than concurrent studies of 
6:155:11318:28:27:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking’s impacts on the schooling decisions of young people (e.g., Marchand and Weber, 2015; 
6:156:11413:27:28:72:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rickman, Wang, and Winters, 2017; Zuo, Schieffer, and Buck, 2018). More states allow for 
6:157:11502:28:28:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:consideration of the mediating effects of changes in state education policies like compulsory 
6:158:11596:28:27:72:527:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling laws. Multiple data sources also allow us to closely examine which mechanisms are 
6:159:11688:27:38:72:222:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving the dropout response.5

6:163:11990:12:11:71:505:108:102:Times:102:Times:F:student enrollment. Rickman, Wang, and Winters (2017) focus on the educational attainment of native-born

6:165:12214:12:11:71:506:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:and Buck (2018) provide a complementary analysis using different sources of fracking-related variation and

7:172:12684:28:27:72:510:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo, 2018), to infrastructure and workfare programs in India

7:174:12867:28:27:72:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:localized variation in the incidence of an economic shock. To our knowledge, however, this

7:178:13176:27:28:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:high school enrollment with respect to adult male earnings of around 0.18, below the lower 
7:179:13267:28:27:72:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:bound of the range of elasticities estimated by Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005) in their

7:181:13448:28:28:72:541:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:stronger response to technological change in resource extraction than to even long-lived resource 
7:182:13546:28:27:72:521:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:price shocks. Yet, these findings are consistent with a low supply elasticity of educated labor

7:188:13965:27:28:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:least one CZ that is part of a major shale play.6 We derive the reserve measure from the 2011 
7:189:14059:28:33:72:541:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:map of shale plays published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the maximum

7:191:14198:10:16:72:508:113:63:Times:102:Times:F:6 We focus on all shale plays with oil reserves and/or gas reserves reported by the EIA for at least four years 
7:192:14310:16:12:71:526:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:between 2008 and 2015. There are 17 states with at least one CZ containing a major shale play by this definition: 
7:193:14424:12:11:71:535:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota,

8:198:14701:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:2015.7 Overlaying the shale map to CZs, we allocate oil and gas reserves to CZs based on the 
8:199:14794:28:28:72:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:fraction of each play that they represent, then convert them to a common metric that captures the 
8:200:14892:28:27:72:520:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount of heating energy that they contain – millions of British Thermal Units (MMBTUs).  
8:201:14982:27:28:108:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:There is considerable regional variation in reserves per capita (2000 population), with 
8:202:15070:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:clusters of high-reserve areas in the Western, Southern, and mid-Atlantic regions. These areas lie 
8:203:15169:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:atop different major shale plays: the Bakken (in Montana and North Dakota), the Barnett, Eagle 
8:204:15264:28:28:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ford, Fayetteville, Haynesville-Bossier, and Woodford (in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), 
8:205:15355:28:27:72:536:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the Marcellus (in Pennsylvania and West Virginia). However, although the reserve measure 
8:206:15448:27:28:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:is rather blunt, constructed from just the intersection of a CZ with a major play and the overall 
8:207:15546:28:27:72:535:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:play’s economic potential,8 there is also variation in the magnitude of per-capita reserves across 
8:208:15645:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:areas that are close geographically. This means we can identify the effects of fracking from 
8:209:15738:28:28:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:within-state variation in reserves across CZs, an approach that helpfully sweeps out the shared 
8:210:15834:28:27:72:528:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of other state-level shocks, such as changes in state education policy or other aggregate 
8:211:15932:27:28:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic developments. It also mitigates the influence of outliers in the reserve distribution, 
8:212:16028:28:27:72:375:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:which are concentrated in states like North Dakota and Texas.  
8:213:16090:27:28:108:506:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our estimation sample restricts attention to the 14 states in Figure 1 where data on

8:219:16548:9:16:72:542:113:63:Times:102:Times:F:8 We therefore don’t take advantage of within-play differences in “prospectivity,” which could reflect local efforts to 
8:220:16668:16:12:72:539:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:identify economically recoverable reserves and be independently related to trends in educational attainment. See the 
8:221:16785:12:11:72:538:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:Data Appendix for a complete description of how the reserve measure was calculated. We explore the robustness of

9:226:17061:27:28:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:also trim the sample to exclude the smallest 5% and largest 10% of CZs within each state, based 
9:227:17157:28:28:72:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:on population in the year 2000.10 Table 1 Panel A shows that, while the average CZ in this 
9:228:17248:28:27:72:521:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample has substantial shale reserves, its shale oil and gas production as of 2000 was not that 
9:229:17344:27:28:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:high. This is expected: shale gas and oil reserves have become exploitable only as horizontal 
9:230:17438:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:drilling and fracking have spread. For our main analysis, we date the start of widespread use of 
9:231:17535:27:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking to 2006 – a year that predates the first frack dates of the highest-reserve plays but marks 
9:232:17636:28:28:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the rough beginning of the application of the technology in lower-reserve plays.11 The aggregate

9:240:18210:10:16:72:532:292:63:Times:102:Times:F:9 We lose Arkansas, Kentucky, and Wyoming due to missing QWI data for the year 2000. Schooling estimates are 
9:241:18319:16:12:71:539:276:102:Times:102:Times:F:substantively similar when we include these states, as shown in the Appendix. Data sources are discussed below and 
9:242:18434:12:9:71:249:264:102:Times:102:Times:F:described completely in the Data Appendix. 
9:243:18477:9:16:72:514:255:63:Times:102:Times:F:10 The motivation for this is twofold: our outcome measures are especially noisy for the smallest CZs, and the 
9:244:18588:16:11:72:534:239:102:Times:102:Times:F:largest CZs often include large cities that do not seem a valid counterfactual for the typical CZ with shale reserves. 
9:245:18707:11:12:72:523:228:102:Times:102:Times:F:We drop a total of 57 CZs due to this sample restriction. Our findings for schooling attainment are substantively 
9:246:18821:12:11:72:526:216:102:Times:102:Times:F:similar if we drop the smallest 10%, rather than 5%, of CZs within each state, but are more sensitive to including 
9:247:18936:11:9:72:185:205:102:Times:102:Times:F:larger cities. See Appendix. 
9:248:18965:9:16:72:517:196:63:Times:102:Times:F:11 We prefer this approach to one taking advantage of variation in first frack dates across shale plays given the 
9:249:19079:16:12:72:518:180:102:Times:102:Times:F:potential endogeneity of play-specific timing and the fact a lack of ACS data for 2001-2004 makes variation in 
9:250:19190:12:12:72:537:168:102:Times:102:Times:F:timing more difficult to exploit convincingly. However, our estimates are qualitatively similar when we exploit this 
9:251:19307:12:11:72:518:156:102:Times:102:Times:F:timing (Table 5). Bartik et al. (forthcoming) report first frack dates of 2008 for both the Marcellus play and the 
9:252:19422:11:12:72:539:145:102:Times:102:Times:F:Haynesville-Bossier play, for shale gas, and of 2007 and 2009, respectively, for the Bakken play and the Eagle Ford 
9:253:19538:12:11:72:541:133:102:Times:102:Times:F:play, for shale oil. Smaller plays, like Avalon Bone-Spring (oil), Fayetteville (gas), Woodford (gas), were reportedly

9:255:19689:9:16:72:539:113:63:Times:102:Times:F:12 The data are annual aggregates of monthly well-level production data from DrillingInfo. Following prior research 
9:256:19805:16:12:72:535:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:using these data, we classify production from horizontal and directional (“unconventional”) wells as fracking, or as 
9:257:19922:12:11:72:524:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:coming from shale. To be conservative, we classify unknown well types as vertical (or “conventional”) wells. In 
9:258:20034:11:22:72:427:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:Table 5, we assess the robustness of our findings to the choice of 2006 in various ways.

10:262:20217:27:28:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Murnane, 2013) – as fracking has spread, and more so in places with larger shale endowments. 
10:263:20311:28:28:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:It is therefore useful to begin our investigation by establishing that our reserves measure and 
10:264:20407:28:27:72:520:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumptions about timing predict changes in local economic activity consistent with existing 
10:265:20500:27:28:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates. Because it is important for the interpretation of the dropout findings that follow in 
10:266:20597:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section III, we also document the sex and skill bias in these changes to local economic activity 
10:267:20694:27:28:72:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:using data from the QWI, which aggregates administrative microdata on jobs and earnings 
10:268:20782:28:28:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:covering 95% of private sector workers (see Data Appendix) and has recently been used in other

11:287:22119:27:28:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas production from vertical wells: the slope on reserves does not significantly change between 
11:288:22215:28:28:72:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:2005 (the year for the omitted interaction) and any subsequent (or prior) years. However, the 
11:289:22309:28:27:72:518:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient estimates for production from horizontal wells (fracking) suggest that production 
11:290:22403:27:28:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:picked up in higher-reserve CZs several years after 2005; the first statistically significant change 
11:291:22504:28:27:71:505:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:in slope, relative to 2005, actually does not occur until 2011. But the overall pattern is not 
11:292:22599:27:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:surprising given the trends in Figure 2, and it is reassuring that greater growth occurs in CZs with 
11:293:22700:28:28:71:372:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher shale oil and gas endowments per our reserve measure. 
11:294:22761:28:27:107:540:487:144:Times:144:Times:A:Wells needed to be drilled before they can produce, however, so the labor demand effects 
11:295:22850:27:28:71:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fracking should have been felt before large production impacts. And it is arguably these 
11:296:22942:28:27:71:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment shocks – rather than shale production per se – that are more salient for schooling 
11:297:23036:27:28:71:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:choices. The black triangles in Figure 3 Panel B represent event-study estimates for the jobs-to-
11:298:23133:28:28:71:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:population ratio for men ages 25 and over.13 The underlying data are CZ-by-year aggregates of 
11:299:23227:28:27:72:527:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:quarterly county- and sex-level data from the QWI, for the numerator, and annual sex-specific

11:302:23502:27:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:event-study coefficients imply that, despite significantly lower jobs-to-population levels in 2000 
11:303:23601:28:28:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Table 1, Panel B), higher-reserve CZs did not experience different job growth for men between 
11:304:23696:28:27:72:528:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000 and 2005. Thereafter, however, higher-reserve CZs start gaining jobs for men faster than 
11:305:23790:27:61:72:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower-reserve CZs in the same state. This phenomenon strengthens through the end of the period

11:307:23932:10:16:72:518:113:63:Times:102:Times:F:13 We focus on the entire population ages 25 and over because the educational breakdown of jobs and monthly 
11:308:24040:16:12:72:524:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:earnings by sex, explored in Table 3 and Figure 4, is available only for this broad age group in the QWI. See the 
11:309:24154:12:11:72:532:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:Data Appendix for a complete description of the QWI data. We consider impacts on jobs and earnings in narrower 
11:310:24265:11:22:72:433:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:age bands, across all education categories, in the section on causal mechanisms (Table 7).

12:314:24450:27:28:72:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:diamonds) are much lower in magnitude, implying smaller impacts on female employment.  
12:315:24537:28:28:108:511:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another way of measuring the labor demand shocks from fracking is to estimate its 
12:316:24619:28:27:72:513:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:impacts on the earnings prospects. To this end, we follow Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo 
12:317:24709:27:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2018) in estimating impacts on the natural log of “expected” monthly earnings, with expected 
12:318:24803:28:27:72:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:monthly earnings defined as the product of the average monthly earnings of adults ages 25 and 
12:319:24897:27:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:over times the jobs-to-population ratio. As shown in Figure 3 Panel C, this measure suggests 
12:320:24990:28:28:71:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:more sizable labor market impacts over 2006 to 2010, but a difference between an immediate 
12:321:25081:28:27:71:315:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:and a later post-fracking period is still noticeable.

12:328:25614:28:27:72:533:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:between 2006-10 and 2000-05, and 휃/ represents the change between 2011-15 and 2000-05. To 
12:329:25703:27:28:72:474:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:validate this specification, we also test whether estimates of 휃6 and 휃/ are different. 
12:330:25789:28:28:108:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:Unless otherwise noted, throughout the remainder of the paper, we estimate model (2)

12:332:25969:27:49:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:D. As shown in column 2, CZs with higher per-capita shale reserves differ in some ways from

12:334:26108:10:16:72:531:125:63:Times:102:Times:F:14 We have also estimated deviation-from-trend models, which effectively impose separate linear fits on the event-
12:335:26222:16:12:71:538:109:102:Times:102:Times:F:study coefficients before and after 2005. The identifying assumption is that, in the absence of fracking, any trending 
12:336:26341:12:12:71:534:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:in the 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$ gradient in the pre-period would have simply continued. Such a model allows some of the effects 
12:337:26454:12:11:72:523:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:of fracking to be immediate (post-2005 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$ intercept shift) and some to accumulate over time (post-2005 
12:338:26564:11:22:72:510:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:change in the trend in the 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$ gradient). The results are quite similar to what we report for model (2).

13:345:27048:27:28:107:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:The first two columns of Table 2 Panel A present estimates of model (2) for the jobs-to-

13:350:27512:27:28:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretable magnitude: the implied effects of fracking over 2011-15 for the average CZ with

13:352:27703:29:27:72:497:403:144:Times:144:Times:B:1 Panel A). The average CZ with reserves gained more jobs for men than women due to 
13:353:27787:27:28:72:528:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking: about 43 male jobs for every 1000 adult men and about 6 female jobs for every 1000 
13:354:27880:28:28:72:540:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:adult women by 2011-15. It also saw substantial earnings growth: expected earnings were 10.4% 
13:355:27974:28:27:72:521:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher for men, and 2.6% higher for women, by 2011-15. These estimates are roughly in line

13:363:28716:11:12:72:524:182:102:Times:102:Times:F:its standard deviation. We arrive at similar calculations regarding magnitudes for other variables where there are

13:372:29566:11:22:72:392:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:range from 1.3% to 14.4% and earnings effects that range from 1.8% to 16.7%.

14:379:29980:27:28:72:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of educational attainment. We estimate the sex- and education-specific CZ population by 
14:380:30068:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:multiplying the overall adult CZ population by the share of adult men or women ages 25-64 with 
14:381:30163:27:28:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the relevant completed education in the Census or ACS.19 For brevity, we show only implied 
14:382:30254:28:28:71:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects by 2011-15 for the average CZ with any reserves, calculated as earlier described.20 Figure 
14:383:30353:28:27:72:525:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:4 provides a graphical representation of the corresponding event-study (model (1)) estimates.  
14:384:30448:27:28:108:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:Men of all education levels have experienced job and expected earnings gains as a result 
14:385:30537:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fracking (Panel A). However, gains along both dimensions have been largest among high 
14:386:30626:27:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:school dropouts: by 2011-15, the average male dropout in a CZ with any reserves had a 7 percent 
14:387:30722:28:28:72:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher chance of holding a job due to fracking – a figure marginally significantly larger than the 
14:388:30821:28:27:72:518:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:gain for high school graduates (p=0.063). In addition, male dropouts ages 25 and over in the 
14:389:30914:27:28:71:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:average CZ with reserves would have expected to earn, across 2011-15, 12.7% more than they 
14:390:31005:28:27:71:518:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:otherwise would have. This is not significantly greater than the earnings growth expected by 
14:391:31098:27:28:71:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:high school graduates (p=0.185), but it is significantly greater than the expected earnings growth 
14:392:31197:28:28:71:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:among men with some college or more. Among women, jobs gains were more similar across 
14:393:31283:28:27:71:492:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:education categories, but earnings gains were also most substantial at the bottom of the 
14:394:31372:27:48:71:184:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution (Panel B).

15:404:31986:27:28:108:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:We have established that our measure of shale reserves and assumptions about the timing 
15:405:32074:28:28:72:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the spread of fracking predict changes in local economic activity consistent with existing 
15:406:32168:28:27:72:518:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:findings. We have also added to existing understanding of these changes by exploiting more 
15:407:32259:27:28:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:granular data: not only did places with more shale reserves experience more growth in labor 
15:408:32351:28:27:72:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand starting around 2006 – particularly in 2011 and later – those increases in labor demand 
15:409:32446:27:28:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:were weighted toward men, and among men, those less-educated. Male high school dropouts saw 
15:410:32538:28:28:72:380:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the greatest improvements in their jobs and earnings prospects.  
15:411:32603:28:27:108:499:487:144:Times:144:Times:A:Collectively, these findings suggest that the educational decisions of young men, 
15:412:32685:27:28:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:including on the high school dropout margin, are likely to have been affected by fracking. Our 
15:413:32780:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:next goal is to estimate the reduced-form effect of fracking on high school dropout by sex, using 
15:414:32878:27:28:72:488:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the same models that we employed in Section II; we defer further discussion of causal 
15:415:32964:28:28:72:207:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanisms to Section IV.  
15:416:32991:28:27:72:135:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:A.  Data 
15:417:33000:27:28:108:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:We use two sources of information on dropout; neither is ideal, but they provide 
15:418:33081:28:27:72:350:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary evidence on the phenomenon of interest.  
15:419:33136:27:28:108:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:First, we construct high school dropout rates from the public-use microdata samples 
15:420:33220:28:28:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:(PUMS) of the 2000 Census and the 2005 through 2015 ACS (Ruggles et al., 2015). These data 
15:421:33311:28:27:72:537:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:provide person-level information on sex, age, school enrollment, and educational attainment and 
15:422:33407:27:28:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:identify local geography down to the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. While PUMAs 
15:423:33496:28:27:72:539:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:are not the same as CZs, they can be allocated to CZs based on the division of county population 
15:424:33593:27:28:72:531:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:across PUMAs and the mapping between CZs and counties. As with our analysis on the spread 
15:425:33683:28:49:72:519:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fracking, we choose to aggregate to the CZ level to capture the local economic impacts of

16:429:33867:27:28:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:2017). We focus on 17- and 18-year-olds – an age group for which dropout decisions are salient 
16:430:33962:28:28:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:but migration for work is low – and define dropout as having not recently been enrolled in school 
16:431:34060:28:27:72:397:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:and not having a high school degree or GED (see Data Appendix).  
16:432:34125:27:28:108:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:Though suitable for this analysis, the Census and ACS have limitations. First, small 
16:433:34210:28:27:72:487:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:samples (5% in the Census and 1% in the ACS) contribute to imprecision. Second, no 
16:434:34293:27:28:72:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on PUMA is available in the 2001 to 2004 ACS, limiting the years available to 
16:435:34383:28:28:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:establish common outcomes trends in the pre-fracking period, which are implicit in a difference-
16:436:34479:28:27:72:489:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:in-differences specification. Third, the dropout rates from the Census and ACS are not 
16:437:34566:27:28:72:372:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily comparable due to differences in survey timing.21  
16:438:34629:28:27:108:501:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our second data source – the CCD – helps to address these limitations. The CCD 
16:439:34708:27:28:72:487:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes annual school-district level data on high school enrollment by grade and sex. 
16:440:34795:28:28:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Enrollment data in the CCD are in principle consistently measured and cover all school districts 
16:441:34892:28:27:72:518:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the United States. After accounting for some lapses in coverage, aggregating 11th and 12th 
16:442:34985:27:28:71:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:grade enrollment (combined) from the district to the CZ level, and normalizing by estimates of 
16:443:35080:28:27:71:533:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 17-18-year-old population from SEER, we have an annual series on sex-specific enrollment-
16:444:35173:27:28:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:to-population ratios beginning in the 1999-00 academic year (represented as 2000 to follow). The 
16:445:35270:28:68:71:434:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:main limitation of this series is that data are missing for 2009-10 (2010).22

16:447:35396:10:16:72:531:161:63:Times:102:Times:F:21 The Census, officially collected on April 1, solicits school enrollment as of February 1. By contrast, the ACS is 
16:448:35513:16:11:72:524:145:102:Times:102:Times:F:fielded throughout the year (with survey month not publicly reported) and asks about school enrollment over the 
16:449:35625:11:12:72:541:134:102:Times:102:Times:F:past three months. Because a new school year begins typically in August or September, a higher share of the 17- and 
16:450:35741:12:11:72:534:122:102:Times:102:Times:F:18-year-olds surveyed in the fall – and therefore a higher share of 17- and 18-year-olds in the ACS – will be of age 
16:451:35858:11:12:72:529:111:102:Times:102:Times:F:to be enrolled in 12th grade or beyond. If teens sometimes make dropout decisions based on grade rather than age, 
16:452:35972:12:12:72:539:99:102:Times:102:Times:F:and if that tendency happens to be correlated with 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$, our estimates from the Census/ACS analysis could be

17:460:36351:28:27:71:511:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:olds (Panel B). In both cases, we restrict attention to the same sample of CZs considered in 
17:461:36444:27:28:71:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section II; the standard errors underlying the 90% confidence intervals (capped vertical lines) are 
17:462:36544:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:clustered on CZ; and we include time-varying effects of the CZ observables in Table 1 Panel D, 
17:463:36639:27:28:72:501:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:in an attempt to improve precision. We also weight the estimates in Panel B by cell size.  
17:464:36730:28:28:107:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:The coefficients are noisier than those in Figure 3 Panel B and Figure 4. However, the 
17:465:36817:28:27:71:536:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates are consistent with fracking weakening the attachment of teenage boys to high school. 
17:466:36913:27:28:72:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:As was the case in Figures 3 and 4 for jobs-to-population ratios and expected earnings, the 
17:467:37005:28:27:72:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:gradient between male dropout and 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$ (black triangles) shows a distinctly different trend 
17:468:37101:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:after 2005 from the flat trend that preceded it. Starting in 2006, higher-reserve CZs begin to see 
17:469:37200:28:28:72:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger reductions – or smaller increases – in male enrollment-to-population ratios relative to 
17:470:37295:28:27:72:511:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower-reserve CZs in the same state (Panel A). For dropout, the pattern is flipped, showing 
17:471:37387:27:28:72:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative increases in dropout in high versus low-reserve CZs in 2006 and later (Panel B). In both 
17:472:37485:28:27:72:535:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:panels, the point estimates appear consistent with a larger impact, on average, in 2011 and later, 
17:473:37584:27:28:72:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:precisely when fracking appears to start having larger labor market impacts. The event-study 
17:474:37677:28:28:72:465:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients for female dropout rates (gray diamonds) do not display this pattern.

18:483:38314:27:28:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients move in the direction of increased dropout. However, there is a significantly greater 
18:484:38413:28:28:72:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:decrease (increase) in the enrollment-to-population ratio (dropout rate) for relatively high reserve 
18:485:38514:28:27:72:531:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:CZs between 2011-15 and 2000-05, and the data reject equality of the difference-in-differences

18:487:38701:28:27:72:489:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment-to-population (dropout rates) in the average CZ with any reserves were 1.4

18:492:39057:28:27:108:486:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 5 explores the sensitivity of our estimates to a number of changes in the 
18:493:39137:27:28:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:econometric specification. For reference, Panel A repeats the sex-specific estimates for both 
18:494:39231:28:28:72:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment-to-population and dropout rates from Table 4. Columns 5 and 6 of each panel 
18:495:39318:28:27:72:511:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:demonstrate how the changes in specification affect sex-specific estimates of the impact of 
18:496:39410:27:28:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking on the natural log of expected monthly earnings (Table 2). This is a useful benchmark, 
18:497:39506:28:27:71:525:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:since specifications that generate weaker “first stage” impacts on the labor market should also 
18:498:39602:27:28:71:502:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:generate weaker impacts on school enrollment, if changes in the labor market are the key 
18:499:39691:28:28:71:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanism linking fracking to schooling decisions. Throughout, we give predicted effects by 
18:500:39783:28:27:71:301:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:2011-15 in the average CZ with any reserves.23 
18:501:39829:27:28:108:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:A:To begin, we consider sensitivity to controls. In Panel B, we first drop the controls for 
18:502:39919:28:45:72:522:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:time-varying effects of the year 2000 CZ observables in Table 1 Panel D. The impacts on the

18:505:40171:16:11:72:529:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:D, respectively. Plots of event-study coefficients for each of these specifications are in Appendix Figures A1, A2,

19:509:40297:0:27:72:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates are generally small and not consistent across outcomes. However, substituting year 
19:510:40390:27:28:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed effects only for the state-by-year fixed effects in our preferred model slightly raises the 
19:511:40488:28:28:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:magnitude of the estimated impacts for boys. Such a finding may arise if fracking opportunities 
19:512:40584:28:27:72:519:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:in a CZ also increased dropout propensities of boys elsewhere in the state. But an alternative 
19:513:40679:27:28:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanation is that higher-reserve CZs are in states where dropout rates would have been falling 
19:514:40776:28:27:71:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:less quickly over time for other reasons. Although the estimates are largely similar, state-by-year 
19:515:40876:27:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed effects help to ensure our estimates are not contaminated by these state-specific shocks. 
19:516:40972:28:28:72:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:The final specification in Panel B provides unweighted estimates for the dropout outcome. The 
19:517:41066:28:27:72:518:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard errors actually fall slightly in the unweighted specification, suggesting the potential 
19:518:41163:27:28:71:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:importance of small outliers. The point estimates, however, remain basically unchanged. 
19:519:41251:28:27:107:516:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:Panel C considers different assumptions about timing. First, we assign each CZ with 
19:520:41335:27:28:72:510:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:reserves the first frack year for the earliest-fracked shale play it lies atop (푡$∗), with dates as 
19:521:41435:28:28:72:410:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported by Bartik et al. (forthcoming). The model of interest is then:

19:524:41655:28:27:72:541:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:the introduction of variation across states in when the 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$ gradient should begin to change. 
19:525:41754:27:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:For both schooling outcomes, the estimates are now smaller in magnitude for boys. However, 
19:526:41845:28:28:72:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated impacts on adult male earnings are as well, and implied effects of local earnings 
19:527:41937:28:27:72:537:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth on schooling decisions for boys are quite similar to what we saw at baseline, particularly 
19:528:42035:27:28:72:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the enrollment-to-population ratio. Nevertheless, we can no longer reject equality of the 
19:529:42129:28:27:72:529:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:impacts on dropout rates across boys and girls. The next specification is a simple difference-in-
19:530:42226:27:28:72:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences, comparing 2011-15 to the year 2000 only, and so acknowledging that fracking 
19:531:42315:28:49:72:500:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurred earlier in some places. The primary consequence is to reduce statistical power.

20:534:42407:0:27:108:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Panel D explores the robustness of our conclusions to alternative predictions of local 
20:535:42494:27:28:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:shale reserves. The first two approaches weight oil and gas reserves by price rather than energy 
20:536:42591:28:28:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:content in the aggregate reserve prediction under extreme assumptions: using the peak ratio of oil 
20:537:42690:28:27:72:539:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:to gas prices (from 2012) and the peak ratio of gas to oil prices (from 2003).24 We then apply the 
20:538:42789:27:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:earliest available shale play reserve estimates (from 2008), combining oil and gas into common 
20:539:42884:28:27:72:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:energy units as in our original measure.25 For boys, the implied effects of earnings growth on 
20:540:42979:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment (column 1) and dropout (column 3) are weakened the most when using 2008 reserve 
20:541:43070:28:28:72:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates, but they are still evident, suggesting that using more recent reserves data mainly 
20:542:43164:28:27:72:470:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:serves to improve statistical power. Dropout estimates for girls continue to remain 
20:543:43248:27:28:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:indistinguishable from zero, and in most cases remain significantly lower in magnitude than 
20:544:43340:28:27:72:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:those for boys. Overall, the implications are the same regardless of how reserves are measured: 
20:545:43436:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking appears to have lowered schooling attainment for teenage boys much more so than for 
20:546:43529:28:28:72:110:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:girls.26

20:549:43661:28:52:72:498:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar to those at baseline: the schooling decisions of teenage boys appear to have been

20:551:43798:9:17:72:527:233:63:Times:102:Times:F:24 In essence, we bound the relative weights placed on oil and gas when combined using prices; although there is 
20:552:43911:17:11:72:531:216:102:Times:102:Times:F:temporal and geographic variation in energy prices, price expectations as relevant for our analysis would arguably 
20:553:44026:11:9:72:373:205:102:Times:102:Times:F:fall between these extremes of annual industry-standard price benchmarks. 
20:554:44100:9:16:72:520:196:63:Times:102:Times:F:25 Shale oil reserve estimates are not available until 2011, so our local per-capita reserve estimates for 2008 are 
20:555:44216:16:10:72:239:180:102:Times:102:Times:F:imputed for oil with 2011 reserve values. 
20:556:44258:10:16:72:509:170:63:Times:102:Times:F:26 Appendix Table A7 shows sensitivity of our schooling estimates to changes in the estimation sample. The 
20:557:44365:16:11:71:521:154:102:Times:102:Times:F:reduced-form estimates are slightly smaller in magnitude when we include CZs from the three states with major 
20:558:44475:11:12:71:502:143:102:Times:102:Times:F:shale plays but without QWI data for 2000, though we still reject equality of effects by 2011-15 across sex. 
20:559:44584:12:11:71:506:131:102:Times:102:Times:F:Dropping the bottom 10% rather than the bottom 5% of a state’s CZs (based on size) has lesser effect on the 
20:560:44692:11:12:71:531:120:102:Times:102:Times:F:estimates than dropping the top 5% rather than the top 10% of a state’s CZs. In the latter case, the estimated effect 
20:561:44810:12:11:71:532:108:102:Times:102:Times:F:on male dropout shrinks (but remains significant) and we can no longer reject equality of effects with females. We 
20:562:44925:11:12:71:494:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:think our preferred sample selection rule is justifiable given that large CZs are unlikely to provide a valid 
20:563:45035:12:11:71:533:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:counterfactual for smaller CZs where fracking is more prevalent, and indeed, the balance tests in Table 1 column 2 
20:564:45150:11:22:72:264:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:look less compelling with larger CZs included.

21:567:45200:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly more negatively affected by fracking than those of teenage girls. Before we move 
21:568:45295:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:on to why educational choices were affected by fracking, it is useful to confirm that the estimates 
21:569:45395:28:28:72:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:indeed reflect educational decisions rather than residential ones. Concerns over migration 
21:570:45486:28:27:72:523:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:motivated our study of teenagers, but could migration still be affecting our estimates? Setting 
21:571:45582:27:28:72:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:aside the question of migration, other explanations for our findings besides fracking, like 
21:572:45674:28:27:72:472:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneity in responses to changes in state education policies, are also possible. 
21:573:45760:27:28:108:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:Consider migration first, which we can observe in Census and ACS microdata. Because 
21:574:45844:28:28:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the endogeneity of migration, we do not condition estimation on it but rather decompose the 
21:575:45939:28:27:72:541:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcome variable into a dummy for being both a dropout and a recent migrant (in the past year in 
21:576:46036:27:28:71:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the ACS and in the past 5 years in the Census) and a dummy for being both a dropout and not a 
21:577:46129:28:27:71:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent migrant; t  he sum of coefficients across these two outcomes is equal to the total baseline 
21:578:46228:27:28:71:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:dropout effect. As shown in Table 6 Panel B, only the estimates for being both a dropout and not 
21:579:46323:28:28:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:a recent migrant are statistically significant for boys and statistically different between boys and 
21:580:46424:28:27:71:501:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:girls. The vast majority of the reduced-form estimate thus appears to be accounted for by 
21:581:46514:27:28:71:307:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:educational choices rather than residential ones.  
21:582:46565:28:27:107:535:294:144:Times:144:Times:A:Even if not driven by migration, shifts in the demographics of the local population could 
21:583:46655:27:28:71:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:be incidentally correlated with the spread of fracking and could therefore influence our estimates. 
21:584:46755:28:28:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the first set of estimates in Panel C, we control for time-varying local shares of the Census and 
21:585:46856:28:27:71:536:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:ACS 17- and 18-year-olds who are black, Hispanic, or who have recently migrated. The implied 
21:586:46949:27:28:71:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects on dropout change little, suggesting that fracking is not strongly correlated with changes 
21:587:47048:28:45:71:489:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the composition of 17- and 18-year-olds, at least on these observable dimensions.27

21:590:47291:16:11:72:524:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:variables are only available for the selected sample of 17- and 18-year-olds in the Census and ACS who still live

22:595:47515:27:28:72:502:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in the local environment, we control for changes in the age at which states allow 
22:596:47605:28:28:72:510:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:children to drop out of high school. Common effects of such changes are of course already 
22:597:47695:28:27:72:540:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:captured in our state-by-year fixed effects. But suppose that dropout rates in higher-reserve areas 
22:598:47795:27:28:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:fell relatively less in response to the increases in compulsory schooling ages that occurred over 
22:599:47893:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:our estimation period.28 Then a dropout effect we are attributing to fracking may really be caused 
22:600:47992:27:28:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:by heterogeneity in the impacts of state education policy. In the last rows of Table 6, Panel C, we 
22:601:48092:28:28:71:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:assess this possibility directly by including as a control the interaction between 푟푒푠푒푟푣푒푠$ and a 
22:602:48191:28:27:72:533:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:state-by-time-varying indicator for the requirement that a person be enrolled in school until age 
22:603:48289:27:28:72:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:17 or 18. We do this both for the dropout rate of 17-18-year-olds and for the enrollment-to-
22:604:48381:28:27:72:484:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:population ratio. For males, the estimates get slightly larger in magnitude, though not 
22:605:48469:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly so, suggesting that such heterogeneity either is working against us seeing an effect 
22:606:48568:28:28:72:502:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:or is difficult to detect given the generally small changes in dropout in response to recent 
22:607:48661:28:27:72:360:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in compulsory schooling laws (Oreopoulos, 2009).

22:609:48755:28:27:108:502:294:144:Times:144:Times:A:The dropout findings capture the reduced-form effects of fracking – the effects of

22:611:48924:28:28:72:514:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:independently interesting, we also care about causal mechanisms. For example, in Becker’s 
22:612:49014:28:27:72:515:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:classic (1964) model of human capital investment, candidate mechanisms for an increase in 
22:613:49104:27:50:72:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:dropout rates would include more than just a reduction in the return to a high school degree;

22:617:49469:11:12:72:322:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:compulsory schooling ages from 2000 forward from NCES at

23:622:49694:0:27:72:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases in the costs of staying in high school, namely increases in the opportunity cost, matter 
23:623:49793:27:28:72:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:as well. But fracking can also affect the return to a high school degree by influencing school 
23:624:49888:28:28:72:441:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality, which may rise due to additional funding, or fall due to crowding.29  
23:625:49967:28:27:107:517:625:144:Times:144:Times:A:To formalize the discussion of channels, consider a choice between two states – high 
23:626:50052:27:28:71:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:school graduation and high school dropout – among 18-year-olds. Those who choose to graduate 
23:627:50145:28:27:71:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:enter the labor market one year later than those who do not. The decision point is normalized to 
23:628:50242:27:28:71:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:year 0, so that dropouts enter the labor market in year 0, and graduates enter in year 1; all 
23:629:50336:28:28:71:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals then work through year T in discrete time indexed by t. Individuals i vary in their 
23:630:50432:28:27:71:539:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability, 푑L, which is uniformly distributed over [0,1]. For simplicity, assume that earnings in both 
23:631:50533:27:28:72:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:states are known at the time of the decision, with 푌NO(푡)>푌STNO(푡)	∀푡. Also assume that the 
23:632:50625:28:27:72:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:indirect or psychic costs of remaining in high school until period 1, 휑(푑L), are decreasing in 
23:633:50720:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability, so that 휑′<0. Most potential dropouts are enrolled in public school, so direct costs of 
23:634:50817:28:28:72:267:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:remaining enrolled are zero (no tuition). 
23:635:50859:28:27:108:540:349:144:Times:144:Times:A:Teen i chooses high school graduation if the lifetime payoff from graduation exceeds that

23:637:51046:28:27:71:520:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability for staying in school, 푑∗, is also the high school dropout rate. If psychic costs are then

23:646:51416:10:16:72:537:113:63:Times:102:Times:F:29 Increased family incomes could be another channel through which fracking influences the return to a degree. For 
23:647:51531:16:12:72:526:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:example, children from families whose incomes have risen due to fracking may be gaining more skills from high 
23:648:51641:12:11:72:539:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:school than they would have otherwise. To the extent that responses would be similar for girls and boys, they would 
23:649:51757:11:22:72:414:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:not help to explain the gap in estimated effects by sex, which is our focal point here.

24:652:51848:0:27:72:497:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, the dropout rate is a decreasing function of the return to high school – or earnings 
24:653:51939:27:28:72:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:prospects of dropouts over their working lives – and an increasing function of the opportunity 
24:654:52034:28:28:72:195:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:cost of staying in school. 
24:655:52061:28:27:108:534:625:144:Times:144:Times:A:How does this map to the evidence that we’ve presented thus far? We’ve shown that the 
24:656:52147:27:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:teen male dropout rate has risen and the return to education among adult men has fallen by more 
24:657:52243:28:27:72:518:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:over time in areas with more shale reserves. Evidence of the same phenomena for females is 
24:658:52334:27:28:72:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:much weaker, suggesting that the reduction in the return is the key causal pathway for our 
24:659:52425:28:28:71:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:findings. But an increase in the opportunity cost of school enrollment for boys could also be 
24:660:52519:28:27:71:513:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:contributing to our estimates. This would especially be the case if boys were present-biased 
24:661:52612:27:28:71:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Cadena and Keys, 2015; Lavecchia, Lu, and Oreopoulos, 2016) and fracking increased earnings 
24:662:52705:28:27:71:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:of teenage boys. The standard human capital model of course assumes that that they would be 
24:663:52797:27:28:71:295:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:forward looking, which might not be realistic.

24:665:52936:28:27:71:525:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:channels, Table 7 considers the jobs-to-population ratio (Panel A) and natural log of expected 
24:666:53031:27:28:71:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:monthly earnings (Panel B) for various narrow age groups and separately by sex, calculated from 
24:667:53127:28:27:71:541:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:QWI data and population estimates as earlier described.30 For each outcome, we provide the year 
24:668:53223:27:28:72:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000 mean (column 1), difference-in-differences estimates from model (2) with additional 
24:669:53312:28:28:72:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls (columns 2 to 3), the p-value on equality of the two coefficient estimates between year 
24:670:53409:28:27:72:536:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups (column 4), sexes (for 2011-15, column 5), and age groups (for 2011-15, column 6), and

24:672:53593:28:45:72:520:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:Though fracking led only to a small increase in the likelihood of 14-18-year-old boys having

24:675:53847:16:11:72:533:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:age ranges considered in the table. See Appendix Figure A5 for event-study representations of the effects for these

25:681:54169:28:28:72:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:males, ages 19-24 and 25-34, whose experiences on the job market are arguably particularly 
25:682:54260:28:27:72:412:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:salient for prospective dropouts in forming expectations of the future.  
25:683:54333:27:28:108:492:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:We of course cannot rule out that teenagers are misinformed, over-reacting to a 
25:684:54413:28:27:72:526:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:misplaced notion that well-paying jobs are immediately available to them that are not. But the 
25:685:54508:27:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates are also consistent with changes in the return to education playing a role in the dropout 
25:686:54608:28:28:72:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:decision of boys. Nevertheless, changes in the return to education among adult men may not 
25:687:54699:28:27:72:528:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:represent the changes in the expected return across the lifecycle for the cohorts of interest. The 
25:688:54798:27:28:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:fracking boom could have reduced school quality, for example, lowering the skill (and future 
25:689:54891:28:27:72:375:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity) gains associated obtaining a high school degree.  
25:690:54955:27:28:108:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 8 considers whether school quality has declined as a result of fracking, potentially 
25:691:55046:28:28:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:lowering the return to schooling independently of labor market developments. We would have 
25:692:55137:28:27:72:500:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:liked to measure school quality with some measure of school output, like test scores, but 
25:693:55227:27:28:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:available test score data are not geographically disaggregated enough or do not span enough 
25:694:55319:28:27:72:518:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:years to apply our empirical approach.31 Instead, we consider class size and per-pupil school 
25:695:55413:27:28:72:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending and revenues, using CZ aggregates of annual data from the CCD and the Census of

25:698:55635:10:16:72:532:124:63:Times:102:Times:F:31 The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) spans the period of interest, but reports data only for 
25:699:55749:16:11:72:536:108:102:Times:102:Times:F:states and selected large school districts. With passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, states were required to test 
25:700:55868:11:12:72:496:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:children in grades 3 through 8 in math and reading and publicly report the test results starting in 2002-03. 
25:701:55977:12:11:72:533:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:Unfortunately, the tests and reporting practices differ across states, so comprehensive estimates are unavailable for

26:705:56115:0:27:108:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:The first three rows of the table show that there was no effect of fracking on average 
26:706:56202:27:28:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:class size, overall per-pupil spending, or overall per-pupil revenue.32 Given the standard errors, 
26:707:56301:28:28:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:we can rule out small contributions of changes in school resources to our schooling estimates.33 
26:708:56397:28:27:71:521:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fracking did affect the composition of revenues, though, consistent with expectations. In line 
26:709:56492:27:28:72:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:with fracking increasing property values (Bartik et al. forthcoming), fracking appears to have 
26:710:56587:28:27:72:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased local (property-tax based) revenues per student enrolled in public schools.34 However, 
26:711:56684:27:28:72:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:this positive effect on local revenues has been offset by negative revenue effects at the federal

26:713:56803:28:27:107:508:487:144:Times:144:Times:A:While speculative, these auxiliary findings suggest that labor market developments 
26:714:56886:27:28:71:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with fracking are important to our school enrollment findings, and that teenage boys 
26:715:56982:28:27:71:491:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:have based their decisions on more than just opportunity costs. Incorporating all causal 
26:716:57071:27:57:71:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:pathways, our estimates yield an elasticity of high school enrollment with respect to adult

26:720:57443:11:12:71:541:311:102:Times:102:Times:F:unable to capture the heterogeneous effects uncovered in regional analyses (Marchand and Weber, 2015; Newell and

26:722:57666:11:12:71:527:288:102:Times:102:Times:F:Our class size results obtained at the national level also cannot produce the heterogeneity documented in regional

26:724:57846:9:16:72:539:267:63:Times:102:Times:F:33 For example, the upper bound on the 95% confidence interval for the average class size effect of fracking in a CZ 
26:725:57963:16:12:72:483:251:102:Times:102:Times:F:with any reserves is less than a one student increase. As a point of comparison, Dynarski, Hyman, and 
26:726:58065:12:11:72:512:239:102:Times:102:Times:F:Schanzenbach (2013) find that being randomly assigned to attend a small class in kindergarten (with 13 to 17 
26:727:58174:11:12:72:521:228:102:Times:102:Times:F:students) instead of a regular-sized class (with 22 to 25 students) – so having 5 to 12 fewer students in the same

26:729:58404:11:12:71:513:205:102:Times:102:Times:F:percentage points higher than that for females. The implied effect of an additional student on the male-female 
26:730:58515:12:11:71:513:193:102:Times:102:Times:F:difference in college attendance is thus about 0.2 percentage point (1.6/8.5, where 8.5 is the average class size 
26:731:58629:11:12:71:509:182:102:Times:102:Times:F:increase). If we adopted the same 0.2 percentage point implied effect of an additional student for high school 
26:732:58740:12:9:71:519:170:102:Times:102:Times:F:dropout, we would be able to account for less than 20% of the increase in the male-female gap in dropout rates. 
26:733:58852:9:16:72:530:161:63:Times:102:Times:F:34 Not all studies find positive effects of fracking on property values. Muehlenbachs, Spiller, and Timmins (2015) 
26:734:58967:16:12:71:529:145:102:Times:102:Times:F:find large negative impacts on nearby groundwater-dependent house prices, though at a broader geographic scale, 
26:735:59079:12:11:71:535:133:102:Times:102:Times:F:they find positive impacts that diminish over time. Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber (2013) also find negative impacts on 
26:736:59195:11:9:71:138:122:102:Times:102:Times:F:property values. 
26:737:59212:9:16:72:518:113:63:Times:102:Times:F:35 State governments often redistribute local tax revenue across school districts in an effort to narrow spending 
26:738:59326:16:12:71:526:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:differences between more and less property-wealthy districts. Relatedly, the federal government’s primary grants 
26:739:59439:12:11:71:506:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:program (Title I) is distributed on the basis of child poverty. If fracking has reduced child poverty rates, any 
26:740:59552:11:22:71:478:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:educational impacts for local students may have eventually been offset by reductions in Title I funds.

27:743:59657:0:27:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:earnings of 0.18.36 This elasticity estimate is on the lower end of the range of elasticities that 
27:744:59756:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005) estimate by exploiting earnings variation from the coal 
27:745:59849:28:28:72:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s, which suggest that school enrollment falls by 2.2% to 
27:746:59941:28:27:72:540:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:7.2% for every 10% increase in earnings. The difference in truly comparable elasticities between 
27:747:60038:27:28:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the two studies would, moreover, arguably be larger: the variation in Black, McKinnish, and 
27:748:60130:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sanders (2005) arises from long-lived, but ultimately transitory, price-shocks, biasing downward 
27:749:60227:27:28:72:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:their elasticity estimate as would be comparable to our setting of permanent, technological 
27:750:60319:28:28:72:504:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:change. The effect size for young men in our study is    thus small by historical standards. 
27:751:60412:28:27:72:168:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:V.  Conclusion 
27:752:60427:27:28:108:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:Over the past decade, the widespread diffusion of horizontal drilling and fracking has 
27:753:60514:28:27:72:482:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:fueled a structural transformation of local economies across the United States – from 
27:754:60600:27:28:72:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pennsylvania to North Dakota – increasing local incomes and helping to set the U.S. on a path 
27:755:60694:28:28:72:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:toward energy independence. Using high-frequency outcomes data and taking advantage of 
27:756:60781:28:27:72:498:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:geographic and temporal variation in fracking, we have demonstrated that this structural 
27:757:60870:27:28:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:transformation has had the additional consequence of slowing reductions in high school dropout 
27:758:60965:28:27:72:540:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates among teenagers, particularly the young males whose longer-term labor market prospects it 
27:759:61061:27:28:72:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:has more greatly affected. Though we cannot completely rule out other causal pathways, such as 
27:760:61156:28:28:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:an increased opportunity cost, we marshal additional evidence to support the conclusion that 
27:761:61249:28:27:72:529:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:perceptions of a reduced longer-term return to a high school degree for men were an important 
27:762:61343:27:73:72:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:causal mechanism. For example, fracking did not appreciably increase jobs for teenagers.

27:764:61479:10:16:72:514:101:63:Times:102:Times:F:36 We calculate this elasticity by comparing the 1.43 percentage point decrease in the teen male enrollment-to-
27:765:61590:16:11:71:536:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:population ratio from our baseline specification – which amounts to roughly a 1.9% decline given the baseline ratio 
27:766:61706:11:22:71:416:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:(Table 1 Panel C) – to a 10.4% earnings gain from fracking for adult males (Table 3).

28:769:61794:0:27:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fracking also appears to have changed school resources too little for changes in school quality to 
28:770:61893:27:28:72:258:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:be an important factor in our findings. 
28:771:61933:28:28:108:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:Do these findings provide cause for concern? As we describe, the decision to drop out of 
28:772:62022:28:27:72:513:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:school could well be a rational one in the face of increases in later-life job opportunities for 
28:773:62119:27:28:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:dropouts. Nevertheless, some students could be making mistakes in dropping out. There are also 
28:774:62214:28:27:71:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:social benefits from completing high school that are ignored in private dropout decisions (e.g., 
28:775:62311:27:28:71:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lochner and Moretti, 2004; Dee, 2004; Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopolous, 2004). Fracking may 
28:776:62404:28:28:71:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:thus be generating sub-optimally low levels of education among some individuals who would 
28:777:62494:28:27:71:540:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:already likely be relatively low-skilled, with possible implications for future productivity and the 
28:778:62595:27:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:social safety net. Whether the human capital of a generation of young men has been permanently 
28:779:62690:28:27:71:516:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:affected is an open question, one that cannot be readily answered with our data and research 
28:780:62783:27:28:71:117:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:design.37 
28:781:62792:28:28:108:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second, and more broadly, we present new evidence on the relationship between 
28:782:62870:28:27:72:532:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology and educational attainment. With fracking, we have a technology that complements 
28:783:62962:27:28:72:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:low-skilled labor and one whose use is geographically constrained in a way that allows for 
28:784:63053:28:27:72:532:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:credible identification of its impacts on educational attainment. We find evidence of reductions 
28:785:63150:27:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:in educational attainment at the bottom of the skill distribution, and that longer-term declines in 
28:786:63250:28:28:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the return to education could be an important contributing factor. In addition, converting our 
28:787:63345:28:27:72:543:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:point estimates to an elasticity and comparing our findings directly with earlier work, we find our 
28:788:63445:27:28:72:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated effect sizes to be consistent with a low supply elasticity of educated labor today

28:791:63611:10:16:72:535:90:63:Times:102:Times:F:37 Although those students who drop out may re-enroll later in their lives (Emery, Ferrer, and Green (2012) do find 
28:792:63727:16:22:72:536:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:some evidence for such re-enrollment in British Columbia), we cannot investigate this possibility with Census data.

29:795:63845:0:27:108:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Altogether, our study suggests a smaller response in educational attainment to skill-
29:796:63930:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:biased labor demand shocks today than estimated in earlier decades and supports the view that 
29:797:64024:28:28:72:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:SBTC has contributed to wage inequality. Even so, the effects of technological change on 
29:798:64113:28:27:72:506:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:education may be heterogeneous across the skill distribution. Future understanding of this 
29:799:64204:27:28:72:476:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship would therefore benefit from exploration of other episodes of localized 
29:800:64289:28:27:72:396:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:technological change, particularly ones favoring the highly skilled.

49:1360:97045:9:16:72:542:184:63:g_d0_f39:102:g_d0_f39:F:2 Thus, we assign a county x% of    a shale play’s estimated reserves if it accounts for x% of its land area. Unlike

49:1362:97274:11:11:71:542:157:102:g_d0_f39:102:g_d0_f39:F:reserves rather than the fraction of each CZ with reserves to better capture fracking potential. For example, two CZs 
49:1363:97392:11:11:71:542:146:102:g_d0_f39:102:g_d0_f39:F:with very different reserves would look identical under the latter measure. The latter measure also cannot easily

50:1400:99918:13:14:72:532:310:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:because school years generally last 180 days, starting in September and ending in May, there is 
50:1401:100014:14:13:72:540:296:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:F:some potential that we misclassify ACS respondents interviewed in the late summer as dropouts, 
50:1402:100109:13:13:72:535:283:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:since we do not observe the interview date in the public-use data. Because our analysis includes 
50:1403:100206:13:13:72:524:270:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:state-by-year fixed effects, it will account for any resulting bias provided that it does not vary 
50:1404:100305:13:14:72:534:257:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:within states over time. Second, with a new school year starting in September, a higher share of

50:1407:100595:13:13:72:530:217:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:dropout decisions based on grade rather than age, and if that tendency happens to be correlated

52:1468:104794:0:13:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:The QWI data do have some limitations which are important to consider in the context of our 
52:1469:104886:13:13:72:512:695:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:analysis. First, because much of the data is collected via a unique federal-state data sharing 
52:1470:104981:13:13:72:539:682:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:F:collaboration, the years of data availability differ by state. While 14 states in our study have data 
52:1471:105083:13:14:72:529:669:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:available for our entire analysis timeframe (2000-2015), three states (Arkansas, Kentucky, and 
52:1472:105178:14:13:72:524:655:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:Wyoming) are missing some years of data, particularly at the beginning of the study window. 
52:1473:105270:13:13:72:532:642:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:We exclude these states in our analysis, but estimates that include data from all 17 states where

52:1489:105782:13:13:72:528:403:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:Imputations in the published QWI data warrant consideration as well, especially for education-
52:1490:105876:13:13:72:499:390:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:specific data. QWI documentation states that the vast majority of jobs can be matched to 
52:1491:105965:13:14:72:537:377:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:personal characteristics for sex and age variables (97 percent) and geographic variables (over 90 
52:1492:106063:14:13:72:528:363:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:percent), so imputations are less of a concern for these variables. On the other hand, education 
52:1493:106160:13:14:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:F:characteristics primarily rely on an imputation model with a statistical match between the Census 
52:1494:106258:14:13:72:494:336:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:and LEHD data using a state-specific logit model that contains age categories, earnings 
52:1495:106346:13:13:72:536:323:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:categories, and industry dummies for individuals age 14 and older who reported strictly positive 
52:1496:106443:13:13:72:519:310:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:wage earnings. Although this method of imputation likely yields estimates that are generally

52:1501:106785:13:14:72:542:244:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:F:First, the online extraction tool for the publicly available QWI data allows for only three separate 
52:1502:106886:14:13:72:527:230:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:ways to tabulate data: by sex and age, by sex and education, and by race and ethnicity. We are 
52:1503:106981:13:13:72:520:217:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:therefore restricted to analyses based on two-way tabulations. Additionally, data suppression 
52:1504:107075:13:14:72:365:204:144:g_d0_f39:144:g_d0_f39:C:prevents us from undertaking any industry-specific analysis.
