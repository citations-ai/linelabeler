3:50:2298:0:28:90:176:723:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
3:51:2313:28:27:117:492:695:144:Times:144:Times: Economic historians have long recognised that governments are central to the 
3:52:2390:27:28:90:525:668:144:Times:144:Times:development of organised finance and the smooth operation of trading arrangements (e.g., 
3:53:2479:28:28:90:518:640:144:Times:144:Times:North and Weingast, 1989). Indeed, the experiences of the 17th-century Dutch Republic, 
3:54:2566:28:27:90:505:612:144:Times:144:Times:18th-century England, and the 19th-century United States offer powerful narratives to 
3:55:2652:27:28:90:504:585:144:Times:144:Times:support this view.2 Yet the role of governments in fostering growth through improved 
3:56:2737:28:27:90:528:557:144:Times:144:Times:institutions has received less attention in modern macroeconomic and development studies 
3:57:2826:27:28:90:533:530:144:Times:144:Times:that use more recent data. This is not to say, however, that economists have ignored the role 
3:58:2920:28:28:90:522:502:144:Times:144:Times:of institutions in promoting growth over the post-World War II period. On the contrary, a 
3:59:3010:28:27:90:500:474:144:Times:144:Times:battery of empirical studies published over the past two decades point to a first-order 
3:60:3098:27:28:90:515:447:144:Times:144:Times:importance of financial development in promoting long-run economic growth, and have 
3:61:3182:28:27:90:539:419:144:Times:144:Times:elevated the proposition to something of a stylised fact (see Levine 1997; 2005). At the same 
3:62:3276:27:28:90:531:392:144:Times:144:Times:time, a largely independent literature indicates a positive role for trade openness and export 
3:63:3371:28:27:90:522:364:144:Times:144:Times:orientation in long-run growth, especially when tested over the latter half of the twentieth 
3:64:3464:27:28:90:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:century with data for a broad set of countries (e.g., Dollar, 1992; Ben-David, 1993; Sachs and 
3:65:3559:28:28:90:247:309:144:Times:144:Times:Warner, 1995; Edwards, 1998).  
3:66:3590:28:27:117:525:281:144:Times:144:Times: Much of the research on financial development in recent years, however, has shifted 
3:67:3674:27:28:90:504:254:144:Times:144:Times:from measuring the growth effects of finance to learning more about what determines 
3:68:3758:28:42:90:517:226:144:Times:144:Times:financial development itself.  It is in this area that the link between finance and trade has

3:70:3912:9:21:90:521:175:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:2 See, for example, de Vries (1976) and de Vries and van der Woude (1997) on the Dutch 
3:71:3999:21:16:90:533:154:144:Times:144:Times:Republic, Dickson (1967) and Brewer (1989) on England, Neal (1990) on integration of the 
3:72:4088:16:16:90:500:138:144:Times:144:Times:London and Amsterdam markets, and Sylla (1999) on the United States. More recent 
3:73:4169:16:16:90:524:122:144:Times:144:Times:comparative studies of these countries and others include Rousseau (2003), Rousseau and 
3:74:4257:16:15:90:297:106:144:Times:144:Times:Sylla (2003) and Andrianova et al. (2008).

4:76:4304:0:28:90:529:723:144:Times:144:Times:received some attention.3 Here we extend this line of inquiry by bringing governments into 
4:77:4395:28:27:90:528:695:144:Times:144:Times:the nexus of finance and trade, starting with 18th century England and then broadening the 
4:78:4486:27:28:90:382:668:144:Times:144:Times:analysis to 84 countries using data from 1960 to the present. 
4:79:4548:28:28:117:488:640:144:Times:144:Times: Our starting point is historical.  In the early stages of economic and financial 
4:80:4629:28:27:90:512:612:144:Times:144:Times:development, countries may find themselves caught in an under-development trap. The 
4:81:4713:27:28:90:511:585:144:Times:144:Times:absence of financial markets, both domestic and international, combined with an under-
4:82:4799:28:27:90:533:557:144:Times:144:Times:developed tax base and inefficiencies in tax administration can lead to governments that are 
4:83:4892:27:28:90:511:530:144:Times:144:Times:cash constrained.  Without sufficient funds, governments are unable to undertake much 
4:84:4978:28:28:90:529:502:144:Times:144:Times:needed public investments in hard and soft infrastructure, education and health. Inadequate 
4:85:5070:28:27:90:494:474:144:Times:144:Times:transportation networks, rudimentary law and order systems, and ill and/or illiterate 
4:86:5156:27:28:90:480:447:144:Times:144:Times:populations can create insurmountable obstacles for industrial take-off. 4  In such 
4:87:5240:28:27:90:531:419:144:Times:144:Times:circumstances, opportunities for profitable private investment are rare. Where present, they 
4:88:5333:27:28:90:519:392:144:Times:144:Times:can be very risky. And without insurance markets, the risks are likely to be unacceptably 
4:89:5423:28:27:90:534:364:144:Times:144:Times:high for entrepreneurs.  As a result the demand for private finance may be negligible or non-
4:90:5516:27:28:90:542:337:144:Times:144:Times:existent.  In such a bad equilibrium, financial and economic under-development are two sides 
4:91:5609:28:28:89:180:309:144:Times:144:Times:of the same coin.   
4:92:5629:28:27:117:530:281:144:Times:144:Times: Trade offers a way to break out of the under-development trap.  However, history has 
4:93:5714:27:28:90:530:254:144:Times:144:Times:shown that this requires a high degree of co-ordination between private and public sectors.  
4:94:5807:28:38:89:534:226:144:Times:144:Times:Trade can be highly profitable if it is secure yet the profits can easily be competed away. As 
4:95:5902:38:9:72:218:188:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
4:96:5962:9:26:90:447:179:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:3 See, for example, Svaleryd and Vlachos (2002) and Baltagi et al. (2009). 
4:97:6037:26:21:90:540:153:42:g_d0_f1:144:Times:4 The critical role of infrastructure in promoting industrial take-off is documented by Easterly 
4:98:6134:21:16:90:538:132:144:Times:144:Times:and Rebelo (1993).  There is also a large literature on the positive effects of infrastructure on 
4:99:6232:16:16:90:531:116:144:Times:144:Times:private investment, trade and economic growth. See for example, Bougheas et al. (1999) or 
4:100:6322:16:0:89:204:100:144:Times:100:g_d0_f2:Bougheas et al. (2000). 
5:101:6349:0:28:90:520:723:144:Times:144:Times:Andrianova et al. (2008) and others have argued, the emergence of London as a financial 
5:102:6437:28:27:90:517:695:144:Times:144:Times:market in the latter part of the 17th century owes a lot to the monopoly rights granted by 
5:103:6528:27:28:90:534:668:144:Times:144:Times:government to all the leading joint stock companies. These rights guaranteed high returns to 
5:104:6621:28:28:90:516:640:144:Times:144:Times:investors and helped to mobilise saving (the share issues of the East India Company, for 
5:105:6710:28:27:90:523:612:144:Times:144:Times:example, were typically over-subscribed).  The rise of the great trading companies in turn 
5:106:6801:27:28:90:540:585:144:Times:144:Times:promoted development of a modern commercial sector. The monopoly rights were granted at 
5:107:6889:28:27:90:532:557:144:Times:144:Times:a price: the joint stock companies made very significant long-term loans to the government. 
5:108:6981:27:28:90:539:530:144:Times:144:Times:These loans were so large that they transformed the state of the public finances. As Rousseau 
5:109:7075:28:28:90:525:502:144:Times:144:Times:(2003) shows, the rise in real incomes that followed the expansion of trade set in motion a 
5:110:7167:28:27:90:538:474:144:Times:144:Times:virtuous finance-trade-growth cycle which helped to propel England from a weak state in the 
5:111:7259:27:28:90:525:447:144:Times:144:Times:early part of the 17th century to Europe’s foremost military power by the beginning of the 
5:112:7350:28:27:90:396:419:144:Times:144:Times:18th century and the world’s clear financial leader by its end.5   
5:113:7417:27:28:117:496:392:144:Times:144:Times:   Given the central role of governments in promoting financial and commercial 
5:114:7495:28:27:90:495:364:144:Times:144:Times:development in history, might we expect to see similar patterns today in developing 
5:115:7579:27:28:90:505:337:144:Times:144:Times:countries?  We think that the answer is yes, although the picture can be more complex 
5:116:7665:28:28:90:541:309:144:Times:144:Times:because developing countries today have greater (yet still varying degrees of) access to world 
5:117:7760:28:27:90:506:281:144:Times:144:Times:capital markets and foreign aid. For the poorest developing countries, foreign aid is an 
5:118:7849:27:28:90:532:254:144:Times:144:Times:important mechanism for financing trade-promoting infrastructure and public investment in 
5:119:7939:28:27:90:511:226:144:Times:144:Times:health and education.  As a result, the link between government spending and domestic 
5:120:8025:27:21:90:516:199:144:Times:144:Times:financial development may be weaker than it is likely to have been, for example, in 18th 
5:121:8114:21:9:72:218:178:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
5:122:8174:9:21:90:495:169:42:g_d0_f1:144:Times:5 Similar events were realised a century earlier in Amsterdam. The Dutch East India 
5:123:8258:21:16:90:541:148:144:Times:144:Times:Company, which had very close links to the Dutch state, was formed in 1602 by royal charter 
5:124:8350:16:16:89:521:132:144:Times:144:Times:following demands by its predecessors who saw their profits eroded by competition.  The 
5:125:8438:16:16:89:518:116:144:Times:144:Times:emergence of the stock market in Amsterdam is firmly linked to the establishment of the 
5:126:8526:16:0:89:223:100:144:Times:100:g_d0_f2:Company (see Neal, 1990). 
6:127:8555:0:28:90:523:723:144:Times:144:Times:century England, where governments tapped much if not all of their finance domestically. 
6:128:8644:28:27:90:518:695:144:Times:144:Times:For the same reason, we would expect a stronger link between government and domestic 
6:129:8729:27:28:90:337:668:144:Times:144:Times:financial development in middle income countries. 
6:130:8779:28:28:117:524:640:144:Times:144:Times: First, however, it is appropriate to consider 18th century England, often touted as the 
6:131:8867:28:27:90:445:612:144:Times:144:Times:classic case of the centrality of the State in modern economic emergence.

6:135:8980:13:14:108:111:530:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:136:8980:14:28:126:539:516:144:Times:144:Times: Modern studies of the role of the state in 18th century British growth tend to focus on 
6:137:9068:28:27:90:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:the extent to which wartime expenditures led to a crowding out of private sector investments, 
6:138:9162:27:28:90:516:461:144:Times:144:Times:thereby slowing overall economic growth (e.g., Williamson, 1984; Crafts, 1987; Mokyr, 
6:139:9248:28:28:90:498:433:144:Times:144:Times:1987).  But if disbursements by the exchequer are a weak proxy for the output of the

6:141:9423:27:28:90:479:378:144:Times:144:Times:may have been larger, in which case crowding out would have been less severe.  
6:142:9502:28:27:125:535:350:144:Times:144:Times: Fig. 1 shows total government expenditure from 1720 along with total trade (i.e., the 
6:143:9588:27:28:89:516:323:144:Times:144:Times:sum of imports, exports, and re-exports), all in per capita 1740 sterling. 6  The four large

6:145:9770:27:55:90:526:268:144:Times:144:Times:48), the Seven Years War (1754-63), the American Revolutionary War (1775-83), and the

6:147:9916:9:19:90:530:204:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:6 Government expenditures are the sum of civil and military spending from Mitchell (1988, 
6:148:10006:19:14:89:537:185:144:Times:144:Times:Table 11.2, pp. 578-80). The trade data are from Mitchell (1988, Table 10.1.A, pp. 448-9 for 
6:149:10099:14:14:89:519:171:144:Times:144:Times:England and Wales for 1720-91, and Table 10.1.B, p. 450 for Great Britain 1792-99). To 
6:150:10186:14:14:90:536:157:144:Times:144:Times:form a single series for trade openness we join the broader aggregate for Great Britain to the 
6:151:10281:14:14:90:541:143:144:Times:144:Times:narrower series for England and Wales. We deflate all of our data to reflect 1740 prices using 
6:152:10376:14:13:90:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:the Schumpeter-Gilboy price index for consumer goods (Mitchell, 1988, Table 14.1.B, pp. 
6:153:10464:13:14:90:538:116:144:Times:144:Times:719-20) and convert them into per capita terms using population data for England (excluding 
6:154:10556:14:13:90:385:102:144:Times:144:Times:Monmouthshire) from Mitchell (1988, Table 1.1.A, pp. 7-8).

7:178:10960:28:28:90:538:284:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures such as these could not have been conducive to an industrial take-off.  Yet total

7:180:11150:27:28:90:493:229:144:Times:144:Times:the exception of the American Revolutionary period, does not fluctuate sharply and 
7:181:11233:28:40:90:529:201:144:Times:144:Times:negatively with government expenditure.  Rather, the two series have a positive correlation

7:183:11385:10:21:90:537:151:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:7 Our sample period was immediately preceded by the War of Spanish Succession (1700-14) 
7:184:11473:21:15:90:498:130:144:Times:144:Times:and then by the Nine Years War (1688-97), the latter commencing with the Glorious 
7:185:11555:15:15:90:189:115:144:Times:144:Times:Revolution of 1688.

8:187:11579:0:28:90:515:723:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient of 0.49, with international trade rising by 88 percent between 1720 and 1799 
8:188:11668:28:27:89:224:695:144:Times:144:Times:despite the American War.  
8:189:11695:27:28:125:521:668:144:Times:144:Times: At the same time that trade was rising dramatically, England was in the midst of a 
8:190:11778:28:28:89:500:640:144:Times:144:Times:commercial and industrial revolution.  And when the time series for trade in Fig. 1 is 
8:191:11865:28:27:89:527:612:144:Times:144:Times:considered in light of earlier data for the East India Company that indicate a more than six-
8:192:11958:27:28:89:524:585:144:Times:144:Times:fold increase in Asian exports between 1660 and 1710, the rapid commercialisation of the 
8:193:12047:28:27:89:515:557:144:Times:144:Times:British economy comes into clear focus. It is interesting to note that Hoffman’s index of 
8:194:12137:27:28:89:508:530:144:Times:144:Times:industrial production (Mitchell, 1988, Table 8.21.A, pp. 431-432, including building),  
8:195:12225:28:28:89:541:502:144:Times:144:Times:progresses less rapidly than the trade series at first, but accelerates after 1780, and thus seems 
8:196:12324:28:27:89:356:474:144:Times:144:Times:to share the rhythm of the later part of the trade boom.  
8:197:12382:27:28:125:541:447:144:Times:144:Times: The positive relation between government expenditure and trade requires explanation. 
8:198:12467:28:27:89:508:419:144:Times:144:Times:Was the crowding out suggested by earlier studies a short-run phenomenon while state 
8:199:12552:27:28:89:496:392:144:Times:144:Times:interventions promoted growth in a long-term sense through a less direct “big push” 
8:200:12636:28:27:89:513:364:144:Times:144:Times:mechanism?  We argue here that such a push started with public sector investments that 
8:201:12723:27:28:89:515:337:144:Times:144:Times:raised income, production, trade, and bank deposits, with the latter providing significant 
8:202:12814:28:28:89:529:309:144:Times:144:Times:feedback effects to the commercial sector as the Bank of England shifted its asset portfolio 
8:203:12907:28:27:90:516:281:144:Times:144:Times:towards private loans. This allowed government expenditure, finance, and commerce, as 
8:204:12993:27:28:90:486:254:144:Times:144:Times:measured by the extent of trading activity, to interact in a complementary manner. 
8:205:13076:28:27:126:531:226:144:Times:144:Times: The main public expenditure early on, of course, involved gearing up for war, and a 
8:206:13160:27:28:90:537:199:144:Times:144:Times:positive interaction between the government and banking began as Parliament strove to raise 
8:207:13252:28:28:90:540:171:144:Times:144:Times:finance for the Nine-Years War against France in 1688. A key problem for the government at 
8:208:13343:28:27:90:543:143:144:Times:144:Times:the time was the illiquidity of its own bonds, so it formed the Bank of England in 1694 to buy 
8:209:13438:27:0:90:515:116:144:Times:144:Times:and hold this debt while the underlying capitalization of the Bank itself could trade with 
9:210:13532:0:28:90:529:723:144:Times:144:Times:greater liquidity on the newly-formed London stock market.8  Over the next fifty years, the 
9:211:13624:28:27:90:541:695:144:Times:144:Times:Bank would become, to quote R. D. Richards (1934, p. 272), “a credit institution, an organ of 
9:212:13718:27:28:90:521:668:144:Times:144:Times:State Finance, a discount and issuing house, a bullion warehouse, and a safe repository.”  
9:213:13809:28:28:117:505:640:144:Times:144:Times: Shortly after its founding, the Bank re-coined the nation’s metallic currency and 
9:214:13891:28:27:89:514:612:144:Times:144:Times:engaged in various note-issuing experiments, both of which promoted monetization and 
9:215:13976:27:28:89:517:585:144:Times:144:Times:brought some degree of order to the fledgling financial system. The dashed line in Fig. 2 
9:216:14066:28:27:89:509:557:144:Times:144:Times:shows how the real per capita liabilities of the Bank (i.e., the sum of its circulation and 
9:217:14158:27:28:89:502:530:144:Times:144:Times:deposits) increased rapidly through the early 1730s before declining slightly and then 
9:218:14245:28:28:89:501:502:144:Times:144:Times:levelling off for the remainder of the century. 9 The ability of the Bank to bring about 
9:219:14334:28:27:89:538:474:144:Times:144:Times:intensive growth in ordinary deposits early on proved essential to supporting the government 
9:220:14427:27:28:89:511:447:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures that would become necessary in the 1740s and 1750s.  Even the extensive 
9:221:14512:28:27:89:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:growth in deposits after 1750, though not impressive, was considerable given the 50 percent 
9:222:14604:27:47:89:380:392:144:Times:144:Times:increase in England’s population between 1750 and 1799. 10

9:224:14722:9:21:90:533:336:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:8 The stock exchange facilitated transactions in public debt securities and shares of the large 
9:225:14818:21:16:90:514:315:144:Times:144:Times:trading companies, including the British East and West India Companies, the South Sea 
9:226:14904:16:15:89:307:299:144:Times:144:Times:Company, and the Royal African Company.

9:228:14946:11:19:90:536:273:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:9 We obtain the Bank’s deposit and circulation liabilities from Mitchell (1988, Table 12.2.A, 
9:229:15040:19:14:90:542:254:144:Times:144:Times:pp. 655-58). It is probably fair to say that coin and Bank of England notes accounted for most 
9:230:15135:14:14:90:510:240:144:Times:144:Times:of the circulating medium it in London and elsewhere before 1750 given that London’s 
9:231:15220:14:14:90:533:226:144:Times:144:Times:private bankers had stopped issuing notes, which were always a small part of their business, 
9:232:15313:14:14:90:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:long before 1775 due to competition from the Bank of England (Cameron, 1967, p. 22). But 
9:233:15402:14:13:90:529:198:144:Times:144:Times:an increase in the number of country banks after 1775 and a lack of reliable information on 
9:234:15494:13:14:90:523:185:144:Times:144:Times:net specie imports make us unable to build a continuous series for an M2-like aggregate.

9:236:15586:9:19:90:500:162:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:10 Since the Bank’s deposit and circulation liabilities were presumably zero before its 
9:237:15674:19:14:90:516:143:144:Times:144:Times:founding in 1694, their growth prior to the start of our data in 1720 must have been very 
9:238:15764:14:13:90:506:129:144:Times:144:Times:rapid. This apparent rise in liabilities, for which we see only the tail end in Fig. 2, also 
9:239:15857:13:14:90:498:116:144:Times:144:Times:coincided with another spike in government expenditures during the War of Spanish

10:256:16151:28:27:117:537:327:144:Times:144:Times:But while the Bank’s relationship with the State has received the most attention among 
10:257:16238:27:28:89:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:scholars, the Bank also offered considerable support to London’s merchant and trading 
10:258:16324:28:27:89:528:272:144:Times:144:Times:communities through its clearing and discounting facilities (see Clapham, 1941). The solid 
10:259:16415:27:28:89:526:245:144:Times:144:Times:line in Fig. 2 shows the extent of the Bank of England’s private loan business, which grew 
10:260:16506:28:28:89:519:217:144:Times:144:Times:rapidly from the 1750s, even approaching the size of its deposit and circulation liabilities 
10:261:16599:28:52:89:530:189:144:Times:144:Times:during the 1760s and again by 1800.11  Much of this activity was accomplished through the

10:263:16749:10:21:90:519:127:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:11 We build this series as the income from discounting bills and notes and making private 
10:264:16839:21:16:90:510:106:144:Times:144:Times:loans (Clapham, 1945, Vol. 1, Appendix E, pp. 301-2 and Vol. II, Appendix C, p. 433) 
10:265:16924:16:0:90:539:90:144:Times:144:Times:divided by the Bank rate over the previous year (Clapham, 1945, Vol. I, Appendix D, p. 299, 
11:266:17019:0:28:90:530:723:144:Times:144:Times:Bank’s “drawing accounts,” though not all those with accounts were entitled to advances.12 
11:267:17109:28:27:89:527:695:144:Times:144:Times:Evidence from the Bank archives show that loans and discounts were spread across a wide 
11:268:17197:27:28:89:530:668:144:Times:144:Times:range of commercial activities, and that discounts below the statutory limit of £50 were not 
11:269:17290:28:28:89:542:640:144:Times:144:Times:unusual.  And as liabilities struggled to keep up with population by the late 1730s, the Bank’s 
11:270:17386:28:27:89:533:612:144:Times:144:Times:capital and deposits were increasingly deployed toward the provision of private loans, some 
11:271:17478:27:28:89:533:585:144:Times:144:Times:of which were used to facilitate trade. With the large trading companies making loans to the 
11:272:17571:28:27:89:523:557:144:Times:144:Times:government through the Bank of England, and these (often military) expenditures making 
11:273:17658:27:28:89:484:530:144:Times:144:Times:their way back into the deposit liabilities of the Bank, we believe that the rise and 
11:274:17744:28:28:89:502:502:144:Times:144:Times:accompanying fluctuations in the amount and availability of private loans could have 
11:275:17829:28:27:89:511:474:144:Times:144:Times:strongly influenced commerce just as the industrial economy hit its stride after 1760.     
11:276:17920:27:28:125:503:447:144:Times:144:Times:The Bank’s private loans may also be representative of commercial lending in 
11:277:17997:28:27:89:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:England more generally because, before 1750, the Bank of England co-existed in the 
11:278:18080:27:28:89:514:392:144:Times:144:Times:provision of banking services only with a group of private bankers in London who dealt 
11:279:18167:28:27:89:513:364:144:Times:144:Times:primarily in deposits and bills of exchange. This gave rise to an active money market to 
11:280:18256:27:28:89:539:337:144:Times:144:Times:finance trade and working capital for the emerging manufacturing sector, and the Bank had a 
11:281:18348:28:28:89:542:309:144:Times:144:Times:central role in its operation.  Moreover, England was slow to develop private banks compared 
11:282:18441:28:34:89:485:281:144:Times:144:Times:to the pace at which they would grow in the United States only 50 years later.13

11:285:18804:16:15:89:500:217:144:Times:144:Times:primarily short term, which is consistent with Clapham’s reading of the loan records.

11:287:18891:11:21:90:537:191:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:12 The Bank also made over ninety loans to the East India Company between 1709 and 1744, 
11:288:18980:21:16:90:534:170:144:Times:144:Times:but these loans, though exceeding other bill and note discounts in the Bank’s early days, did 
11:289:19074:16:15:90:448:154:144:Times:144:Times:not become an important component of the asset portfolio until the 1750s.

11:291:19149:12:21:90:518:127:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:13 Relatively little is known about the extent of country banking in 18th century England. 
11:292:19240:21:16:90:540:106:144:Times:144:Times:These banks were generally small, but grew in number. Cameron (1967, pp. 23-24) estimates 
11:293:19330:16:0:90:529:90:144:Times:144:Times:that “about a dozen” existed in 1750, about 100 in the early 1780s, and about 300 by 1800.

12:295:19449:14:14:90:93:709:144:Times:144:Times: 
12:296:19449:14:27:117:525:695:144:Times:144:Times: Is the available evidence for 18th century England consistent with virtuous cycles of 
12:297:19535:27:28:90:514:668:144:Times:144:Times:government expenditure, trade and financial development?  Though our historical focus 
12:298:19621:28:28:90:526:640:144:Times:144:Times:limits the richness of the data items that can be brought to bear on our hypothesis, the data 
12:299:19715:28:27:89:495:612:144:Times:144:Times:depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are sufficient for conducting at least a basic time series 
12:300:19804:27:28:89:534:585:144:Times:144:Times:investigation. We limit the time coverage to 1728 to 1799 because this represents the period 
12:301:19897:28:27:89:540:557:144:Times:144:Times:for which reliable data on private loans of the Bank of England are continuously available on 
12:302:19991:27:28:89:512:530:144:Times:144:Times:an annual basis.  We have argued above that this variable might capture the intensity of 
12:303:20080:28:28:89:237:502:144:Times:144:Times:financial intermediation well.  
12:304:20112:28:27:117:496:474:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 provides time-series evidence of the relationship between government 
12:305:20189:27:28:89:536:447:144:Times:144:Times:expenditure, trade openness and financial development, with all three variables measured on 
12:306:20281:28:27:89:529:419:144:Times:144:Times:a real, per capita basis. The upper panel reports results from a vector autoregressive (VAR) 
12:307:20374:27:28:89:516:392:144:Times:144:Times:model estimated in log levels.14   Both trade and government expenditure Granger-cause 
12:308:20461:28:27:90:541:364:144:Times:144:Times:private loans at the five percent level or less with the regression coefficients for each variable 
12:309:20560:27:28:90:504:337:144:Times:144:Times:summing to a positive value. This suggests that both of these variables drive financial 
12:310:20648:28:62:90:452:309:144:Times:144:Times:development, which is consistent with our view of the mechanism at work.

12:313:20914:11:21:90:524:222:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:14 Before estimating the VAR, we tested each series for non-stationarity using Augmented 
12:314:21003:21:16:89:542:201:144:Times:144:Times:Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for any 
12:315:21098:16:16:90:530:185:144:Times:144:Times:of these series using three to five additional lag differences in the test regressions. All three 
12:316:21196:16:15:90:528:169:144:Times:144:Times:series rejected the null in first differences. Since our Johansen (1991) tests indicate that the 
12:317:21293:15:16:90:521:154:144:Times:144:Times:series share a single cointegrating relationship, a VAR model in levels is appropriate (see 
12:318:21385:16:16:90:539:138:144:Times:144:Times:Sims et al., 1990). We determine the lag order of the VAR using a series of nested likelihood 
12:319:21479:16:16:90:527:122:144:Times:144:Times:ratio tests.  The Granger-causality inferences are qualitatively the same when we apply the 
12:320:21571:16:15:90:402:106:144:Times:144:Times:modified Wald tests developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995).

14:451:23746:28:27:81:517:673:144:Times:144:Times:single long-term relationship among the three variables, with both the trace and maximum 
14:452:23835:27:28:81:548:646:144:Times:144:Times:eigenvalue statistics rejecting the null of no cointegration and failing to reject the null of a single 
14:453:23939:28:28:81:183:618:144:Times:144:Times:cointegrating vector. 
14:454:23961:28:27:109:501:590:144:Times:144:Times:The lower panel of Table 1 reports estimates from the corresponding vector error 
14:455:24042:27:28:81:537:563:144:Times:144:Times:correction model (see Banerjee et al., 1993).15 These VECM results confirm the exogeneity of 
14:456:24135:28:27:81:546:535:144:Times:144:Times:trade suggested by the levels VAR.  They also confirm that financial development is not weakly 
14:457:24230:27:28:81:542:508:144:Times:144:Times:exogenous to the system with an estimated coefficient of -0.1134.  The negative and significant 
14:458:24326:28:28:81:544:480:144:Times:144:Times:sum of the regression coefficients on first differences of both government expenditure and trade 
14:459:24423:28:27:81:547:452:144:Times:144:Times:in the private loans equation suggest that both crowded out Bank of England private loans in the 
14:460:24520:27:28:81:540:425:144:Times:144:Times:short-run. More interestingly, however, the negative sign on the error correction term (ECT) in 
14:461:24616:28:27:81:542:397:144:Times:144:Times:the private loans equation, when viewed with the negative loadings on government expenditure 
14:462:24709:27:28:81:503:370:144:Times:144:Times:and trade in the normalised cointegrating vector, are consistent with a positive long-run 
14:463:24799:28:28:81:532:342:144:Times:144:Times:relationship from both government expenditure and trade openness to financial development, 
14:464:24890:28:27:81:504:314:144:Times:144:Times:just as the levels VAR in the upper panel indicated.  Turning to the VECM equation for 
14:465:24977:27:28:81:539:287:144:Times:144:Times:government expenditure, we find that the latter is not weakly exogenous, once again providing 
14:466:25071:28:27:81:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:confirmation of the block tests obtained in the levels VAR, and suggesting that financial 
14:467:25161:27:28:81:533:232:144:Times:144:Times:development even had positive long-run effects on the resources available to the government.

16:504:27018:14:28:109:548:339:144:Times:144:Times:In light of our historical findings for England, we now ask whether our hypothesis, namely

17:516:28076:0:28:109:543:717:144:Times:144:Times:As before, we measure trade openness as the ratio of imports plus exports. Government is 
17:517:28165:28:28:81:540:689:144:Times:144:Times:measured as final expenditures, excluding the military.17  For comparability with other studies, 
17:518:28262:28:27:81:537:661:144:Times:144:Times:we use three familiar measures of financial development, namely liquid liabilities (M3), liquid 
17:519:28358:27:28:81:511:634:144:Times:144:Times:liabilities less narrow money (M3 less M1), and credit allocated to the private sector.  To 
17:520:28450:28:27:81:517:606:144:Times:144:Times:facilitate cross-country analysis, we express all variables as percentages of gross domestic 
17:521:28543:27:28:81:535:579:144:Times:144:Times:product (GDP).  Liquid liabilities as a percentage of GDP have become a standard measure of 
17:522:28635:28:28:81:527:551:144:Times:144:Times:financial depth and an indicator of the overall size of financial intermediary activity in cross-
17:523:28732:28:27:81:539:523:144:Times:144:Times:country studies. M3 less M1 removes the pure transactions asset to focus more on the intensity 
17:524:28827:27:28:81:548:496:144:Times:144:Times:of intermediation, and the credit measure isolates intermediation to the private sector from credit 
17:525:28927:28:27:81:546:468:144:Times:144:Times:allocated to government or state enterprises. We average the data over five-year periods to build 
17:526:29025:27:28:81:540:441:144:Times:144:Times:a maximum of nine time series observations for each country starting with 1960-64 and ending

17:539:30029:21:21:81:547:175:49:g_d0_f1:144:Times:17  It is reasonable to exclude military expenditures from our measure of government for the post-
17:540:30127:21:16:81:534:154:144:Times:144:Times:1960 period given that wars have not been a mechanism through which financial sectors have 
17:541:30218:16:16:81:528:138:144:Times:144:Times:emerged and their inclusion would distort identification of the agglomeration effects that we 
17:542:30312:16:16:81:543:122:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesise. In this respect the role of wars in financial development today differs considerably 
17:543:30410:16:15:81:379:106:144:Times:144:Times:from that in the earlier days of British economic emergence.

18:546:30570:28:28:81:497:689:144:Times:144:Times:trade openness, and Xit is a set of baseline explanatory variables that have been shown 
18:547:30658:28:27:81:534:661:144:Times:144:Times:empirically to be robust determinants of growth. We then estimate a second set of regressions

18:552:30965:14:27:109:536:549:144:Times:144:Times:The conditioning set (i.e., the Xit) for the financial development regressions includes per 
18:553:31057:27:28:81:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:capita income and CPI inflation, in accordance with the empirical literature on the determinants 
18:554:31154:28:28:81:528:494:144:Times:144:Times:of financial development (e.g., Rousseau and Wachtel, 2002; Baltagi et al., 2009). The trade 
18:555:31247:28:27:81:536:466:144:Times:144:Times:openness regressions additionally condition on the initial value of aggregate GDP in each five-
18:556:31342:27:28:81:516:439:144:Times:144:Times:year period to capture the effects of country size on trade.  We anticipate that country size 
18:557:31436:28:27:81:540:411:144:Times:144:Times:matters in a negative way when it comes to trade openness in that, all other things equal, larger 
18:558:31534:27:28:81:538:384:144:Times:144:Times:countries need to trade less than smaller countries, as consumers and firms are able to source a 
18:559:31631:28:28:81:542:356:144:Times:144:Times:greater range of products domestically at lower cost.  Estimation is by instrumental variables to 
18:560:31729:28:27:81:490:328:144:Times:144:Times:ameliorate potential problems of simultaneity. Specifically, we attempt to extract the 
18:561:31816:27:28:81:534:301:144:Times:144:Times:predetermined component of the financial variable by using its initial value (in each five-year 
18:562:31912:28:27:81:548:273:144:Times:144:Times:period) along with the initial values of government expenditure and trade as percentages of GDP 
18:563:32008:27:28:81:291:246:144:Times:144:Times:as instruments in each regression equation. 
18:564:32052:28:28:109:534:218:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 presents estimates of the regressions specified in (1) and (2) using the full set of 
18:565:32145:28:27:81:549:190:144:Times:144:Times:five-year observations in our 84-country sample. All estimates include time period fixed effects.  
18:566:32244:27:28:81:502:163:144:Times:144:Times:The coefficient on trade openness is highly statistically significant in all three financial 
18:567:32337:28:27:81:518:135:144:Times:144:Times:development regressions (see left side of table) and so is the coefficient on initial GDP per 
18:568:32431:27:0:81:440:108:144:Times:144:Times:capita, but neither government expenditure or CPI inflation is significant.  
20:569:34392:0:28:117:542:723:144:Times:144:Times:Tables 3 and 4 examine the extent to which the results reported in Table 2 vary with per 
20:570:34481:28:27:89:536:695:144:Times:144:Times:capita income by running quartile regressions.  The estimates reported in both tables suggest 
20:571:34575:27:28:89:531:668:144:Times:144:Times:that both relationships vary considerably according to country income levels, hence relying 
20:572:34667:28:28:89:350:640:144:Times:144:Times:on the aggregate results in Table 2 can be misleading. 
20:573:34722:28:27:117:520:612:144:Times:144:Times:The results in Table 3 reveal that government expenditure has a positive and highly 
20:574:34806:27:28:89:514:585:144:Times:144:Times:significant effect on financial development in the second and third income quartiles.  Its 
20:575:34897:28:27:89:502:557:144:Times:144:Times:effect in the first quartile is positive but not significant while it is negative and highly 
20:576:34990:27:28:89:506:530:144:Times:144:Times:significant in the fourth quartile.  These results suggest that at very low income levels, 
20:577:35081:28:28:89:508:502:144:Times:144:Times:government spending does not seem to promote more intense financial intermediation, 
20:578:35165:28:27:89:539:474:144:Times:144:Times:possibly reflecting a country’s reliance on foreign aid and soft international loans in the early 
20:579:35263:27:28:89:484:447:144:Times:144:Times:stages of development. At intermediate levels of income, governments’ financing 
20:580:35343:28:27:89:522:419:144:Times:144:Times:requirements will need to be at least partially satisfied from domestic sources, which may 
20:581:35434:27:28:89:523:392:144:Times:144:Times:explain why government spending impacts positively on the development of the domestic 
20:582:35520:28:27:89:539:364:144:Times:144:Times:financial system.  The reversal of this effect at high levels of income suggest that high public 
20:583:35617:27:28:89:532:337:144:Times:144:Times:sector borrowing requirements in developed economies impact negatively on the size of the 
20:584:35707:28:28:89:518:309:144:Times:144:Times:banking system.  This may be because in developed economies, the growth of the public 
20:585:35793:28:27:89:541:281:144:Times:144:Times:sector may crowd out rather than crowd in the private sector.  If the private sector relies more 
20:586:35890:27:28:89:513:254:144:Times:144:Times:on the banking system than the public sector, crowding out of the former by the latter is 
20:587:35980:28:27:89:301:226:144:Times:144:Times:likely to result in a smaller banking system. 
20:588:36026:27:28:117:526:199:144:Times:144:Times:Trade openness also has a positive and highly significant effect on financial depth in 
20:589:36113:28:28:89:520:171:144:Times:144:Times:the second and third quartiles, a negative one in the fourth and an insignificant one in the 
20:590:36206:28:27:89:509:143:144:Times:144:Times:first.  The positive effect of trade openness on financial development is consistent with 
20:591:36296:27:0:89:518:116:144:Times:144:Times:existing empirical literature (e.g., Baltagi et al., 2009) as well as with the great reversals

22:677:38194:0:28:90:530:723:144:Times:144:Times:A plausible explanation for this finding needs perhaps to recognise the role that money and 
22:678:38286:28:27:90:529:695:144:Times:144:Times:capital markets can play in promoting trade in developed economies. If, for example, firms 
22:679:38377:27:28:90:527:668:144:Times:144:Times:can obtain cheaper trade finance from money and capital markets than from banks, greater 
22:680:38466:28:28:90:528:640:144:Times:144:Times:trade openness could well be associated with lower levels of banking system development. 
22:681:38555:28:27:117:541:612:144:Times:144:Times:The estimates reported in Table 4 show that government expenditure impacts positively 
22:682:38641:27:28:90:494:585:144:Times:144:Times:on trade openness at low and high income levels, but has no significant influence at 
22:683:38726:28:27:90:519:557:144:Times:144:Times:intermediate levels of income.  At low income levels, this may reflect the developmental 
22:684:38815:27:28:90:524:530:144:Times:144:Times:nature of government expenditures – infrastructure projects for example are likely to have 
22:685:38906:28:28:90:497:502:144:Times:144:Times:high import content.  As countries develop, their capacity to undertake such projects 
22:686:38992:28:27:90:508:474:144:Times:144:Times:domestically is likely to improve, which can explain the insignificant coefficient at the 
22:687:39082:27:28:90:496:447:144:Times:144:Times:intermediate income levels.  On the other hand, the positive and larger in magnitude 
22:688:39167:28:27:90:541:419:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient of government expenditure at high income levels is somewhat puzzling.  It clearly 
22:689:39261:27:28:90:535:392:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that high government expenditures at these levels are trade promoting, which is not 
22:690:39354:28:27:90:518:364:144:Times:144:Times:obvious why. The effects of financial development on trade openness are interesting and 
22:691:39442:27:28:90:535:337:144:Times:144:Times:much less surprising.  It appears that they tend to decline with income, being at their highest 
22:692:39538:28:28:90:529:309:144:Times:144:Times:at low income levels, suggesting that financial development may have some if not all of its 
22:693:39630:28:27:89:524:281:144:Times:144:Times:growth promoting effects early on by supporting trade.  For the fourth income quartile the 
22:694:39721:27:28:89:541:254:144:Times:144:Times:effects of financial development are small and significant only at the ten percent level.  In the 
22:695:39819:28:27:89:534:226:144:Times:144:Times:intermediate region the effects taper off but are still sizeable and significant, suggesting that 
22:696:39917:27:28:89:524:199:144:Times:144:Times:financial development continues to be important in promoting economic openness in such 
22:697:40004:28:28:89:531:171:144:Times:144:Times:countries.  Interestingly, the effects of per capita income on trade are significant only in the 
22:698:40101:28:27:89:536:143:144:Times:144:Times:first and second quartiles while the negative-size effect is highly significant in all quartiles.

23:791:41783:14:27:90:536:197:144:Times:144:Times:variation that exists among different groups of countries.  Different policy recommendations 
23:792:41876:27:28:90:517:170:144:Times:144:Times:may therefore be appropriate for different stages of development.  At low income levels, 
23:793:41965:28:27:90:540:142:144:Times:144:Times:economic development is the only variable that appears to drive financial development, since 
23:794:42058:27:0:90:535:115:144:Times:144:Times:both trade openness and government spending have positive and insignificant coefficients at 
24:795:42154:0:28:90:534:723:144:Times:144:Times:conventional levels.  At intermediate income levels, both government expenditure and trade 
24:796:42245:28:27:90:528:695:144:Times:144:Times:openness are significant drivers of banking system development.  At high levels of income 
24:797:42335:27:28:90:524:668:144:Times:144:Times:both these effects are reversed, reflecting perhaps the increased role played by money and 
24:798:42426:28:28:90:447:640:144:Times:144:Times:capital markets and crowding out of the private sector by the government. 
24:799:42500:28:27:117:524:612:144:Times:144:Times:At the very initial stages of development, government spending relies on foreign aid 
24:800:42585:27:28:89:522:585:144:Times:144:Times:and soft international loans which do not promote domestic financial development but do 
24:801:42673:28:27:89:524:557:144:Times:144:Times:seem to support trade. It is only later, when the commercial sector is more developed, that 
24:802:42765:27:28:90:522:530:144:Times:144:Times:government expenditure would be directed toward trade-promoting infrastructure such as 
24:803:42852:28:28:90:533:502:144:Times:144:Times:ports, railroads, and roads, which ultimately create income that feeds back into the financial 
24:804:42947:28:27:90:542:474:144:Times:144:Times:sector. As economic development progresses, government expenditure begins to facilitate the 
24:805:43039:27:28:90:537:447:144:Times:144:Times:emergence of domestic finance, because governments begin to borrow from domestic banks, 
24:806:43127:28:27:90:292:419:144:Times:144:Times:which are able to mobilise more savings.

24:809:43190:28:27:117:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:We make a first attempt to examine empirically the interactions between government 
24:810:43273:27:28:90:512:323:144:Times:144:Times:expenditure, trade openness and financial development utilising data from 18th century 
24:811:43360:28:27:90:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:England and a panel of 84 countries from 1960-2004. For England, we find that the 
24:812:43442:27:28:90:489:268:144:Times:144:Times:government and international trade did have a positive long-run effect on financial 
24:813:43526:28:28:90:539:240:144:Times:144:Times:development when measured as the value of private loans issued at the Bank of England. For 
24:814:43617:28:27:90:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:the wider panel of countries and more recent data, we find that government expenditure 
24:815:43704:27:28:90:516:185:144:Times:144:Times:seems to have positive effects on financial development for countries that are in the mid-
24:816:43794:28:27:90:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:ranges of economic development as measured by per capita income, but has little effect for 
24:817:43885:27:0:90:424:130:144:Times:144:Times:poor countries and a strongly negative effect for the wealthiest ones.  
25:818:43961:0:28:117:542:723:144:Times:144:Times:The historical and more modern analyses are both consistent with a mutually supportive 
25:819:44048:28:27:89:513:695:144:Times:144:Times:government-trade-finance nexus that reaches its peak of effectiveness once an economy 
25:820:44134:27:28:89:517:668:144:Times:144:Times:begins to modernise. England, for example, had shown signs of modernizing prior to the 
25:821:44221:28:28:89:530:640:144:Times:144:Times:Glorious Revolution of 1688, but military conflicts and the rise of a stronger Parliamentary 
25:822:44314:28:27:89:522:612:144:Times:144:Times:state allowed the Bank of England to form and evolve along with a host of other financial 
25:823:44404:27:28:89:518:585:144:Times:144:Times:institutions, setting the nexus into motion. Indeed, with a per capita income of more than 
25:824:44495:28:27:89:522:557:144:Times:144:Times:$1,000 (1990 US) by 1770, England would have been firmly in the second quartile of our 
25:825:44582:27:28:89:344:530:144:Times:144:Times:broad cross-section of economies measured in 1990. 
25:826:44633:28:28:117:540:502:144:Times:144:Times:Our study takes exception to the usual view that government expenditure in general has 
25:827:44720:28:27:89:507:474:144:Times:144:Times:a crowding-out effect on private investment, and suggests that the government itself is 
25:828:44808:27:28:89:529:447:144:Times:144:Times:essential to the development of sound financial arrangements.  The effects of such a nexus, 
25:829:44900:28:27:89:537:419:144:Times:144:Times:with the emergence of a modern sector reflected in the extent of international trade, are most 
25:830:44995:27:28:89:529:392:144:Times:144:Times:emphatic as economies begin to experience robust growth. This has strong implications for 
25:831:45085:28:27:89:307:364:144:Times:144:Times:the staging of development policies today.
