2:27:808:26:20:72:120:464:144:Times:144:Times:Abstract 
2:28:817:20:13:72:546:444:144:Times:144:Times:We  evaluate  the  extent  to  which  poor  households  are  able  to  participate  in  Payments  for  
2:29:920:13:14:72:543:431:144:Times:144:Times:Environmental Services (PES) scheme using data from a PES scheme implemented at two sites 
2:30:1010:14:14:72:545:417:144:Times:144:Times:in  Latin  America.  This  allows  us  to  compare  environmental  and  livelihood  impacts  of  PES  
2:31:1112:14:14:72:543:403:144:Times:144:Times:across regions with different agronomic and socio-economic characteristics. In particular, one of 
2:32:1210:14:14:72:543:389:144:Times:144:Times:our sites is composed almost entirely of poor or extremely poor households, while the other has 
2:33:1306:14:13:72:547:375:144:Times:144:Times:households  ranging  from  extremely  poor  to  very  well  off.  The  results  show  that  poorer  
2:34:1406:13:14:72:545:362:144:Times:144:Times:households  are  in  fact  able  to  participate—indeed,  by  some  measures  they  participated  to  a  
2:35:1511:14:14:72:544:348:144:Times:144:Times:greater  extent  than  better-off  households.  Moreover,  their  participation  was  not  limited  to  the  
2:36:1620:14:14:72:543:334:144:Times:144:Times:simpler, least expensive options. Extremely poor households had a somewhat greater difficulty in 
2:37:1717:14:14:72:543:320:144:Times:144:Times:participating, but even in their case the difference is solely a relative one. Transaction costs may 
2:38:1818:14:26:72:543:306:144:Times:144:Times:be greater obstacles to the participation of poorer households than household-specific constraints.

3:52:2836:19:14:108:547:683:144:Times:144:Times:Payments  for  Environmental  Services  (PES)  schemes  pay  land  users  to  undertake  
3:53:2925:14:14:72:542:669:144:Times:144:Times:practices that generate external benefits, either to individual users of ecosystem services (such as 
3:54:3026:14:14:72:545:655:144:Times:144:Times:downstream  water  users)  or  to  society  as  a  whole  (Wunder,  2005;  Pagiola  and  Platais,  2007;  
3:55:3132:14:14:72:542:641:144:Times:144:Times:Engel et al., 2008). These payments represent a potential additional income source for land users, 
3:56:3231:14:13:71:543:627:144:Times:144:Times:but  will  only  bring  benefits  to  households  that  are  able  to  participate.  A  common  fear  among  
3:57:3340:13:14:71:543:614:144:Times:144:Times:many observers has been that poorer households would be unable to participate in PES schemes. 
3:58:3434:14:14:71:543:600:144:Times:144:Times:Several  studies  in  Costa  Rica,  for  example,  found  that  many  participants  in  that  country’s  PES  
3:59:3544:14:20:71:535:586:144:Times:144:Times:scheme are relatively well off (Ortiz et al., 2002; Miranda et al., 2003; Zbinden and Lee, 2005). 
3:60:3642:20:14:108:544:566:144:Times:144:Times:The  Regional  Integrated  Silvopastoral  Ecosystem  Management  Project,  implemented  at  
3:61:3734:14:13:72:542:552:144:Times:144:Times:sites in Colombia, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica from 2003 to 2008, offers an excellent opportunity 
3:62:3830:13:14:72:543:539:144:Times:144:Times:to  examine  the  ability  of  poor  households  to  participate  in  PES.  The  Silvopastoral  Project  used  
3:63:3941:14:14:72:547:525:144:Times:144:Times:PES  to  stimulate  the  adoption  of  silvopastoral  practices  in  degraded  pastures  by  paying  
3:64:4042:14:14:72:543:511:144:Times:144:Times:participating households for the biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration services that 
3:65:4140:14:14:72:543:497:144:Times:144:Times:were generated, with financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Unlike many other 
3:66:4233:14:13:72:544:483:144:Times:144:Times:PES  schemes,  the  Silvopastoral  Project  offered  a  wide  range  of  participation  options,  ranging  
3:67:4340:13:14:72:546:470:144:Times:144:Times:from  simple  and  inexpensive  land  use  changes  to  substantial  and  complex  changes  (with  
3:68:4439:14:14:72:543:456:144:Times:144:Times:correspondingly higher payments). That some of the choices offered by the project are complex 
3:69:4533:14:20:72:507:442:144:Times:144:Times:and onerous provides a particularly strong test of poorer households’ ability to participate. 
3:70:4627:20:14:108:543:422:144:Times:144:Times:In this chapter, we evaluate the extent to which poor households were able to participate 
3:71:4717:14:13:72:543:408:144:Times:144:Times:in the Silvopastoral Project’s PES scheme, using data from two of its sites. As the same payment 
3:72:4814:13:14:72:543:395:144:Times:144:Times:scheme  was  offered  in  both  areas,  we  are  able  to  compare  poor  household  participation  in  PES  
3:73:4923:14:14:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:under different agronomic and socio-economic conditions. In particular, one site is characterized 
3:74:5021:14:14:72:544:367:144:Times:144:Times:by high levels of poverty, with most households falling below the poverty line, and many below 
3:75:5116:14:14:72:545:353:144:Times:144:Times:the  extreme  poverty  line,  while  the  other  site  exhibits  a  very  wide  range  of  income  levels,  
3:76:5224:14:13:72:543:339:144:Times:144:Times:including  both  extremely  poor  and  very  wealthy  farm  households.  Because  of  the  nature  of  the  
3:77:5332:13:14:72:543:326:144:Times:144:Times:practices being promoted, we are unable at this time to assess the Silvopastoral Project’s welfare 
3:78:5431:14:14:72:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:impact.  What  we  assess  is  the  threshold  issue  of  ability  to  participate:  if  poorer  households  
3:79:5540:14:20:71:443:298:144:Times:144:Times:cannot participate, they will not receive any benefits, whether large or small. 
3:80:5620:20:13:108:545:278:144:Times:144:Times:We  begin  by  describing  the  Silvopastoral  Project  and  the  two  project  sites.  We  then  
3:81:5718:13:14:72:543:265:144:Times:144:Times:discuss  the  factors  that  might  hinder  poorer  households’  ability  to  participate  in  PES  schemes,  
3:82:5828:14:14:72:543:251:144:Times:144:Times:drawing on the review by Pagiola et al. (2005) and on the rich literature on technology adoption 
3:83:5925:14:14:72:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:by  smallholders  in  developing  countries,  many  of  whose  lessons  are  relevant  to  PES.  We  then  
3:84:6032:14:14:72:544:223:144:Times:144:Times:use data collected at the study sites to analyze participation patterns, with particular attention to 
3:85:6134:14:13:72:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:participation  by  poorer  households.  We  first  examine  the  extent  to  which  different  groups  of  
3:86:6241:13:14:72:544:196:144:Times:144:Times:households participate, and then undertake an econometric analysis to determine the factors that 
3:87:6338:14:14:72:543:182:144:Times:144:Times:affect  participation  decisions.  We conclude by discussing the implications  of  our  results  for  the  
3:88:6445:14:42:72:191:168:144:Times:64:Times:design of PES schemes.1

3:90:6516:7:16:76:542:119:42:Times:100:Times:1    Earlier analyses we conducted at these same sites are reported in Pagiola et al., 2007b and 2008. Those analyses 
3:91:6634:16:12:90:543:103:100:Times:100:Times:used data from earlier years (from the first year only, at the Nicaragua site, and for the first three years, at the 
3:92:6751:12:11:90:544:91:100:Times:100:Times:Colombia  site).  This  paper  updates  those  analyses  to  use  the  data  from  all  four  project  years  and  compares  
3:93:6876:11:0:90:183:80:100:Times:100:Times:results at the two sites. 
4:94:6904:0:19:71:226:708:144:Times:144:Times:2. The Silvopastoral Project  
4:95:6933:19:14:107:543:689:144:Times:144:Times:The Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project piloted the use of 
4:96:7019:14:14:71:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:PES in three sites in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua (Pagiola et al., 2004). The project was 
4:97:7117:14:14:71:544:661:144:Times:144:Times:financed  by  a  US$4.5  million  grant  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF),  through  the  
4:98:7222:14:20:71:534:647:144:Times:144:Times:World Bank. It was implemented in the field by local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
4:99:7314:20:19:71:189:627:144:Times:144:Times:2.1 PES scheme design 
4:100:7336:19:14:107:543:608:144:Times:144:Times:The Silvopastoral Project used PES to promote the adoption of silvopastoral practices in 
4:101:7425:14:14:71:545:594:144:Times:144:Times:areas  of  degraded  pastures,  with  the  aim  of  generating  biodiversity  conservation  and  carbon  
4:102:7530:14:14:71:544:580:144:Times:144:Times:sequestration  services.  Silvopastoral  practices  include  (1)  planting  high  densities  of  trees  and  
4:103:7639:14:14:71:545:566:144:Times:144:Times:shrubs  in  pastures;  (2)  cut  and  carry  systems,  in  which  livestock  is  fed  with  the  foliage  of  
4:104:7749:14:13:71:545:552:144:Times:144:Times:specifically  planted  trees  and  shrubs  (‘fodder  banks’);  and  (3)  using  fast-growing  trees  and  
4:105:7855:13:14:71:547:539:144:Times:144:Times:shrubs   for   fencing   and   wind   screens.   These   practices   provide   deeply   rooting,   perennial   
4:106:7966:14:20:71:436:525:144:Times:144:Times:vegetation that is persistently growing and has a dense but uneven canopy.  
4:107:8042:20:14:107:546:505:144:Times:144:Times:The  on-site  benefits  of  silvopastoral  practices  to  land  users  may  include  additional  
4:108:8139:14:14:71:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:production  from  the  tree  component,  such  as  fruit,  fuelwood,  fodder,  or  timber;  maintaining  or  
4:109:8248:14:13:71:548:477:144:Times:144:Times:improving   pasture   productivity   by   increasing   nutrient   recycling;   and   diversification   of   
4:110:8356:13:14:71:543:464:144:Times:144:Times:production (Dagang and Nair, 2003). These benefits can be important, but are often insufficient 
4:111:8452:14:14:71:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:by themselves to justify adopting silvopastoral practices—particularly practices with substantial 
4:112:8550:14:14:71:544:436:144:Times:144:Times:tree  components,  which  have  high  upfront  planting  costs  and  only  bring  benefits  several  years  
4:113:8658:14:14:71:544:422:144:Times:144:Times:later.  Estimates  prepared  for  the  project  show  rates  of  return  of  between  4%  and  14%  (Gobbi,  
4:114:8767:14:13:71:543:408:144:Times:144:Times:2002). Other studies found similar results; White et al. (2001), for example, found rates of return 
4:115:8867:13:14:71:545:395:144:Times:144:Times:to  adoption  of  improved  pasture  in  Esparza,  Costa  Rica,  of  9%  to  12%.  These  estimates,  of  
4:116:8973:14:20:71:400:381:144:Times:144:Times:course, only consider the on-site benefits of silvopastoral practices.  
4:117:9045:20:14:107:546:361:144:Times:144:Times:Because  of  their  increased  complexity  relative  to  traditional  pastures,  silvopastoral  
4:118:9141:14:14:71:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:practices  also  have  important  biodiversity  benefits  (Dennis  et  al.,  1996;  Harvey  and  Haber,  
4:119:9246:14:13:71:545:333:144:Times:144:Times:1999).  They  have  been  shown  to  play  a  major  role  in  the  survival  of  wildlife  species  by  
4:120:9351:13:14:71:544:320:144:Times:144:Times:providing scarce resources and refuge; to have a higher propagation rate of native forest plants; 
4:121:9449:14:14:71:544:306:144:Times:144:Times:and  to  provide  shelter  for  wild  birds.  They  can  also  help  connect  protected  areas.  Silvopastoral  
4:122:9561:14:14:71:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:practices can also fix significant amounts of carbon in the soil and in the standing tree biomass 
4:123:9659:14:13:71:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:(Fisher et  al.,  1994;  Swallow  et  al.,  2007).  Both  biodiversity  and  carbon  sequestration  benefits  
4:124:9769:13:14:71:542:265:144:Times:144:Times:are off-site, however, so land users tend not to include them when they decide which practices to 
4:125:9867:14:14:71:547:251:144:Times:144:Times:adopt.  GEF  funding  for  the  Silvopastoral  Project  is  based  on  the  desire  to  secure  these  
4:126:9970:14:14:71:545:237:144:Times:144:Times:biodiversity  and  carbon  sequestration  benefits.2  Silvopastoral  practices  can  also  affect  water  
4:127:10076:14:14:72:547:223:144:Times:144:Times:services,  though  the  specific  impact  is  likely  to  be  site  specific  (Bruijnzeel,  2004).  The  
4:128:10181:14:19:72:411:209:144:Times:144:Times:Silvopastoral Project did not include any payments for water services. 
4:129:10252:19:14:108:545:190:144:Times:144:Times:To  encourage  adoption  of  more  beneficial  practices,  the  Silvopastoral  Project  offered  
4:130:10349:14:14:72:542:176:144:Times:144:Times:payments that are proportional to the level of services provided. To do so, it developed indices of 
4:131:10449:14:14:72:544:162:144:Times:144:Times:the biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration services that different land uses provide, 
4:132:10547:14:14:72:547:148:144:Times:144:Times:then   aggregated   them   into   a   single   ‘environmental   services   index’   (ESI).3   The   project   
4:133:10657:14:13:72:543:134:144:Times:144:Times:distinguished 28 different land uses, each with its own ESI score, and paid participants according 
4:134:10756:13:20:72:543:121:144:Times:144:Times:to the change in total ESI score over their entire farm area. Remote sensing imagery, followed by

4:136:10902:7:14:72:493:94:42:Times:100:Times:2      In this context the GEF can be considered to be buying services on behalf of the global community.  
4:137:11009:14:0:72:386:80:42:Times:100:Times:3      The ESI is described in detail in CIPAV (2003) and Pagiola et al. (2004). 
5:138:11093:0:13:71:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:on-the-ground  verification,  was  used  to  develop  detailed  baseline  land  use  maps  of  each  PES  
5:139:11199:13:14:71:544:695:144:Times:144:Times:recipient  household  (as  well  as  of  members  of  a  control  group,  see  below),  indicating  the  land  
5:140:11310:14:14:71:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:use being undertaken on each parcel. Land use changes in each parcel were then monitored on an 
5:141:11405:14:20:71:467:667:144:Times:144:Times:annual basis, and payments were made on the basis of observed land use changes. 
5:142:11485:20:14:107:545:647:144:Times:144:Times:Silvopastoral  practices  tend  to  be  unattractive  to  land  users,  despite  their  long-term  
5:143:11584:14:13:71:544:633:144:Times:144:Times:benefits,  primarily  because  of  their  substantial  initial  investment  and  because  of  the  time  lag  
5:144:11694:13:14:71:545:620:144:Times:144:Times:between  investment  and  returns.  This  led  to  the  hypothesis  that  a  relatively  small  payment  
5:145:11799:14:14:71:547:606:144:Times:144:Times:provided  early  on  could  ‘tip  the  balance’  between  current  and  silvopastoral  practice,  by  
5:146:11901:14:14:71:544:592:144:Times:144:Times:increasing  the  net  present  value  of  investments  and  reducing  the  initial  period  in  which  these  
5:147:12011:14:14:71:544:578:144:Times:144:Times:practice impose net costs on land users (Pagiola et al., 2004, 2008). On this basis, participating 
5:148:12110:14:13:71:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:households  received  payments  of  US$75  per  incremental  ESI  point,  per  year,  over  a  four-year  
5:149:12216:13:14:71:544:551:144:Times:144:Times:period.4  Payments  were  made  annually,  after  on-the-ground  verification  of  land  use  changes.  
5:150:12320:14:20:72:461:537:144:Times:144:Times:They also received a one-time payment of US$10/point for the baseline points.5  
5:151:12400:20:20:72:153:517:144:Times:144:Times:2.2 Project sites 
5:152:12418:20:14:108:545:497:144:Times:144:Times:The  Silvopastoral  Project’s  sites  were  in  Quindío,  Colombia;  Esparza,  Costa  Rica;  and  
5:153:12516:14:13:72:543:483:144:Times:144:Times:Matiguás-Río Blanco, Nicaragua (Pagiola et al., 2004). In this paper, we focus exclusively on the 
5:154:12614:13:20:72:494:470:144:Times:144:Times:Quindío and Matiguás-Río Blanco sites. See the appendix for the data sources we used. 
5:155:12700:20:14:108:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:The  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  area  is  located  in  the  department  of  Matagalpa,  about  140km  
5:156:12797:14:14:72:544:436:144:Times:144:Times:northeast  of  Managua,  on  the  southern  slopes  of  the  Cordillera  de  Darien.  It  has  an  undulating  
5:157:12908:14:14:72:543:422:144:Times:144:Times:terrain, with an elevation of about 300-500m above sea level. Average temperature is about 25°C 
5:158:13004:14:13:71:544:408:144:Times:144:Times:and  average  rainfall  between  1700mm  and  2500mm.  Participants  are  clustered  in  two  adjacent  
5:159:13108:13:14:71:543:395:144:Times:144:Times:microwatersheds, that of Río Bulbul and that of Río Paiwas. Farms range in size from 10-30ha to 
5:160:13204:14:14:71:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:a  few  of  over  60ha.  Most  households  are  poor,  with  many  falling  below  Nicaragua’s  extreme  
5:161:13309:14:20:71:135:367:144:Times:144:Times:poverty line. 
5:162:13323:20:14:108:542:347:144:Times:144:Times:Land use in Matiguás-Río Blanco is dominated by extensive grazing. As shown in Table 
5:163:13408:14:13:72:544:333:144:Times:144:Times:1,  pastures  accounted  for  about  63%  of  the  area  prior  to  project  start.  Of  this,  about  half  was  
5:164:13522:13:14:72:543:320:144:Times:144:Times:degraded pasture, and a little over a quarter had either no or few trees. Annual crops made up a 
5:165:13619:14:14:72:543:306:144:Times:144:Times:very small part of total area. It is noteworthy that about 20% of total area remained under forest, 
5:166:13719:14:14:72:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:mostly along streambanks. It is also noteworthy that silvopastoral practices, though not common, 
5:167:13816:14:13:71:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:were  not  unknown  even  before  the  project:  there  were  some  489ha  of  pastures  with  high  tree  
5:168:13923:13:20:72:307:265:144:Times:144:Times:density, and 88ha of fodder banks, for example.  
5:169:13972:20:14:108:543:245:144:Times:144:Times:The Quindío area is located in Colombia’s Central Cordillera, in the watershed of Río La 
5:170:14061:14:22:72:543:231:144:Times:144:Times:Vieja, at an altitude of about 900-1,500m above sea level. Average temperature is about 20-25°C 
5:171:14157:22:8:72:219:209:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
5:172:14205:8:16:72:543:201:42:Times:100:Times:4       The  Silvopastoral  Project’s  use  of  short-term  payments  is  controversial,  as  payments  in  PES  schemes  should  
5:173:14335:16:11:89:543:185:100:Times:100:Times:generally be on-going. The use of short-term payments means that the conditionality of payments is limited to 
5:174:14445:11:12:89:542:174:100:Times:100:Times:the first few years, which may well affect the long-term viability of the mechanism (Pagiola et al., 2007a). The 
5:175:14558:12:11:89:542:162:100:Times:100:Times:use of short-term payments is not pertinent to the issue considered in this paper, which focuses on the extent of 
5:176:14672:11:9:89:269:151:100:Times:100:Times:participation, and whether poverty affects it. 
5:177:14719:9:16:72:543:142:42:Times:100:Times:5       It  is  important  to  note  that  this  initial  ‘baseline’  payment  was  intended  as  a  recognition  of  the  environmental  
5:178:14857:16:12:89:542:126:100:Times:100:Times:services that households were already providing, and not as subsidy to increased service provision. Households 
5:179:14968:12:11:89:543:114:100:Times:100:Times:receiving  the  baseline  payment  were  under  no  obligation  to  participate  further.  As  noted  below,  however,  the  
5:180:15093:11:12:89:543:103:100:Times:100:Times:baseline  payment  did  help  finance  some  of  the  required  investments,  particularly  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco.  It  
5:181:15216:12:11:89:543:91:100:Times:100:Times:also  played  a  very  important  role  in  establishing  trust  among  participants  that  they  would  indeed  receive  the  
5:182:15343:11:0:89:435:80:100:Times:100:Times:promised payments if they undertook the land use changes the Project was asking for. 
6:183:15430:0:13:71:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:and average rainfall between 1500mm and 2000mm. Farms range from 10-20ha to some of 50-
6:184:15517:13:14:71:543:695:144:Times:144:Times:80ha. In this former coffee area, many of the larger farms are owned by urban professionals and 
6:185:15613:14:20:71:266:681:144:Times:144:Times:managed by employees (mayordomos).  
6:186:15649:20:14:107:545:661:144:Times:144:Times:Coffee  production  once  dominated  land  use  in  Quindío,  but  it  has  been  replaced  by  
6:187:15745:14:14:71:544:647:144:Times:144:Times:pasture  in  the  last  decade  due  to  low  coffee  prices,  and  now  accounts  for  less  than  1%  of  the  
6:188:15858:14:13:71:543:633:144:Times:144:Times:area. As shown in Table 2, extensive grazing was the main land use in Quindío prior to project 
6:189:15953:13:14:71:543:620:144:Times:144:Times:start. Degraded and treeless pastures dominated the landscape, accounting for about 65% of the 
6:190:16048:14:14:71:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:area. Livestock production is primarily for meat production, with a small proportion being used 
6:191:16144:14:14:71:544:592:144:Times:144:Times:for  milk  production.  Overall  tree  cover  was  low,  although  there  was  a  significant  amount  of  
6:192:16251:14:14:71:543:578:144:Times:144:Times:forest remnants, most of which was riparian forest. Silvopastoral practices such as pastures with 
6:193:16349:14:13:71:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:trees, fodder banks, and live fences were practically non-existent. Only 7 in 110 farms surveyed 
6:194:16445:13:20:72:432:551:144:Times:144:Times:had any fodder banks, for example, with an average of less than 1ha each.  
6:195:16520:20:14:108:543:531:144:Times:144:Times:Although neither Nicaragua nor Colombia is in the list of top deforesters, both have high 
6:196:16610:14:14:72:548:517:144:Times:144:Times:deforestation   rates,   particularly   Nicaragua.   Conditions   at   the   Nicaragua   site   are   broadly   
6:197:16722:14:14:72:545:503:144:Times:144:Times:representative  of  those  observed  in  many  parts  of  Central  America,  while  conditions  at  the  
6:198:16827:14:13:72:543:489:144:Times:144:Times:Colombia  site  are  broadly  representative  of  conditions  found  in  parts  of  Venezuela,  Brazil,  and  
6:199:16937:13:20:72:118:476:144:Times:144:Times:Ecuador. 
6:200:16946:20:14:108:545:456:144:Times:144:Times:All  households  in  the  study  sites  that  met  minimal  farm  and  herd  size  criteria  were  
6:201:17045:14:14:72:545:442:144:Times:144:Times:eligible  to  participate.  Participants  were  selected  on  a  first-come  basis  until  the  maximum  
6:202:17150:14:14:72:548:428:144:Times:144:Times:number   allowed   by   available   funding   was   reached.   The   characteristics   of   participating   
6:203:17258:14:13:72:543:414:144:Times:144:Times:households are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. At Matiguás-Río Blanco, the average participating 
6:204:17353:13:14:71:542:401:144:Times:144:Times:household is composed of six members and has about 34ha of land and about 23 livestock units.6 
6:205:17447:14:14:71:544:387:144:Times:144:Times:The  average  per  capita  income  of  about  C$2,000  is  below  the  poverty  line.  Other  indicators  
6:206:17553:14:14:71:545:373:144:Times:144:Times:confirm  the  low  living  standards  of  the  area’s  households:  few  have  water  or  electricity,  and  
6:207:17662:14:14:71:544:359:144:Times:144:Times:education  levels  are  very  low.  Agriculture  is  the  main  economic  activity,  with  few  households  
6:208:17770:14:13:71:543:345:144:Times:144:Times:having off-farm income. In Quindío, the average household is composed of slightly less than five 
6:209:17867:13:14:71:543:332:144:Times:144:Times:members, and has about 36ha of land and a herd of about 57 livestock units. Average per capita 
6:210:17962:14:20:71:460:318:144:Times:144:Times:income is about COP10 million, but with very high variation across the sample.  
6:211:18042:20:14:107:545:298:144:Times:144:Times:To  assess  relative  participation  levels,  we  classify  households  at  each  site  into  three  
6:212:18143:14:13:71:546:284:144:Times:144:Times:groups  based  on  their  estimated  income.7  The  small  size  of  our  sample  precluded  a  finer  
6:213:18246:13:14:72:544:271:144:Times:144:Times:breakdown  (for  example,  into  quintiles).  In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  we  use  the  national  poverty  
6:214:18352:14:14:72:542:257:144:Times:144:Times:lines for 2001 (World Bank, 2003), adjusted for inflation, to divide households into groups: those 
6:215:18451:14:14:72:543:243:144:Times:144:Times:with  incomes  below  the  extreme  poverty  line  (“extremely  poor”),  those  with  incomes  between  
6:216:18555:14:20:72:543:229:144:Times:144:Times:the extreme poverty line and the poverty line (“poor”), and those with incomes above the poverty 
6:217:18652:20:8:72:219:209:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
6:218:18700:8:16:72:543:201:42:Times:100:Times:6       Livestock  are  converted  into  livestock  units  (Unidad  Gran  Ganado,  UGG)  using  the  following  conversion  
6:219:18824:16:9:90:514:185:100:Times:100:Times:factors: adult cows, 1.0 UGG; oxen or breeding bulls, 1.55 UGG; calves, 0.33 UGG; yearlings, 0.7 UGG. 
6:220:18926:9:16:72:543:176:42:Times:100:Times:7        We  computed  household  income  by  adding  all  income  sources  reported  by  participants,  including  net  income  
6:221:19055:16:11:89:544:160:100:Times:100:Times:from  agricultural,  forest,  and  dairy  production;  livestock  sales;  off-farm  work;  net  income  from  non-farm  
6:222:19175:11:12:89:542:149:100:Times:100:Times:enterprises; and remittances. Dairy, agricultural, and forest products consumed by the household are included in 
6:223:19288:12:11:89:542:137:100:Times:100:Times:the calculation of income using market prices, and the value of family labor is imputed using local wage rates 
6:224:19399:11:12:89:543:126:100:Times:100:Times:for  unskilled  labor.  Expenditure  is  generally  preferred  over  income  as  an  indicator  of  household  welfare,  as  it  
6:225:19528:12:11:89:542:114:100:Times:100:Times:tends to be less variable (Ravallion, 1992). However, the baseline survey only collected data allowing income to 
6:226:19641:11:12:89:543:103:100:Times:100:Times:be  computed.  Moreover,  these  data  are  based  largely  on  information  self-reported  by  the  farmers,  and  so  are  
6:227:19766:12:11:89:542:91:100:Times:100:Times:subject to both recall problems and possible biases. These biases are unlikely to affect our results as long they 
6:228:19880:11:0:89:226:80:100:Times:100:Times:are similar across income groups. 
7:229:19917:0:13:71:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:line  (“non-poor”).  In  Quindío,  with  its  much  greater  spread  of  income  levels,  there  is  a  clear  
7:230:20028:13:14:71:543:695:144:Times:144:Times:jump in income levels above 20 million Colombian Pesos (COP), so we group households with 
7:231:20118:14:14:71:545:681:144:Times:144:Times:income  above  this  level  into  a  “high  income”  group.  Below  this  income  level,  there  is  no  
7:232:20223:14:14:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:apparent clustering, so we divide the remaining households into two groups of similar size, with 
7:233:20320:14:14:71:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:the division falling at COP2 million. We classify households with income between COP2 million 
7:234:20414:14:13:71:543:639:144:Times:144:Times:and COP20 million into a “middle-income” group, and those with incomes below COP2 million 
7:235:20504:13:14:71:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:into  a  “low-income”  group.  About  half  of  the  latter  group  falls  below  Colombia’s  official  
7:236:20608:14:20:71:238:612:144:Times:144:Times:poverty line (World Bank, 2002).  
7:237:20642:20:14:107:543:592:144:Times:144:Times:Breaking  down  participants  into  income  groups  shows  both  similarities  and  differences.  
7:238:20740:14:14:71:544:578:144:Times:144:Times:At  both  sites,  poorer  households  have  significantly  less  land  and  smaller  herds  than  better-off  
7:239:20850:14:13:71:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:households.  Poorer  households  also  have  larger  households  and  more  dependents  per  adult,  
7:240:20951:13:14:71:543:551:144:Times:144:Times:although in Quindío the proportion of  dependents  is  highest  among  middle  income  households.  
7:241:21051:14:14:71:545:537:144:Times:144:Times:In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  differences  in  educational  level  and  experience  are  minimal  and  not  
7:242:21156:14:14:71:545:523:144:Times:144:Times:statistically  significant;  these  differences  are  much  greater  in  Quindío,  but  they  are  also  not  
7:243:21266:14:14:71:544:509:144:Times:144:Times:statistically  significant.  In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  average  access  to  services  is  low,  but  poorer  
7:244:21376:14:13:71:545:495:144:Times:144:Times:households  are  less  likely  to  have  either  electricity  or  water;  in  contrast,  average  access  to  
7:245:21486:13:14:71:542:482:144:Times:144:Times:services is high in Quindío, but low income households are less likely to have water services and 
7:246:21584:14:14:71:544:468:144:Times:144:Times:more  likely  to  live  further  from  the  nearest  village.  Particularly  important  for  what  follows,  
7:247:21693:14:14:71:544:454:144:Times:144:Times:access  to  credit  and  technical  assistance  is  highest  among  better-off  households  at  both  sites,  
7:248:21803:14:14:71:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:although  the  differences  are  not  significant.  The  topography  of  farms  is  broadly  similar  across  
7:249:21913:14:19:71:211:426:144:Times:144:Times:income groups at both sites.  
7:250:21943:19:20:71:194:407:144:Times:144:Times:2.2 PES implementation 
7:251:21966:20:14:107:543:387:144:Times:144:Times:The Silvopastoral Project made its first payments at both sites, for baseline ESI points, in 
7:252:22059:14:14:71:543:373:144:Times:144:Times:July 2003. It made its first payment for changes in land use in May 2004. Additional payments 
7:253:22153:14:20:71:252:359:144:Times:144:Times:were made in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  
7:254:22189:20:13:107:544:339:144:Times:144:Times:Tables  1  and  2  compare  land  use  by  PES  recipients  prior  to  the  project  and  after  four  
7:255:22292:13:14:71:543:326:144:Times:144:Times:years of payments. Overall, there was substantial land use change at both sites. In Matiguás-Río 
7:256:22389:14:14:71:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco, 1,343ha (48% of total area) experienced some form of land use change, while in Quindío 
7:257:22484:14:14:71:545:298:144:Times:144:Times:1258ha  (44%  of  total  area)  experienced  some  form  of  land  use  change.8  A  wide  variety  of  
7:258:22588:14:13:72:546:284:144:Times:144:Times:changes  were  observed,  ranging  from  minor  changes  such  as  sowing  improved  grasses  in  
7:259:22686:13:14:72:546:271:144:Times:144:Times:degraded  pastures  to  very  substantial  changes  such  as  planting  high-density  tree  stands  or  
7:260:22790:14:14:72:543:257:144:Times:144:Times:establishing fodder banks. The area of degraded pasture experienced the largest fall at both sites, 
7:261:22890:14:14:72:545:243:144:Times:144:Times:being  reduced  by  over  80%  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  and  by  over  90%  in  Quindío.  The  area  
7:262:22992:14:14:72:544:229:144:Times:144:Times:natural  pastures  without  trees  also  declined  strongly–by  a  third  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  and  by  
7:263:23101:14:13:72:543:215:144:Times:144:Times:two  thirds  in  Quindío.  In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  the  greatest  increase  was  in  the  area  of  pasture  
7:264:23213:13:14:72:544:202:144:Times:144:Times:with high tree density, which increased by 570ha. The area of fodder banks increased by almost 
7:265:23308:14:14:72:544:188:144:Times:144:Times:160ha,  and  about  210km  of  live  fencing  were  established.  In  Quindío,  most  of  the  gains  were  
7:266:23416:14:14:72:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:experienced  in  pastures  with  high  tree  density,  which  increased  by  334ha.  The  area  of  fodder  
7:267:23524:14:14:72:546:160:144:Times:144:Times:banks  increased  relatively  little  (from  less  than  5ha  to  over  28ha),  but  that  of  intensive  
7:268:23630:14:13:72:544:146:144:Times:144:Times:silvopastoral  systems  (Leucaena  planted  at  5,000  trees/ha)  increased  substantially  (from  0ha  to  
7:269:23738:13:22:72:543:133:144:Times:144:Times:130ha). About 346km of live fencing were established. Overall, these changes increased the total 
7:270:23835:22:8:72:219:111:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
7:271:23883:8:16:72:543:103:42:Times:100:Times:8       The  figures  quoted  actually  under-state  the  extent  of  change,  as  they  show  net  changes.  In  addition,  existing  
7:272:24018:16:11:89:543:87:100:Times:100:Times:silvopastoral practices were often upgraded to more intensive practices (for example, increasing the density of 
7:273:24130:11:0:89:162:76:100:Times:100:Times:trees in pastures). 
8:274:24152:0:13:71:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:ESI  score  of  PES  recipients  by  53%  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  and  by  49%  in  Quindío.  Thus  
8:275:24254:13:14:71:544:695:144:Times:144:Times:households  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  made  more  substantial  changes  on  a  smaller  proportion  of  
8:276:24358:14:20:71:258:681:144:Times:144:Times:their land than households in Quindío. 
8:277:24397:20:14:107:544:661:144:Times:144:Times:In  Quindío,  the  land  use  changes  undertaken  by  PES  recipients  were  vastly  greater  than  
8:278:24498:14:14:71:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:those  observed  in  the  control  group,  among  whom  less  than  13%  of  land  area  experienced  any  
8:279:24605:14:13:71:540:633:144:Times:144:Times:change, for an increase in ESI points of only 7%. The lack of a proper control group at Matiguás-
8:280:24702:13:14:71:543:620:144:Times:144:Times:Río Blanco prevents a similar comparison, but casual observation suggests that land use changes 
8:281:24798:14:14:71:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:among non-recipients in nearby areas were substantially less extensive, in both area affected and 
8:282:24896:14:26:71:159:592:144:Times:144:Times:degree of change. 
8:283:24914:26:20:71:379:566:144:Times:144:Times:3. Participation in the Silvopastoral Project’s PES scheme  
8:284:24973:20:13:107:548:546:144:Times:144:Times:PES   schemes   pay   land   users   to   maintain   or   switch   to   land   uses   that   provide   
8:285:25076:13:14:71:546:533:144:Times:144:Times:environmental  services  that  others  value.  Participation  is  voluntary,  and  participants  receive  
8:286:25182:14:14:71:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:payments  for  doing  so.  This  creates  a  prima  facie  presumption  that  participants  are  at  least  no  
8:287:25294:14:14:71:542:505:144:Times:144:Times:worse off by joining than they would be by not joining. Were this not the case, they could simply 
8:288:25392:14:14:71:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:decline to participate. The potential benefits of PES schemes will only be realized by those who 
8:289:25489:14:13:71:544:477:144:Times:144:Times:participate,  however.  Determining  whether  poorer  households  will  in  fact  be  able  to  participate  
8:290:25598:13:20:71:522:464:144:Times:144:Times:in a PES scheme is thus critical to any potential impact such schemes might have on poverty. 
8:291:25691:20:14:107:543:444:144:Times:144:Times:Pagiola et  al.  (2005)  group  the  factors  that  might  affect  a  household’s  participation  in  a  
8:292:25796:14:14:71:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:PES scheme into three categories: factors that affect eligibility to participate; factors that affect 
8:293:25898:14:14:71:545:416:144:Times:144:Times:households’  desire  to  participate;  and  factors  that  affect  their  ability  to  participate.  The  three  
8:294:26011:14:13:71:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:categories  form  a  logical  sequence:  ability  to  participate  only  become  an  issue  for  households  
8:295:26120:13:14:71:542:389:144:Times:144:Times:that wish to do so, and that in turn is only relevant for households that are eligible to participate.9 
8:296:26223:14:14:71:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  factors  that  affect  the  participation  of  eligible  households,  and  
8:297:26336:14:20:71:411:361:144:Times:144:Times:particularly on how they affect the participation of poorer households. 
8:298:26408:20:20:71:426:341:144:Times:144:Times:3.1 Constraints to the participation of poor households in PES schemes 
8:299:26479:20:13:107:543:321:144:Times:144:Times:Eligibility to participate is affected by the scheme’s targeting and by requirements it may 
8:300:26571:13:14:71:544:308:144:Times:144:Times:impose. Costa Rica’s PES scheme, for example, requires that applicants be located in a priority 
8:301:26667:14:14:71:545:294:144:Times:144:Times:conservation  area  (based  primarily  on  biodiversity  criteria)  or  in  a  watershed  covered  by  an  
8:302:26774:14:14:71:545:280:144:Times:144:Times:agreement  with  an  individual  water  user,  and  to  meet  a  variety  of  requirements  (such  as  not  
8:303:26882:14:13:71:543:266:144:Times:144:Times:being in arrears with the country’s social security system). It once also required most participants 
8:304:26983:13:14:71:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:to have land titles, but this requirement has been eliminated (Pagiola, 2008). Similarly, Mexico’s 
8:305:27082:14:14:71:545:239:144:Times:144:Times:PES  scheme  defines  eligible  areas  in  terms  of  their  importance  to  water  supplies  and  other  
8:306:27188:14:14:71:544:225:144:Times:144:Times:criteria  (Muñoz  et  al.,  2006).  The  eligibility  of  poorer  households  will  thus  likely  often  be  an  
8:307:27301:14:14:71:547:211:144:Times:144:Times:important  consideration.  Pagiola  and  Colom  (2006),  for  example,  find  that  the  areas  in  
8:308:27401:14:13:71:543:197:144:Times:144:Times:Guatemala that are important for water service provision do not always have high poverty rates. 
8:309:27497:13:14:71:544:184:144:Times:144:Times:It is not an issue in our study, however, as we focus on areas that were selected for inclusion in 
8:310:27596:14:20:71:131:170:144:Times:144:Times:the project.  
8:311:27610:20:14:107:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:Assuming that a given household is eligible to participate, the next question is whether it 
8:312:27702:14:21:71:543:136:144:Times:144:Times:desires to participate. This is likely to depend primarily on whether it expects to be better off as a 
8:313:27805:21:8:71:219:115:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
8:314:27853:8:16:72:543:107:42:Times:100:Times:9       Wunder  (2008)  adds  a  fourth  ‘filter’:  whether  households  are  competitive  in  terms  of  transaction  costs.  This  
8:315:27986:16:11:89:542:91:100:Times:100:Times:filter affects whether the PES scheme will select particular households, and thus is closely related to eligibility 
8:316:28102:11:0:89:292:80:100:Times:100:Times:criteria. We return to this issue in the conclusions. 
9:317:28159:0:13:71:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:result.  Participation  in  PES  can  be  thought  of  as  adopting  a  particular  production  technique,  
9:318:28267:13:14:71:544:695:144:Times:144:Times:whose  returns  include  payments  from  the  scheme.  The  literature  on  technology  adoption  and  
9:319:28370:14:14:71:544:681:144:Times:144:Times:program  participation  thus  provides  many  insights  into  the  factors  likely  to  affect  participation  
9:320:28481:14:14:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:(Feder et al., 1985). The literature on adoption of agroforestry practices (Pattanayak et al., 2003; 
9:321:28582:14:14:71:545:653:144:Times:144:Times:Mercer,  2004)  is  particularly  pertinent  here,  as  the  practices  promoted  by  the  Silvopastoral  
9:322:28688:14:13:71:543:639:144:Times:144:Times:Project are very similar. Previous analyses confirm the significance of factors that tend to affect 
9:323:28788:13:14:71:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:the  benefits  or  the  costs  of  participation,  such  as  prices  faced,  farm  characteristics,  and  the  
9:324:28899:14:14:71:546:612:144:Times:144:Times:opportunity  cost  of  household  labor,  the  fit  in  the  farming  system,  or  the  risk  involved  
9:325:29003:14:14:71:545:598:144:Times:144:Times:(Pattanayak et  al.,  2003).  Factors  such  as  slope,  for  example,  can  affect  the  extent  to  which  
9:326:29112:14:14:71:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:productivity  is  threatened  under  current  practices,  thus  increasing  incentives  to  adopt  land  uses  
9:327:29223:14:13:71:543:570:144:Times:144:Times:that are less vulnerable to degradation. As developing-country PES schemes typically offer fixed 
9:328:29320:13:14:71:542:557:144:Times:144:Times:payments per hectare for adopting a given practice, the payment itself is unlikely to differentially 
9:329:29421:14:20:71:346:543:144:Times:144:Times:affect the desirability of participation across households. 
9:330:29481:20:14:107:544:523:144:Times:144:Times:A household may want to participate in a PES scheme and yet be unable to do so, for a 
9:331:29567:14:14:71:543:509:144:Times:144:Times:variety of reasons. Participation in a PES scheme requires adoption of the land uses promoted by 
9:332:29664:14:13:71:543:495:144:Times:144:Times:the  scheme.  This  may  be  simple  and  cheap,  if  the  scheme  calls  for  retaining  existing  land  uses  
9:333:29776:13:14:71:543:482:144:Times:144:Times:(as in the Costa Rica scheme’s forest protection contract), or it may be complex and costly, if the 
9:334:29876:14:14:71:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:scheme calls for switching to new practices (as in the PES scheme studied here). Tenure issues 
9:335:29971:14:14:71:544:454:144:Times:144:Times:are  often  critical,  particularly  in  cases  where  PES  schemes  require  long-term  investments,  such  
9:336:30080:14:14:71:543:440:144:Times:144:Times:as reforestation or adoption of silvopastoral practices. Tenure variables were significant in 72% 
9:337:30178:14:13:71:548:426:144:Times:144:Times:of   agroforestry   adoption   studies   that   included   them,   with   greater   tenure   security   being   
9:338:30290:13:14:71:545:413:144:Times:144:Times:consistently  associated  with  greater  adoption  (Pattanayak  et  al.,  2003).  In  Costa  Rica,  both  
9:339:30396:14:14:71:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:Thacher et  al.  (1997)  and  Zbinden  and  Lee  (2005)  found  tenure-related  variables  to  be  highly  
9:340:30503:14:14:71:544:385:144:Times:144:Times:significant  in  explaining  participation  in  the  country’s  PES  scheme  and  its  predecessors.  When  
9:341:30611:14:14:71:544:371:144:Times:144:Times:the  new  practices  to  be  adopted  are  complex,  access  to  technical  assistance  may  be  an  issue.  
9:342:30720:14:13:71:542:357:144:Times:144:Times:Access to extension was found to significantly affect agroforestry adoption in 90% of studies that 
9:343:30819:13:14:71:542:344:144:Times:144:Times:included it (Pattanayak et al., 2003). This was the case in two studies in Costa Rica, for example 
9:344:30918:14:14:71:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:(Thacher et al., 1997; Zbinden and Lee, 2005). Adopting new land use practices may also prove 
9:345:31012:14:14:71:542:316:144:Times:144:Times:difficult if households cannot finance the necessary investment. Savings, remittances, or off-farm 
9:346:31111:14:13:71:543:302:144:Times:144:Times:income may help some households undertake the necessary investments. Assets and credit both 
9:347:31203:13:14:71:545:289:144:Times:144:Times:tend  to  increase  adoption  of  agroforestry  practices,  and  their  role  is  very  often  significant  
9:348:31311:14:20:71:195:275:144:Times:144:Times:(Pattanayak et al., 2003). 
9:349:31338:20:14:107:544:255:144:Times:144:Times:Many  of  the  factors  that  affect  a  household’s  ability  to  participate  in  PES  may  well  be  
9:350:31442:14:14:71:542:241:144:Times:144:Times:more salient for poor households. Poorer households are less likely to have secure tenure, tend to 
9:351:31541:14:13:71:542:227:144:Times:144:Times:have fewer savings and less access to credit, and are less likely to receive technical assistance (de 
9:352:31643:13:14:71:543:214:144:Times:144:Times:Janvry  and  Sadoulet,  2000;  López  and  Valdés,  2000).  Whether  poor  households  will  be  able  to  
9:353:31750:14:14:71:543:200:144:Times:144:Times:participate in PES schemes (assuming that they are eligible and interested in doing so) is thus a 
9:354:31848:14:20:71:213:186:144:Times:144:Times:legitimate source of concern. 
9:355:31878:20:20:71:448:166:144:Times:144:Times:3.2 Poor household participation in the Silvopastoral Project’s PES scheme 
9:356:31953:20:13:108:543:146:144:Times:144:Times:The Silvopastoral Project induced substantial land use change at its sites. The question of 
9:357:32045:13:20:72:523:133:144:Times:144:Times:interest here is the extent to which poorer households were able to participate in this success.  
9:358:32143:20:14:108:544:113:144:Times:144:Times:Figures 1  and  2  break  down  observed  land  use  changes  by  household  income  group.  At  
9:359:32240:14:14:71:539:99:144:Times:144:Times:both sites, poorer households accounted for a substantial share of land use changes. At Matiguás-
9:360:32337:14:0:71:543:85:144:Times:144:Times:Río Blanco, poor and extremely poor households accounted for 49% of the decline in degraded 
10:361:32431:0:13:71:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:pasture.  In  Quindío,  low  income  households  accounted  for  35%  of  the  decline  in  degraded  
10:362:32533:13:14:71:543:695:144:Times:144:Times:pastures and 45% of the decline in improved pasture without trees. They only accounted for 9% 
10:363:32627:14:14:71:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:of the decline in natural pasture without trees, but this is primarily due to their having the least 
10:364:32728:14:20:71:290:667:144:Times:144:Times:area in this use of any of the income groups.  
10:365:32775:20:14:107:546:647:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover,  land  use  changes  by  poorer  households  at  both  sites  were  not  limited  to  
10:366:32871:14:13:71:543:633:144:Times:144:Times:adopting  technically  simpler  and  less  onerous  practices.  In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  for  example,  
10:367:32977:13:14:71:546:620:144:Times:144:Times:extremely  poor  households  established  60ha  of  fodder  banks  (38%  of  the  total),  and  poor  
10:368:33079:14:14:71:544:606:144:Times:144:Times:households  another  37ha  (23%).10  Extremely  poor  households  also  established  153ha  (40%)  of  
10:369:33182:14:14:72:544:592:144:Times:144:Times:pastures with high tree density, with poor households providing another 78ha (20%). Similarly, 
10:370:33277:14:14:72:543:578:144:Times:144:Times:in Quindío low income households adopted many complex land uses, including 70ha of pastures 
10:371:33369:14:13:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:with  high  tree  density  and  31ha  of  fodder  banks  and  intensive  silvopastoral  systems  (Leucaena 
10:372:33475:13:14:72:546:551:144:Times:144:Times:planted  at  5,000  trees/ha).  Indeed,  it  was  the  middle  income  group  that  made  the  simplest  
10:373:33580:14:14:72:545:537:144:Times:144:Times:possible  change  on  almost  half  of  the  land  they  converted,  replacing  natural  with  improved  
10:374:33685:14:20:72:485:523:144:Times:144:Times:grasses (mainly star grass, Cynodon plectostachyus) in pastures with no or few trees.  
10:375:33772:20:14:108:543:503:144:Times:144:Times:Tables 5 and 6 examine various indices of household participation across income groups. 
10:376:33860:14:13:72:544:489:144:Times:144:Times:In  terms  of  area  converted,  poorer  households  perform  poorly  at  both  sites.  At  Matiguás-Río  
10:377:33966:13:14:72:545:476:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco,  non-poor  households  converted  just  under  20ha  each,  on  average,  almost  double  the  
10:378:34069:14:14:72:546:462:144:Times:144:Times:10ha  converted  by  extremely  poor  households,  while  in  Quindío  high  income  households  
10:379:34166:14:14:72:544:448:144:Times:144:Times:converted about 34ha each, over three times the 9ha converted by low income households. It is 
10:380:34260:14:14:71:545:434:144:Times:144:Times:interesting  to  note,  however,  that  poor  (but  not  extremely  poor)  households  in  Matiguás-Río  
10:381:34365:14:19:71:405:420:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco converted practically as large an area as the non-poor (18ha). 
10:382:34435:19:14:108:544:401:144:Times:144:Times:Data  on  total  land  use  changes  by  households  in  each  income  group  are  affected  by  the  
10:383:34537:14:14:72:543:387:144:Times:144:Times:different land endowments of each group, however, making total area converted a poor measure 
10:384:34630:14:14:72:546:373:144:Times:144:Times:of  relative  participation.  The  differences  across  income  groups  shrink  considerably  when  
10:385:34730:14:14:72:544:359:144:Times:144:Times:changes  are  expressed  in  terms  of  proportion  of  farm  area  converted.  In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  
10:386:34837:14:13:72:539:345:144:Times:144:Times:poor households converted the greatest proportion of their farm: 57%, compared to 49% for non-
10:387:34931:13:14:72:543:332:144:Times:144:Times:poor households. Although extremely poor households converted the smallest proportion of their 
10:388:35026:14:14:72:545:318:144:Times:144:Times:farm  (42%)  of  any  of  the  groups,  the  difference  was  less  marked  than  in  absolute  terms.  In  
10:389:35134:14:14:72:543:304:144:Times:144:Times:Quindío, high income households converted the greatest proportion of their farms (55%) but low 
10:390:35229:14:13:72:543:290:144:Times:144:Times:and  middle  income  farms  were  not  far  behind  (40%  converted).  Moreover,  these  differences  in  
10:391:35335:13:20:72:425:277:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of farm converted are not significantly different (at 5% level). 
10:392:35411:20:14:108:546:257:144:Times:144:Times:Whether  expressed  in  hectares  or  in  proportion  of  farm  area  converted,  area-based  
10:393:35505:14:14:72:545:243:144:Times:144:Times:indicators  fail  to  measure  whether  the  changes  are  large  or  small.  Sowing  improved  pasture  
10:394:35610:14:14:72:544:229:144:Times:144:Times:grasses  in  a  treeless  pasture  requires  substantially  less  effort  than  converting  it  to  pasture  with  
10:395:35725:14:13:72:544:215:144:Times:144:Times:high  tree  density,  yet  will  have  the  same  value  in  terms  of  either  area  converted  or  percent  of  
10:396:35839:13:14:72:543:202:144:Times:144:Times:farm area converted. Area-based indicators also omit investments in live fencing. One option to 
10:397:35935:14:14:72:544:188:144:Times:144:Times:incorporate  a  measure  of  intensity  is  to  weight  the  area  converted  by  the  ESI  of  the  land  use  
10:398:36047:14:14:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:change, and then add the points for live fencing. The ESI is not intended as a measure of effort, 
10:399:36145:14:14:72:543:160:144:Times:144:Times:but  higher-ESI  land  uses  tend  to  involve  more  effort  than  lower-ESI  uses.  This  measure  is  also  
10:400:36256:14:13:72:543:146:144:Times:144:Times:appealing as it is the outcome of interest to the buyer of the environmental services being sought. 
10:401:36356:13:22:72:544:133:144:Times:144:Times:The increase in total ESI is the simplest measure (and is readily available, as it forms the basis 
10:402:36455:22:8:72:219:111:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
10:403:36503:8:16:72:543:103:42:Times:100:Times:10      The  popularity  of  fodder  banks  among  poorer  households  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  may  be  due  to  the  greater  
10:404:36632:16:11:90:543:87:100:Times:100:Times:availability and lower opportunity cost of labor in such households. The cut-and-carry practices that such banks 
10:405:36745:11:0:90:265:76:100:Times:100:Times:imply require substantial amounts of labor. 
11:406:36793:0:13:71:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:for  payments  to  participants),  but  like  the  area  converted  it  is  constrained  by  total  farm  size.  
11:407:36906:13:14:71:545:695:144:Times:144:Times:Stating  it  in  terms  of  increase  in  ESI  per  hectare  or  percent  increase  in  ESI  addresses  this  
11:408:37016:14:20:71:117:681:144:Times:144:Times:problem. 
11:409:37025:20:14:107:540:661:144:Times:144:Times:In Matiguás-Río Blanco, the increase in ESI points is greatest in absolute terms for non-
11:410:37114:14:14:71:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:poor households, but poor households follow close behind, and the difference is not statistically 
11:411:37212:14:13:71:545:633:144:Times:144:Times:significant.  Poor  households  do  even  better  in  proportional  change  in  ESI.  Extremely  poor  
11:412:37315:13:14:71:542:620:144:Times:144:Times:households trail, but the difference is not statistically significant. Extremely poor households had 
11:413:37416:14:14:71:548:606:144:Times:144:Times:the   highest   initial   ESI/ha,   however,   so   they   may   have   had   less   scope   for   substantial   
11:414:37529:14:14:71:545:592:144:Times:144:Times:improvements.  In  Quindío,  the  absolute  increase  in  ESI  points  is  smallest  for  low  income  
11:415:37632:14:14:71:545:578:144:Times:144:Times:households  and  largest  for  high  income  households,  but  in  relative  terms  the  55%  increase  
11:416:37736:14:13:71:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:achieved  by  low  income  households  exceeded  the  41%  achieved  by  middle  income  households  
11:417:37837:13:14:71:546:551:144:Times:144:Times:and  rivaled  the  67%  of  high  income  households.  Once  again,  these  differences  are  not  
11:418:37936:14:20:71:185:537:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant. 
11:419:37963:20:20:71:262:517:144:Times:144:Times:3.3 Explaining participation decisions 
11:420:38002:20:14:107:545:497:144:Times:144:Times:Examination  of  observed  land  use  change  indicates  that  poorer  households  are  in  fact  
11:421:38100:14:13:71:543:483:144:Times:144:Times:able  to  participate  quite  extensively  in  the  Silvopastoral  Project’s  PES  scheme,  even  though  it  
11:422:38210:13:14:71:543:470:144:Times:144:Times:requires  some  technically  complex  and  onerous  land  use  changes.  Participation  rates  by  poorer  
11:423:38317:14:14:71:544:456:144:Times:144:Times:households  are  broadly  similar  to  those  of  better  off  households  at  both  sites—lower  by  some  
11:424:38425:14:14:71:544:442:144:Times:144:Times:measures,  but  higher  by  others.  To  shed  further  light  on  participation  decisions  and  the  factors  
11:425:38537:14:20:71:517:428:144:Times:144:Times:that may affect them, we undertook econometric analyses of participation rates at both sites. 
11:426:38630:20:13:107:543:408:144:Times:144:Times:The literature on adoption decisions usually looks at the binary choice of whether or not 
11:427:38720:13:14:71:542:395:144:Times:144:Times:to adopt a given practice, using cross-sectional data on adopters and non-adopters, and the effect 
11:428:38819:14:14:71:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:of different factors on the probability of adoption (Pattanayak et al., 2003). This approach is not 
11:429:38919:14:14:71:544:367:144:Times:144:Times:relevant  in  our  case  because  project  funding  limited  the  number  of  participants  and  because  a  
11:430:39028:14:14:71:545:353:144:Times:144:Times:binary  adoption/non-adoption  choice  would  fail  to  capture  the  nature  of  participation  in  the  
11:431:39134:14:13:71:543:339:144:Times:144:Times:project. Rather than participation per se, what is of interest here is how household characteristics 
11:432:39235:13:14:71:542:326:144:Times:144:Times:affect the intensity of participation, with a particular focus on whether poorer households are less 
11:433:39336:14:14:71:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:able  to  participate  than  better-off  households.  Our  approach  is  similar  to  that  of  Nkonya  et  al. 
11:434:39448:14:14:71:543:298:144:Times:144:Times:(1997), who examined the intensity of adoption of improved seed in Tanzania using continuous 
11:435:39541:14:13:71:543:284:144:Times:144:Times:variables (hectares planted with improved maize seed or amount of fertilizer applied per hectare 
11:436:39638:13:14:71:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:of maize), and of Rajasekharan and Veeraputhran (2002), who examine the share of farms using 
11:437:39731:14:20:71:220:257:144:Times:144:Times:intercropping in Kerala, India. 
11:438:39763:20:14:107:546:237:144:Times:144:Times:We  run  five  different  regressions  for  each  site,  using  the  indices  of  participation  
11:439:39860:14:14:71:543:223:144:Times:144:Times:discussed earlier (area converted, share of farm converted, absolute change in ESI points, percent 
11:440:39959:14:13:71:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:change  in  ESI  points,  and  change  in  ESI  points/ha).  Similar  to  Rajasekharan  and  Veeraputhran  
11:441:40066:13:14:71:539:196:144:Times:144:Times:(2002)11, we employed a one-tailed Tobit to model farm area, as this variable is restricted to non-
11:442:40165:14:14:71:543:182:144:Times:144:Times:negative values. Likewise we employed a two-tailed Tobit model to model the percentage of the 
11:443:40259:14:14:71:545:168:144:Times:144:Times:farm  area  converted,  as  this  ranges  between  0  and  100.  Change  in  ESI,  change  in  ESI  per  
11:444:40364:14:14:71:543:154:144:Times:144:Times:hectare, and percent change in ESI can take any value, and so are modeled using ordinary least 
11:445:40459:14:41:71:147:140:144:Times:144:Times:squares (OLS). 
11:446:40474:41:7:72:219:99:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
11:447:40522:7:16:72:543:92:42:Times:100:Times:11      Rajasekharan  and  Veeraputhran  (2002)  employed  a  one-tailed  Tobit  to  study  the  adoption  of  intercropping  in  
11:448:40652:16:0:90:511:76:100:Times:100:Times:three regions in Kerala, India using the share of farm area under intercropping as the dependent variable. 
12:449:40762:0:13:107:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:Our  choice  of  explanatory  variables  draws  on  the  factors  identified  by  Pagiola  et  al. 
12:450:40861:13:14:71:544:695:144:Times:144:Times:(2005)  as  likely  to  affect  participation  in  PES,  and  by  Pattanayak  et  al.  (2003)  and  the  studies  
12:451:40975:14:14:71:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:they cite as likely to affect adoption of agroforestry practices, as discussed below. The number of 
12:452:41075:14:14:71:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:explanatory  variables  that  could  be  included  was  limited  by  the  relatively  small  sample  size  at  
12:453:41186:14:14:71:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:both  sites.  In  this  case,  increasing  the  sample  was  not  an  option:  our  data  include  every  single  
12:454:41300:14:13:71:544:639:144:Times:144:Times:PES  recipient  at  both  sites.  Fortunately,  the  small  size  of  the  sites  means  that  many  potential  
12:455:41412:13:20:71:472:626:144:Times:144:Times:explanatory variables vary little across households, and thus can be safely omitted. 
12:456:41497:20:14:107:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:Tables 7 and 8 present the estimation results for the two sites.12 The first two columns in 
12:457:41589:14:14:72:544:592:144:Times:144:Times:each  table  report  the  results  of  Tobit  models  for  area  changed  and  proportion  of  farm  changed,  
12:458:41700:14:14:72:543:578:144:Times:144:Times:and the last three columns the results for the OLS models for change in ESI, percentage change 
12:459:41795:14:13:72:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:in  ESI,  and  change  in  ESI  per  hectare.  Measures  of  model  fit  are  relatively  low,  but  this  is  not  
12:460:41911:13:14:72:547:551:144:Times:144:Times:surprising  with  cross-sectional  data,  particularly  when  sample  sizes  are  small.  They  are  
12:461:42012:14:14:72:545:537:144:Times:144:Times:comparable  to  those  obtained  by  Rajasekharan  and  Veeraputhran  (2002)  and  Ervin  and  Ervin  
12:462:42114:14:20:72:116:523:144:Times:144:Times:(1982).   
12:463:42124:20:14:108:545:503:144:Times:144:Times:The  first  group  of  independent  variables  examines  the  effect  of  farm  characteristics.  
12:464:42222:14:13:71:544:489:144:Times:144:Times:Many  previous  studies  report  a  positive  effect  of  farm  size  on  adoption  of  various  practices,  
12:465:42331:13:14:71:542:476:144:Times:144:Times:which has been interpreted as indicating higher flexibility of the farming system or the existence 
12:466:42430:14:14:71:545:462:144:Times:144:Times:of  economies  of  scale  (Rajasekharan  and  Veeraputhran,  2002;  Thacher  et  al.,  1997;  Nowak,  
12:467:42532:14:14:71:543:448:144:Times:144:Times:1987). At our sites, farm area is positively associated with intensity of adoption measured in area 
12:468:42632:14:14:71:543:434:144:Times:144:Times:converted  at  both  sites,  but  has  a  small  and  non-significant  impact  on  most  other  indicators  of  
12:469:42744:14:13:71:544:420:144:Times:144:Times:participation.  This  suggests  that  the  correlation  between  farm  size  and  area  converted  is  simply  
12:470:42855:13:20:71:309:407:144:Times:144:Times:due to larger farms having more area to convert.  
12:471:42905:20:14:108:544:387:144:Times:144:Times:Labor availability would seem likely to be important, although it is not often significant 
12:472:42996:14:14:72:545:373:144:Times:144:Times:(Pattanayak et  al.,  2003).  We  include  a  measure  of  the  hours  per  week  worked  on  the  farm.  
12:473:43102:14:14:72:540:359:144:Times:144:Times:Family  labor  is  significant  and  positive  in  the  farm  area  model  in  Quindío,  but  gives  non-
12:474:43207:14:13:72:545:345:144:Times:144:Times:significant  results  in  the  farm  share  and  ESI  models,  and  in  all  the  models  in  Matiguás-Río  
12:475:43315:13:14:72:544:332:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco.  This  is  not  surprising,  as  the  relationship  between  land  use  change  and  labor  use  is  
12:476:43424:14:14:72:543:318:144:Times:144:Times:complex: switching to higher ESI land uses does not necessarily increase labor use. Interestingly, 
12:477:43523:14:14:71:545:304:144:Times:144:Times:the  age  of  the  household  head  has  a  consistent,  statistically  significant  negative  impact  on  
12:478:43630:14:13:71:540:290:144:Times:144:Times:intensity  of  participation  in  all  models  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  but  generally  small  and  non-
12:479:43736:13:14:71:544:277:144:Times:144:Times:significant impacts in Quindío. Other studies have often found a positive effect, though rarely a 
12:480:43834:14:14:71:545:263:144:Times:144:Times:significant  one  and  have  generally  attributed  it  to  experience  reducing  the  risk  of  adoption  
12:481:43941:14:14:71:543:249:144:Times:144:Times:(Pattanayak et  al.,  2003);  an  alternative  explanation,  and  one  consistent  with  the  Matiguás-Río  
12:482:44049:14:14:71:543:235:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco results, is that older farmers may be less inclined to make changes. Whether households 
12:483:44144:14:13:71:545:221:144:Times:144:Times:were  male-headed  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  participation  at  either  site  under  all  
12:484:44252:13:20:71:144:208:144:Times:144:Times:formulations.   
12:485:44268:20:14:108:547:188:144:Times:144:Times:The   second   group   of   independent   variables   concerns   factors   likely   to   affect   the   
12:486:44372:14:17:72:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:profitability of adoption. As our study areas are small (particularly Matiguás-Río Blanco), most 
12:487:44469:17:8:72:219:157:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
12:488:44517:8:16:72:542:149:42:Times:100:Times:12     OLS models were tested for heteroscedasticity in the error distribution using the Breusch-Pagan test. Results for 
12:489:44638:16:11:90:543:133:100:Times:100:Times:these tests rejected the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity of errors, which if ignored would result in the lost of 
12:490:44755:11:12:90:542:122:100:Times:100:Times:optimality of the OLS estimator (Greene, 2000; Mittelhammer et al., 2000). In the absence of prior information 
12:491:44866:12:11:89:540:110:100:Times:100:Times:about  the  structure  of  the  heteroscedasticity,  we  used  the  OLS  estimator  with  White’s  heteroscedasticity-
12:492:44984:11:12:89:544:99:100:Times:100:Times:consistent  covariance  matrix  estimator  (White,  1980).  We  found  no  evidence  of  either  moderate  or  strong  
12:493:45103:12:11:89:543:87:100:Times:100:Times:muticollinerarity in any of the regression models using the Belsley et al. (1980) diagnostics in OLS models and 
12:494:45215:11:0:89:292:76:100:Times:100:Times:the Belsley (1991) diagnostic in the Tobit models. 
13:495:45270:0:13:71:546:708:144:Times:144:Times:farms  face  similar  prices  for  inputs  and  outputs,  and  have  similar  yield  potentials.  The  
13:496:45373:13:14:71:543:695:144:Times:144:Times:profitability of the various silvopastoral practices should thus be broadly similar throughout each 
13:497:45473:14:14:71:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:area. Farmers with lower accessibility will tend to face higher input costs and lower output prices 
13:498:45573:14:14:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:at the farm gate. Indeed, we find that distance from the nearest village has a significant negative 
13:499:45673:14:14:71:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:impact on the extent of area converted in Quindío, though the impact on ESI is not significant. In 
13:500:45772:14:13:71:540:639:144:Times:144:Times:Matiguás-Río Blanco, where distances are smaller but roads are worse, whether farms have year-
13:501:45866:13:14:71:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:round  access  had  strong  positive  impacts  on  changes  expressed  in  ESI,  but  not  on  area-based  
13:502:45973:14:20:71:127:612:144:Times:144:Times:indicators.  
13:503:45986:20:14:107:544:592:144:Times:144:Times:The proportion of the farm on flat terrain has a negative impact in Quindío, but it is not 
13:504:46077:14:14:71:542:578:144:Times:144:Times:significant except in some of the ESI models. In Matiguás-Río Blanco we expressed this variable 
13:505:46173:14:13:71:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:as  a  proportion  of  the  farm  on  hilly  terrain,  but  found  it  not  to  be  significant  in  any  model.  In  
13:506:46291:13:14:71:544:551:144:Times:144:Times:general,  there  is  no  strong  a  priori  reason  to  expect  a  particular  sign  on  topography  variables.  
13:507:46404:14:14:71:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:Land on steep slopes may benefit more from silvopastoral practices in that it is more vulnerable 
13:508:46501:14:14:71:544:523:144:Times:144:Times:to degradation under traditional extensive grazing. On the other hand, the cost of implementing 
13:509:46597:14:20:71:194:509:144:Times:144:Times:practices may be higher.  
13:510:46623:20:13:107:543:489:144:Times:144:Times:In  Quindío,  herd  size  has  a  significant  positive  impact  in  the  ESI  models  but  not  in  the  
13:511:46729:13:14:71:544:476:144:Times:144:Times:area  models,  suggesting  that  its  impact  is  primarily  through  its  demand  for  fodder  rather  than  
13:512:46839:14:20:71:252:462:144:Times:144:Times:through its contribution to financing. 
13:513:46878:20:14:107:543:442:144:Times:144:Times:The third group of independent variables includes factors that have been hypothesized to 
13:514:46967:14:14:71:547:428:144:Times:144:Times:affect  the  ability  of  households  to  participate  in  the  scheme.13  The  ability  to  finance  the  
13:515:47074:14:13:72:545:414:144:Times:144:Times:necessary  investments  is  one  potential  obstacle.  To  examine  whether  initial  investment  costs  
13:516:47179:13:14:72:543:401:144:Times:144:Times:affect ability to participate, we include variables a measure of assets in the Quindío analysis. In 
13:517:47279:14:14:71:543:387:144:Times:144:Times:Matiguás-Río Blanco, where initial assets vary relatively little, we use access to credit, measured 
13:518:47379:14:14:71:543:373:144:Times:144:Times:as  a  binary  indicator  of  whether  a  household  had  access  to  credit  during  the  five  years  prior  to  
13:519:47494:14:14:71:544:359:144:Times:144:Times:project  implementation.14  We  also  include  off-farm  income,  measured  as  the  income  share  of  
13:520:47598:14:13:72:544:345:144:Times:144:Times:off-farm  jobs  held  by  all  household  members.  Off-farm  income  can  be  a  financing  source  for  
13:521:47704:13:20:72:483:332:144:Times:144:Times:investment in new practices, but can also result in a higher opportunity cost of labor.  
13:522:47793:20:14:108:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:In Matiguás-Río Blanco, both access to credit and off-farm income had a positive impact 
13:523:47881:14:14:72:547:298:144:Times:144:Times:on  intensity  of  participation  in  every  model,  although  only  that  of  off-farm  income  was  
13:524:47983:14:13:72:543:284:144:Times:144:Times:significant. The non-significance of credit is surprising, given the cost of implementing some of 
13:525:48081:13:14:72:547:271:144:Times:144:Times:the  practices  promoted  by  the  Silvopastoral  Project  and  the  low  income  levels  of  most  
13:526:48181:14:14:72:544:257:144:Times:144:Times:households.  The  first-year  survey  of  participants  provides  the  explanation  for  this  result:  most  
13:527:48291:14:14:72:543:243:144:Times:144:Times:households, even in poor areas such as Matiguás-Río Blanco, have a variety of ways of finance 
13:528:48385:14:14:72:543:229:144:Times:144:Times:investments (Pagiola et al., 2008). Some investments were undertaken entirely with family labor 
13:529:48481:14:13:72:546:215:144:Times:144:Times:and  so  did  not  require  financing.  Unsurprisingly  in  a  livestock-producing  area,  the  sale  of  
13:530:48587:13:14:72:546:202:144:Times:144:Times:animals  was  the  most  frequently  mentioned  source  of  funds  (61%  of  all  households).  The  
13:531:48688:14:14:72:544:188:144:Times:144:Times:project’s  initial  ‘baseline’  payment  also  played  an  important  role  for  many  households  (53%).  
13:532:48795:14:38:72:546:174:144:Times:144:Times:Although  almost  no  households  mentioned  off-farm  income  as  a  source  of  financing,  it  is  
13:533:48897:38:8:72:219:136:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
13:534:48945:8:16:72:543:128:42:Times:100:Times:13      Within  these  factors,  tenure  is  not  an  issue  at  either  site,  as  both  were  selected  partly  for  the  absence  of  such  
13:535:49088:16:9:90:132:112:100:Times:100:Times:problems. 
13:536:49098:9:16:72:543:103:42:Times:100:Times:14      The  endogeneity  of  credit  was  tested  using  the  Wu-Hausman  and  Hausman  tests  in  the  OLS  models  and  the  
13:537:49226:16:11:90:545:87:100:Times:100:Times:Smith-Blundell  test  in  the  Tobit  models.  Exogeneity  of  credit  was  not  rejected  in  any  model  at  the  90%  
13:538:49347:11:0:90:161:76:100:Times:100:Times:confidence level. 
14:539:49368:0:13:71:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:possible that such income contributed primarily through its contribution to savings, which was an 
14:540:49466:13:20:71:331:695:144:Times:144:Times:important source of financing for 41% of households. 
14:541:49519:20:14:107:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:In Quindío, household assets had a very small but negative sign, in all formulations, but 
14:542:49609:14:14:71:544:661:144:Times:144:Times:they  are  not  significant.  Off-farm  income  had  a  mostly  negative,  but  also  not  significant,  effect  
14:543:49722:14:14:71:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:on adoption intensity in Quindío. These results are consistent with an interpretation of off-farm 
14:544:49820:14:13:71:542:633:144:Times:144:Times:employment increasing the opportunity cost of labor. Savings were the most often cited source of 
14:545:49917:13:14:71:544:620:144:Times:144:Times:financing  for  first-year  investments  in  Quindío,  followed  by  animal  sales;  baseline  payments  
14:546:50022:14:14:71:542:606:144:Times:144:Times:played a very small role, probably because low initial ESI points meant that these payments were 
14:547:50119:14:20:71:106:592:144:Times:144:Times:small.  
14:548:50127:20:14:107:544:572:144:Times:144:Times:The  technical  difficulty  of  adopting  silvopastoral  practices  is  the  other  main  potential  
14:549:50228:14:13:71:543:558:144:Times:144:Times:obstacle  to  household  participation.  To  test  the  importance  of  this  factor,  the  project  provided  
14:550:50339:13:14:71:545:545:144:Times:144:Times:technical  assistance  (TA)  to  a  randomly-selected  subset  of  PES  recipients.  The  results  were  
14:551:50444:14:14:71:544:531:144:Times:144:Times:strikingly  different  across  the  two  sites.  In  Matiguás-Río  Blanco,  access  to  the  project’s  TA  
14:552:50552:14:14:71:545:517:144:Times:144:Times:wasn’t  significant  under  any  formulation,  while  in  Quindío  it  was  significant  under  every  
14:553:50655:14:14:71:545:503:144:Times:144:Times:formulation.  The  explanation  for  the  lack  of  significance  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  is  probably  
14:554:50761:14:13:71:543:489:144:Times:144:Times:twofold:  first,  as  noted  above,  silvopastoral  practices  were  already  relatively  well  known  in  the  
14:555:50873:13:14:71:543:476:144:Times:144:Times:area prior to the project. Second, the very small size of the site probably made it much easier for 
14:556:50973:14:14:71:543:462:144:Times:144:Times:households  who  did  not  receive  TA  directly  to  learn  from  their  neighbors  who  did.  In  contrast,  
14:557:51084:14:14:71:544:448:144:Times:144:Times:silvopastoral  practices  were  practically  unknown  in  Quindío  prior  to  the  project,  and  the  larger  
14:558:51195:14:14:71:545:434:144:Times:144:Times:spatial  size  of  the  site  (and,  hence,  the  much  lower  density  of  recipients  in  the  overall  farm  
14:559:51307:14:19:71:341:420:144:Times:144:Times:population) made TA play a much more important role. 
14:560:51360:19:14:107:545:401:144:Times:144:Times:The  strongest  result  in  the  Quindío  models  is  that  being  a  PES  recipient  has  a  large  
14:561:51461:14:14:71:543:387:144:Times:144:Times:positive impact on the extent of adoption of silvopastoral measures, irrespective of how adoption 
14:562:51559:14:14:71:545:373:144:Times:144:Times:is  measured.  This  confirms  the  observed  sharp  contrast  in  land  use  change  between  PES  
14:563:51659:14:14:71:539:359:144:Times:144:Times:recipients  and  control  group  measures,  and  indicates  that  the  contrast  was  not  due  to  self-
14:564:51764:14:13:71:544:345:144:Times:144:Times:selection  of  strongly  motivated  land  users  into  the  scheme  or  to  differences  in  characteristics  
14:565:51874:13:14:71:543:332:144:Times:144:Times:across  groups.  The  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  results  also  show  a  strong  positive  impact  of  being  a  
14:566:51982:14:14:71:543:318:144:Times:144:Times:PES recipient, but given the concerns over the quality of the control group we cannot treat this 
14:567:52079:14:20:71:222:304:144:Times:144:Times:result as more than suggestive. 
14:568:52110:20:13:107:544:284:144:Times:144:Times:As  poverty  is  multidimensional,  we  also  include  dummies  for  the  income  groups,  with  
14:569:52207:13:14:71:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:the best-off income group omitted, to capture other aspects of poverty that may not be captured 
14:570:52303:14:14:71:545:257:144:Times:144:Times:by  the  previous  variables.  These  dummies  show  some  interesting  patterns  at  both  sites.  In  
14:571:52407:14:14:71:548:243:144:Times:144:Times:Matiguás-Río   Blanco,   poor   (but   not   extremely   poor)   households   have   higher   levels   of   
14:572:52515:14:14:71:543:229:144:Times:144:Times:participation than non-poor households in every model. Extremely poor households, on the other 
14:573:52610:14:13:71:543:215:144:Times:144:Times:hand, have lower levels of participation than non-poor households in terms of area converted and 
14:574:52707:13:14:71:543:202:144:Times:144:Times:in most ESI models. None of these differences is statistically significant, however. These results 
14:575:52806:14:14:71:544:188:144:Times:144:Times:confirm  the  patterns  seen  in  Table  5.  In  Quindío,  both  the  low  income  and  the  middle  income  
14:576:52915:14:14:71:542:174:144:Times:144:Times:group dummies have a mix of positive and negative coefficients, but except in one case the effect 
14:577:53013:14:14:71:545:160:144:Times:144:Times:isn’t  statistically  significant.  This  suggests  that  income  level  has  relatively  little  impact  on  
14:578:53123:14:13:71:544:146:144:Times:144:Times:participation  that  isn’t  already  captured  by  other  variables  (such  as  farm  size)  which  may  be  
14:579:53232:13:14:71:543:133:144:Times:144:Times:correlated with poverty. The only significant impact is that middle income households convert a 
14:580:53328:14:14:71:543:119:144:Times:144:Times:lower share of their farm than high income households. This may well be due to that group using 
14:581:53424:14:14:71:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:a portion of their farm for other productive activities – indeed, low income households actually 
14:582:53521:14:14:71:546:91:144:Times:144:Times:expanded  the  area  under  shade-grown  coffee  to  a  small  extent,  and  replaced  part  of  their  
14:583:53625:14:0:71:345:77:144:Times:144:Times:monoculture fruit crop areas with diversified fruit crops. 
15:584:53688:0:19:71:154:708:144:Times:144:Times:4. Conclusions 
15:585:53702:19:14:107:544:689:144:Times:144:Times:Can  poorer  households  participate  in  PES  scheme?  The  experience  of  the  Silvopastoral  
15:586:53799:14:14:71:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:Project  in  both  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  and  Quindío  indicates  that  they  can.  Not  only  did  poorer  
15:587:53907:14:14:71:545:661:144:Times:144:Times:households  participate  quite  extensively,  but  by  some  measures  they  participated  to  a  greater  
15:588:54014:14:14:71:544:647:144:Times:144:Times:extent  than  better-off  households  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco.  Participation  by  poorer  households  
15:589:54118:14:13:71:543:633:144:Times:144:Times:was  somewhat  lower  in  Quindío,  but  the  differences  were  not  statistically  significant.  Even  the  
15:590:54228:13:14:71:546:620:144:Times:144:Times:poorest  households  at  both  sites  participated  at  high  rates  in  the  project.  And  again  their  
15:591:54335:14:14:71:545:606:144:Times:144:Times:participation  was  not  limited  solely  to  the  simpler  and  cheaper  practices.  These  results  are  
15:592:54442:14:14:71:542:592:144:Times:144:Times:particularly strong in that the Silvopastoral Project imposes much greater burdens on participants 
15:593:54541:14:14:71:545:578:144:Times:144:Times:than  most  PES  schemes.  They  bode  well  for  the  prospects  of  poor  households  being  able  to  
15:594:54646:14:13:71:546:564:144:Times:144:Times:participate  in  PES  schemes  financed  from  Reduced  Emissions  for  Deforestation  or  Forest  
15:595:54745:13:14:71:544:551:144:Times:144:Times:Degradation  (REDD)  payments,  as  these  schemes  are  likely  to  focus  on  much  simpler  and  less  
15:596:54851:14:20:71:251:537:144:Times:144:Times:costly forest conservation measures.  
15:597:54889:20:14:107:543:517:144:Times:144:Times:This  conclusion  obviously  needs  to be approached with some caution. It is possible that 
15:598:54981:14:14:71:544:503:144:Times:144:Times:the  high  levels  of  participation  by  poorer  households  are  due  to  self-selection  bias:  only  those  
15:599:55093:14:13:71:545:489:144:Times:144:Times:households  able  to  participate  may  have  joined.  We  believe  this  is  unlikely,  for  two  reasons.  
15:600:55202:13:14:71:543:476:144:Times:144:Times:First, the project offered a very wide range of participation options, including many that are not 
15:601:55301:14:14:71:545:462:144:Times:144:Times:very  onerous,  even  for  poorer  households.  Indeed,  households  could  in  principle  have  done  
15:602:55404:14:14:71:544:448:144:Times:144:Times:absolutely  nothing;  they  would  then  have  received  the  baseline  payment  but  would  not  have  
15:603:55508:14:14:71:540:434:144:Times:144:Times:received  any  payment  beyond  that.  In  fact,  no  household  chose  that  route.  Second,  many  non-
15:604:55613:14:13:71:544:420:144:Times:144:Times:participating  households  at  both  sites  wanted  to  participate  as  well,  but  were  prevented  from  
15:605:55721:13:14:71:544:407:144:Times:144:Times:doing so by the project’s own limits on the number it could accept. But even if there were some 
15:606:55817:14:14:71:543:393:144:Times:144:Times:self-selection at play, it is significant that in a poor area such as Matiguás-Río Blanco there are 
15:607:55917:14:14:71:542:379:144:Times:144:Times:many poor households—including many extremely poor households—that are able to participate 
15:608:56008:14:14:71:546:365:144:Times:144:Times:in  a  PES  schemes,  and  even  to  undertake  expensive  and  technically  challenging  land  use  
15:609:56109:14:19:71:123:351:144:Times:144:Times:practices.  
15:610:56121:19:14:107:547:332:144:Times:144:Times:Nevertheless,  one  should  not  jump  to  the  sanguine  conclusion  that  all  poor  farm  
15:611:56214:14:14:71:543:318:144:Times:144:Times:households everywhere will always be able to participate in PES schemes.15 Both PES schemes 
15:612:56306:14:14:72:545:304:144:Times:144:Times:and  local  conditions  differ  from  case  to  case,  and  there  may  well  be  cases  where  otherwise  
15:613:56413:14:13:72:543:290:144:Times:144:Times:eligible poor households may find it difficult or impossible to participate. Indeed, results at both 
15:614:56514:13:14:72:544:277:144:Times:144:Times:sites show that the poorest households – although by no means shut out – do appear to have had 
15:615:56609:14:20:72:425:263:144:Times:144:Times:greater difficulty in participating as intensively as better-off households.  
15:616:56687:20:14:108:548:243:144:Times:144:Times:Our   detailed   results   help   us   identify   several   specific   factors   that   tend   to   affect   
15:617:56796:14:14:72:543:229:144:Times:144:Times:participation. This information can help design PES schemes to reduce potential obstacles to the 
15:618:56893:14:13:72:544:215:144:Times:144:Times:participation of poorer households. There is little that a PES scheme can do about poorer farms 
15:619:56989:13:14:72:547:202:144:Times:144:Times:being  less  accessible,  but  it  can  do  something  about  financing  constraints  and  technical  
15:620:57091:14:20:72:126:188:144:Times:144:Times:difficulty.  
15:621:57104:20:14:108:547:168:144:Times:144:Times:The   significance   of   credit   underlines   an   important   potential   constraint   for   poorer   
15:622:57209:14:14:72:544:154:144:Times:144:Times:households.  This  constraint  will  not  always  be  present  in  PES  schemes.  When  schemes  require  
15:623:57315:14:13:72:546:140:144:Times:144:Times:maintaining  existing  practices—as  in  the  majority  of  contracts  in  Costa  Rica’s  scheme,  for  
15:624:57419:13:16:72:545:127:144:Times:144:Times:example,  and  as  in  prospective  REDD-financed  schemes—there  are  few  or  no  investment  
15:625:57515:16:8:72:219:111:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
15:626:57563:8:16:72:545:103:42:Times:100:Times:15      It  is  also  important  to  recall  that  this  case  study  does  not  speak  to  possible  differences  in  eligibility  to  
15:627:57699:16:11:89:543:87:100:Times:100:Times:participate,  due  to  spatial  considerations  or  tenure  problems.  Pagiola  and  Colom  (2006)  find  that  the  areas  in  
15:628:57827:11:0:89:504:76:100:Times:100:Times:Guatemala that are important for the provision of water services do not always have high poverty rates. 
16:629:57934:0:13:71:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:requirements.16 Financing constraints may be important when land use changes are required for 
16:630:58028:13:14:71:544:695:144:Times:144:Times:participation,  however,  as  in  Costa  Rica’s  Reforestation  or  Agroforestry  contracts.  Our  results  
16:631:58136:14:14:71:545:681:144:Times:144:Times:suggest  that  this  constraint  is  not  absolute,  as  it  is  sometimes  made  out  to  be.  Even  poor  
16:632:58244:14:14:71:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:households  such  as  those  in  Matiguás-Río  Blanco  often  have  a  variety  of  ways  to  finance  
16:633:58347:14:14:71:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:profitable  investments.  Nevertheless,  it  is  likely  that  poorer  households  will  have  fewer  such  
16:634:58455:14:13:71:544:639:144:Times:144:Times:alternatives:  fewer  savings,  fewer  assets  that  might  be  sold,  worse  access  to  credit.  Providing  
16:635:58565:13:14:71:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:some initial financing (such as the baseline payment made by the Silvopastoral Project) may be 
16:636:58660:14:20:71:538:612:144:Times:64:Times:desirable for PES schemes that involve initial investments in areas with many poor households.17
16:637:58756:20:14:108:543:592:144:Times:144:Times:Our results also highlight the need to understand whether TA may be required. The need 
16:638:58843:14:14:72:543:578:144:Times:144:Times:for TA appears to be linked more with prior experience than with poverty, however. When PES 
16:639:58935:14:13:72:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:schemes  require  participants  to  adopt  relatively  well  known  practices,  TA  may  be  of  minor  
16:640:59039:13:14:71:545:551:144:Times:144:Times:importance.  Conversely,  when  participation  requires  adoption  of  practices  that  are  not  widely  
16:641:59145:14:20:71:467:537:144:Times:144:Times:used, even relatively well off households such as those in Quindío may need TA.  
16:642:59226:20:14:108:547:517:144:Times:144:Times:The   availability   of   multiple   options   in   the   Silvopastoral   Project   may   well   have   
16:643:59330:14:14:72:544:503:144:Times:144:Times:contributed  to  high  participation  by  poorer  households,  as  they  were  able  to  choose  the  options  
16:644:59441:14:13:72:544:489:144:Times:144:Times:that work best for them, in light of their particular constraints. When there are multiple ways of 
16:645:59540:13:14:72:544:476:144:Times:144:Times:providing  a  service  (or  different  levels  of  a  service),  it  makes  sense  to  offer  multiple  ways  in  
16:646:59654:14:14:72:545:462:144:Times:144:Times:which  households  can  participate,  as  long  as  transaction  costs  do  not  increase  unduly.  It  is  
16:647:59762:14:14:72:543:448:144:Times:144:Times:interesting to note, however, that at our sites the poorest households did not choose the cheaper 
16:648:59860:14:14:72:545:434:144:Times:144:Times:and  easier  land  uses  –  in  fact,  it  was  the  better  off  households  that  did  so  in  Matiguás-Río  
16:649:59971:14:19:72:366:420:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco, and the middle income group that did so in Quindío. 
16:650:60031:19:14:108:544:401:144:Times:144:Times:In general, transaction costs are likely to be a bigger threat to the participation of poorer 
16:651:60125:14:14:71:545:387:144:Times:144:Times:households  in  PES  schemes  then  their  own  ability  to  participate  (Pagiola  et  al.,  2005).  Our  
16:652:60232:14:14:71:544:373:144:Times:144:Times:results  illustrate  this.  As  can  be  seen  in  Table  6,  low  income  households  in  Quindío  converted  
16:653:60343:14:14:71:543:359:144:Times:144:Times:40% of their farms, on average, and increased their ESI score by about 55%. These participation 
16:654:60439:14:13:71:544:345:144:Times:144:Times:rates are not far below those of high income households, who converted 55% of their farms and 
16:655:60533:13:14:71:543:332:144:Times:144:Times:increased their ESI score by 67%. But from the perspective of the service buyer, what matters is 
16:656:60630:14:14:71:544:318:144:Times:144:Times:the  total  absolute  increase  in  environmental  service  generation  (whether  proxied  by  area,  as  is  
16:657:60740:14:14:71:544:304:144:Times:144:Times:commonly  the  case,  or  by  more  sophisticated  measures  such  as  the  ESI),  and  the  unit  cost  of  
16:658:60849:14:13:71:543:290:144:Times:144:Times:achieving  it.  The  cost,  in  turn,  has two components: the cost of the payment, which is identical 
16:659:60952:13:14:71:543:277:144:Times:144:Times:for a given increase in ESI for all households, and the transaction cost of contracting with each 
16:660:61050:14:14:72:543:263:144:Times:144:Times:household. This second cost is likely to be largely fixed per household, irrespective of farm size. 
16:661:61150:14:14:71:543:249:144:Times:144:Times:Thus high income households converted a total of 342ha and achieved a total increase in ESI of 
16:662:61245:14:14:71:543:235:144:Times:144:Times:259 points. At first glance, the results for low income households appear similar: they converted 
16:663:61343:14:13:71:543:221:144:Times:144:Times:a total of 283ha and achieved a total increase in ESI of 242 points. The number of low income 
16:664:61437:13:14:71:543:208:144:Times:144:Times:households is much larger, however, so on a per contract basis, the comparison is less favorable: 
16:665:61535:14:14:71:543:194:144:Times:144:Times:low income households converted 9.4ha and increased ESI by 8.1 points per contract, while high 
16:666:61630:14:14:72:543:180:144:Times:144:Times:income households converted 34.2ha and increased ESI by 25.9 points per contract. It takes more 
16:667:61726:14:14:72:544:166:144:Times:144:Times:than  three  contracts  with  low  income  households,  therefore,  to  achieve  the  same  results  as  a  
16:668:61834:14:16:72:545:152:144:Times:144:Times:single  contract  with  a  high  income  household.  Very  similar  relationships  can  be  seen  in  the  
16:669:61941:16:8:72:219:136:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
16:670:61989:8:16:72:543:128:42:Times:100:Times:16      Even  forest  conservation  may  require  out-of-pocket  expenditures  by  participating  households,  for  example  to  
16:671:62118:16:11:90:543:112:100:Times:100:Times:fence off forests receiving conservation contracts or undertake measures to prevent forest fires. These costs are 
16:672:62232:11:9:90:448:101:100:Times:100:Times:much lower, however, than those that they would face if land use changes were required. 
16:673:62320:9:16:72:544:92:42:Times:100:Times:17      Costa  Rica  frontloads  payments  under  its  timber  plantation  contract  for  this  reason.  Frontloaded  payments,  
16:674:62449:16:0:90:428:76:100:Times:100:Times:however, introduce other problems, as they reduce the conditionality of the scheme. 
17:675:62537:0:13:71:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Matiguás-Río Blanco case (Table 5). Thus, the larger the transaction costs, the more attractive it 
17:676:62636:13:14:71:545:695:144:Times:144:Times:will  be  for  PES  schemes  to  focus  on  large  land  holdings.  As  farm  size  tends  to  be  highly  
17:677:62743:14:14:71:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:correlated with income, in practice this will mean focusing on better-off households. This is not a 
17:678:62843:14:14:71:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:purely  hypothetical  concern:  In  Ecuador,  the  PROFAFOR  scheme  has  decided  to  adopt  a  50ha  
17:679:62946:14:14:71:546:653:144:Times:144:Times:minimum  size  for  the  forest  plantations  from  which  it  buys  carbon  sequestration  services  
17:680:63048:14:19:71:206:639:144:Times:144:Times:(Wunder and Albán, 2008). 
17:681:63074:19:14:107:548:620:144:Times:144:Times:Keeping   transaction   costs   low—in   addition   to   being   desirable   in   itself—is   thus   
17:682:63175:14:14:71:544:606:144:Times:144:Times:imperative  if  poorer  households  are  not  be  shut  out  of  many  PES  schemes.18  But  the  smaller  
17:683:63282:14:14:71:544:592:144:Times:144:Times:farm  size  of  many  poor  households  means  they  will  always  have  relatively  higher  transactions  
17:684:63389:14:14:71:544:578:144:Times:144:Times:costs.  It  is  thus  important  to  attempt  to  devise  mechanisms  to  overcome  them.  Costa  Rica,  for  
17:685:63499:14:13:71:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:example, experimented with collective contracting, under which groups of small farmers joined 
17:686:63593:13:14:71:543:551:144:Times:144:Times:the country’s PES scheme collectively rather than individually, thus spreading transaction costs 
17:687:63690:14:14:71:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:over  a  large  group.  This  approach  ran  into  problems,  however,  as  non-compliance  by  a  single  
17:688:63797:14:14:71:544:523:144:Times:144:Times:group  member  resulted  in  payments  being  halted  to  all  members.  The  approach  has  thus  been  
17:689:63902:14:14:71:544:509:144:Times:144:Times:revised  to  process  the  applications  of  such  groups  together,  but  then  issue  individual  contracts;  
17:690:64014:14:13:72:545:495:144:Times:144:Times:this  avoids  the  partial  compliance  problem,  but  has  much  smaller  savings  in  transaction  costs  
17:691:64122:13:14:72:539:482:144:Times:144:Times:(Pagiola, 2008). This is clearly an area in which more work—and some imaginative solutions—
17:692:64213:14:14:71:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:will be necessary. This is also an area in which development aid could be used to leverage PES 
17:693:64308:14:14:71:544:454:144:Times:144:Times:schemes  by  providing  support  to  the  participation  of  poorer  households,  and  in  particular  by  
17:694:64415:14:14:71:326:440:144:Times:144:Times:underwriting some of the transaction costs involved.

17:697:64516:7:16:72:543:115:42:Times:100:Times:18    The Silvopastoral Project as presently conducted is a poor example of this, as it has relatively high monitoring 
17:698:64635:16:12:90:543:99:100:Times:100:Times:costs dictated in part by its pilot nature and in part by the need to distinguish small differences in land use so as 
17:699:64753:12:11:90:544:87:100:Times:100:Times:to  compute  ESI  scores.  Work  is  underway  under  the  project  to  determine  the  nature  of  the  tradeoff  between  
17:700:64877:11:0:90:236:76:100:Times:100:Times:monitoring costs and effectiveness.  
18:701:64917:0:19:71:197:696:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix: Data sources 
18:702:64940:19:14:107:544:677:144:Times:144:Times:To  examine  participation  decisions,  we  used  three  data  sets.  The  first  is  the  baseline  
18:703:65041:14:14:71:543:663:144:Times:144:Times:survey  conducted  in  October-November  2002,  during  project  preparation.  This  survey  included  
18:704:65144:14:14:71:544:649:144:Times:144:Times:very  detailed  information  on  household  characteristics.  A  second  survey  of  participants  was  
18:705:65248:14:14:71:546:635:144:Times:144:Times:conducted  in  March-May  2004,  after  the  first  year  of  project  implementation.  This  survey  
18:706:65350:14:13:71:547:621:144:Times:144:Times:collected   information   on   land   use  changes  that  occurred  in  the  intervening  period.  The  
18:707:65454:13:20:71:423:608:144:Times:144:Times:questionnaires for the surveys are available from the authors on request.  
18:708:65529:20:14:107:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:Information  from  these  two  surveys  was  complemented  with  detailed  land  use  data  for  
18:709:65626:14:14:71:543:574:144:Times:144:Times:each farm, derived from maps prepared annually by the project between 2003 and 2007 for each 
18:710:65719:14:14:71:546:560:144:Times:144:Times:farm  using  remote  sensing  imagery.  Quickbird  imagery  with  a  61cm  resolution  was  used,  
18:711:65818:14:13:71:544:546:144:Times:144:Times:providing  very  high  levels  of  detail.  Land  use  maps  for  each  farm  derived  from  these  images  
18:712:65926:13:14:71:545:533:144:Times:144:Times:were  then  extensively  ground-truthed  to  match  each  plot  to  one  of  the  28  different  land  uses  
18:713:66035:14:20:71:502:519:144:Times:144:Times:recognized by the project. These maps provide accurate and consistent measures of area.  
18:714:66124:20:14:107:544:499:144:Times:144:Times:Both  the  baseline  and  follow-up  surveys  included  a  control  group,  as  does  the  mapping  
18:715:66224:14:14:71:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:dataset.  The  main  intended  purpose  of  this  group  was  to  attempt  to  distinguish  project-induced  
18:716:66333:14:13:71:544:471:144:Times:144:Times:land  use  changes  from  changes  induced  by  other  factors  (Ferraro  and  Pattanayak,  2006).  In  an  
18:717:66441:13:14:71:545:458:144:Times:144:Times:earlier  paper  (Pagiola  et  al.,  2008),  we  found  that  control  group  members  in  Matiguás-Río  
18:718:66545:14:14:71:544:444:144:Times:144:Times:Blanco  differed  from  PES  recipients  in  many  important  characteristics  (such  as  income,  farm  
18:719:66650:14:14:71:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:size, or herd size), as so we decided that using the control group would not be useful. We retain 
18:720:66748:14:14:71:543:416:144:Times:144:Times:the Matiguás-Río Blanco control group here to ease comparability with the Quindío analysis, but 
18:721:66844:14:13:71:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:caution  against  placing  much  significance  in  differences  between  the  control  group  and  PES  
18:722:66948:13:20:71:124:389:144:Times:144:Times:recipients.
