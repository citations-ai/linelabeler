2:31:1598:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Publicly funded exam schools educate many of the world's most talented students. These schools typically
2:32:1702:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:contain higher achieving peers, more rigorous instruction, and additional resources compared to regular
2:33:1805:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:public schools. This paper uses a sharp discontinuity in the admissions process at three prominent
2:34:1903:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:exam schools in New York City to provide the first causal estimate of the impact of attending an exam
2:35:2004:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:school in the United States on longer term academic outcomes. Attending an exam school increases
2:36:2100:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:the rigor of high school courses taken and the probability that a student graduates with an advanced
2:37:2200:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:high school degree. Surprisingly, however, attending an exam school has little impact on Scholastic
2:38:2299:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:Aptitude Test scores, college enrollment, or college graduation -- casting doubt on their ultimate long

3:53:2673:0:32:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1    Introduction
3:54:2690:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Public exam schools are prominent around the world.  Exam schools make up over half of U.S. News
3:55:2786:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and World Report’s top 100 American high schools, and 20 out of the 21 high schools designated
3:56:2880:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as the “public elite” by Newsweek.1Governments in China, Malaysia, Romania, Singapore, and
3:57:2970:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Turkey allocate students to secondary schools based almost entirely on admissions entrance exams.
3:58:3067:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Gifted  students  in  Australia,  Japan,  Korea,  Mexico  City,  and  the  United  Kingdom  compete  for
3:59:3171:20:21:72:280:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:limited spots in selective secondary schools.
3:60:3216:21:20:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To the extent that students benefit from high-achieving peers, more advanced coursework, or
3:61:3307:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:higher expectations, exam schools are likely to increase student achievement.  Indeed, many argue
3:62:3404:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the success of exam school alumni isprima facieevidence of their success in educating students.
3:63:3504:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Robert Fogel (Stuyvesant), Claudia Goldin (Bronx Science), and George Wald (Brooklyn Tech) are
3:64:3598:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:part of a long list of prominent exam school alumni that include numerous U.S. Representatives,
3:65:3693:20:20:72:531:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Olympic Medalists, Grammy and Oscar nominees, Pulitzer Prize winners, and Nobel Laureates.
3:66:3783:20:21:88:539:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Conversely, exam school alumni may be successful simply because they were highly gifted and
3:67:3874:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:motivated teenagers who would have prospered in any school.  Social interactions in exam schools
3:68:3970:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:could  be  negative,  especially  for  students  who  are  lower  in  the  ability  distribution  with  a  com-
3:69:4081:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parative advantage in non-academic activities (Cicala, Fryer, and Spenkuch 2011).  Lower relative
3:70:4178:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ability may also make students less competitive in college admissions, even if their absolute level of
3:71:4280:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:achievement is unchanged (Attewell 2001).  In these cases, exam school students might be better
3:72:4375:20:21:72:482:312:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:served by a less competitive environment or greater heterogeneity among their peers.2
3:73:4460:21:20:88:539:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Gaining  a  better  understanding  of  the  impact  of  attending  an  exam  school  on  educational
3:74:4560:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attainment and achievement is of significant importance for education policy, and the subject of
3:75:4656:20:21:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this paper.  We provide the first causal estimate of the impact of attending an exam high school
3:76:4752:21:20:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the United States on later outcomes, using data from three of the most prominent exam high
3:77:4845:20:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schools in the United States - Brooklyn Technical High School, the Bronx High School of Science,
3:78:4941:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Stuyvesant High School.  Our identification strategy exploits the fact that admission into New
3:79:5039:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:York City’s exam high schools is a discontinuous function of an individual’s admissions test score.
3:80:5138:20:30:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As  a  result,  there  exist  cutoff  points  around  which  very  similar  applicants  attend  different  high
3:81:5249:30:15:87:539:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1U.S.NewsandWorldReport2010highschoolrankingsareavailableat

3:84:5535:7:15:87:539:86:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2Students  at  Stuyvesant,  one  of  the  most  prominent  exam  schools  in  the  United  States,  describe  a  hyper-
3:85:5654:15:0:72:371:71:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:competitive atmosphere that left many of them disillusioned (Klein 2007).
4:86:5728:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schools.  The crux of our identification strategy is to compare the average outcomes of individuals
4:87:5827:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:just above and below these cutoffs.  Intuitively, we attribute any discontinuous relationship between
4:88:5928:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:average outcomes and admissions test scores at these cutoffs to the causal impact of attending that
4:89:6027:20:21:72:104:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school.
4:90:6034:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  find  that  attending  an  exam  school  increases  the  likelihood  that  a  student  takes  more
4:91:6136:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rigorous high school coursework and the probability that a student graduates with a more advanced
4:92:6233:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high school diploma.  Surprisingly, however, there is little impact of attending an exam school on
4:93:6331:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) reading and writing scores, and, at best, a modest positive impact
4:94:6428:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on SAT math scores.  Moreover,  the impact of exam school attendance on college enrollment or
4:95:6521:20:21:72:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:graduation is,  if anything,negative.  Students just eligible for Brooklyn Tech are 2.3 percentage
4:96:6619:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points  less  likely  to  graduate  from  a  four  year  college.   Students  eligible  for  Bronx  Science  and
4:97:6731:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Stuyvesant are neither more or less likely to graduate – the 95 percent confidence interval rules
4:98:6828:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:out  impacts  larger  than  2.8  percentage  points  for  Bronx  Science  and  2.5  percentage  points  for
4:99:6935:21:20:72:127:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Stuyvesant.
4:100:6946:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are three important caveats to our analysis.  First, we estimate the benefit of attending
4:101:7041:20:21:72:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an exam school for themarginalstudent admitted to each exam school.  It is plausible that the
4:102:7134:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of attending an exam school is different for other parts of the distribution.  To partially
4:103:7232:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:address  this  issue,  we  estimate  the  effect  of  exam  school  eligibility  separately  for  students  with
4:104:7344:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high  and  low  state  test  scores  in  8th  grade,  finding  no  statistically  significant  differences.   This
4:105:7458:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests  that  exam  schools  affect  both  high  and  low  ability  students  similarly,  but  our  results
4:106:7567:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should still be interpreted with this caveat in mind.  Second,  the counterfactual to attending an
4:107:7665:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exam school is in some cases attending a private high school or another exam school.  For example,
4:108:7763:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nearly 40 percent of students just ineligible for Stuyvesant attend Bronx Science, with another 20
4:109:7861:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent leaving the NYC public school system altogether.  Thus, our estimates may be less about
4:110:7956:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the impact of attending an exam school per se, than about the impact of attending a school with
4:111:8051:21:20:72:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:higher-achieving peers more generally.3Third, our set of outcomes is limited to various measures
4:112:8147:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of academic attainment and achievement.4To the extent that attending an exam school increases
4:113:8240:20:30:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:human or social capital in ways that are important for later outcomes, independent of SAT scores,
4:114:8337:30:15:87:539:130:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3Other school inputs such as teacher experience, teacher absences, and teacher salary do not differ systematically
4:115:8451:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:across exam schools, though, as a large body of literature points out, measurable inputs have little causal impact on
4:116:8568:11:7:72:216:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:student outcomes (Hanushek 1997).
4:117:8601:7:15:87:539:97:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4Our attempts to match our data to tax or social security records were not successful.  We also attempted to
4:118:8709:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:match our list of 163,000 exam school applicants who have graduated high school to entries in the Marquis “Who’s
4:119:8821:10:0:72:411:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Who” volumes - a measure of professional success - but there were only 32 matches.
5:120:8904:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college enrollment or graduation, then there is reason to believe that our conclusions are premature
5:121:9004:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the true impact of an elite exam school will only be understood with the passage of time (and
5:122:9101:20:20:72:180:668:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:more data collection).5

5:130:9805:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school  educational  system,  finding  is  that  students  with  access  to  higher  achieving  schools  and
5:131:9913:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tracks within schools score more highly on an end of high school exam.  Dustan (2010) exploits the
5:132:10011:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allocation mechanism to elite high schools in Mexico City to show that attending an elite schools
5:133:10108:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is associated with higher end-of-school test scores.  Clark (2007) employs a regression discontinuity

6:165:13006:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a specialized school in 2005, and Brooklyn Latin School was founded in 2006 to further expand the
6:166:13103:20:21:72:192:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:set of specialized schools.

7:192:15459:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of exam school applicants has increased from 14,173 in 1989 to 27,650 in 2008.  The last student
7:193:15555:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:admitted to Stuyvesant is typically ranked 914th, while the last student admitted to Bronx Science
7:194:15653:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Brooklyn Tech is typically ranked 2,367th and 4,412nd respectively.  The rank cutoff of the
7:195:15748:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:last student admitted to each school has also increased, as each school has expanded the number of
7:196:15846:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:available seats to accommodate the greater demand for seats.  The increased number of seats has
7:197:15941:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not been enough to fully offset the increase in demand, however, resulting in more stringent score

9:276:22711:20:0:72:153:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raise $12 million.
10:277:22730:0:32:72:260:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3    Conceptual Framework
10:278:22755:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are at least three theories for why the marginal student might benefit from exam schools.
10:279:22850:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:First, a well developed literature emphasizes the importance of peer groups (Coleman 1966), social
10:280:22948:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interactions (Case and Katz 1991, Cutler and Glaeser 1997) and network externalities (Borjas 1995,
10:281:23046:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Lazear 2001) are important in the formation of skill and values and the development of human and
10:282:23142:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:social  capital  (see  Sacerdote  (2011)  for  a  recent  review).   In  particular,  there  are  likely  to  be
10:283:23254:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fewer “bad apples” in exam schools that exert negative externalities on higher achieving students
10:284:23351:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Lazear 2001, Hoxby and Weingarth 2006, Carrell and Hoekstra 2011).  Second, if teachers teach
10:285:23445:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the  median student  in their classrooms,  exam  schools are  likely to  have more  academic rigor
10:286:23546:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Duflo,  Dupas,  Kremer,  forthcoming).   Third,  exam  schools  are  likely  to  have  more  resources
10:287:23649:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than traditional public schools.  Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and Brooklyn Tech are all conducting
10:288:23746:21:20:72:539:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:multimillion dollar capital campaigns to augment the resources each school receives from the city.
10:289:23844:20:20:88:539:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are also several theories that argue exam schools may be bad for the marginal student,
10:290:23936:20:21:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particularly for boys.  Peer interactions may be negative for the marginal student if they are lower in
10:291:24039:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the ability distribution, leading them to have a comparative advantage in non-academic activities
10:292:24136:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Cicala,  Fryer,  and  Spenkuch  2011).   The  marginal  student  is  also  likely  to  have  a  lower  class
10:293:24245:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rank  than  they  otherwise  would  have,  making  them  less  competitive  in  college  admissions  even
10:294:24350:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if their absolute level of achievement is unchanged (Attewell 2001).  Exam schools may also have
10:295:24446:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:no impact if other endogenous variables in the production of achievement (e.g., parental inputs or
10:296:24544:20:21:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time on homework) are substitutes for school quality or better peers.  For instance, parents whose
10:297:24642:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:children score above the admission threshold may invest less in their child’s education, provide less
10:298:24743:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:monitoring of their teachers, or simply be more trusting of the school with the education of their
10:299:24841:20:21:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:child.  Finally, it is also possible that exam school courses are taught too far above the level of the
10:300:24944:21:20:72:156:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal student.
10:301:24961:20:20:88:539:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It  is  impossible  to  identify  the  separate  impact  of  each  of  these  potential  channels  with  the
10:302:25069:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data available here.  Instead, this paper’s goal is to produce credible estimates of the net impact
10:303:25168:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of attending an exam high school on a series of important educational outcomes.  The resulting
10:304:25262:20:0:72:506:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduced form estimates will likely reflect a number of the channels specified in this section.

11:312:25963:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:English scale scores, school preferences, and whether each student was eligible at each of the exam

11:314:26070:20:20:88:539:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To explore the impact of exam school attendance on college outcomes, we match the admissions
11:315:26162:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:records to information on college attendance from the NSC, a non-profit organization that maintains
11:316:26261:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:enrollment information for 92 percent of colleges nationwide.  The NSC data contain information
11:317:26356:20:20:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on enrollment spells for all covered colleges that a student attended, though not grades or course
11:318:26454:20:21:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:work.   The  admissions  data  were  matched  to  the  NSC  database  by  NSC  employees  using  each
11:319:26555:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:student’s full name, date of birth and high school graduation date, which the NSC used to match
11:320:26650:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to its database.  4 percent of records from our sample that were blocked by the student or student’s
11:321:26750:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school.  Students eligible for an exam school are no more or less likely to have a record blocked than
11:322:26852:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other students, however.  Other than the blocked records, the NSC data is available for all cohorts
11:323:26951:20:20:72:468:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and students in the admissions data, regardless of eventual high school enrollment.
11:324:27034:20:21:88:539:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To provide a measure of college quality, we match the NSC records to data on college character-

11:330:27620:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:alumni donations.  We use midpoint SAT score in 2010 as our primary measure of college quality.
11:331:27715:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:When only ACT scores are available, we convert them to SAT scores using the ACT’s official score

11:333:27910:20:21:72:499:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are identical if we only use the first 4, 5, or 6 years after a student graduates high school.

12:341:28633:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data on race is available for cohorts after 2008 for students who attended a public middle school,
12:342:28731:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:while 8th grade test scores are available for cohorts after 2002 in public schools.  These data form
12:343:28831:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the basis of our specification tests in Section 5.  Complete Regents test score records are available
12:344:28932:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the 2005 through 2009 cohorts,  with incomplete records available for the 1998 through 2013
12:345:29027:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cohorts.   SAT  scores  are  available  for  the  2007  through  2010  cohorts,  while  graduation  data  is
12:346:29135:21:20:72:282:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:available for the 2002 through 2009 cohorts.
12:347:29179:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An important caveat is that the NYCDOE data only includes students who enroll in a public
12:348:29268:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high school for at least one year in NYC. Students who enroll in a private school or a public high
12:349:29366:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school in another district are not included.  If the most talented or motivated students who do not
12:350:29465:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:get accepted into an exam school are more likely to leave the NYC public system – and hence, not
12:351:29561:20:21:72:458:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be in our data set – then our estimates using the NYCDOE data may be biased.
12:352:29637:21:20:88:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 1 examines whether individuals who score above an exam school cutoff are more likely
12:353:29728:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to stay in the NYC public school system.  Those who score just below an exam school cutoff are
12:354:29822:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely to attend a private school or transfer to another district.  Students below the Brooklyn
12:355:29922:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Tech cutoff are 4.1 percentage points less likely to stay in the NYC system, while students below
12:356:30019:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Bronx Science and Stuyvesant cutoffs are 4.2 and 4.7 percentage points less likely to stay in a
12:357:30118:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:NYC public school.  The average match rate of the admissions test records to the NYCDOE data
12:358:30210:21:20:72:144:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is 78.5 percent.
12:359:30226:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The second panel of Figure 1 examines students enrolled in a public middle school only, a group
12:360:30321:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that may be less likely to enroll in a private high school if not eligible for an exam school. The match
12:361:30425:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate among this group is 88.6 percent.  However, while attrition among public school students is less
12:362:30526:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:severe, public school students below the Brooklyn Tech cutoff are still 2.9 percentage points less
12:363:30624:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to stay in the NYC system, while students below the Bronx Science and Stuyvesant cutoffs
12:364:30719:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are 2.3 and 1.3 percentage points less likely to stay in a NYC public school, with the Stuyvesant

12:366:30861:20:20:88:539:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 2 provides a partial test for the type of nonrandom attrition that would bias our high
12:367:30954:20:0:72:540:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school results by examining the characteristics of public middle school students leaving the NYC
13:368:31052:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:system.  We regress observable baseline characteristics on each school’s eligibility cutoff within the
13:369:31154:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:set of students who stay in NYC. If the characteristics of those who stay in the NYC public school
13:370:31252:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:system change discontinuously at an eligibly cutoff, this is evidence of nonrandom attrition.  We
13:371:31349:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:limit the sample in Figure 2 to students who were previously enrolled in a public middle school, as
13:372:31448:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these are the only students for whom we have baseline results, and they are less likely to attrit in
13:373:31548:20:20:72:401:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the first place.  All high school results will be from this same sample.
13:374:31620:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is no clear pattern of nonrandom attrition into the NYCDOE data.  In particular, public

13:376:31807:20:20:72:345:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:math and English exams compared to students who stay.
13:377:31860:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As  a  second  test  of  nonrandom  attrition,  we  estimate  our  main  results  for  college  outcomes

13:380:32154:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample is the same as in the full sample of all exam school applicants.  Taken together with our
13:381:32250:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results from Figure 2, this suggests that, at least among public middle school students, our high
13:382:32347:20:20:72:326:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school results are not biased by nonrandom attrition.
13:383:32400:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Summary statistics for each exam school are displayed in Table 3.  We include all of the available

13:385:32601:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year, the most recent available.  Students at exam schools are more likely to be white or Asian than
13:386:32701:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the typical student in NYC, less likely to be black or Hispanic, and less likely to be eligible for free

13:388:32913:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than the typical NYC student on the state math and English exam in 8th grade, while students at

13:394:33458:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schools.  93.0 percent of Stuyvesant students graduate from high school, compared to 53.7 percent
13:395:33555:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of students in NYC as a whole.  91.1 and 87.1 percent of Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech graduate
13:396:33652:21:20:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from high school.  Exam school students are also far more likely to receive a Regents or Advanced

14:422:35979:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have somewhat lower student to teacher and student to staff ratios than traditional public schools

15:435:36901:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important unobserved determinants of later outcomes, such estimates may be biased.  In particular,
15:436:36999:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it is plausible that people who select into specialized high schools had different academic skills and
15:437:37101:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:motivation before they enrolled.  Since exam school enrollment may be a function of ability, this
15:438:37198:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can lead to a bias in the direct estimation of  (1) using OLS. The key intuition of our approach is
15:439:37297:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that this bias can be overcome if the distribution of unobserved characteristics of individuals who
15:440:37396:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:just barely eligible for a school is the same as the distribution among those who were just barely

15:447:37950:21:20:71:539:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distribution  of  unobservable  determinants  of  future  outcomesεiis  by  assumption  continuous  at
15:448:38052:20:20:71:539:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each cutoff, the coefficientα1is identified.  Intuitively, any discontinuous relation between future
15:449:38152:20:21:71:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes  and  the  SHSAT  score  at  the  cutoff  can  be  attributed  to  the  causal  impact  of  school
15:450:38259:21:20:71:373:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:enrollment under the identification assumption in equation (2).
15:451:38322:20:20:88:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We estimate the reduced form impact of scoring just above the eligibility cutoff for each school
15:452:38418:20:21:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separately  using  standard  methods  for  regression  discontinuity  analysis  (e.g.   Lee  and  Lemiuex
15:453:38523:21:20:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2010).  First, we restrict the data to scores within 0.25 standard deviations around each school’s
15:454:38621:20:20:71:539:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cutoffs.  This is the largest bandwidth that never includes another school’s eligibility cutoff.  Rule
15:455:38723:20:21:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of thumb and cross validation selection procedures suggest somewhat larger bandwidths of 0.35 to
15:456:38819:21:20:71:539:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:0.75 standard deviations (see Appendix Table 7).  This somewhat smaller bandwidth includes only
15:457:38914:20:20:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the observations in the immediate neighborhood of the cutoffs,  but at the cost of including less
15:458:39011:20:21:71:260:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information, which can lessen precision.
15:459:39051:21:20:88:539:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, within our bandwidth, we estimate the following reduced form model of outcomes for
15:460:39141:20:37:71:128:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each school:
15:461:39153:37:36:77:540:113:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:yi=π0+π1(scorei≥c∗s) +π2(scorei≥c∗s)×(scorei−cs) +π3(scorei−cs) +π4Xi+πt+εi(3)
15:462:39231:36:0:72:539:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Whereyiis  a  future  outcome  such  as  college  enrollment  or  graduation,  and  (scorei≥c∗s)  is  an
16:463:39337:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indicator that the student scored at or above the eligibility cutoff.  We include separate score trend
16:464:39439:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:terms above and below the eligibility cutoff.  We also control for gender, whether a student attended
16:465:39540:20:20:72:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a private or public middle school, and the year of high school entryt.  To address potential concerns
16:466:39641:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:about discreteness in the SHSAT score we cluster our standard errors at the SHSAT score level
16:467:39734:21:20:72:174:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Card and Lee 2008).
16:468:39754:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The identified parameterπ1measure the average reduced form treatment effect of scoring just
16:469:39845:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:above the cutoff for each school.  This is the causal impact of being eligible for an exam school.  It
16:470:39947:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is important to note that the counterfactual to attending an exam school in many cases is a private
16:471:40046:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school or other exam school.  Take,  for example,  the eligibility cutoff for Stuyvesant.  Nearly 40
16:472:40146:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent of students  just ineligible for Stuyvesant graduate from Bronx Science,  with another  20
16:473:40244:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent leaving the NYC public school system,  likely to attend a private school.  The exception
16:474:40340:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to this is Brooklyn Tech, where students below the eligibility cutoff are not eligible for any of the
16:475:40441:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exam schools and must choose between a traditional public school in NYC or a private high school.
16:476:40538:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The key threat to a causal interpretation of our estimates is that exam school applicants are
16:477:40631:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not distributed randomly around the school cutoffs.  Such nonrandom sorting could invalidate our
16:478:40727:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical design by creating discontinuous differences in respondent characteristics around the score
16:479:40828:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cutoff.  In Figure 3 we evaluate this possibility by testing whether the observable characteristics of
16:480:40930:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:applicants trends smoothly through each cutoff.  Gender and middle school type is available for the
16:481:41029:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1994 through 2013 high school cohorts for all students.  8th grade test scores are available for only
16:482:41130:21:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 2002 through 2013 cohorts who attended a public middle school, while ethnicity data is only
16:483:41225:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:available for the 2008 through 2013 cohorts who attended a public middle school.  Students eligible
16:484:41324:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for Brooklyn Tech are less likely to be black, while students eligible for Stuyvesant are more likely
16:485:41425:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to be Hispanic.  Otherwise, there are no statistically significant differences between just eligible and
16:486:41529:20:20:71:181:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:just ineligible students.
16:487:41554:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Next, we examine whether the frequency of respondents changes at the cutoff.  We follow the
16:488:41645:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approach  of  McCrary  (2008)  and  first  collapse  the  data  into  equal  sized  bins  of  0.01.   We  then
16:489:41755:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regress the number of observations in each bin on a local linear regression which we allow to vary
16:490:41853:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on either side of the cutoff.  As suggested by Figure 4, the coefficient on the eligibility cutoffs is
16:491:41955:21:20:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistically insignificant for all three schools.  Results are identical with either larger or smaller
16:492:42058:20:20:71:539:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bin widths.  Given the general lack of statistical significance on both of our robustness checks, we
16:493:42158:20:20:71:539:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interpret our results as showing no clear evidence that our identifying assumption is violated in the
16:494:42259:20:0:71:252:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:full sample of exam school applicants.
17:495:42299:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Recall that our high school outcomes are only available for the set of students who enroll in a
17:496:42394:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:public high school in NYC. Section 4 discusses the issues related to selection into this sample, and
17:497:42494:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conducts a number of robustness checks.  While we find that students scoring just above an exam
17:498:42589:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school cutoff are more likely to enter the NYCDOE data, eligible and ineligible students are just
17:499:42686:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as likely to be male, black, and Hispanic, and score about the same on 8th grade math and reading
17:500:42783:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exams.   Nonetheless,  our  high  school  results  should  be  interpreted  with  this  sample  selection  in
17:501:42892:20:44:72:99:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mind.

17:508:43380:20:20:72:539:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the eligibility indicator.11In all results, the first cutoff is Brooklyn Tech, the second Bronx
17:509:43480:20:21:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Science, and the third Stuyvesant.  Point estimates and standard errors for the eligibility variable
17:510:43580:21:20:71:539:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  each  school  are  presented  next  to  each  cutoff.   Regression  estimates  add  controls  for  cohort,
17:511:43691:20:20:71:220:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gender and middle school type.
17:512:43721:20:21:88:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Individuals scoring just above the Brooklyn Tech cutoff are 22 percentage points more likely
17:513:43813:21:20:71:539:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to graduate from the school than individuals scoring just below the cutoff.  Individuals who score
17:514:43911:20:20:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:just above the Bronx Science cutoff are 31.1 percentage points more likely to graduate from that
17:515:44007:20:21:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school, while students scoring above the Stuyvesant cutoff are 56.8 percentage points more likely
17:516:44104:21:20:71:539:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to  graduate  from  Stuyvesant.   Note  that  some  students  scoring  below  each  school’s  cutoff  still
17:517:44211:20:20:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:graduate from that school.  This is because students can retake the SHSAT in 9th grade, allowing
17:518:44307:20:26:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:some students to change schools.  Nonetheless, these first stage results suggest a strong relationship
17:519:44409:26:15:83:539:174:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:10We use graduation rather than “ever attended” due to data limitations in the early cohorts.  First stage results
17:520:44523:15:7:72:457:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:using the number of years attending each exam high school are presented in Appendix Table 8.
17:521:44615:7:15:83:539:152:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:11Lee and Lemieux (2010) propose a formal test for optimal bin width based on the idea that if the bins are narrow
17:522:44729:15:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:enough, then there should not be a systematic relationship between the outcome variable and the running variable
17:523:44841:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:within each bin.  Otherwise, the bin is too wide and the mean value of the outcome variable is not representative
17:524:44954:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:at  the  boundaries.   A  simple  test  for  this  consists  of  adding  a  set  of  interactions  between  the  bin  dummies  and
17:525:45084:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the running variable to a base regression of the outcome variable on the set of bin dummies, and testing whether
17:526:45196:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the interactions are jointly significant.  Results from this test for the first stage variable and college enrollment are
17:527:45317:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:presented in Appendix Table 9.  The interaction terms tend not to be jointly significant at our chosen bin width of
17:528:45432:11:0:72:321:71:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:0.05.  Results are nearly identical for other outcome variables.

18:537:46230:20:20:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each cutoff.  As with the first stage results in Section 6.1, these estimates include all students who
18:538:46332:20:21:72:422:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:applied to an exam school, even if they later left the NYC school system.
18:539:46405:21:20:88:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Surprisingly, there appears to be little impact of exam schools on four year college enrollment
18:540:46500:20:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  graduation.   If  anything,  students  eligible  for  exam  schools  are  less  likely  to  have  attended
18:541:46611:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or  graduated  from  college  by  2009.   Students  just  eligible  for  Brooklyn  Tech  are  2.3  percentage
18:542:46720:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points  less  likely  to  graduate  from  a  four  year  college.   Students  just  eligible  for  Bronx  Science

18:544:46933:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage points less likely to graduate, though neither estimate is statistically significant.  With
18:545:47035:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that said, the 95 percent confidence interval rules out impacts larger than 2.8 percentage points for
18:546:47136:20:20:72:341:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bronx Science and 2.5 percentage points for Stuyvesant.
18:547:47191:20:21:88:539:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The results are similar when examining college enrollment in more selective institutions.  We

18:555:47957:21:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for Brooklyn Tech are 1.6 percentage points less likely to enroll in a school with a median SAT of
18:556:48055:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:above 1300.  There is no impact of Stuyvesant or Bronx Science eligibility on enrollment in a school

19:561:48564:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely to enroll in a post-baccalaureate program.  The relatively small standard errors rules

19:563:48714:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  4  presents  results  separately  by  middle  school  type  and  gender,  the  only  two  control
19:564:48818:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables available across all years and students.  We interact the linear trend in exam score with
19:565:48917:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both the group being tested and the cutoff variable.  There are no clear patterns by ethnicity or free
19:566:49019:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lunch status among the subset of students we have that data for.  Males and students who attended
19:567:49116:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private middle schools benefit somewhat more from being eligible for Stuyvesant, and women seem
19:568:49211:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to benefit somewhat more from being eligible for Brooklyn Tech.  Given the general lack of clear
19:569:49307:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:patterns and statistical significance, however, our estimates suggest that all groups are affected by
19:570:49408:21:20:72:225:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exam school eligibility similarly.
19:571:49442:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 5 presents results separately by 8th grade state test score for students who were enrolled
19:572:49538:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in  a  NYC  middle  school,  the  only  group  we  have  state  scores  for.   The  regression  discontinuity
19:573:49647:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates presented in this paper capture the causal effect of admission for students near the cutoff.
19:574:49749:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At each cutoff,  however,  there exists a distribution of actual ability.  Some high ability students
19:575:49850:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may score lower on the entrance exam by chance, putting them nearer a cutoff than their ability
19:576:49945:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would suggest, while some low ability students may, by chance, score higher on the entrance exam,
19:577:50042:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gaining admission to a school with far more able students on average.  We test for the heterogenous
19:578:50141:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of exam school admission by ability by splitting the same by state test scores in 8th grade.
19:579:50240:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We first limit the sample to students within 0.25 standard deviations of the Brooklyn Tech cutoff
19:580:50337:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and above to eliminate students with no chance of admissions.  We then split the remaining sample
19:581:50434:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the median and 75th percentile of combined math and English 8th grade state test score.  We
19:582:50528:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allow the linear trend in exam score to differ by both the group being tested and the cutoff variable.
19:583:50630:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Perhaps surprisingly, there are no clear patterns by baseline state test score.  Of the eighteen
19:584:50726:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results  considered,  only  one  difference  is  statistically  significant  at  the  ten  percent  level.   This
19:585:50839:21:20:72:507:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests that high and low ability students are affected by exam school eligibility similarly.
19:586:50933:20:20:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A null result on the impact of exam schools on college enrollment and outcomes, while surprising,
19:587:51030:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is broadly consistent with the literature on the effect of school choice on college outcomes (e.g.,
19:588:51129:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Cullen,  Jacob  and  Levitt  2006,  Deming  et  al.   2011),  but  differs  substantially  from  the  popular
19:589:51238:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:view of exam schools.  In Chicago, Cullen, Jacob and Levitt (2006) find no impact of winning a
19:590:51332:20:20:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school choice lottery on test scores, but some benefits on behavioral outcomes such as self-reported
19:591:51432:20:0:72:540:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:criminal activity.  On the other hand, Deming et al.  (2011) find that high school choice winners in
20:592:51534:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Charlotte-Mecklenburg score no better on high school exams, but are more likely to graduate from
20:593:51630:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high school and attend college.  Berkowitz and Hoekstra (2011) examine the effect of attending elite
20:594:51730:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private high school on college placement using by examining the outcomes of admitted applicants
20:595:51825:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who later chose not to attend, finding that the attending the school leads students to attend more
20:596:51923:21:36:72:172:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selective universities.

20:599:52122:21:20:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presented in Figures 7 through 9.  Recall that we only have high school data on individuals who
20:600:52217:20:20:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attend a public high school in NYC. Students who leave the system to attend a private school or
20:601:52312:20:21:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a  public  school  in  another  district  are  excluded.   This  approach  assumes  that  the  students  who
20:602:52420:21:20:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leave NYC do not differ in some systematic from those that stay.  While our robustness checks in
20:603:52516:20:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Section 4 suggest little difference between students who stay in the system and those that leave,
20:604:52613:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditional on attending a public middle school.  There is also no difference in the impact of exam
20:605:52712:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schools on college outcomes in the full sample and the sample used for high school outcomes.  Still,
20:606:52812:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we cannot definitely rule out unobservable differences between leavers and stayers, so our results
20:607:52910:20:21:72:297:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.

20:610:53152:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Regents diplomas.  To receive a Local diploma, students must score at least 55 on each of five core
20:611:53251:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Regents examinations:  English, Mathematics, Science, U.S. History and Government, and Global
20:612:53344:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:History and Geography.  In order to receive a more prestigious Regents Diploma,  students must
20:613:53438:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:receive a score of at least 65 in each of these five core subjects.  To earn the Advanced Regents
20:614:53535:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Diploma,  students must also score at least a 65 on elective exams in math,  science,  and foreign

20:616:53642:20:20:88:539:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Students  eligible  for  Bronx  Science  are  more  likely  to  graduate  from  high  school  in  general,
20:617:53748:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  more  likely  to  receive  an  Advanced  Regents  diploma.   Students  eligible  for  Brooklyn  Tech
20:618:53853:21:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are  also  more  likely  to  receive  an  Advanced  Regents  diploma.   Stuyvesant  eligibility  does  not
20:619:53959:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significantly affect high school graduation or the type of diploma obtained,  perhaps because the
20:620:54056:20:21:72:416:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal applicant is already quite likely to receive an advanced degree.

20:622:54219:20:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:through 2009 high school cohorts.  Students eligible for Brooklyn Tech and Bronx Science are more
21:623:54318:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely  to  complete  core  courses  such  as  Global  History  and  English  Language  Arts,  though  no
21:624:54423:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely to take the first math course.  Students eligible for any of the three schools are more
21:625:54522:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to take an optional second math course covering Trigonometry, though the estimate is only
21:626:54618:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistically significant for Bronx Science.  Students eligible for Bronx Science and Stuyvesant take
21:627:54719:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more science exams,  and more likely to take more advanced subjects such as Physics.  Students
21:628:54813:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eligible for Stuyvesant are also more likely to take Chemistry, while students from Brooklyn Tech
21:629:54910:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Bronx Science are less likely to take that class.  Taken together with the results from Figure 7,
21:630:55011:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we see the Regents results as suggesting that exam school students take more advanced coursework
21:631:55107:20:20:72:169:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than other students.
21:632:55127:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 9 examines the impact of attending an exam school on SAT scores, a measure of human
21:633:55217:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capital,  for the 2007 through 2010 cohorts.  Students eligible at each exam school are somewhat
21:634:55313:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely to take the SAT, though none of the point estimates are statistically significant.  Those
21:635:55414:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eligible for Bronx Science score 10.9 points higher on the SAT math section conditional on having
21:636:55511:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taken it, but no better in reading or writing.  Students eligible for Stuyvesant and Bronx Science
21:637:55609:20:43:72:231:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do no better in all three sections.
21:638:55644:43:31:72:244:381:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:7    Concluding Remarks
21:639:55667:31:21:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Public  exam  high  schools  have  educated  some  of  the  world’s  most  successful  scientists  and  pro-
21:640:55775:21:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fessionals.   We  provide  evidence  that  attending  an  exam  school  increases  rigor  of  the  marginal
21:641:55882:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:student’s high school course work, and makes the marginal student more likely to graduate from
21:642:55976:20:21:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high school with an advanced diploma.  Surprisingly,  however,  the impact of attending an exam
21:643:56071:21:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school  on  college  enrollment  or  graduation  is,  if  anything,  negative.   There  is  also  little  impact
21:644:56183:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of attending an exam school on SAT reading and writing scores, and, at best, a modest positive
21:645:56277:20:21:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact on SAT math scores.  The results are similar across gender, middle school type, and baseline
21:646:56376:21:20:72:151:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state test scores.
21:647:56394:20:20:88:539:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our analysis of exam schools suggests that students are encouraged or pushed to take harder
21:648:56485:20:21:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:course work but that their actual human capital essentially remains unchanged.  With that said,
21:649:56580:21:20:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:without  longer-term  measures  such  as  income,  health,  or  life  satisfaction,  it  is  difficult  to  fully
21:650:56693:20:20:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interpret our results.  To the extent that attending an exam school increases social capital in ways
21:651:56793:20:21:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that are important for later outcomes that are independent of college enrollment, graduation, or
21:652:56889:21:0:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:human  capital,  then  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  our  conclusions  are  premature  and  the  true
22:653:57000:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact  of  an  elite  exam  school  will  only  be  understood  with  the  passage  of  time.   If,  on  the
22:654:57109:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other hand, SAT scores, college enrollment and graduation are “sufficient statistics” for later life
22:655:57209:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes,  then  our  results  show  the  impact  of  attending  an  elite  exam  school  for  the  marginal
22:656:57317:20:0:72:207:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:student is likely to be small.

54:1465:95322:13:14:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we  combine  Sequential  Math  1,  Math  A  and  Integrated  Algebra  scores  and  Sequential  Math  3,
54:1466:95425:14:13:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Math B, and Trigonometry scores (based on the advice of NYC staff).  Results are identical if we
54:1467:95521:13:14:72:486:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrict the results to Math A and B, which make up the majority of our observations.
54:1468:95606:14:13:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Regents exams are administered within schools in January, June, and August of each calendar

54:1470:95795:14:13:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exam.  Students typically take exams at the end of the corresponding course, so that most students
54:1471:95893:13:14:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:take the exams in June.  Unlike most other standardized exams, teachers grade the Regents exams
54:1472:95988:14:14:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for students in their own school.  The State Education Department of New York provides explicit
54:1473:96083:14:13:72:491:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:guidelines for how the teacher-based scoring of each Regents exam should be organized.
54:1474:96169:13:14:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Regents exam requirements have changed somewhat during the years we examine (1998 to 2010).
54:1475:96260:14:13:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To graduate, students generally must score at least 55 on each of five core Regents examinations:
54:1476:96357:13:14:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:English, Mathematics, Science, U.S. History and Government, and Global History and Geography.
54:1477:96450:14:13:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to receive a more prestigious Regents Diploma, students must receive a score of at least
54:1478:96547:13:14:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:65 in each of these five core subjects.  To earn an Advanced Regents Diploma, students must also
54:1479:96643:14:13:72:435:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:score at least a 65 on elective exams in math, science, and foreign language.
54:1480:96720:13:14:88:539:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Currently, the option of receiving a local diploma is being eliminated entirely.  Beginning with
54:1481:96816:14:13:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those  who  entered  the  9th  grade  in  the  fall  of  2008,  students  are  required  to  meet  the  Regents
54:1482:96927:13:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Diploma requirements (score 65 or higher in each of the five core subjects) in order to graduate
55:1483:97025:0:14:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from high school in New York State.  The shift from local diploma to Regents diploma requirements
55:1484:97122:14:14:72:540:695:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was done gradually, with students entering 9th grade in fall 2005 having to score 65 in at least two
55:1485:97222:14:13:72:410:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:core subjects, and each subsequent cohort facing stricter requirements.
55:1486:97293:13:14:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A score of 85 is labeled as achieving mastery of the subject matter.  While scoring 85 or higher
55:1487:97389:14:13:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is not relevant for high school graduation,  meeting this cutoff is often used by high schools as a
55:1488:97488:13:14:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prerequisite for courses and by New York State colleges as either a prerequisite or qualification for
55:1489:97589:14:13:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:credit towards a degree.  Beginning with students who entered 9th grade in the fall of 2009,  an

55:1491:97782:14:13:72:399:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who score above 85 on three Regents exams in science and/or math.
55:1492:97847:13:14:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Regents examinations contain both multiple-choice and open-response questions.  The foreign
55:1493:97938:14:13:72:540:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:language exams also contain a speaking component.  Scoring materials provided to schools include
55:1494:98034:13:14:72:540:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  correct  answers  to  multiple-choice  questions  and  detailed,  subject-specific  instructions  and

55:1516:99729:21:13:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Admissions to the academic SHS is determined by the Specialized High Schools admissions test
55:1517:99821:13:14:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(SHSAT). The test is broken into two sections, one math and one verbal, and students are given
55:1518:99915:14:13:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2 hours and 30 minutes per section with no break.  The verbal section is made up of 45 multiple-
55:1519:100011:13:14:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:choice questions.  30 questions test reading comprehension, 10 questions test logical reasoning, and
55:1520:100111:14:13:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5 questions require students to put sentences into the most logical order in a paragraph.  The math
55:1521:100210:13:14:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:section is comprised of 50 multiple-choice questions, which test basic math, algebra (factoring and
55:1522:100309:14:13:72:388:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:substitution), geometry, basic graphing, logic, and word problems.
55:1523:100375:13:14:88:539:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In scoring the SHSAT, there is no penalty for wrong answers and correct answers receive points.
55:1524:100470:14:13:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The raw number of questions correct is scaled through a Department of Education formula, and
55:1525:100562:13:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores fall between 200 and 800.  Due to the formula used by the DOE, students who score very
56:1526:100657:0:14:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:highly in one section but poorly in another are more likely to have a higher score than students

56:1535:101432:13:14:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who wanted to attend a specific school but was not accepted to that school.  Gender was coded
56:1536:101525:14:13:72:540:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as male, non-male, or missing.  Middle school type was coded as public, private, or missing.  We
56:1537:101621:13:30:72:452:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consider only 8th grade admissions, dropping all SHSAT scores from 9th grade.
