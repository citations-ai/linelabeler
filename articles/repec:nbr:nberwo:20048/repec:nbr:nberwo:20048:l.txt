2:34:1970:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:With a large nationwide retailer, we run a natural field experiment to measure the effects of energy

2:36:2173:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:durable goods. While a combination of large rebates plus sales incentives substantially increases market
2:37:2277:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:share, information and sales incentives alone each have zero statistical effect and explain at most a
2:38:2378:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:small fraction of the low baseline market share. Sales agents strategically comply only partially with

2:40:2583:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:with the disinterested majority. These results suggest that at current prices in this context, seller-provided
2:41:2693:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:information is not a major barrier to energy efficiency investments. We theoretically and empirically

3:54:3094:0:28:72:185:691:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:55:3111:28:16:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Consumers often learn about new or higher-quality products from firms, and in theory, information
3:56:3208:16:17:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:problems can be ameliorated as sellers of relatively high-quality products inform consumers of their
3:57:3308:17:16:72:539:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:beneficial attributes.1In many cases,  however,  barriers to information transmission can cause a
3:58:3405:16:16:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:failure of “unraveling,” and imperfect information could reduce demand for high-quality products.
3:59:3502:16:17:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In these situations, regulators may be able to increase welfare by mandating or otherwise inducing
3:60:3600:17:16:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information  disclosure,  subsidizing  quality,  or  even  setting  minimum  quality  standards.   Before
3:61:3705:16:17:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:intervening, however, a regulator might want additional information:  How successful are firms at
3:62:3802:17:16:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:providing information?  How well-informed are consumers about new products and their attributes?
3:63:3898:16:17:88:539:532:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Every year, Americans purchase $361 billion in energy-using durable goods such as cars and air
3:64:3992:17:16:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conditioners and spend $570 billion on energy for those goods (BLS 2014).  Regulators intervene
3:65:4087:16:16:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in durable goods markets by mandating energy use information disclosure and by encouraging ad-
3:66:4181:16:17:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ditional marketing of energy efficiency through initiatives such as the Energy Star Retail Partner
3:67:4279:17:16:72:540:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:program.   Imperfect  information  is  also  commonly  used  to  justify  extensive  subsidies  for  energy
3:68:4386:16:17:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:efficient goods,  as well as minimum energy efficiency standards.2Despite the importance of im-
3:69:4481:17:16:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perfect information in the energy policy debate, however, there is limited evidence on how energy
3:70:4578:16:17:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cost information disclosure affects demand for durable goods.  Dranove and Jin’s (2010) review of
3:71:4675:17:16:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the information disclosure literature discussed zero studies related to energy efficiency, although we
3:72:4777:16:17:72:408:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discuss below how this literature has recently received more attention.
3:73:4848:17:16:88:539:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  study  water  heaters,  which  are  interesting  and  important  precisely  because  they  are  so
3:74:4950:16:16:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mundane.  Consumers rarely think about their water heater until it breaks unexpectedly, at which
3:75:5046:16:17:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:point  they  want  to  replace  it  quickly,  with  limited  time  for  search  and  information  acquisition.
3:76:5156:17:16:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Consumers  rarely  discuss  water  heaters  with  their  friends,  meaning  that  retailers  play  a  pivotal
3:77:5265:16:17:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:role  in  guiding  purchases.   At  average  product  lifetimes  and  usage  rates,  purchasing  an  energy
3:78:5372:17:16:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:efficient “Energy Star” natural gas water heater instead of a standard model is an investment with
3:79:5470:16:17:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:13-18  percent  return  -  and  this  is  before  the  generous  subsidies  offered  by  many  local  utilities.
3:80:5582:17:16:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Despite this, the Energy Star market share is only about 3 percent at the retailer we study.  These
3:81:5681:16:16:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choices are expensive:  water heating is the second largest home energy use in the U.S. (DOE 2009),
3:82:5780:16:17:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consuming about $300 in energy annually per household, or about $29 billion per year nationwide.
3:83:5876:17:16:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Motivated by these issues, we carried out a natural field experiment with a large nationwide
3:84:5968:16:16:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retailer that sells water heaters and many other goods.  We worked at the Retailer’s call center,
3:85:6065:16:11:84:325:171:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:A:1See Grossman (1981), Milgrom (1981), and Viscusi (1978).
3:86:6122:11:15:84:539:160:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:2There are many examples.  The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy argues that minimum effi-
3:87:6227:15:11:72:540:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:ciency standards are merited for several reasons, including “rush purchases when an existing appliance breaks down,
3:88:6342:11:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:providing no time to comparison shop” (Nadel 2011).  The Regulatory Impact Analysis for the increase in the Cor-
3:89:6454:11:11:72:540:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:porate Average Fuel Economy standard for 2012 to 2016 argues that even without counting the value of externality
3:90:6566:11:11:72:540:112:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:reductions, the regulation increases consumer welfare, perhaps because consumers are not correctly informed about
3:91:6679:11:11:72:540:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the value of fuel economy (NHTSA 2010, page 2).  The Regulatory Impact Statement for Australia’s ban on energy
3:92:6789:11:0:72:508:90:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:inefficient lightbulbs argues that “information failures” help to justify that policy (DEWHA 2008, page vii).
4:93:6899:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which sells about 45,000 water heaters each year.  More than 20,000 callers were randomly assigned
4:94:6997:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between treatments in which sales agents were instructed to provide energy cost savings information
4:95:7096:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and/or offer customer rebates for Energy Star models. We also offered $25 sales incentives for agents
4:96:7197:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who sold Energy Star on randomly-selected calls, and we crossed these incentives with the customer
4:97:7295:16:17:72:109:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rebates.
4:98:7303:17:16:88:539:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A crucial feature of our experiment is that the seller’s interactions with customers are interme-
4:99:7400:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:diated by sales agents.  This is not uncommon:  consumers learn about life insurance, mutual funds,
4:100:7499:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and many consumer goods at least partially through agents.  In our setting, sales agent behavior is
4:101:7598:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important for two reasons.  First, it directly determines the Retailer’s ability to market Energy Star
4:102:7700:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:products:  if sales agents don’t provide information on a call, callers will likely remain uninformed.
4:103:7802:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Second, in equilibrium, it is indirectly informative about consumers’ responsiveness to information:
4:104:7902:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:given that information disclosure takes time and focus away from other sales tasks, if consumers
4:105:7998:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are not interested in information,  agents will not provide it.  To document sales agent behavior,
4:106:8096:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our research team independently audited more than 2,000 phone calls, quantifying the interactions
4:107:8193:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between agents and consumers.  Our ability to observe agent behavior, instead of simply the equi-
4:108:8290:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:librium outcome of attempting to disclose information, is one feature that distinguishes this paper
4:109:8389:16:17:72:167:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from previous work.
4:110:8408:17:16:88:539:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are several reasons to expect that the treatments could substantially increase Energy Star
4:111:8504:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:market share.  Because consumers are thought to be poorly informed about water heater features,
4:112:8599:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they often accept sales agents’ recommendations about what model to purchase. The $100 customer
4:113:8694:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rebate increases the average consumer’s return on investment in an Energy Star model to 28-37
4:114:8787:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent, and when combined with additional subsidies available from many local utilities, our $100
4:115:8885:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rebate brings the incremental purchase price of the Energy Star model close to zero.  The $25 sales
4:116:8984:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentives are equal to two times agents’ fixed hourly wage and are ten times larger than their usual
4:117:9085:17:16:72:143:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sales incentive.
4:118:9101:16:17:88:539:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Against this backdrop,  our results are surprising.  Our audits show that agents comply with
4:119:9193:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:delivering the information and rebates on only about one-fifth of calls.  Information has zero sta-
4:120:9292:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tistical effect on demand,  and confidence intervals rule out that demand increases by more than
4:121:9388:17:16:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:4.9 percentage points on calls when the information is delivered and the consumer is considering a
4:122:9486:16:17:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substitutable model.  While this bound is large relative to the baseline Energy Star market share,
4:123:9584:17:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it suggests that the market share would still be very low even if agents informed all consumers.
4:124:9680:16:16:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The $100 customer rebates do increase Energy Star purchases, however, and the combination of a
4:125:9774:16:17:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:$25 sales incentive and $100 customer rebate appears to have particularly strong complementary
4:126:9868:17:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects.  This last result suggests one potential policy implication:  when addressing market failures
4:127:9970:16:17:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that might distort energy-using durable good purchases, policymakers may wish to consider also
4:128:10064:17:16:72:430:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentivizing sales agents instead of only subsidizing consumers’ purchases.
4:129:10140:16:0:88:539:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We show that agents preferentially market Energy Star to consumers with higher latent demand
5:130:10233:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for Energy Star.  Furthermore, on calls with the $25 sales incentive but no experimental customer
5:131:10330:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rebate  and  no  explicit  direction  to  deliver  an  informational  script,  agents  exert  very  little  effort
5:132:10444:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to  sell  Energy  Star  models.   Along  with  the  small  information  effect,  these  results  suggest  that
5:133:10554:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents’ non-compliance is better described as “strategic” instead of “shirking”:  agents don’t inform
5:134:10655:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers about Energy Star because they know that at the retailer’s base price, most consumers
5:135:10750:17:16:72:302:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are not interested in the product once informed.
5:136:10798:16:17:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are two potential explanations for why the Retailer’s attempts at information disclosure
5:137:10892:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:did not increase Energy Star demand.  First, consumers may tend to be unaware of Energy Star and
5:138:10988:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:underestimate its benefits, but sales agents may not be able to address this because their “disclosure
5:139:11090:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:technology” is limited:  they work in time-constrained sales interactions and may have a perceived
5:140:11188:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lack  of  credibility  when  promoting  a  higher-priced  model.   Second,  consumers  might  already  be
5:141:11293:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relatively well-informed about Energy Star availability and benefits, and most choose not to buy
5:142:11389:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because they don’t think that the reduced energy use is worth the incremental upfront cost.  These
5:143:11487:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two explanations have very different implications for whether regulators should intervene to provide
5:144:11587:17:16:72:324:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information or otherwise encourage energy efficiency.
5:145:11640:16:16:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We carried out an extensive set of customer follow-up surveys to shed light on these two ex-
5:146:11732:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:planations.  On the one hand, there is evidence that consumers are confused:  even when “Energy
5:147:11827:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Star” is precisely defined, 52 percent of consumers report believing that they had bought an official
5:148:11928:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy Star model, while only 2.1 percent actually had.  Of the consumers who thought they had
5:149:12022:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not bought Energy Star, 15 percent reported that this was because they were not aware that there
5:150:12118:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:was an Energy Star option.  On the other hand,  the great majority of consumers were aware of
5:151:12211:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy Star, and their foremost reason for not purchasing was that the price was too high.  Fur-
5:152:12307:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:thermore, while there is wide dispersion of beliefs, the average consumer actually overestimates the
5:153:12407:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potential energy cost savings from Energy Star.  While the survey results are not as conclusive as
5:154:12505:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the experimental results, they at least suggest that lack of awareness and cost savings information
5:155:12604:16:17:72:377:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are not the primary barriers to energy efficiency in this context.
5:156:12670:17:16:88:539:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We also include a simple theoretical model which helps to motivate the experiment and interpret
5:157:12765:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results.  The model is a two-firm version of Grossman and Shapiro’s (1984) analysis of informational
5:158:12865:17:16:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:advertising in a Hotelling spatial model.  We extend this framework to include two goods, a base
5:159:12961:16:17:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:good and a “high-quality” (energy efficient) good, and nest within the firm a set of optimizing sales
5:160:13062:17:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents who disclose information at convex cost.  The model highlights the importance of equilibrium
5:161:13161:16:16:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interactions  between  the  firm’s  management,  sales  agents,  and  consumers:  because  information
5:162:13263:16:17:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provision  is  costly,  sales  agents  will  not  provide  information  if  consumers  are  unresponsive,  and
5:163:13373:17:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers will be unresponsive when the firm sets a relatively high price for the high-quality good.
5:164:13473:16:17:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:When the firm lowers the price of the high-quality good, however, consumers become more interested
5:165:13571:17:16:72:540:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  product,  and  agents  exert  more  effort  in  marketing  it.   The  model  also  helps  to  clarify
5:166:13681:16:0:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  policy  relevance  of  the  experiment  by  formalizing  how  minimum  quality  (energy  efficiency)
6:167:13787:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standards  are  more  likely  to  increase  welfare  if  the  high-quality  good  is  more  beneficial  and  if
6:168:13898:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experimental results show that it is difficult for firms to inform consumers of this.  Furthermore,
6:169:13997:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the model formally considers government-provided sales agent incentives,  showing that they can
6:170:14092:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase welfare if firms under-provide information relative to the social optimum and firms are not
6:171:14192:16:17:72:385:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:able to “undo” the government-provided incentive in equilibrium.
6:172:14256:17:16:88:539:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of this section discusses related literature.  Section 2 provides an overview of
6:173:14350:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  water  heater  market,  and  Section  3  presents  the  theoretical  model.   Section  4  details  the
6:174:14457:17:32:72:531:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experimental design and data.  Section 5 presents the empirical results, and Section 6 concludes.

6:176:14579:23:17:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our  study  is  broadly  connected  to  several  different  literatures.   Most  immediately,  our  study  is
6:177:14688:17:16:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:related  to  the  literature  on  information  disclosure,  as  reviewed  by  Milgrom  (2008)  and  Dranove
6:178:14795:16:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Jin (2010).  Empirical papers on the effects of information disclosure include Choi, Laibson,

6:186:15497:17:16:88:539:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Closely related is the literature that studies the effects of energy-related information.  There
6:187:15593:16:16:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  a  number  of  papers  in  this  domain  that  differ  from  ours  in  only  one  respect.   Some  studies
6:188:15704:16:17:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:analyze the effects of energy use information disclosure on stated preferences or other proxies for
6:189:15803:17:16:71:539:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:actual purchases of durable goods,  including Davis and Metcalf (2014),  Deutsch (2010a,  2010b),
6:190:15900:16:17:71:539:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Newell  and  Siikamaki  (2013),  and  Ward,  Clark,  Jensen,  Yen,  and  Russell  (2011).   Some  studies
6:191:16005:17:16:71:539:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:either use observational data (Kallbekken, Saelen, and Hermansen 2013) or randomly assign a very
6:192:16101:16:17:71:539:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:small  number  of  units  (Anderson  and  Claxton  1982).   There  are  other  large-sample  RCTs  that
6:193:16204:17:16:71:539:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:study how peer energy use comparisons affect purchases of durable goods, including Allcott and
6:194:16298:16:16:71:539:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Rogers (2014), Brandon, List, Metcalfe, and Price (2014), and Herberich, List, and Price (2011),
6:195:16394:16:17:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but this social information is conceptually distinct from information about the durable good itself.
6:196:16494:17:16:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Also related is Houde’s (2014a) analysis of the Energy Star label and other studies of how various
6:197:16592:16:17:71:539:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kinds of information affect total household energy use, such as Allcott (2011), Dolan and Metcalfe
6:198:16690:17:16:71:539:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2013),  Jessoe  and  Rapson  (2014),  and  others.   Along  with  Allcott  and  Taubinsky  (2015),  our
6:199:16794:16:17:71:539:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:paper is slightly different in that it uses large sample RCTs to study how providing information
6:200:16890:17:16:71:539:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about a durable good’s energy use affects actual purchases of that good.  This particular question is
6:201:16991:16:16:71:539:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important given the regulatory resources that go into durable good energy use disclosure programs
6:202:17088:16:0:71:539:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and given the costly energy efficiency standards and subsidies that are partially predicated on the
7:203:17188:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:idea that consumers remain imperfectly informed when purchasing durable goods.  Furthermore,
7:204:17280:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our paper is substantially conceptually different from the rest of the energy information literature
7:205:17380:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:due to its focus on a situation where the information provision process is intermediated by sales
7:206:17477:17:16:72:105:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents.
7:207:17484:16:17:88:539:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our experiment is also related to studies of behavior by sales agents and advisers,  including
7:208:17578:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:field experiments by Anagol,  Cole,  and Sarkar (2013),  Mullainathan,  Noeth,  and Schoar (2012),
7:209:17676:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Naginet al.(2002), as well as theoretical analyses by Hoffman, Inderst, and Ottaviani (2013)
7:210:17772:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Inderst and Ottaviani (2009, 2012).  This literature largely focuses on information asymmetries
7:211:17871:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between sales agents and consumers or alternatively on agency problems between firm managers
7:212:17963:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  workers.   While  these  issues  could  be  at  play  in  our  context,  we  do  not  focus  on  them.   In
7:213:18075:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our model, the firm’s inability to observe sales agent behavior does not reduce profits, and agents
7:214:18174:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:give consumers correct information about the product.  Instead, we highlight agents’ imperfect and
7:215:18272:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differential compliance with the experiment.  This angle is comparable to findings by Duflo, Gale,
7:216:18370:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Liebman, Orszag, and Saez (2006) that tax preparation professionals have different levels of success

7:218:18572:16:16:72:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentives connect us to the sales force management literature (see Mantralaet  al.  (2010) for a

7:220:18766:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to studying employee compensation and management practices (see Ichniowski and Shaw (2003) for
7:221:18860:16:17:72:536:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an earlier review), and to “process” field experiments in strategy research (Chatterjiet al.2015).
7:222:18958:17:16:88:539:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A key innovation relative to the literatures on information disclosure and employee incentives
7:223:19052:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is  that  we  highlight  theinteractionbetween  consumer  and  firm  behavior  in  equilibrium.   Much
7:224:19154:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the recent empirical work on information disclosure studies consumer responses to information
7:225:19250:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that is experimentally provided with certainty or disclosed by firms under mandate, which isolates
7:226:19348:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumer behavior independent of the firm.  Conversely, much of the employee incentives literature
7:227:19446:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:focuses on worker behavior in isolation of the consumer.  For example, Ashraf, Bandiera, and Jack

7:229:19638:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Lazear (2000),  Shearer  (2004),  and  others focus on how  employees  respond  to different types  of
7:230:19740:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentives, but these responses do not meaningfully depend on behavior by the firm’s customers.
7:231:19835:17:16:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:By contrast, a central feature of our setting is that the firm’s ability to motivate its sales agents
7:232:19936:16:17:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to  promote  a  product  depends  crucially  on  consumer  interest  in  that  product,  which  is  in  turn
7:233:20044:17:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:determined by the firm’s pricing decisions.  A handful of other papers have highlighted other types
7:234:20143:16:16:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of equilibrium interactions between the supply and demand sides of the market for energy efficiency,
7:235:20243:16:0:72:314:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:including Fischer (2005, 2011) and Houde (2014b).
8:236:20293:0:28:72:219:691:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2    Market Overview
8:237:20313:28:24:72:258:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.1    The Water Heater Market
8:238:20343:24:16:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:There are over 100 million water heaters currently in use in the United States, approximately one
8:239:20440:16:17:72:540:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:per household.3The typical water heater remains in use for 13 years (DOE 2010), which translates
8:240:20536:17:16:71:539:606:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into a seven to eight percent replacement rate per year.  Non-replacement sales vary with the state
8:241:20635:16:16:71:539:590:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  new  housing  market,  but  they  historically  represent  18  percent  of  total  sales.   “Storage”
8:242:20745:16:17:71:539:574:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:water heaters, where water is stored hot as opposed to heated up on demand, make up 96 percent
8:243:20839:17:16:71:539:557:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the market.  In 2012, there were 7.69 million residential storage water heaters sold in the United
8:244:20940:16:17:71:539:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:States, 3.96 million (51 percent) of which are fueled by natural gas (AHRI 2013), while the rest
8:245:21036:17:16:71:139:524:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use electricity.
8:246:21052:16:17:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Water heater manufacturing is highly concentrated, with the top three producers (A.O. Smith,
8:247:21144:17:16:71:539:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Rheem, and Bradford White) supplying 96 percent of all residential water heaters in 2008.  Approx-
8:248:21242:16:16:71:539:475:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:imately half of all units are sold through wholesale distributors; of these, 87 percent are purchased
8:249:21343:16:17:71:539:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and installed by plumbers.  The remaining half of all units are purchased through retail channels
8:250:21440:17:16:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:such as our partner Retailer.  In 2010, the Retailer had a 9 percent share of the retail market, third
8:251:21542:16:17:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:behind two other retailers that had 23 and 19 percent shares.  Thirty percent of the Retailer’s sales
8:252:21643:17:16:71:539:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are made through the call center where our experiment takes place, while the remaining 70 percent
8:253:21740:16:17:71:539:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are made in physical retail establishments.  Our sample thus includes a small but non-trivial share
8:254:21839:17:31:71:395:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of all water heaters sold in the United States over the study period.
8:255:21908:31:24:71:248:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.2    Water Heater Attributes
8:256:21938:24:16:71:539:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Water  heaters  are  a  convenient  product  to  study  because  they  are  differentiated  only  on  a  few
8:257:22046:16:23:71:243:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dimensions.  Key characteristics are:
8:258:22083:23:16:88:540:282:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Fuel type:  natural gas,  propane,  or electric.  Consumers’ choices depend on what fuels are
8:259:22177:16:16:99:540:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:available in their houses, so choices along this dimension are effectively exogenous.  We limit
8:260:22272:16:17:99:540:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:our  study  to  natural  gas  and  propane  water  heaters,  as  there  are  no  Energy  Star  electric
8:261:22375:17:24:99:489:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:models.  Less than one percent of sales in the sample were propane-fueled models.
8:262:22456:24:16:88:540:209:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Storage tank size.  This determines the amount of hot water available at any time.  Residential
8:263:22552:16:17:99:540:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:tank sizes range from 30 to 80 gallons.  In our sample, 90 percent of sales are either 40 or 50
8:264:22647:17:24:99:135:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:gallons.
8:265:22655:24:17:88:540:152:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Warranty length.  The Retailer offers models with warranty lengths of 3, 6, 9, and 12 years.
8:266:22748:17:16:99:540:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Models with longer warranties are typically constructed differently, using additional or im-
8:267:22840:16:15:99:346:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:proved anode rods to delay or fully prevent rusting.
8:268:22892:15:14:84:539:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:3DOE (2010) provides an overview of the United States water heater market;  this is the source of most of the
8:269:23001:14:0:72:171:90:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:statistics presented here.
9:270:23028:0:17:88:540:691:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Tank  height.   Some  consumers  need  to  install  water  heaters  in  basements  with  low  ceiling
9:271:23130:17:16:99:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:heights.  In our sample, about eight percent of sales are “short” models, while the rest are
9:272:23222:16:26:99:177:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:standard height.
9:273:23238:26:16:88:540:632:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Nitrogen  oxide  emissions.   In  some  areas,  in  particular  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and
9:274:23338:16:17:99:540:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:southern California, air quality regulations require consumers to purchase “low NOx” water
9:275:23428:17:16:99:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:heaters,  which  have  different  natural  gas  combustion  chambers  that  produce  less  nitrogen
9:276:23527:16:25:99:127:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:oxide.
9:277:23533:25:17:88:540:558:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Power venting.  Typical natural gas water heaters vent hot combustion gases out of the house
9:278:23626:17:16:99:540:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:through a vertical chimney.  When this is not possible, a power vent water heater is required
9:279:23719:16:26:99:348:525:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:to push the gases outside through a horizontal pipe.
9:280:23771:26:16:88:540:499:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Mobile home designs.  The Retailer sells water heaters specifically designed for mobile homes;
9:281:23866:16:26:99:345:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:these comprise less than one percent of our sample.
9:282:23917:26:32:88:266:457:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Energy use.  We discuss this below.
9:283:23953:32:23:72:451:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.3    Water Heater Energy Use and the Energy Star Technology
9:284:24014:23:17:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Each model’s energy use is tested at an independent laboratory using test protocols defined by the
9:285:24112:17:16:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. government.  Test results are used for the FTC Energy Guide labels, or “yellow tags,” which
9:286:24208:16:17:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  energy  use  information  labels  that  provide  estimated  annual  energy  costs  based  on  national
9:287:24315:17:16:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:average usage and energy prices.  The yellow tags report total energy costs across all fuels used,
9:288:24413:16:16:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which for the Energy Star models includes both natural gas and electricity.  By law, yellow tags
9:289:24509:16:17:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:must be displayed on water heaters in a showroom, and the Retailer’s website also includes PDFs
9:290:24604:17:16:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the yellow tag next to each model’s description.  Thus, while many consumers may not see or
9:291:24698:16:17:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attend to energy cost information, it is easily verifiable.  Of course, each household’s actual energy
9:292:24800:17:16:72:476:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs may differ from the average due to utilization rates, climate, and other factors.
9:293:24887:16:17:88:539:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The energy use test protocols are also used to calculate statistics called Energy Factors, which
9:294:24983:17:16:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:represent  the  share  of  energy  input  into  the  water  heater  that  is  transformed  into  hotter  water
9:295:25093:16:16:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:instead of otherwise dissipated.  To qualify for Energy Star status, a natural gas water heater must
9:296:25193:16:17:72:429:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:achieve an Energy Factor of 0.67 or above, compared to the standard 0.59.
9:297:25266:17:16:88:539:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:During  our  study  period,  the  Retailer  sold  four  natural  gas  Energy  Star  models.   Two  are
9:298:25368:16:17:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:modified versions of their standard 40 and 50 gallon models with 6-year warranties.  To improve
9:299:25463:17:16:72:540:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:energy efficiency, the manufacturer adds another inch of insulation around the tank and uses electric
9:300:25564:16:17:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ignition instead of a continuously-burning pilot light.  To accommodate electric ignition, the Energy
9:301:25665:17:16:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Star models must be plugged in to a power outlet, and they consume a small amount of electricity.
9:302:25762:16:16:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:They  also  have  electronic  thermostats  and  a  more  advanced  flue  damper  that  opens  and  closes
9:303:25867:16:0:72:540:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:depending  on  whether  gas  is  currently  being  burned.   These  differences  only  affect  energy  use
10:304:25974:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  have  no  material  impact  on  unit  performance,  and  there  are  no  other  differences  between
10:305:26079:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the standard and Energy Star 6-year warranty models.  (Of course, consumers may attach other
10:306:26171:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:connotations to the Energy Star label, and as we mention below, local in-stock availability is an
10:307:26268:17:16:72:193:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:additional differentiator.)
10:308:26295:16:17:88:539:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The other two Energy Star models are 40 and 50 gallon premium models with 12-year warranties.
10:309:26388:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The premium models have the same amount of insulation as the standard 12-year models;  they
10:310:26479:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:achieve higher energy efficiency through electric ignition and other modifications to the combustion
10:311:26579:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:process.  The premium Energy Star models also differ from the standard 12-year models on other
10:312:26673:16:16:72:323:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dimensions that make them generally higher-quality.
10:313:26724:16:17:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 1 presents information on these four Energy Star models and how they compare to their
10:314:26815:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:closest substitutes.  Standard models cost $400 to $700, not including installation.  According to
10:315:26913:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the yellow tags, standard models use about $300 worth of energy each year, meaning that lifetime
10:316:27009:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cost  is  much  larger  than  upfront  purchase  price.   Energy  Star  models  save  about  $30  per  year.
10:317:27117:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Because the 6-year warranty models are very close substitutes except for purchase price and energy
10:318:27215:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cost, the 13 and 18 percent internal rates of return are reasonable approximations of the expected
10:319:27313:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monetary net benefits of Energy Star.  By contrast, the 12-year Energy Star model also has other
10:320:27409:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:premium features, so 1 and 3 percent internal rates of return do not capture the full benefits of the
10:321:27510:17:16:72:150:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:premium model.
10:322:27524:16:17:88:539:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Because of the fixed costs of developing, certifying, and manufacturing a unique model, man-
10:323:27616:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ufacturers do not produce Energy Star versions of each standard water heater.  In particular, the
10:324:27713:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturer that supplies the Retailer does not make mobile home or propane Energy Star mod-
10:325:27806:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:els.  Because of the fixed costs of procuring and stocking each model,  the Retailer also does not
10:326:27904:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:carry all the Energy Star models that the manufacturer offers.  The Retailer does not carry the
10:327:27999:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturer’s short tank size or low-NOx Energy Star models.  Because consumers are effectively
10:328:28095:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unable to substitute across these features,  we define a subset of “substitutable” models that in-
10:329:28193:16:17:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cludes all Energy Star and non-Energy Star natural gas tank water heaters except for low-NOx,
10:330:28286:17:32:72:383:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:short tank height, mobile home, power vent and propane models.
10:331:28348:32:23:72:208:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.4    The Sales Process
10:332:28372:23:17:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:According to DOE (2010), 35-40 percent of replacement purchases nationwide arise suddenly due
10:333:28465:17:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to complete unit failure, typically when water rusts through the steel tank and escapes onto the
10:334:28561:16:17:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:floor.  Our follow-up customer surveys show that 83 percent of purchases in our sample were due to
10:335:28659:17:16:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unexpected breaks instead of planned replacements.  Because most people don’t like cold showers,
10:336:28755:16:17:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers typically want to replace their water heater within 24 hours if possible.  This hurry has
10:337:28854:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:several implications.  First, consumers have not saved money in anticipation of a large expenditure,
10:338:28954:16:16:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:so  they  may  be  especially  price  sensitive.   Second,  consumers  tend  to  prefer  models  that  are  in
10:339:29064:16:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stock locally and can thus be installed quickly.  Because sales volumes are lower, the Retailer stocks
11:340:29167:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy Star water heaters at fewer locations than its standard models.  Third,  consumers make
11:341:29261:17:16:72:514:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:little time to acquire information about different types of water heaters and their attributes.
11:342:29356:16:17:88:539:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A quote from our survey of the Retailer’s sales agents nicely summarizes these issues:  “Cus-
11:343:29449:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tomers that were shopping ahead [i.e.  not responding to an unexpected unit failure] seemed to be
11:344:29546:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:making more educated decisions ...  they were more inclined to use the Energy Star water heaters
11:345:29642:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as item they wanted their quote for.  I feel that whenever there was not such a sense of urgency ...
11:346:29742:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:customers were in a position to spend more on a better water heater and also able to wait for it to
11:347:29841:17:16:72:131:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be ordered.”
11:348:29853:16:16:88:539:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:When  customers  call  the  Retailer’s  water  heater  call  center,  sales  agents  have  significant  in-
11:349:29960:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fluence over their decisions.  Some callers have done background internet research and think they
11:350:30057:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:know what model they want before calling,  while the majority know only that they need a new
11:351:30149:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:water heater.  Agents work with these callers to determine which model is best for them based on
11:352:30245:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  attributes  discussed  above,  such  as  fuel  type,  ceiling  height,  local  low-NOx  regulations,  and
11:353:30355:16:17:72:176:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:appropriate tank size.
11:354:30377:17:16:88:539:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Before the experiment started, we called the Retailer’s call center a number of times, acting as
11:355:30473:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“mystery shoppers.” We found that the Retailer’s sales agents have been successfully trained to look
11:356:30573:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:up Energy Star rebates offered by local utilities, discuss Energy Factors, and discuss information
11:357:30671:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on yellow tags.  Unless the caller asks about energy efficiency, however, agents never discussed the
11:358:30771:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:issue with us, because information disclosure is costly.  As one agent wrote on our survey, “I would
11:359:30871:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:say about 90 percent of our customers only care about how cheaply can they get away with the
11:360:30963:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchase of a water heater.” Sharing extraneous information increases call times,  and many call
11:361:31059:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:centers evaluate agents on call times in order to keep labor costs low.  Longer call times can reduce
11:362:31160:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:customer satisfaction and increase the probability that the customer gets distracted and does not
11:363:31257:16:17:72:158:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:complete the sale.
11:364:31275:17:16:88:539:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:These features of the water heater sales process motivated our experiment: perhaps Energy Star
11:365:31369:16:17:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sales are low because consumers are unaware of the product and its benefits, and agents’ influence
11:366:31467:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over  consumers  could  be  leveraged  to  increase  awareness.   Notwithstanding,  this  discussion  also
11:367:31573:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:makes  clear  that  informing  consumers  is  costly.   In  the  next  section,  we  present  a  model  that
11:368:31681:17:38:72:174:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:captures these issues.

11:370:31736:28:23:72:329:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:3.1    Sales Associates and the Sales Process
11:371:31781:23:16:72:540:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The Retailer’s water heater division operates two call centers.  There are 77 sales agents who take
11:372:31880:16:17:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at least one call during our sample period.  These sales agents sell only water heaters, not other
11:373:31978:17:16:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:goods.  The agents report to Team Managers, who in turn report to Shift Managers, who report to
11:374:32073:16:0:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the call center manager.  Agents make between $11 and $14 per hour, depending on seniority, along
12:375:32172:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with  sales  incentives  that  typically  scale  closely  with  purchase  price  and  average  approximately
12:376:32280:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:$4.  Interestingly, however, sales incentives are only slightly higher for the 6-year warranty Energy
12:377:32381:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Star models compared to their closest non-Energy Star substitutes,  despite purchase prices that
12:378:32477:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are about $200 higher.  Sales incentives for the premium 12-year warranty Energy Star models are
12:379:32573:16:17:72:458:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about $5 larger than for the standard 12-year warranty non-Energy Star models.
12:380:32651:17:16:88:539:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  Retailer  has  an  established  set  of  processes  that  sales  agents  are  to  follow  on  each  call.
12:381:32761:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:About 60 to 65 percent of calls are recorded at random, and managers monitor a subset of these
12:382:32855:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calls for evaluation and quality assurance.  The sales agents meet with their managers weekly to
12:383:32951:16:16:72:503:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:review performance and talk about sales initiatives and modifications to the sales process.
12:384:33042:16:17:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:When a customer calls, he or she is routed to the first available sales agent.  The call centers use
12:385:33142:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:caller ID, and the agents verbally confirm the caller’s phone number.  Using this phone number, the
12:386:33241:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:customer is assigned a “reference number.” We define a “consumer” as a unique reference number.
12:387:33336:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Individuals often call more than once as they comparison shop or gather more information.  If an
12:388:33432:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:individual calls more than once from the same phone number or verbally gives the same number
12:389:33524:17:16:72:378:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to a sales agent, then he or she is tracked as a unique customer.
12:390:33589:16:16:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Once the sales agent and consumer agree on a water heater model, the sales agent checks whether
12:391:33684:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the model is in stock in the customer’s region, arrives at a price quote, records the customer address,
12:392:33787:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and charges the customer’s credit card. Customers can install the unit themselves, hire a third-party
12:393:33888:16:32:72:374:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:plumbing contractor, or pay the Retailer to do the installation.

12:395:33978:24:16:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The  sales  agents  have  a  standard  computer  interface  that  has  the  Retailer’s  sales  program  plus
12:396:34086:16:17:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:internet access.  To implement the experiment, the Retailer’s staff redesigned the interface to open
12:397:34186:17:16:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the experiment website each time a reference number is entered.  Our research team designed and
12:398:34281:16:17:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:programmed  the  experiment  website,  which  afforded  us  full  control  over  the  randomization  and
12:399:34385:17:16:72:139:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other content.
12:400:34399:16:17:88:539:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix Figure A.1 is a screen shot of the website’s initial screen.  On this screen, the agent
12:401:34495:17:16:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would  enter  the  customer’s  needed  fuel  type  (Gas  or  Electric)  and  click  “GO.”  After  the  agent
12:402:34603:16:16:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:clicked “GO,” the website would display call handling instructions, including a script that the agent
12:403:34704:16:17:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:was to cover with the customer.  The different treatments were implemented through these scripts.
12:404:34801:17:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Appendix  Figure  A.2  is  a  screen  shot  of  one  example  treatment,  the  $100  Energy  Star  rebate.
12:405:34907:16:17:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Electric customers are excluded from the experimental population, with the website displaying “No
12:406:35004:17:16:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Script.” Natural Gas customers form the experimental population, and they are randomly assigned
12:407:35099:16:17:72:222:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to one of the treatment groups.
12:408:35130:17:16:88:539:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Agents  and  callers  were  both  randomized.   Agents  were  randomly  assigned  as  Information
12:409:35227:16:16:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Treatment Agents or Information Control Agents.  Callers were randomly assigned to treatment
12:410:35319:16:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:groups based on their reference number.  Thus, consumer who called multiple times but kept the
13:411:35415:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same reference number remained in the same treatment condition.  Consumers who first spoke with
13:412:35510:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an Information Control Agent were automatically assigned to Information Control,  while callers
13:413:35605:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who first spoke with an Information Treatment Agent were randomly assigned to either Information
13:414:35701:17:16:72:238:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Treatment or Information Control.
13:415:35734:16:17:88:539:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 displays the experimental timeline and treatment groups.  Phase 1 ran from November
13:416:35825:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2012 to April 2013.  During this time, there was a three-by-two matrix of treatments:  customers
13:417:35921:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:were randomly assigned to $0, $25, or $100 rebate, which was crossed with Information Treatment
13:418:36016:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or Control.  Phase 2 of the experiment ran from early April to early June 2013.  In this phase, we
13:419:36114:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:added a sales incentive, which the Retailer calls a “spiff.” Phase 3 lasted from early June to early
13:420:36214:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:July.  In this phase, we added two final treatments, which were interactions of the spiff with the
13:421:36312:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two rebate levels.  In Phase 4, the Retailer ended the spiff treatments but continued the rest of the
13:422:36413:16:17:72:519:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experiment for several weeks.  In total, there were eight different treatment cells, plus control.
13:423:36511:17:16:88:539:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Below, we give examples of the call handling instructions for several example treatments.  In
13:424:36604:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the Information Treatment condition with no rebate, the website instructed the agent to read the
13:425:36700:17:23:72:227:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:following script to the customer:
13:426:36733:23:16:115:512:437:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:Let me take a moment to tell you about our Energy Star models.  Energy Star water
13:427:36814:16:17:99:512:421:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:heaters cost about$220 more than a standard model, but they save a typical household
13:428:36898:17:16:99:512:404:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:A:$40 each year, so you would make up that price difference in about six years.  Over 12
13:429:36984:16:17:99:513:388:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:years,  which  is  the  normal  life  of  a  water  heater,  you  would  save$480  in  energy  bills.
13:430:37085:17:16:99:512:371:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:Energy Star models may not be available for every home.  If possible, would an Energy

13:432:37210:24:23:71:439:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the rebate condition with no information, the agent was instructed to say:
13:433:37287:23:17:115:513:308:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:I  have  good  news.   [Retailer]  has  specially  selected  you  for  a$100  rebate  on  any

13:435:37466:16:24:99:413:275:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:possible, would an Energy Star water heater be of interest to you?
13:436:37532:24:23:71:437:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:If the customer was assigned to the spiff, the call handling instructions read:

13:439:37725:17:16:99:512:195:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:caller  buys  any  Energy  Star  water  heater.   You  can  share  with  the  caller  any  useful
13:440:37822:16:17:99:512:179:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:information about the benefits of Energy Star, perhaps including environmental benefits
13:441:37909:17:16:99:512:162:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:or long-run energy cost savings.  The caller does not need to purchase on the initial call.

13:444:38145:23:16:71:539:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the combined spiff plus rebate conditions which were added in Phase 3, the sales agent was not
13:445:38242:16:0:71:539:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:instructed to read a specific script.  Instead, the call handling instructions told sales agents that
14:446:38345:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the customer was eligible for a rebate and left it to the sales agent to decide how to phrase that
14:447:38443:17:25:72:131:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information.

14:449:38498:17:16:115:512:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:You  (the  Retail  Hotline  Associate)  will  receive$25  on  your  next  paycheck  if  this
14:450:38590:16:17:99:297:616:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:caller buys any Energy Star water heater.
14:451:38631:17:25:115:512:599:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:The customer will also receive a$25 rebate off of any qualifying Energy Star model.
14:452:38714:25:25:71:276:574:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the control group, the instructions read:
14:453:38758:25:17:115:283:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:CONTROL GROUP: NO SCRIPT
14:454:38782:17:16:115:512:532:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:This customer is in the control group.  Proceed with the call as you normally would.
14:455:38866:16:17:99:512:516:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:Answer  any  questions  the  customer  has,  but  try  not  to  use  any  of  the  language  in  the
14:456:38966:17:25:99:238:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A:information treatment script.
14:457:38995:25:17:71:539:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:At the end of the call,  the sales agents reported in the experiment website whether or not they
14:458:39091:17:16:71:539:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:delivered the script.  As we shall see, these self-reports overstate compliance relative to our indepen-
14:459:39195:16:16:71:539:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dent audits.  The website and the team managers instructed the agents that the only reasons not
14:460:39290:16:17:71:539:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to deliver the script were if the customer needed a low-NOx, short tank, or other specialty model
14:461:39387:17:16:71:539:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that was not substitutable with Energy Star models.  If the agent did not complete the script, the
14:462:39485:16:17:71:485:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:website required them to select the reason for non-compliance from a dropdown menu.
14:463:39568:17:16:88:539:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The experiment was closely integrated into the call center processes.  At the outset, managers
14:464:39662:16:17:71:539:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trained the agents on the scripts and how to use the website,  and this was also part of training
14:465:39759:17:16:71:539:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for  newly-hired  agents  during  the  experiment.   We  also  communicated  directly  with  the  agents
14:466:39863:16:16:71:539:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:through several group emails and two videos that explained the importance of compliance with the
14:467:39959:16:17:71:539:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experiment.  Specifically, we emphasized the importance of both delivering the scripts on treatment
14:468:40058:17:16:71:436:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:group calls andnotdiscussing elements of the scripts on control group calls.
14:469:40134:16:17:88:539:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Every week of the experiment, we provided the Retailer with agent-specific compliance reports
14:470:40227:17:16:71:539:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:based  on  self-reported  compliance  from  the  website.   We  had  bi-weekly  calls  with  managers  to
14:471:40332:16:17:71:539:244:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discuss  these  compliance  reports,  and  managers  could  then  discuss  with  agents  in  their  weekly
14:472:40438:17:16:71:539:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:meetings.  The Retailer’s internal call monitors also audited calls for compliance with treatment
14:473:40535:16:17:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assignment.  Agents with low compliance with the experiment were pressured by managers to do
14:474:40627:17:16:71:539:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:better.  To encourage competition between the two call centers,  managers also reviewed average
14:475:40722:16:16:71:539:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compliance  for  each  call  center,  as  well  as  trends  over  time.   In  the  endline  survey,  sales  agents
14:476:40836:16:17:71:539:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reported that managers frequently emailed and talked with them about the experiment.  In sum,
14:477:40929:17:16:71:539:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents did face some costs if they did not at least report compliance with the experimental protocols.
14:478:41031:16:17:71:539:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:However, this experiment was only one of many issues that managers and agents needed to attend
14:479:41125:17:0:71:84:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to.
15:480:41130:0:17:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Individuals who call multiple times from multiple phones and do not tell the sales agents that
15:481:41224:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they have previously called would have been assigned different reference numbers, and thus poten-
15:482:41321:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tially different treatments.  This could generate spillovers,  for example if a caller who purchases
15:483:41421:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using an Information Control reference number had been assigned an Information Treatment refer-
15:484:41516:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ence number on a previous call.  Based on our conversations with Retailer staff, we do not believe
15:485:41614:17:16:72:525:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that this happens on more than a handful of calls, although we do not have a precise estimate.
15:486:41708:16:17:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Some  consumers,  perhaps  plumbing contractors or  landlords  of multiple  homes,  order multi-
15:487:41804:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ple water heaters during the experiment.  The Retailer gives these individuals separate reference
15:488:41901:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:numbers on their separate purchases, and they are thus treated as separate “consumers” in the ex-
15:489:41998:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:periment.  While this also could generate spillovers, it could not have more than a negligible impact
15:490:42099:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the estimates because it affects only a very small share of the sample:  there are 104 individuals,
15:491:42201:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or 0.4 percent of the sample, who order two water heaters from the same phone number, and no
15:492:42293:17:32:72:350:493:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:phone number appears more than twice in the sales data.4
15:493:42349:32:23:72:131:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:3.3    Data
15:494:42360:23:17:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:There  are  several  main  data  sources.   The  first  is  the  Retailer’s  call  database.   An  observation
15:495:42470:17:16:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consists of the unique customer reference number, date and time of the call, and the agent receiving
15:496:42570:16:17:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the call.  This database includes only sales calls,  not warranty service,  repairs,  or other types of
15:497:42673:17:16:72:539:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calls.5Using the reference number, this is matched to the Retailer’s purchase data, which include
15:498:42770:16:17:72:315:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the model purchased, price paid, and other details.
15:499:42821:17:16:88:539:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  Retailer’s  call  database  is  also  matched  by  reference  number  to  the  experiment  website
15:500:42924:16:16:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:database.  This database includes the treatment assignment and the agent’s self-reported compli-
15:501:43020:16:17:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ance,  for each reference number where the website was opened.  For the 1.3 percent of reference
15:502:43116:17:16:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:numbers that appear in the website data multiple times, we code that the script was read to the
15:503:43211:16:17:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumer if any agent reported that he or she had done so on any call.  In the regressions, each
15:504:43307:17:16:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumerimust be associated with an individual agenta; we use the last agent in the website who
15:505:43402:16:17:72:539:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spoke with customeri.6We define a variableNsiatthat takes value 1 if agentareported compliance
15:506:43496:17:16:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on  a  treatment  group  call  with  consumeri,  and  0  otherwise.   Agents  were  not  explicitly  asked
15:507:43602:16:14:84:539:224:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:4Other  than  perhaps  these  104  individuals,  the  consumers  that  call  the  call  center  are  the  final  owners  of  the
15:508:43730:14:11:72:540:210:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:water heater; contractors do not order through the retail hotline.  Furthermore, consumers typically are not already
15:509:43846:11:11:72:540:199:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:working with a contractor before calling the Retailer, because a contractor would typically procure the water heater
15:510:43962:11:7:72:171:188:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:on behalf of a consumer.
15:511:43986:7:15:84:539:181:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:5Approximately 2-3 percent of reference numbers are repeated, typically as the sales agent updates information.
15:512:44097:15:11:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:In these cases, we use the most recent observation.  We drop six reference numbers that appear to be used twice for
15:513:44212:11:7:72:169:155:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:two distinct individuals.
15:514:44237:7:15:84:539:148:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:6There are other ways to code this, but it would not matter, because almost all of the 1.3 percent of reference
15:515:44348:15:11:72:540:133:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:numbers that appear multiple times were entered by the same agent.  Only four reference numbers were entered by
15:516:44459:11:11:72:540:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:two separate agents in the website,  and none are entered by 3 or more.  Because treatment groups were assigned
15:517:44570:11:11:72:540:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:by reference number, a consumer’s treatment assignment is maintained even if an agent enters the same reference
15:518:44681:11:0:72:166:100:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:number multiple times.

16:520:44804:17:16:72:268:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:treatment calls and zero for control calls.
16:521:44847:16:17:88:539:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  total  number  of  consumers  (reference  numbers  for  consumers  interested  in  natural  gas

16:523:45046:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent) are in the website and are randomly assigned to a treatment group; these calls comprise our
16:524:45146:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“experimental population.” The calls that are not recorded in the website are largely conversations
16:525:45245:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that did not last long enough for the sales agent to activate the website.  As Table 2 shows,  35
16:526:45342:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of consumers (8275 in total) purchased from the Retailer.  Of these sales, 73 percent were
16:527:45440:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:either Energy Star models or were substitutable with Energy Star models given other attributes
16:528:45534:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:such as tank height and NOx emissions.  Of this substitutable group,  however,  only 3.5 percent
16:529:45630:17:16:72:470:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:were actually Energy Star, while the remaining 96.5 percent were standard models.
16:530:45711:16:17:88:539:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For consumers that purchased water heaters, the Retailer records their name and address.  Zip

16:533:45993:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:could be an important correlate of environmentalism and interest in energy efficiency.  Using each
16:534:46091:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchaser’s name and address, a marketing data company called Acxiom provided assessed home
16:535:46182:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:value,  college  graduate  indicator,  age,  household  size,  and  political  affiliation.   Acxiom  gathers
16:536:46291:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data from public records, magazine subscriptions, voting records, scanner data, online purchases,
16:537:46388:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  other  sources,  and  their  data  are  certainly  measured  with  error.   For  the  approximately  10
16:538:46496:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of addresses missing the college graduate indicator, age, or household size, we substitute
16:539:46594:16:17:72:355:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:zip code-level means, again from the ACS 5-year estimates.
16:540:46652:17:16:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Using the Acxiom political affiliation data,  we construct a variable called “Democrat” which
16:541:46745:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:takes value 1 if the purchaser is a registered democrat, 0 if a republican, and 0.5 if independent
16:542:46843:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or unregistered.  If political affiliation is missing, we replace Democrat with the county-level ratio
16:543:46945:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of Democrat to Democrat plus Republican votes in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, using
16:544:47041:16:17:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data  from  the  U.S.  Election  Atlas  (Leip  2013).   Acxiom  also  provided  two  additional  levels  of
16:545:47148:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:environmentalism.  “Environmentalist” is an indicator variable for whether the consumer subscribes
16:546:47246:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to environmental magazines or contributes to environmental or animal welfare charities.  “Green
16:547:47341:17:16:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Living”  is  an  indicator  that  takes  value  one  if  Environmentalist  equals  one  or  if  the  household
16:548:47451:16:17:72:499:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchases environmentally-healthy products such as eco-friendly soaps and organic foods.
16:549:47539:17:16:88:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table  3  presents  sample  means  and  standard  deviations  for  our  nine  demographic  variables.
16:550:47640:16:16:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Consumers in our sample are older and wealthier than the general population, likely related to the
16:551:47738:16:17:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fact that they are almost entirely homeowners.  They are also more liberal and environmentalist, as
16:552:47837:17:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:illustrated by their Democrat scores and zip code hybrid vehicle shares.  In our data, Energy Star
16:553:47935:16:17:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demand  is  positively  associated  with  zip  code  median  income,  home  value,  and  zip  code  hybrid
16:554:48041:17:16:72:540:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:share, reminiscent of the findings of Kahn (2007).  This suggests that the Energy Star market share
16:555:48140:16:0:72:351:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would be even lower in a nationally-representative sample.
17:556:48200:0:17:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We do not have much information with which to test for balance on observables within the entire
17:557:48295:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experimental population.  Using the address-based demographic information, however, we can test
17:558:48390:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for balance within the subset of consumers who purchased from the retailer.  Appendix Table A.1
17:559:48485:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:presents tests using the nine demographic variables for each of the eight treatment cells, relative
17:560:48584:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to control.  Only one of the 72 t-tests rejects equality with greater than 90 percent confidence, and
17:561:48685:17:31:72:473:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all nine F-tests fail to reject that the treatment groups are balanced on observables.
17:562:48771:31:24:72:271:577:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:C:3.3.1    Customer Follow-Up Surveys
17:563:48806:24:16:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We hired an independent call center to conduct telephone follow-up surveys of customers who had
17:564:48901:16:17:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:called between December 10 and June 29.  We designed two separate surveys, one for consumers
17:565:48993:17:16:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who had purchased from the Retailer and one for consumers who had called but not purchased.
17:566:49084:16:17:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For purchasers, we asked a battery of questions covering household information, the water heater
17:567:49180:17:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchase process, and the Energy Star product.  For non-purchasers, we asked whether they had
17:568:49273:16:16:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchased an Energy Star water heater and why they had decided not to buy from the Retailer.
17:569:49365:16:17:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For this analysis, we focus on questions related to consumers’ knowledge of the Energy Star model,
17:570:49463:17:16:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which we only asked of purchasers.  Any other results are certainly available upon request, and the
17:571:49562:16:17:72:360:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:survey protocols are available as part of the replication files.
17:572:49626:17:16:88:539:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We directed the call center to complete no more than 200 surveys of purchasers and as many
17:573:49716:16:17:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:surveys as possible of purchasers.  In order to maximize response rates, we offered a $25 gift card
17:574:49815:17:16:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the Retailer to any respondents who initially attempted to refuse;  149 people accepted.  In
17:575:49912:16:16:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:total, there were 1,091 completed surveys (including 891 from purchasers) from 6,342 attempts, for
17:576:50010:16:32:72:213:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a response rate of 17 percent.
17:577:50040:32:24:72:360:308:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:C:3.3.2    Independent Audits of Recorded Phone Calls
17:578:50091:24:16:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our research assistant (RA) audited 2,122 calls from natural gas water heater consumers recorded
17:579:50187:16:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between May 1 and July 18.  These 2,122 calls are all recorded calls assigned to any of the treatment
17:580:50288:17:16:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:groups during that period, along with approximately five calls per day from the control group.  The
17:581:50387:16:16:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:audits were blind, meaning that the RA did not know the treatment assignment when auditing a
17:582:50479:16:17:72:91:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:call.
17:583:50484:17:16:88:539:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are two reasons why a call is not observed in our audit data.  First, the Retailer’s software
17:584:50583:16:17:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:records only a randomly-selected 60 to 65 percent of calls.  Second, the database of recorded calls
17:585:50682:17:16:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is not organized by reference number, so our RA needed to match recordings to reference numbers
17:586:50777:16:17:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using  phone  number,  time  and  duration  of  call,  and  other  information;  not  all  calls  could  be
17:587:50884:17:16:72:115:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:matched.
17:588:50892:16:0:88:539:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We worked with the RA to develop a protocol for quantifying the content of the interaction
18:589:50984:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between the sales agent and the customer.7We measure the information provision process using
18:590:51076:17:25:72:133:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:six variables:
18:591:51090:25:26:88:521:649:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Mentioned E-Star:  Did the agent mention energy efficiency, energy use, or Energy Star?
18:592:51178:26:25:88:521:623:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Rebate:  Did the agent mention the experiment’s Energy Star rebate from [the Retailer]?
18:593:51266:25:17:88:540:598:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Saves Money:  Did the agent mention that an Energy Star (or energy efficient) water heater
18:594:51357:17:25:99:237:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:saves money in energy costs?
18:595:51385:25:25:88:367:556:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Payback Period:  Did the agent quote a payback period?
18:596:51440:25:17:88:540:531:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•Read  Script:  Does  the  agent  say  one  of  the  experiment  scripts,  either  exactly  or  approxi-
18:597:51544:17:25:99:137:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:mately?
18:598:51551:25:17:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:•ln(E-Star Seconds):  For how many seconds did the agent and the customer talk about energy
18:599:51642:17:25:99:514:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:efficiency, energy use, or Energy Star?  We use the natural log of one plus this number.
18:600:51730:25:16:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Because there are a small share of consumers who call multiple times, the audit dataset includes
18:601:51826:16:17:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:multiple observations of some consumers.  Thus, there are 2,069 unique consumers in our experi-
18:602:51921:17:16:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mental population for whom we have audit data.  For the five binary variables above, we collapse
18:603:52017:16:17:72:540:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using the maximum.  In other words, consistent with our construction of agents’ self-reported com-
18:604:52115:17:16:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:plianceNsiat, we measure whether a consumer was ever informed about Energy Star or a rebate.
18:605:52207:16:17:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For the sixth variable, the number of seconds discussing Energy Star, we take the sum across all of
18:606:52306:17:38:72:161:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a consumer’s calls.
18:607:52325:38:27:72:141:310:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4    Model
18:608:52335:27:16:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We present a simple model of information disclosure through agents in an imperfectly competitive
18:609:52431:16:17:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:market.  The model is related to other models of informative and persuasive advertising, such as
18:610:52527:17:16:72:540:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Becker and Murphy (1993), Dixit and Norman (1978), Dorfman and Steiner (1954), Kotowitz and
18:611:52618:16:17:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Mathewson (1979), and Shapiro (1980).  It builds most closely on the simple spatial competition
18:612:52713:17:16:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model of Hotelling (1929) and the Grossman and Shapiro (1984) extension to informative adver-
18:613:52806:16:17:72:540:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tising.  We extend these models by modeling two goods, a base good and a high-quality good, and
18:614:52901:17:16:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by  nesting  sales  agents  within  the  model,  which  provides  microfoundations  for  the  experiment’s
18:615:53007:16:17:72:218:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information disclosure process.
18:616:53038:17:16:88:539:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model by itself would not be an important contribution, and what we call “propositions”
18:617:53129:16:16:72:540:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are straightforward comparative statics.  We include the model, however, because it helps to put
18:618:53225:16:16:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the empirical work in context.  The sales agent model generates predictions for the field experiment,
18:619:53326:16:0:84:512:103:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:A:7By necessity, this was done before writing the paper, as the Retailer deletes call recordings after 30 days.

19:621:53535:17:32:72:539:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ments.  We then solve for the two-firm equilibrium, which highlights potential policy implications.

19:624:53669:23:16:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Two firms are located at either end of a Hotelling line.  Aside from their locations, the firms are
19:625:53768:16:17:72:540:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fully symmetric.  Each firm sells two goods indexed byj:  a base goodIand a high-quality good
19:626:53861:17:16:72:539:562:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:E.  For applications to energy-using durables such as water heaters,  we have in mind that good
19:627:53956:16:17:72:539:546:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:Eis energy efficient and goodIis energy inefficient.8The two goods are produced at marginal

19:629:54135:16:17:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:will buy one of the two goods from one of the two firms.  The unit demand assumption is certainly
19:630:54232:17:16:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:appropriate  for  water  heaters.   The  basic  Hotelling  setup  also  fits  the  water  heater  market  very
19:631:54342:16:32:72:496:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:well, with horizontally-differentiated retailers selling closely-comparable sets of products.

20:654:56226:0:17:72:539:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:firmf.  For example, if a consumer is informed by an agent of firm 1, then he or she is aware only
20:655:56324:17:16:72:539:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that firm 1 sells goodE.  Consumers informed by both firms are aware that both firms sell goodE.
20:656:56420:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:There are thus four different types of consumers.  Sharesθ1(1−θ2) andθ2(1−θ1) are informed only

20:658:56611:16:17:71:539:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is informed by neither.  We focus on the set of parameter values under which equilibrium prices are

20:674:57873:23:17:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The firm employs a number of sales agents normalized to measure 1.  As described above, providing
20:675:57970:17:16:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information takes time and effort, and it reduces sales agents’ ability to successfully carry out other
20:676:58073:16:17:72:539:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:required tasks during sales interactions.  We assume that informing shareθfof consumers costs

20:678:58263:16:17:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:such costs to sales agents are necessary to explain why they sometimes do not deliver information
20:679:58360:17:16:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when  the  experiment  protocol  directs  them  to.   Convex  costs  are  needed  to  generate  a  unique
20:680:58465:16:17:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium, but this convexity also informally captures another important feature of our empirical
20:681:58564:17:16:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results:  as we shall see, sales agents are able to target their attempts at information provision at
20:682:58665:16:16:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers who appear to be more receptive.  This suggests that as sales agents attempt to inform
20:683:58761:16:17:72:408:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more consumers, the marginal consumers are increasingly unreceptive.
20:684:58829:17:16:88:539:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The firm does not observe all individual sales interactions, so the firm cannot directly setθf.
20:685:58924:16:17:72:539:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Instead, firms pay sales agents a fixed wagewfplus sales incentivesffor each sale of goodE.  Sales

21:694:59283:23:17:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Agents inform consumers until the marginal incentive pay equals the marginal cost of information

21:738:60779:24:16:88:539:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The first part of Proposition 2 states the straightforward result that agents provide more in-

21:740:60968:17:16:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:doesn’t increase demand very much, sales incentives do not induce agents to provide much more
21:741:61061:16:17:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information.  Put simply, agents are unresponsive to sales incentives if consumers don’t respond to

22:767:62706:16:17:71:539:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Because both firm and agent are risk neutral and the agent does not have limited liability, the firm

23:819:65702:23:17:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As discussed in the introduction, minimum energy efficiency standards are often justified by the
23:820:65798:17:16:71:539:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assertion  that  imperfect  information  reduces  demand  for  energy  efficient  goods.   In  this  model,
23:821:65905:16:17:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one  can  capture  the  effects  of  a  minimum  quality  standard  by  eliminating  the  base  good  and
23:822:66010:17:16:71:539:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:requiring that all consumers purchase goodE.  Under our assumptions aboutGHE, GLE, andGI,
23:823:66099:16:16:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this increases welfare for High type consumers but decreases welfare for Low types.  A minimum
23:824:66193:16:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality standard also eliminates information provision costs, as all consumers now are mandated
23:825:66288:17:16:72:426:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to purchase goodE.  Under a minimum quality standard, social welfare is:

23:827:66470:15:11:71:540:162:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:to an equal reduction in marginal cost for both firms.  As long as the subsidized price still exceedsp∗fI, firms pass
23:828:66587:11:10:71:539:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the subsidy on to consumers in the form of reduced prices, but because the price reduction is symmetric, there is no

24:846:67860:24:16:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Unlike minimum quality standards, it would be novel for governments to provide sales incentives

25:868:69458:24:16:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The model helps to understand and motivate the field experiment that we detail in the remainder
25:869:69553:16:17:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the paper.  The three simple propositions show that sales agent behavior is not only important
25:870:69650:17:16:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in  directly  determining  the  firm’s  ability  to  disclose  information,  but  also  indirectly  informative
25:871:69761:16:17:72:540:618:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about consumers’ preferences:  because information provision is costly, optimizing agents will not
25:872:69859:17:16:72:540:601:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inform  consumers  if  they  believe  that  information  will  not  affect  demand.   The  social  welfare
25:873:69965:16:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discussion highlights that if sellers’ information disclosure is not effective at increasing demand for
25:874:70068:17:16:72:539:568:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:high quality goods but the social benefit of allocating goodEto High types (GHE−GI) is large,
25:875:70161:16:16:71:539:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:minimum quality (energy efficiency) standards are more likely to increase welfare.  Before drawing
25:876:70259:16:17:71:539:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this conclusion, however, we would need to show that information provision is ineffective because
25:877:70356:17:16:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:disclosure is difficult (i.e.αis large), not because consumers still don’t want goodEafter being
25:878:70452:16:17:71:539:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed (i.e.λis small).  The model also highlights a novel policy that could increase welfare:
25:879:70548:17:16:71:539:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:government-provided sales incentives.  To evaluate this potential policy, one similarly needs to know
25:880:70649:16:38:71:232:470:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:αandλ, along with (GHE−GI).

25:885:70911:16:17:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the independent audits.  While the latter measure is only available for a smaller subset of calls,
25:886:71013:17:16:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it is an independent assessment and also provides multiple measures of what the sales agent said.

25:892:71496:16:16:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:added treatment groups and across agents who were assigned to Information Treatment or Control.
25:893:71591:16:17:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This equation is estimated as a linear probability model (LPM) in OLS with robust standard errors.
25:894:71689:17:16:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In typical cases like ours where the true probability model is not known, Angrist and Pischke (2012)
25:895:71789:16:17:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:advocate for using the LPM instead of an arbitrary non-linear model such as probit or logit, and
25:896:71885:17:16:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we follow their recommendation.  In practice, our results are qualitatively and quantitatively very
25:897:71984:16:17:72:288:124:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:similar when using probit, logit, or the LPM.
25:898:72029:17:16:88:540:107:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column 1 of Table 4 presents the results using self-reported complianceNsiatas the measure
25:899:72119:16:0:72:540:91:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of compliance.  The sample excludes the spiff treatment calls because agents were not explicitly
26:900:72217:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:asked to read a script on these calls.  Agents report that they read the script on 46 to 49 percent of
26:901:72319:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calls, and this depends little on treatment assignment.  Columns 2-7 use data from our independent
26:902:72417:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:audits, showing that self-reports substantially overstate compliance.  Relative to control group calls,
26:903:72520:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents were about ten percent more likely to mention Energy Star in Information Only treatment
26:904:72614:16:17:72:435:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:group calls, and about 14 percent more likely to do so in Rebate Only calls.
26:905:72690:17:16:88:539:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Columns 3-6 directly measure compliance with the experiment scripts.  Column 3 shows that
26:906:72779:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents mentioned the experiment’s Energy Star rebate on 14 to 24 percent of calls when the website
26:907:72877:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:directed them to.  Columns 4 and 5 show that agents disclosed elements of the information script
26:908:72973:16:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(quoted  a  payback  period  and/or  said  that  Energy  Star  saves  money)  on  9  to  17  percent  more
26:909:73079:16:17:72:294:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information treatment calls relative to control.
26:910:73127:17:16:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column 6 reports whether an agent said something approximating one of the treatment scripts
26:911:73218:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:during the call.  These results are consistent with the results in columns 3, 4, and 5, in that agents
26:912:73320:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:appear to comply with the experiment protocol on about 15 to 20 percent of calls.  The number of
26:913:73416:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:observations is lower in this column because we did not begin to record this variable until after the
26:914:73517:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:first 326 audits were completed.  The outcome variable in column 7 is the natural log of one plus
26:915:73614:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated number of seconds that the agent and customer discussed energy efficiency; it is 33

26:917:73782:17:16:88:539:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The bottom row of Table 4 gives the mean of each dependent variable in the control group.
26:918:73871:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Agent-reported compliance in column 1 is zero by definition in the control group because the website
26:919:73971:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:did not ask agents to report whether they complied on control group calls.  Although agents do
26:920:74065:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mention Energy Star on some control group calls, they almost never deliver a script erroneously to
26:921:74163:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the control group:  out of the more than 400 control group calls that were audited, agents quoted a
26:922:74262:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:payback period once and mentioned an Energy Star rebate twice.  In total, they gave information
26:923:74357:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that sounded like one of the treatment scripts to the control group less than one percent of the
26:924:74453:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time.   Column  3  shows  that  agents  did  mention  a  rebate  on  a  small  but  statistically  significant
26:925:74563:16:17:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:share of non-rebate treatment group calls - both Information Only and Spiff Only calls.  This may
26:926:74660:17:31:72:502:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reflect some small amount of recording error in the audits or mistakes by the sales agents.

26:928:74792:24:16:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For use in the next section, we use the audit data to construct a measure of compliance with the

27:957:76481:24:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:One reason why agents might not provide much information about Energy Star is that they might

27:966:77261:25:16:88:539:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Standard errors are clustered by agent.  Table 5 presents the estimatedγcoefficients on the

27:968:77448:17:16:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:three exceptions.  First, to increase power, we combine the $25 and $100 Rebate groups into one
27:969:77543:16:17:71:539:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicator.  Second, the samples exclude information treatment calls, because Information Control
27:970:77639:17:16:71:539:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Agents do not have any information treatment calls, and the objective is to compare information
27:971:77734:16:16:71:539:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provision on non-information group calls.  Third, we do not present regressions forPayback Period,
27:972:77832:16:17:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because agents only quoted payback periods on four audited non-information group calls.  (All four
27:973:77930:17:16:71:267:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:involved Information Treatment Agents.)
27:974:77969:16:17:88:539:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 shows that Information Treatment Agents are not more likely than Information Control
27:975:78061:17:16:71:539:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Agents to mention experimental rebates on calls in any treatment group.  Information Treatment
27:976:78155:16:17:71:539:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Agents are, however, more likely to mention Energy Star on control calls and to mention that Energy
27:977:78254:17:16:71:539:134:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Star saves money on Spiff Only calls.  Column 6 shows that Information Treatment Agents talk
27:978:78346:16:16:71:539:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about Energy Star for approximately 30 percent longer on Spiff Only and control group calls.  The
27:979:78443:16:0:71:539:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standard errors are too wide to determine whether there is a meaningful difference in information
28:980:78542:0:17:72:305:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provision on combination Spiff plus Rebate calls.
28:981:78591:17:16:88:539:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:These  results  have  two  implications.   First,  they  suggest  that  one  reason  why  the  Retailer’s
28:982:78696:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sales agents do not frequently discuss information is that they were not well-practiced at doing so.
28:983:78796:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Once Information Treatment Agents learned how to discuss Energy Star on information treatment
28:984:78889:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calls, they began to do so without explicit instruction on control and spiff calls.  In the context of
28:985:78991:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our model, the experiment reduced the cost of information provisionαfor Information Treatment
28:986:79084:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Agents.  Second, these results imply that the estimates of effects of information disclosure on sales
28:987:79185:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:should take account of spillovers, in the form of increased discussion of energy efficiency on control
28:988:79287:16:32:72:127:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:group calls.
28:989:79299:32:24:72:269:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.2    Effects on Consumer Choice
28:990:79332:24:16:72:539:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We examine two binary outcomesYiat: whether the consumer purchases any model from the Retailer
28:991:79426:16:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  whether  the  consumer  purchases  an  Energy  Star  model.   For  each  outcome,  we  run  three
28:992:79528:16:30:72:431:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specifications.  The first specification is the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimator:
28:993:79608:30:30:242:539:441:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:A:Yiat=τTi+φi+μa+εiat(11)
28:994:79631:30:16:88:381:411:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:A:As above, this includes agent and phase indicator variables.10
28:995:79693:16:17:88:539:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The second specification is an instrumental variables (IV) estimator, substituting agent-reported
28:996:79790:17:16:71:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:complianceNsiatforTiin  Equation  (11)  and  instrumenting  forNsiatwithTi.11This  sample  is
28:997:79883:16:17:71:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:smaller because it excludes the spiff treatment calls, asNsiatis undefined for these calls.  The third
28:998:79985:17:16:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specification is what we call the “Scaled ITT” estimate:  we interactTiwithGa, which reflects the
28:999:80082:16:17:71:539:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:probability that agentadelivered the specific information or rebate script to consumeri. Intuitively,
28:1000:80183:17:16:71:540:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:multiplying by compliance probability scales theτcoefficient to be equivalent to a Local Average
28:1001:80279:16:16:71:205:296:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:Treatment Effect (LATE).12
28:1002:80305:16:17:88:539:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this context, the ITT and LATE are likely to bound the average treatment effect of providing
28:1003:80400:17:16:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information  to  all  consumers.   While  the  ATE  could  theoretically  be  larger  than  the  LATE  if
28:1004:80505:16:17:71:539:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sales agents targeted information at the least responsive consumers, we shall see momentarily that
28:1005:80603:17:16:71:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents appear to target consumers who are more interested in Energy Star.  If all treatment group
28:1006:80700:16:17:71:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers  withNiat=  0  would  have  had  zero  treatment  effect,  then  the  ITT  equals  the  ATE.
28:1007:80802:17:16:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:On the other hand, if the agents quasi-randomly chose whom to disclose to, then consumers with
28:1008:80896:16:16:71:539:181:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:Niat= 0 andNiat= 1 would have the same treatment effect, and the LATE would equal the ATE.
28:1009:80986:16:15:80:539:165:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:10Once we control for phases, additional time controls do not improve consistency or efficiency.  Adding month-of-
28:1010:81100:15:11:72:540:150:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:sample indicators, for example, does not change coefficients or standard errors.  Furthermore, the estimates do not
28:1011:81215:11:7:72:391:139:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:change when we exclude Phase I, which pre-dated the introduction of the spiff.
28:1012:81293:7:11:80:525:132:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:?:11Our previous working paper contained an error in this sentence that incorrectly described our IV procedure.

28:1015:81643:11:0:71:539:95:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:calculate that adjusting for sampling error in this generated regressor has only a small impact on the standard errors.
29:1016:81764:0:17:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 6 presents the results.  The left three columns show effects on overall sales of any model
29:1017:81860:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the Retailer.  The right three columns show effects on Energy Star sales.  Within each set of
29:1018:81958:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:three columns, the first is the ITT, the second is the IV using agent-reported compliance, and the
29:1019:82056:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:third regression is the Scaled ITT. Because the interaction effects between information and the two
29:1020:82155:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rebate level are never statistically significant, we drop these terms and report results for six major
29:1021:82257:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:treatment  groups  relative  to  control.   At  the  bottom  of  the  table,  we  report  the  mean  purchase
29:1022:82366:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:probabilities in the control group:  about 36 percent of consumers purchase from the Retailer, and
29:1023:82464:17:16:72:378:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about 0.9 percent of consumers purchase an Energy Star model.
29:1024:82525:16:16:88:539:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The treatments have no effect on overall sales, except that the ITT and self-report IV suggest
29:1025:82619:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that a $25 rebate may reduce purchase probability.  One explanation for this is that even mentioning
29:1026:82719:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a small rebate for a different model generates a version of choice overload, complicating the sales
29:1027:82818:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interaction and causing a slight decrease in purchase probability.  This would be consistent with
29:1028:82915:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other evidence of choice overload, such as Iyengar and Lepper (2000).  Another explanation is that
29:1029:83013:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  result  is  spurious  and  would  not  replicate.   We  find  this  latter  explanation  more  plausible,
29:1030:83123:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:partially because there is no negative effect in the Scaled ITT. Intuitively, the Scaled ITT differs
29:1031:83223:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the ITT because it weights more heavily the treatment effects from more compliant agents.
29:1032:83317:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The fact that the negative association disappears in the Scaled ITT implies that the ITT effect is
29:1033:83415:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:driven by agents who aren’t actually doing anything to comply with the experiment, which suggests
29:1034:83512:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a spurious correlation.  The first two columns of Appendix Table A.2 replicate column 1 for agents
29:1035:83610:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the bottom two vs.  top two compliance groups, confirming that none of the treatments affect
29:1036:83705:16:17:72:305:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sales in the subsample of more compliant agents.
29:1037:83753:17:16:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Although there appears to be little or no effect on the Retailer’s overall sales, columns 4-6 show
29:1038:83851:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the treatments do shift the composition of sales toward Energy Star.  The $100 rebate increases
29:1039:83951:16:17:72:539:313:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:Energy Star purchase probability by 0.006 to 0.037 percentage points in the three specifications.13
29:1040:84050:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This effect is large against a control group market share of 0.9 percent, although it is small as a share
29:1041:84155:16:17:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the total potential market.  The combination of a spiff and $100 rebate has a very large point
29:1042:84252:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimate,  increasing purchase probability by 4 to 22 percentage points.  The standard errors are
29:1043:84349:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wide, as this treatment was only offered to a small share of consumers in phase 3 of the experiment.
29:1044:84449:17:16:88:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The information treatments have a tightly estimated zero statistical effect.  In column 6, the
29:1045:84543:16:17:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standard  errors  are  tight  enough  to  bound  the  Local  Average  Treatment  Effect  at  less  than  1.5
29:1046:84651:17:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points.  While this would represent a large percent increase in Energy Star purchase
29:1047:84746:16:16:72:508:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:probability given the small base, the effect in percentage point terms is economically small.
29:1048:84839:16:17:88:539:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Earlier, we documented that although agents effectively never explicitly read a treatment script
29:1049:84935:17:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on a control call, Information Treatment Agents are more likely to mention Energy Star on control
29:1050:85032:16:16:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calls.  If this increases the probability of Energy Star purchase, then the estimates in Table 6 would
29:1051:85134:16:15:80:539:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:13In column 4, the combination of the spiff and a $25 rebate appears to reduce demand for Energy Star.  We suspect
29:1052:85248:15:0:72:509:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:that this result also would not replicate, and it is not statistically significant in the Scaled ITT in column 6.
30:1053:85363:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:understate  the  true  effects  of  the  information  scripts.   The  audit  data  allow  us  to  address  such
30:1054:85474:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spillovers. We construct an alternative “Scaled ITT” estimator, interactingTiwith each compliance
30:1055:85571:16:17:72:539:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:group’s average difference inMentioned  E-Starbetween treatment and control calls.  Intuitively,
30:1056:85667:17:16:72:539:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this scales the treatment effect to equal a LATE withMentioned E-Staras the endogenous variable.
30:1057:85763:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The third column of Appendix Table A.2 presents the results.  The coefficients and standard errors
30:1058:85861:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  inflated,  as  one  should  expect  from  the  fact  that  the  coefficients  in  Table  4  are  smaller  for
30:1059:85975:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:B:Mentioned  Energy  Starthan for the variables used to constructGia.  The qualitative results are
30:1060:86071:17:16:71:539:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:similar:  the Spiff and $100 Rebate combination still has a very large effect, and the standard errors
30:1061:86173:16:16:71:479:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bound the information effect at no more than 2.7 percent with 90 percent confidence.
30:1062:86257:16:17:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As  discussed  in  Section  2.3,  Energy  Star  models  are  only  substitutable  with  some  standard
30:1063:86359:17:16:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:models. Under the assumption that the treatments do not affect whether or not consumers purchase
30:1064:86455:16:17:71:539:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a substitutable model, we can consistently estimate treatment effects within the sample to the set
30:1065:86553:17:16:71:539:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  consumers  that  purchase  substitutable  models.   Appendix  Table  A.3  presents  results.   The

30:1067:86754:17:16:71:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:treatment effects.14The qualitative results are also similar:  the Spiff and $100 Rebate combination
30:1068:86854:16:16:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:has a very large effect, and the standard errors bound the information effect at no more than 4.9
30:1069:86951:16:17:71:539:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points with 90 percent confidence in the “Scaled ITT.” For comparison, Energy Star
30:1070:87044:17:16:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:represents 3.4 percent of substitutable models.  The standard errors suggest that even if sales agents
30:1071:87146:16:17:71:539:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provided information to all callers, Energy Star would still not represent more than 4.9+3.4=8.3
30:1072:87242:17:16:71:539:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the market of substitutable models.  Thus, the lack of seller-provided information does
30:1073:87340:16:17:71:399:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not explain much of the low takeup of energy efficient water heaters.

31:1095:89240:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the consumer purchased Energy Star.  These regressions use agent-reported compliance because the

31:1101:89776:17:16:72:539:493:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:κ <0, this implies that the consumers to whom agents are not disclosing information are less likely
31:1102:89875:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than average to purchase Energy Star, and thus that consumers who are provided with information
31:1103:89970:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  more  likely  than  average  to  purchase  Energy  Star.   While  this  is  not  the  same  as  targeting
31:1104:90080:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information disclosure at consumers who will have the largest treatment effects, it implies targeting
31:1105:90181:16:17:72:251:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in a different and likely related sense.
31:1106:90221:17:16:88:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In  all  four  columns  of  Table  7,  the  statistically  negative  estimates  ofκshows  that  agents
31:1107:90323:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  more  likely  to  report  delivering  the  script  to  consumers  that  are  more  interested  in  energy
31:1108:90433:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:efficiency.  Column 3 includes in the sample only consumers who purchase substitutable models.
31:1109:90527:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Even within this group, agents still target consumers with a higher probability of purchasing Energy

31:1111:90725:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:covariates are missing for consumers who did not purchase from the Retailer, the sample is limited
31:1112:90823:16:17:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to consumers who purchased from the Retailer.  The fact thatκis still negative after conditioning
31:1113:90920:17:16:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on observables shows that agents target information provision based on other unobservable factors.
31:1114:91018:16:17:88:539:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:How is such targeting possible?  Based on conversations with sales agents and with our research
31:1115:91113:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assistant who carried out the audits, we believe that agents learn about the consumer’s preferences
31:1116:91212:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as the call continues.  Agents may have delayed reading the Energy Star script until later in the
31:1117:91309:17:32:72:394:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:call, after having the chance to gauge the consumer’s receptiveness.

31:1119:91409:23:17:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our main empirical results tell a coherent story that is consistent with the three propositions in
31:1120:91507:17:16:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Section  4.   Proposition  1  states  that  agents  will  not  inform  consumers  if  information  does  not
31:1121:91615:16:17:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase demand.  Results in Table 6 and related appendix tables show that information increases
31:1122:91711:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy  Star  sales  by  at  most  a  few  percentage  points,  even  when  focusing  on  the  Scaled  ITT
31:1123:91817:16:16:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates and limiting the sample only to consumers who are purchasing water heaters that are
31:1124:91910:16:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substitutable  with  Energy  Star  models.   Consistent  with  this  and  with  Proposition  1,  the  audit
32:1125:92019:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data show that agents spent very little time discussing Energy Star unless the experiment website
32:1126:92116:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:directed them to.  Agents mentioned Energy Star on only 13 percent of control group calls, and the
32:1127:92214:16:17:72:459:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:median time spent discussing Energy Star within this 13 percent was 15 seconds.
32:1128:92293:17:16:88:539:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition 2 states that agents will provide more information when incentivized to do so, but
32:1129:92387:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they  will  not  be  very  responsive  to  sales  incentives  if  information  has  small  effects  on  demand.
32:1130:92498:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The audit data show that agents provide at best slightly more information about Energy Star on

32:1132:92696:17:16:72:323:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not statistically significant in columns 2, 4, 6, and 7.
32:1133:92752:16:16:88:539:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Both of Propositions 1 and 2 illustrate the interaction between the supply and demand sides
32:1134:92843:16:17:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  market.   It  was  difficult  for  the  Retailer  to  increase  information  provision  through  the
32:1135:92952:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experiment  because  their  sales  agents  knew  that  most  consumers  would  be  unresponsive  to  the
32:1136:93056:16:17:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information.   The  small  Local  Average  Treatment  Effects  in  the  IV  and  Scaled  ITT  estimators,
32:1137:93161:17:16:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:combined  with  the  targeting  results  in  Table  7,  suggest  that  agents’  lack  of  compliance  is  best
32:1138:93271:16:17:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:characterized as “strategic,”  not “shirking.”  In the context of the model,  we mean that agents’
32:1139:93369:17:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information disclosure costαis low enough that if more consumers were “High types” that would
32:1140:93462:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potentially be interested in Energy Star, agents might devote more effort to marketing those models.
32:1141:93562:16:17:88:539:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition 3 states that sales incentives and customer rebates reinforce each other, because the
32:1142:93659:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rebate increases sales agents’ gains from responding to the sales incentive.  Although the standard
32:1143:93758:16:17:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:errors are wide, the point estimates in the sales data in Table 6 strongly support this: the combined
32:1144:93859:17:16:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Spiff and $100 rebate treatment substantially increases Energy Star purchase probability. The audit
32:1145:93958:16:17:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data provide evidence that is suggestive of the microfoundations for this result.  Specifically, agents
32:1146:94061:17:16:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:appear to be slightly more likely to market Energy Star on the spiff treatment calls as the rebates
32:1147:94160:16:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase from $0 to $25 to $100:  in Table 6, the point estimates in columns 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 all
32:1148:94258:16:17:72:224:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase as the rebates increase.
32:1149:94291:17:16:88:539:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  the  model  considers  a  potential  role  for  government-provided  sales  incentives,  which
32:1150:94395:16:17:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:could perhaps be a complement to product subsidies traditionally offered by governments and util-
32:1151:94492:17:16:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ity energy efficiency programs.  The empirical results in Table 6 suggest a strong complementarity
32:1152:94590:16:17:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between price reductions and sales incentives.  The model clarifies that government-provided in-
32:1153:94686:17:16:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:centives could increase welfare in the presence of an informational market failure, as long as firms
32:1154:94786:16:17:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  not  able  to  fully  “undo”  the  government  incentive  by  changing  their  agents’  compensation
32:1155:94891:17:32:72:118:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:structure.
32:1156:94901:32:23:72:330:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.5    Why Is Demand for Energy Star Low?
32:1157:94942:23:17:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Equation (7) shows that a minimum energy efficiency standard is more likely to increase welfare if
32:1158:95040:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the energy efficient product generates utility gains for a larger share of the population or if the cost
32:1159:95144:16:16:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of providing information is high.  Our results show that the experimental attempts at information
32:1160:95241:16:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provision do not significantly increase Energy Star demand. Does this suggest that minimum energy
33:1161:95340:0:17:72:456:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:efficiency standards might increase welfare by addressing imperfect information?
33:1162:95420:17:16:88:539:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A first potential explanation for our empirical results is that although the Energy Star product
33:1163:95516:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would generate gains for many consumers, the Retailer is not able to credibly inform consumers
33:1164:95610:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of this, perhaps due to time constraints on the sales interactions or an inability to credibly convey
33:1165:95711:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attributes of this higher-priced product.  If this were true, many consumers would remain unaware
33:1166:95808:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  Energy  Star  and  unconvinced  of  the  cost  savings.   A  second  explanation  is  that  the  Energy
33:1167:95915:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Star model would not in fact generate utility gains for many consumers, and consumers make an
33:1168:96008:17:16:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed decision to not purchase the product.  If this were true, consumers would be aware of the
33:1169:96106:16:16:72:355:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy Star product and the potential energy cost savings.
33:1170:96164:16:17:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We use results from the follow-up surveys to measure the importance of these two explanations.
33:1171:96258:17:16:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f7:B:Near the end of the survey,  we asked consumers,Some  water  heater  models  that  use  less  energy
33:1172:96358:16:17:71:539:510:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:B:are officially designated as Energy Star.  Did you buy an Energy Star model?The results suggest
33:1173:96453:17:16:71:539:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substantial confusion, consistent with the first explanation.  The top panel of Table 8 shows that
33:1174:96551:16:17:71:539:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:while only 2.1 percent actually purchased Energy Star, 52 percent of survey respondents think that
33:1175:96649:17:16:71:539:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they did.  This should be interpreted cautiously,  as there could have been experimenter demand
33:1176:96744:16:16:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects:  respondents may not have wanted to tell the interviewer that they had not purchased the
33:1177:96841:16:17:71:539:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy Star option.  We designed the survey specifically to reduce demand effects:  this was the
33:1178:96937:17:16:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:first question we asked about energy efficiency, and we asked it after a series of other questions that
33:1179:97040:16:17:71:407:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:signaled that the interviewer was not particularly interested in energy.
33:1180:97112:17:16:88:539:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Respondents who said they had not purchased Energy Star,  or who were ”Not Sure” but in
33:1181:97199:16:17:71:539:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fact had not,  were asked why they had not purchased Energy Star.  The bottom panel of Table
33:1182:97291:17:16:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:8 shows that the primary reason was high prices.  This is consistent with the second explanation
33:1183:97387:16:16:71:539:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of informed consumers choosing not to purchase Energy Star.  Fifteen percent of these consumers
33:1184:97482:16:17:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(or about seven percent of the entire surveyed population) report being unaware that there was an
33:1185:97579:17:16:71:165:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Energy Star option.
33:1186:97598:16:17:88:539:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  follow-up  survey  also  elicited  beliefs  over  energy  costs  for  standard  models  and  energy
33:1187:97702:17:16:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cost  savings  from  Energy  Star  models.   Table  9  shows  the  10th,  50th,  and  90th  percentiles  of
33:1188:97809:16:17:71:539:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:beliefs, along with the mean and the best estimate of the true value, from the yellow tags.  The
33:1189:97905:17:16:71:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:first question in Table 9 shows that consumers’ mean beliefs about water heater energy costs are
33:1190:98001:16:17:71:539:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:approximately in line with the yellow tags.  The second question, however, suggests that the mean
33:1191:98098:17:16:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  median  consumers  actually  overestimate  the  average  dollar  value  of  potential  cost  savings.
33:1192:98204:16:16:71:539:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The third question takes the ratio of the second question to the first, which translates to a percent
33:1193:98305:16:17:71:539:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:savings and can account for heterogeneity in consumers’ utilization.  The “true” mean energy cost
33:1194:98402:17:16:71:539:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:savings  on  the  yellow  tags  are  about  10  percent,  while  the  median  and  mean  consumers  report
33:1195:98508:16:16:71:539:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:believing  that  Energy  Star  could  save  25  and  32  percent,  respectively.15Of  course,  the  beliefs
33:1196:98615:16:15:80:539:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:15Additional (unreported) regressions show that confusion about Energy Star purchases and beliefs about Energy
33:1197:98725:15:0:72:410:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:Star savings do not vary across treatment groups, although estimates are imprecise.
34:1198:98810:0:17:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:were elicited in a phone survey and not made incentive compatible, so they should be interpreted
34:1199:98906:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cautiously.  Notwithstanding, they suggest that underestimating energy cost savings is not a barrier
34:1200:99006:16:39:72:182:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to Energy Star takeup.
34:1201:99028:39:27:72:173:619:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6    Conclusion
34:1202:99043:27:16:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Imperfect information is an oft-cited reason why regulators intervene in markets for energy-using
34:1203:99140:16:17:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:durables though mandatory information disclosure, subsidies, and standards.  In theory, one natural
34:1204:99239:17:16:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:way  for  consumers  to  learn  about  the  benefits  of  energy  efficient  products  is  through  retailers.
34:1205:99349:16:16:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Motivated by this, we partnered with a large nationwide retailer to test the effects of information
34:1206:99448:16:17:72:540:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provision, customer rebates, and sales incentives on the behavior of both sales agents and consumers.
34:1207:99549:17:16:72:539:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We also present a simple model which, while not a theoretical advanceper  se, helps to motivate
34:1208:99644:16:17:72:255:494:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the experiment and clarify the results.
34:1209:99683:17:16:88:539:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Results show that retailer-provided information is ineffective at increasing Energy Star demand,
34:1210:99779:16:17:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:even after adjusting for partial compliance by sales agents.  Knowing that information would be
34:1211:99874:17:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ineffective, sales agents appear to have marketed Energy Star to only the most receptive consumers,
34:1212:99973:16:17:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:strategically failing to provide information to the majority. Follow-up surveys provide some evidence
34:1213:100074:17:16:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that at least some consumers who bought from the Retailer are unaware of the Energy Star product
34:1214:100170:16:16:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or  confused  about  what  they  have  bought.   The  majority  of  consumers  who  bought  from  the
34:1215:100271:16:17:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Retailer and completed our survey, however, are aware of Energy Star and may even overestimate
34:1216:100365:17:16:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:its benefits.  These results highlight the difficulties that retailers can face in increasing demand for
34:1217:100469:16:17:72:540:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:energy efficient or otherwise “high-quality” products.  In this context, a key difficulty appears to
34:1218:100569:17:16:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be that many consumers still don’t view energy efficiency as a privately-beneficial investment, even
34:1219:100669:16:17:72:283:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:after the retailer’s attempts to inform them.
34:1220:100714:17:16:88:539:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The water heater market has some unusual features,  and our sample comprises only a small
34:1221:100803:16:16:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:share of that market.  What broader lessons can be drawn from our results?  First, our results fit
34:1222:100901:16:17:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into a broader set of results from the literature suggesting that while social comparisons or various
34:1223:101002:17:16:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:forms of persuasion can motivate pro-environmental behaviors, hard information about energy costs
34:1224:101099:16:17:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:seems to have more limited effects.  As our model makes clear, “hard” information about product
34:1225:101194:17:16:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:availability  (as  well  as  product  costs  and  benefits)  is  more  relevant  from  a  welfare  perspective
34:1226:101304:16:17:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because  a  regulator’s  inability  to  address  imperfect  information  could  justify  corrective  policies,
34:1227:101414:17:16:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:while the welfare implications of persuasion are less clear.  Our experimental design does not allow
34:1228:101514:16:17:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:us to cleanly distinguish whether consumers are more generally uninformed or whether they are
34:1229:101607:17:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:simply disinterested in information from the retailer’s agents.  Notwithstanding, our survey results
34:1230:101707:16:16:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:help  somewhat  to  resolve  this  question.   Furthermore,  the  water  heater  market  is  certainly  one
34:1231:101814:16:17:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where consumers begin the process with very little information and do rely on agents’ knowledge
34:1232:101909:17:0:72:261:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for many other aspects of the purchase.
35:1233:101950:0:17:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  our  theoretical  and  empirical  results  clearly  suggest  that  policymakers  interested  in
35:1234:102054:17:16:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing the effects of subsidy dollars on Energy Star purchases might consider allocating some
35:1235:102151:16:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentives to sales agents, not just to consumers.  While the magnitude of our effect size is certainly
35:1236:102254:17:16:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specific to our context, this general suggestion is novel. Third, our results provide unusually granular
35:1237:102358:16:17:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:insight into the role of sales agents in the process of information disclosure.  In many situations
35:1238:102457:17:16:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:like ours, a firm or policymaker must consider how to incentivize agents if they want to increase
35:1239:102554:16:17:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information disclosure.  In equilibrium, firms and policymakers can also potentially learn about the
35:1240:102654:17:0:72:455:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:value of information from whether experienced sales agents choose to provide it.
