2:25:1034:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:National saving rates differ enormously across developed countries. But these differences obscure
2:26:1131:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:a common trend, namely a dramatic decline over time. France and Italy, for example, saved over 17
2:27:1228:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:percent of national income in 1970, but less than 7 percent in 2006. Japan saved 30 percent in 1970,
2:28:1328:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:but only 8 percent in 2006. And the U.S. saved 9 percent in 1970, but only 2 percent in 2006. What
2:29:1426:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:explains these international and intertemporal differences? Is it demographics, government spending,
2:30:1526:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:productivity growth or preferences? Our answer is preferences. Developed societies are placing increasing
2:31:1631:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:weight on the welfare of those currently alive, particularly contemporaneous older generations. This
2:32:1731:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:conclusion emerges from estimating two models in which society makes consumption and labor supply
2:33:1828:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:decisions in light of uncertainty over future government spending, productivity, and social preferences.
2:34:1932:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:The two models differ in terms of the nature of preference uncertainty and the extent to which current
2:35:2034:14:42:72:421:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:society can control future societies' spending and labor supply decisions.

3:56:2484:32:24:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:National saving rates di§er enormously across developed countries.  But these di§erences
3:57:2572:24:24:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mask a common trend, namely a dramatic decline over time.   Table 1 documents this
3:58:2654:24:24:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:phenomenon. It shows national saving rates for the U.S., Japan, U.K., France, Italy, Spain,
3:59:2745:24:24:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Canada for selected years from 1970 through 2006. With the exception of Canada, each
3:60:2833:24:24:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countryís saving rate plummeted over this period.  France, for example, saved 17.3 percent
3:61:2923:24:24:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of national income in 1970.  In 2006 it saved only 6.6 percent.  Italy saved 17.4 percent of
3:62:3015:24:23:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its income in 1970, but only 4.2 percent rate in 2006.  And the U.S. saved at 9.5 percent of
3:63:3107:23:24:72:315:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its income in 1970, but almost nothing in 2006.
3:64:3154:24:24:89:540:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:What explains these di§erences across countries and over time?  Is it changes in de-
3:65:3238:24:24:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mographics, preferences, government spending or economic conditions?  To address this
3:66:3323:24:24:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:question, we estimate a model in which the government and household sector jointly make
3:67:3410:24:24:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:labor supply and consumption decisions.  This societal decision-making framework is mo-
3:68:3497:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tivated by Green and Kotliko§ís (2006) demonstration that economic models with rational
3:69:3584:24:24:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agents draw no distinction between private and public property.  Instead, the government
3:70:3672:24:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and household sectors e§ectively play the role of two people stranded on an island, each
3:71:3760:24:24:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of whom can claim, via "o¢ cial," "legal," or informal proclamation, to own all or part of
3:72:3850:24:24:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the islandís resources, including his own and the other partyís time.  But such claims have
3:73:3941:24:23:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:no economic basis or import.  What each person ends up consuming in goods and leisure
3:74:4026:23:24:72:467:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depends on fundamental factors, including the ability to threaten and cajole.
3:75:4103:24:24:89:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our one-good, closed-economy model assumes that the government and the public (so-
3:76:4185:24:24:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ciety) resolve their conáicts and capitalize on their opportunities by agreeing to maximize a
3:77:4278:24:24:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:social welfare function. This function equals the expected discounted áow of utility from the
3:78:4371:24:24:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:publicís future consumption and leisure.  Each periodís consumption and leisure decisions
3:79:4460:24:24:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are made in light of uncertain future levels of productivity and government spending as well
3:80:4552:24:24:72:265:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as uncertain future social preferences.
3:81:4591:24:0:89:540:78:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We model social preference-uncertainty in two ways.  In model 1, current society is in
4:82:4678:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:charge forever. It knows its current intertemporal preferences (rate of time preference) and
4:83:4770:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:current intratemporal preferences (relative weighting of di§erent age groupsíutilities from
4:84:4861:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption and leisure). What it doesnít know is its future intertemporal preferences (how
4:85:4952:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its rate of time preference will evolve).  Model 2 is a time-inconsistency variant of model 1.
4:86:5046:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Rather than posit a single society that is in charge forever, we permit the society in charge
4:87:5139:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to change each period.  Although each society knows for sure its future preferences, each
4:88:5228:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:society realizes that it can control future social consumption and leisure allocation decisions
4:89:5323:24:24:72:367:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only indirectly via the amount of capital it leaves behind.
4:90:5382:24:24:89:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We use the method of moments to estimate the two models for the U.S., France, and Italy.
4:91:5470:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:All six sets of results point to the same culprit for the declines in national rates of saving,
4:92:5565:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:namely changing social preferences that place ever greater weight on current generations
4:93:5653:23:48:72:224:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative to future generations.

8:255:11522:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:society has a similar problem to that of the(T-1)society except that it must consider how

8:257:11680:23:24:89:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We use Monte Carlo simulations to determine how a society prevailing at timesmakes

8:262:12120:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constitutes the optimal time-sdecision.  The Monte Carlo simulations entail taking draws

11:353:17769:24:24:72:539:496:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f7:B:are very close.  Statistically, the goodness of Öt between the two series is assessed by a-2
11:354:17861:24:24:72:539:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:test or the correspondingp-value. Each model easily passes the-2-test, with-2values well
11:355:17949:24:23:72:539:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:below the 5 percent critical value of 5.991.  Thep-value here references the probability of
11:356:18040:23:24:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rejecting the hypothesis that the actual and simulated moment are equal when they are,
11:357:18126:24:24:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indeed, equal.  So a higher probability means the test is more reliable.  Based on thep-
11:358:18214:24:24:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:values, model 1 provides a slightly more reliable Öt for the U.S., whereas model 2 provides
11:359:18305:24:24:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a slightly more reliable Öt for France.  For Italy, model 1 provides a much more reliable Öt

11:366:18826:23:24:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ically reasonable and remarkably similar across models and countries.  Take model 2.  The

11:370:19201:12:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:this method entails Ötting the moments of the simulated series to their real data counterparts under the

12:378:19883:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country. As expected, the weights rise with age through middle age for all countries and for
12:379:19975:24:24:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both models. For the U.S. and Italy, the proÖles then head south (apart from an increase at
12:380:20066:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:very old ages in Italyís model 2). For France, the weights continue to rise with age in model
12:381:20159:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1; in model 2, the weights peak and then start to rise again around age 85.  These larger
12:382:20248:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:utility weights at older ages may reáect social preferences toward providing the elderly with
12:383:20341:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expensive age-related health care services.  Or they may simply reáect the inability of our
12:384:20432:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimating procedure to closely pin down the value of the cubic coe¢ cient in the polynomial
12:385:20524:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:used to capture the age-weight relationship. Another point of interest are the shapes of the
12:386:20616:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:age-weight proÖles for the three countries.  They suggest that French and Italian societies
12:387:20707:24:24:71:525:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:place relatively more weight on the well being of the elderly than does American society.
12:388:20796:24:24:89:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Tables 7 - 9 address our main question: Has social time-discounting or age-weighting
12:389:20880:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changed over time in each country in ways that help explain observed declines in the three
12:390:20970:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countriesínational saving rates?  The answer is yes, with time-discounting playing the key
12:391:21060:24:24:71:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:role. As these tables indicate, the initial discount fact,\f0, exceeds its long-run value,\f, for
12:392:21157:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:each country.  Hence, over time, each country places less and less weight on the well being
12:393:21248:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of those coming in the future.12The di§erences between\f0and\fmay seem small, but
12:394:21329:24:17:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they can be substantial when translated into time preference rates.  For U.S., the long-run
12:395:21420:17:13:81:488:188:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:11Note that a value above 1 is to be expected given that we are have not detrended the data.
12:396:21512:13:15:81:539:175:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:12Note that the values of\f0and\fboth exceed1.  Given that the model we are estimating has a Önite
12:397:21610:15:12:72:540:160:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:horizon (year 2100), this presents no problem with respect to an explosive value of the expected utility
12:398:21714:12:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:maximand. Furthermore, given secular growth in consumption, we would expect a discount factor above1.
12:399:21815:12:12:71:540:136:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f14:F:As discussed in Jonsson and Klein (1996) and Cooley and Prescott (1995), a discount factor in excess of1
12:400:21919:12:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:can be consistent with long-run secular growth and inÖnite horizon utility.  One simply needs to normalize
12:401:22025:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:the model for labor-augmenting technical change and note that the normalized discount factor is less than
12:402:22130:12:12:72:539:100:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f2:F:1; i.e., that the normalized model has a Önite maximand.  Instead of adopting this approach, we preferred
12:403:22235:12:0:72:384:88:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:to estimate the labor-augmenting technical change rate as a parameter.
13:404:22307:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time preference rate is 36.1 percent higher than its initial (1950) value for both models. For
13:405:22401:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:France, the long-run increase in time preference rates is 9.2 percent in the case of model 1
13:406:22493:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and 9.0 percent in the case of model 2.  For Italy, thereís a 54.0 percent rise in the time
13:407:22584:24:24:72:475:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:preference rate based on model 1 and a 8.2 percent increase based on model 2.
13:408:22661:24:24:89:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This shift toward present-orientation ináuences national saving.  Tables 10 - 12 show
13:409:22746:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:actual and simulated saving rates for each country under models 1 and 2. The rows labeled
13:410:22835:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:"baseline" refer to the saving rates generated by the two models.  Thef ixed \frow shows
13:411:22923:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:how each countryís saving rate would have evolved had the discount factor remained at its
13:412:23012:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1950 level.  In both the baseline and Öxed-\fsimulations, we start in 1950 and run our
13:413:23098:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models forward setting all error terms to zero.  In the U.S., the simulated national saving
13:414:23189:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates are very similar for both models and accord fairly well with actual rates for 1970, 1990,
13:415:23284:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and 2000.  For 1980, the simulated saving rates under each model are much lower than the
13:416:23372:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observed rate.  Given that we are assuming no shocks to the economy in the simulations,
13:417:23459:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we wouldnít expect a close relationship between actual and simulated rates in all years.  In
13:418:23551:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the case of France, the two modelsíbaseline simulated saving rates are also in fairly close
13:419:23642:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agreement, although they do less well than in the case of the U.S. in predicting observed
13:420:23731:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:saving rates.  For Italy, the two baselines saving rate paths di§er considerably with neither
13:421:23824:24:24:72:297:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matching observed saving rates very closely.
13:422:23868:24:24:89:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:According to both models, saving rates would have been either substantially or dramati-
13:423:23955:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cally higher had American, French, and Italian societies not become so focused on immediate
13:424:24046:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gratiÖcation.  The U.S. saving rate is more than twice as large in 2000 with a Öxed\fthan
13:425:24135:24:23:72:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is with a declining\f, which is the baseline case.  Under model 2, the year-2000 Öxed-\f
13:426:24226:23:24:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:saving rate is almost 50 percent larger than the declining-\frate.  For France, model 1ís
13:427:24315:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Öxed-\fsimulation produces a year-2000 rate of saving thatís almost 80 percent higher than
13:428:24405:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the baseline value.  This di§erential Ögure is just over 60 percent higher in model 2.  For
13:429:24496:24:24:72:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Italy, model 1 generates a year-2000 saving rate thatís more than one third higher when\f
13:430:24585:24:0:72:477:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stays Öxed; model 2 generates a year-2000 rate thatís over three times as large!
14:431:24667:0:24:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One response to these Öndings is that estimating a declining\fwas virtually guaranteed
14:432:24753:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:given that weíre Ötting declining national saving rates and that a declining value of\fcan
14:433:24843:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easily track this.  Our response is that we arenít Ötting the saving rates per se.  Instead,
14:434:24935:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weíre Ötting the second moments listed in Table 3. In addition, there are other factors in the
14:435:25029:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model that might have explained the decline in national saving rates, producing estimates
14:436:25118:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of\fabove those for\f0.  These include the countriesíchanging demographics, trends in
14:437:25203:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:government spending, trends in multifactor productivity growth and the interactions of these
14:438:25295:24:61:72:509:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trends with the levels of the utility-function parameters and other model parameters.
14:439:25380:61:32:72:180:479:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5  Conclusions
14:440:25394:32:24:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:National saving rates have been declining dramatically in developed countries in recent
14:441:25481:24:24:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decades.   This paper estimates two models for the U.S., France, and Italy, with both
14:442:25566:24:23:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models featuring uncertain future rates of social time-preference.  In one model, current
14:443:25655:23:24:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:social decision makers remain in charge over time.  The second model incorporates time-
14:444:25742:24:24:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inconsistency under which current social decision makers can only indirectly ináuence future
14:445:25834:24:24:72:477:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:social decision makers via the amount of capital they leave for their successors.
14:446:25915:24:24:89:540:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Parameter estimates from both models show that shifts in societal preferences, which
14:447:25999:24:24:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have placed ever greater weight on immediate gratiÖcation, are the principal reason that the
14:448:26091:24:24:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S., France, and Italy are saving at much lower rates now than they did in the past.  Of
14:449:26180:24:24:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:course, most future consumption and leisure will be done by future generations. Hence, our
14:450:26270:24:0:72:430:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results are, in part, indicative of growing intergenerational selÖshness.
