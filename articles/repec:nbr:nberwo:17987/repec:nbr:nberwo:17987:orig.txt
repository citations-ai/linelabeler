2:30:1680:28:28:273:338:615:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:31:1688:28:14:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Beginning in the mid-2000s, the incidence of drug shortages rose, especially for generic injectable
2:32:1787:14:14:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:drugs such as anesthetics and chemotherapy treatments. We examine whether reimbursement changes
2:33:1882:14:14:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contributed to the shortages, focusing on a reduction in Medicare Part B reimbursement to providers
2:34:1981:14:14:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for drugs. We hypothesize that lower reimbursement put downward pressure on manufacturers’ prices
2:35:2078:14:14:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which reduced manufacturers’ incentives to invest in capacity, reliability, and new launches. We show
2:36:2179:14:14:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that, after the policy change, shortages rose more for drugs with (i) higher shares of patients insured
2:37:2282:14:14:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by Medicare, (ii) greater decreases in provider reimbursement, and (iii) greater decreases in manufacturer
2:38:2388:14:42:72:104:489:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:prices.

3:56:2769:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:jectable drugs (Figure 1). Examples include drugs used in chemotherapy, antibiotics and anesthe-
3:57:2865:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sia, as well as injectable electrolytes and vitamins.  Shortages cause doctors and patients to seek
3:58:2964:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:alternatives that are unfamiliar or inferior. When substitutes are unacceptable, doctors and patients
3:59:3065:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:delay or forego treatment.1Most of the drugs that experienced shortages were off-patent and had

3:65:3541:21:22:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs in the United States. One such change was the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) which
3:66:3631:22:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduced Medicare reimbursement to the health care providers who administer these drugs.3We
3:67:3721:22:22:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:begin by specifying a theoretical model of how reimbursement policy and market size influence
3:68:3814:22:21:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shortages. Our model implies that the decision by manufacturers to invest in reliability and quality
3:69:3914:21:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:depends  on  the  expected  returns.4If  the  returns  are  sufficiently  high,  then  manufacturers  will

4:83:5328:22:25:72:532:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:newer or more robust manufacturing lines. These actions can reduce the likelihood of shortages.
4:84:5423:25:22:87:539:661:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Consistent with the theoretical model, the empirical results suggest supply-side responses to de-
4:85:5520:22:22:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:creasing margins. We begin by showing that drugs which had greater exposure to the policy change
4:86:5616:22:21:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:experienced greater increases in shortages.  Exposure to the policy change is measured using the
4:87:5712:21:22:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare market share (MMS) – the fraction of a drug’s revenue that comes from Medicare fee for
4:88:5807:22:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:service patients. This metric is similar to the Medicare market share measure used by Duggan and
4:89:5903:22:21:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Scott Morton (2010) who study the effect of introducing Medicare Part D. Then, to explore our
4:90:5996:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:theorized mechanisms by which the policy change could lead to more shortages, we test compara-
4:91:6090:22:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tive statics from the theoretical model. In particular, we show that drugs for which reimbursements
4:92:6189:22:21:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fell by more after the policy change had greater increases in shortages. These results hold whether

4:94:6381:22:22:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:policy, but an indirect measure of manufacturer profitability) or a manufacturers’ average revenue
4:95:6479:22:21:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per dose (which was indirectly affect by the policy, but a direct measure of manufacturer profitabil-
4:96:6580:21:26:72:92:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ity).
4:97:6585:26:21:87:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These  relationships  are  quantitatively  important.   We  estimate  that  a  sterile  injectable  drug
4:98:6689:21:22:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which has 10% less Medicare market share would have .66 fewer expected shortages days per
4:99:6778:22:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year after the policy change,  from a mean of 60.   Likewise,  a 10% drop in reimbursements to
4:100:6872:22:21:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:providers would increase the number of expected shortage days by 2.8 per year. The median drop
4:101:6966:21:22:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in reimbursement from Medicare to providers for generic sterile injectable drugs after the policy
4:102:7063:22:37:72:185:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:change is roughly 50%.

4:104:7100:25:21:87:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated.   A manufacturer must receive approval by
4:105:7190:21:22:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before being allowed to produce a generic phar-
4:106:7279:22:22:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maceutical.   To be approved,  the manufacturer must persuade the FDA that its generic drug is
4:107:7373:22:21:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pharmaceutically equivalent to the branded drug and that the manufacturing process follows good
4:108:7468:21:22:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing practices including ensuring sterility for injectable dosage forms (Scott Morton,
4:109:7563:22:22:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1999). Entry into branded drugs is also highly regulated, requiring a new molecule to demonstrate
4:110:7660:22:0:72:275:75:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:efficacy and safety compared to a placebo.
5:111:7703:0:22:87:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Sterile injectable drugs are typically administered in a clinical setting, such as a physician’s
5:112:7799:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:office or in a hospital.  In the U.S. a typical generic sterile injectable drug is produced by three to
5:113:7902:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:four of the seven big generic injectable manufacturers.5Sterility is critical for injectable drugs be-
5:114:8004:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cause they are administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously rather than passing
5:115:8101:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:through the gastrointestinal tract.  Manufacturing lines can be contaminated by bacteria, fungus,
5:116:8198:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or mold which causes delays to clean up the problem.  In some cases,  remediation is so costly
5:117:8292:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relative to expected profit that the manufacturer stops producing the drug.  Shortages might also
5:118:8389:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:occur due to disruptions to supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Once one manufacturer

5:120:8584:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:other manufacturers might not find it profitable to produce more units of the drug, or might not be
5:121:8683:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:licensed to produce more of the drug, or might have been affected by the same supply shock as
5:122:8776:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the other manufacturer. According to our IMS Health data sample which we detail later, injectable
5:123:8873:21:26:72:375:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs totaled $83.3 billion dollars and 3.7 billion units in 2010.

5:125:9048:21:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare-eligible patient being treated for cancer. She visits her provider who administers a drug
5:126:9146:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:through injection or infusion.  The provider paid the price of the drug to a manufacturer (through
5:127:9244:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a wholesaler).  The provider is reimbursed by Medicare for the drug.  The difference between the
5:128:9340:21:22:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:amount that Medicare reimburses for the drug and the manufacturer’s price is the gross margin
5:129:9433:22:22:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for  the  provider.6Henceforth,  “manufacturer’s  price”  will  refer  to  a  payment  from  a  provider
5:130:9537:22:21:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to a manufacturer (through a wholesaler),  while “reimbursement” will refer to a payment from
5:131:9630:21:31:71:275:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare or a private insurer to a provider.

5:133:9702:25:22:87:539:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare provides health insurance for seniors and the disabled. Medicare covers hospitals and
5:134:9796:22:22:71:539:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hospice (Part A), as well as physician visits and outpatient services (Part B). Under Part B, physi-
5:135:9896:22:21:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cians are reimbursed when they administer a drug (often a sterile injectable). Until 2005, Medicare
5:136:9995:21:22:71:539:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Part B reimbursed providers for drugs based on Average Wholesale Price (AWP). However, AWP
5:137:10085:22:17:71:539:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:was a list price, not an actual average price.  According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Com-

5:139:10286:16:8:72:359:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:manufacturers, as well as smaller manufacturers, experienced shortages.

7:153:10829:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mission  (2003):  “[AWP]  does  not  correspond  to  any  transaction  price...   AWP  has  never  been
7:154:10932:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:defined by statute or regulation.  Individual AWPs are compiled in compendia like the Red Book
7:155:11026:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and First Databank”. As such, the AWP was often substantially higher than the actual transaction
7:156:11122:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (2003) cited some dramatic examples: Vincasar,
7:157:11212:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a chemotherapy drug, had an AWP of $740, while being sold to physicians for $7.50.7Berndt
7:158:11301:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2005) provides a detailed history of AWP. By raising AWP, manufacturers could raise the prof-
7:159:11395:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:itability of providers that chose their drug.  However, the threat of litigation and new regulation
7:160:11494:22:25:72:200:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probably disciplined AWP.
7:161:11519:25:22:87:539:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) (officially known as the Medicare Prescrip-
7:162:11608:22:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003) created the retail drug benefit known as
7:163:11701:22:21:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare Part D and changed reimbursement under Medicare Part B. In 2004,  MMA changed
7:164:11787:21:22:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare reimbursement from the previously used 95% of AWP to 85% of AWP. Starting Jan-
7:165:11874:22:22:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uary 1,  2005,  Medicare began to  reimburse these drugs at 106% of the previous two quarter’s
7:166:11968:22:21:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Average Sales Price (ASP). The ASP is the volume-weighted average price across all manufac-
7:167:12059:21:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turers of a given drug to all buyers from two quarters prior.  The ASP captures actual transaction
7:168:12157:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices, including most discounts and rebates.  A study by the Office of Inspector General found
7:169:12252:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the median percentage difference between AWP and ASP was 50% (Office of Inspector Gen-
7:170:12343:21:22:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:eral, 2005).  The change resulted in decreases on the order of 50% of reimbursements for these
7:171:12437:22:22:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs to providers as seen in Figure 3.  Furthermore the policy change clearly affected the level
7:172:12534:22:21:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of reimbursements paid by Medicare as shown in Figure 4.  There is a clear drop in revenue paid
7:173:12629:21:22:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by Medicare in 2005, followed by below private growth in Medicare reimbursements.  The ASP
7:174:12719:22:22:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regime is not a government price control, but rather cost-based reimbursement, however it resulted
7:175:12817:22:25:72:413:227:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:in much less generous reimbursements than the previous AWP regime.8
7:176:12884:25:22:87:539:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The reimbursement change only directly affected Medicare fee-for-service.  Private insurance
7:177:12976:22:21:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Medicare Advantage, which is administered by private insurers, were not directly affected.
7:178:13070:21:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Enrollment in Medicare Advantage grew during the sample period from 13 percent of Medicare
7:179:13160:18:12:85:366:141:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:7AWP was jokingly referred to as “Ain’t What’s Paid” (Mullen, 2007).
7:180:13228:12:16:85:539:129:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:8The fact that ASP is based on two quarters previous introduces some rigidity into the price mechanism which
7:181:13336:16:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:likely doesn’t help alleviate shortages. However, ASPs frequently rise by more than 6% from quarter to quarter in the
7:182:13453:12:12:72:540:101:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:data, so we conclude that this aspect of the switch to ASP is second order compared to the decrease in the realized
7:183:13568:12:0:72:174:89:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:levels of reimbursements.

8:192:14298:13:14:115:540:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to 2003. The number of drugs in sample is allowed to vary over time. The red line is revenue for
8:193:14394:14:0:115:336:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the drugs in the IMS data which are in our sample.
9:194:14445:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enrollees in 2005 to 27 percent in 2012. However, it is quite common for private insurers to mimic
9:195:14543:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare reimbursement, albeit with a lag (Clemens and Gottlieb, 2013).  Indeed, in 2007, 21%
9:196:14636:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of surveyed private payers planned to mimic ASP, while 76% intended to use rates above ASP or
9:197:14729:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not use ASP (Mullen, 2007).  In 2012, seven years after the change to ASP by Medicare, private
9:198:14823:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insurers were using ASP for 55% of patients, according to a survey (Magellan Rx Management,
9:199:14914:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2013). Private insurers were somewhat more generous than Medicare. In 2012, the average private
9:200:15009:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insurance markup over ASP was 18% (Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, 2013, p.48). Hence,
9:201:15097:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:while the change from AWP to ASP was immediate for the Medicare population, it was somewhat
9:202:15188:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more gradual for privately insured patients.  Nevertheless, we can think of it as being caused by
9:203:15285:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:government policy, because private insurers typically mimic Medicare.  Enrollment in Medicare
9:204:15378:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Advantage  grew  in  our  sample  period  which  would  create  a  counter-vailing  effect  except  that
9:205:15482:22:25:72:417:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:private insurers gradually followed the lead of Medicare to ASP pricing.
9:206:15554:25:22:87:539:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Another policy affected reimbursement during the sample period. The Medicaid 340b program
9:207:15643:22:21:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:requires that drug manufacturers offer discounts to outpatient facilities that can be classified as
9:208:15742:21:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“safety-net  providers”  for  low-income  patients.   The  number  of  drugs  purchased  through  340b
9:209:15844:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:covered entities grew during the period. Because these drugs are offered at a discount, the growth
9:210:15942:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:implies lower revenue for drug manufacturers.9While our estimates do not isolate the effect of
9:211:16036:21:22:71:539:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduced incentives because of 340b, the mechanism at work – reduced incentives because of poli-
9:212:16131:22:22:71:539:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cies that lower payments to manufacturers – is the same. However, drug purchases under the 340B
9:213:16226:22:21:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Program account for about 2 percent of all U.S. drug purchases (U.S. Department of Health and
9:214:16319:21:31:71:210:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Human Services, 2013, 311).

9:216:16392:25:22:87:539:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Because of the elevated reimbursement levels, prior to the policy change, both providers and
9:217:16484:22:22:71:539:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturers could capture (short-run) surplus.  For example, as much as half of an oncologists’
9:218:16581:22:18:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:income  may  have  come  from  the  surplus  on  drugs.   Likewise,  branded  manufacturers  charged
9:219:16681:18:15:85:539:153:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:9Occasionally, large price increases for generic drugs make the news.  Price increases tend to occur when manu-
9:220:16792:15:12:72:540:138:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:facturers have market power due to exits or acquisitions.  Our model (section 2) predicts higher generic prices when
9:221:16908:12:12:72:540:126:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:there are fewer manufacturers. However, these cases of large price increases for generics are rare. According to Janine
9:222:17027:12:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Burkett of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, “Price inflation among a few generic drugs has been in the
9:223:17139:12:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:news lately,” but the “Express Scripts Prescription Price Index shows that, since 2008, the average price of brand drugs
9:224:17259:12:0:72:498:90:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:has almost doubled, while the average price of generic drugs has been cut roughly in half” (Burkett, 2014).

10:226:17471:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:above marginal costs if fixed costs are large (some sterile injectable manufacturing requires costly

10:229:17709:26:21:87:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MMA caused providers to be reimbursed less.  Furthermore, the reimbursement change com-
10:230:17796:21:22:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pressed the scope of price differentiation for manufacturers.  With Medicare reimbursing at a 6
10:231:17891:22:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent markup on average price, providers that paid a 7 percent markup on average price would
10:232:17985:22:21:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lose money with each purchase. Hence, both manufacturers and providers likely lost surplus. This
10:233:18081:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is consistent with previous research on vertical relationships suggesting that large firms on each
10:234:18179:22:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:side of the market share the surplus (Crawford and Yurukoglu, 2012; Grennan, 2013; Ho and Lee,
10:235:18273:22:21:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2015). Through this channel, the decreased reimbursements to providers would reduced the prices
10:236:18368:21:22:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturer’s receive as well.  We investigate the relationship between provider reimbursement

10:241:18680:22:22:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reimbursement.  This class of models has been studied by Carlton (1978), Deneckere and Peck
10:242:18771:22:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1995),  and  Dana  (2001)  amongst  others.   We  consider  two  regimes:  list-price  reimbursement
10:243:18872:22:21:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(AWP) and cost reimbursement (ASP). The AWP regime features reimbursement at a list price that
10:244:18966:21:22:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is higher than what would normally be the acquisition price of the drug. The ASP regime features
10:245:19062:22:25:72:299:252:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:reimbursement based on costs to the provider.10

10:252:19665:16:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:does introduce some frictions into the flexibility of prices if health providers are unwilling to take a loss on individual

12:304:21520:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:what fraction of total capacity they own.12We assume that manufacturers produce up to capacity
12:305:21614:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and do not destroy any of their product even when the industry has over-produced.  One could
12:306:21706:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consider variations to this game that accounted for that type of behavior. For example, once shocks
12:307:21805:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are realized, new capacities could be announced publicly followed by a simultaneous move game
12:308:21898:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:where  each  manufacturer  decides  how  much  quantity  to  supply  to  the  market.   Depending  on
12:309:21999:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the realization of the shocks, a single manufacturer may be large enough to unilaterally withhold
12:310:22096:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enough quantity to avoid the market price falling to zero. Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (2002)
12:311:22192:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:document this type of behavior in the California electricity generation industry.  However, there
12:312:22289:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will still be states of the world where this incentive does not exist, and Medicare’s reimbursement
12:313:22388:22:25:72:342:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:under the AWP regime will affect investment incentives.
12:314:22443:25:22:87:539:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The incentive to invest in capacity is determined by integrating prices over the joint distribution

12:316:22638:22:21:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of firms is given by the maximum number of firms such that the variable profits of each firm are

13:341:23622:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or lower is ambiguous. When a firm enters the industry, it does not capture the full social value of

13:347:24183:22:22:71:539:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturers for Medicare patients even when the industry over-produces.  This implies higher
13:348:24277:22:21:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns to investing in capacity for manufacturers, thus more total capacity and fewer shortages.
13:349:24374:21:22:71:539:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The model is useful for empirical analysis because it predicts a differential impact of the AWP
13:350:24469:22:22:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reimbursement depending on features of the drug.  In particular, drugs with lower fixed costs and
13:351:24566:22:21:71:539:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that serve more Medicare patients will experience a greater increase in shortages moving from
13:352:24659:21:26:71:343:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:AWP to acquisition cost based reimbursement as in ASP.
13:353:24713:26:21:87:539:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The contracts negotiated between health providers, wholesalers, and manufacturers are more
13:354:24803:21:22:71:539:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:complicated  than  the  simple  model  put  forth  here.   Contracts  often  have  non-linearities  due  to
13:355:24910:22:22:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bundled discounts or quantity discounts or other material clauses.  Modeling the nexus of non-
13:356:25004:22:21:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:linear contracts between strategic agents would be an important advance to the maintained model.
13:357:25100:21:22:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:However, it is unlikely that such a model would change the result that moving from AWP to ASP
13:358:25193:22:22:71:539:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reimbursement decreases incentives to invest in capacity.  This is because in such models of the
13:359:25289:22:21:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nexus of linear contracts in other industries (for example Crawford and Yurukoglu (2012)) the price
13:360:25388:21:22:71:539:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the upstream firm, the manufacturer in this paper, will depend strongly on the surplus created by
13:361:25488:22:22:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consumption of the good and competition. Non-linearities in the contracts may reduce or sharpen
13:362:25583:22:21:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this dependence, but there is no theoretical basis that they would overturn the dependence.  Since
13:363:25681:21:22:71:539:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices and demand for each product determine the incentives to invest in capacity, the simple model
13:364:25780:22:37:71:413:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:here captures the first-order determinants of these investment decisions.
13:365:25853:37:25:76:137:165:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:3    Data
13:366:25862:25:21:87:539:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:An observation is a drug and year.  We refer to a drug as an active ingredient or combination
13:367:25955:21:19:71:539:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of active ingredients.  For example, the nutritional product Multiple Vitamins for Infusion (MVI)
13:368:26052:19:15:82:539:100:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:13In  this  model,  conditional  on  having  the  socially  optimal  number  of  firms,  the  capacity  choices  are  socially
13:369:26178:15:12:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:optimal.   This is because price rises topmaximmediately in a shortage.   With less flexible pricing or competitive
13:370:26293:12:0:72:399:73:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:pressures in shortage states, capacity investment could also be too low under ASP.

14:402:26688:47:13:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 5: Model’s predictions of shortage frequency as functions of model parameters.  The solid lines are
14:403:26794:13:14:115:540:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predictions for the cost-based ASP reimbursement regime. The dashed-dotted lines are predictions
14:404:26890:14:13:115:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:under the AWP reimbursement regime. Increasingpmaxmakes capacity investment more desirable
14:405:26980:13:14:115:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and can induce entry.  Raising market size has two effects:  (1) It makes entry more desirable as
14:406:27077:14:13:115:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there are more consumers for the medicine.  However, it also means that the industry needs to
14:407:27170:13:14:115:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:produce more to satisfy demand which can make capacity investment less attractive depending
14:408:27261:14:14:115:540:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the shape of the cost of capacity function.  When fixed costs increase, fewer firms enter.  This
14:409:27360:14:13:115:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leads to higher margins and more capacity investment in equilibrium.  Finally, when the share of
14:410:27456:13:14:115:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Medicare patients rises, capacity investment becomes more attractive in the AWP regime while it
14:411:27551:14:0:115:256:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is unaffected in the ASP regime.
15:412:27585:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is a combination of active ingredients that also exist as stand-alone drugs. We only consider drugs
15:413:27684:22:25:72:350:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whose route of administration is intravenous or injectable.
15:414:27743:25:22:87:539:661:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We use five data sources.  First, we use Medicare Part B revenue and quantity data from the
15:415:27834:22:22:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CMS Part B National summary files.  Second, we use privately-insured outpatient hospital (anal-
15:416:27929:22:21:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ogous to Medicare Part B) revenue and quantity data from the MarketScan Commercial Claims
15:417:28018:21:22:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Encounters Database. Third, we have total US drug revenue and quantity data across all pay-
15:418:28113:22:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ers (Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance) and settings (physicians, hospitals, retail) from IMS
15:419:28210:22:21:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Health.  Fourth, we have shortage data by molecule and year from the University of Utah Drug
15:420:28302:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Information Service. Fifth, we have approval dates and the number of manufacturers per molecule
15:421:28397:22:25:72:192:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from FDA Orange Book.
15:422:28418:25:22:87:539:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First, we use Medicare reimbursements and services given by the Part B national summary files.
15:423:28512:22:22:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The key variables are the total reimbursements by Medicare and number of services billed for a
15:424:28606:22:21:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code and year.  Providers use HCPCS
15:425:28691:21:22:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:codes to bill Medicare and private payers for procedures.  A typical HCPCS code represents one
15:426:28785:22:22:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:administration  of  a  drug.   For  example,  the  spending  by  Medicare  to  a  hospital  or  physician’s
15:427:28892:22:21:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:office on a lymphoma patient being treated by chemotherapy agent Doxorubicin once a month for
15:428:28985:21:22:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three months would show up as three services of HCPCS code J9000.  The same drug can have
15:429:29074:22:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:multiple HCPCS codes representing different dosages. We use data from 2001 to 2012 and adjust
15:430:29167:22:21:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reimbursements for inflation to year 2010 dollars.  CMS also provides data on the Average Sales
15:431:29262:21:22:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Price (ASP) by HCPCS code by quarter from 2005 to the present. The ASP is the quantity weighted
15:432:29357:22:22:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:average sales price accounting for discounts and rebates in the previous two quarters. The data for
15:433:29456:22:21:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Q1 2005 provide a glimpse at payments manufacturers were receiving for two quarters under the
15:434:29549:21:26:72:244:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:AWP based reimbursement scheme.
15:435:29580:26:21:87:539:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Second,  we  use  MarketScan  Commercial  Claims  and  Encounters  database  outpatient  files.
15:436:29675:21:22:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These data  are given  at the claims-level,  but we  aggregate to the  year and  HCPCS code.   The
15:437:29773:22:22:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data are not nationally representative, but rather they are a convenience sample of all claims from
15:438:29872:22:21:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:large employers and insurance plans.  The data only include enrollees who are under 65.  As dis-
15:439:29968:21:22:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cussed later, we reweight the data to match the population of the commericially insured population
15:440:30066:22:0:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the U.S. We use the years 2001-2009 to estimate the total non-Medicare spending, adjusted for
16:441:30164:0:26:72:378:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:inflation to year 2010 dollars, by year and HCPCS code as well.
16:442:30227:26:21:87:539:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Third, we use IMS MIDAS data for estimates of a drug’s total revenue for the years 2003 to
16:443:30317:21:22:72:540:661:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2010.  We use these data to esitmate sales to providers.  These data contain all payers, including
16:444:30415:22:25:72:336:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:private, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid.
16:445:30467:25:22:87:539:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Fourth, we use shortage data from the University of Utah Drug Information Service (UUDIS)
16:446:30556:22:22:72:540:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which archives shortages that were reported to the FDA or the Association of Health System Phar-
16:447:30652:22:21:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:macists  (ASHP)  by  providers  (hospitals  or  pharmacists)  or  manufacturers.   In  the  data,  a  drug
16:448:30758:21:22:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shortage is defined as “a supply issue that affects how the pharmacy prepares or dispenses a drug
16:449:30855:22:22:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:product  or  influences  patient  care  when  prescribers  must  use  an  alternative  agent”  (Fox  et  al.,
16:450:30964:22:21:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2009).  A report of a shortage leads to a response from the FDA and ASHP which usually results
16:451:31058:21:22:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in recommendations for rationing drugs and alternative drugs that can be used. Manufacturers are
16:452:31154:22:22:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also contacted to determine which manufacturers, if any, have emergency supplies.  This suggests
16:453:31250:22:21:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the reporting of shortages is vetted by manufacturers and the FDA. Shortages are molecule
16:454:31344:21:22:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and form (injectable or not) specific and are for the entire U.S. We also have information on the
16:455:31441:22:25:72:520:397:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:dates of shortage start and when they are resolved. We use shortage data from 2001 to 2012.14
16:456:31534:25:22:87:539:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Fifth, we use the Food and Drug Administration’s Orange Book for the years 2001-2012 to
16:457:31621:22:22:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:record how many approved manufacturers of a drug (active ingredient and route of administration
16:458:31716:22:21:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:combination) exist in each year, and the number of years since the earliest approval of a manufac-
16:459:31814:21:22:72:539:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turer of the drug.  The FDA Orange Book records each approved and active manufacturer15of a
16:460:31905:22:22:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given drug in a given year. Because the analysis is at the drug level, we collapse the observations of
16:461:32007:22:21:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a given drug into one observation per year. The Orange Book does not track biological pharmaceu-
16:462:32103:21:22:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ticals which are made by a biological process rather than chemical synthesis (e.g. insulin). These
16:463:32201:22:22:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs have a more complicated manufacturing process and have been subject to some shortages.
16:464:32293:22:21:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Most biologicals are still on patent.   This paper focuses on chemically-synthesized compounds
16:465:32387:21:18:72:316:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which make up the majority of administered drugs.
16:466:32436:18:16:82:539:159:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:14An alternative set of vaccine shortage data are offered by the FDA. The FDA uses a stricter definition of a shortage
16:467:32554:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:than the UUDIS. However, historical FDA data are not available. The UUDIS measures of shortages are widely used
16:468:32665:12:8:72:392:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the pharmaceutical literature Fox et al. (2009); Fox, Sweet and Jensen (2014).
16:469:32746:8:16:82:539:123:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:15Approved products whose manufacturers no longer actively market the product are listed as “discontinued” in
16:470:32855:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the Orange Book.   The number of manufacturers variable we construct from the Orange Book only counts active
16:471:32963:12:0:72:131:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:manufacturers.
17:472:32979:0:26:76:303:701:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:3.1    Medicare Market Share (MMS)
17:473:33013:26:21:87:539:675:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MMS is the fraction of a drug’s revenue from Medicare Part B. We use MMS to identify which
17:474:33103:21:22:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs will be more impacted by the Medicare reimbursement change. Hence, for MMS, cardinality
17:475:33196:22:25:72:290:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is not particularly important, but ordinality is.
17:476:33245:25:22:87:539:607:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We use two estimates of MMS. For both measures,  the numerator is Medicare Part B sales
17:477:33332:22:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to physicians.  These were the only sales directly affected by the policy change of switching to
17:478:33428:22:21:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ASP pricing.16The two MMS measures vary according to the denominator:  total drug revenue.
17:479:33518:21:22:71:539:542:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the first measure of MMS, the denominator is the sum of revenue for each drug from the IMS
17:480:33611:22:22:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:database.  In the second measure of MMS, the denominator is the sum of revenues for each drug
17:481:33704:22:21:71:539:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the MarketScan database plus the revenues to Medicare Part B. The number of people in the
17:482:33796:21:22:71:539:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MarketScan  data  rises  from  around  five  million  in  2001  to  37  million  in  2009.   To  create  the
17:483:33904:22:22:71:539:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MarketScan-based estimate of MMS for each year, we scale the revenue by drug as if the sample
17:484:33997:22:21:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were nationally representative.17For example, suppose there are 10 million individuals in a given
17:485:34094:21:22:71:539:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year in the MarketScan data.  We scale the revenue of each drug by the US population minus the
17:486:34188:22:25:71:468:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of individuals insured by Medicare and/or Medicaid divided by 10 million.
17:487:34268:25:22:87:539:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare serves seniors and those with kidney failure. Consistent with this, the drugs with the
17:488:34363:22:21:71:539:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:highest MMS include inhalants for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a progressive disease
17:489:34457:21:22:71:539:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:caused by smoking), Pegaptanib Sodium (for age-related macular degeneration) and Triptorelin
17:490:34549:22:22:71:539:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Pamoate (for prostate cancer).  Other drugs with the highest Medicare share are immunosuppres-
17:491:34643:22:22:71:539:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sants  used  in  kidney  transplants  which  are  covered  by  Medicare  for  all  ages.   The  drugs  with
17:492:34750:22:21:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the lowest Medicare share are those used by a younger population, including Somatrem (human
17:493:34841:21:22:71:539:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth hormone for children), Glatiramer Acetate (for multiple sclerosis), two drugs which treat
17:494:34937:22:25:71:330:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hyper-thyroidism, and Urofollitropin (a fertility drug).
17:495:34993:25:22:87:539:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While the data used to construct the numerator,  reimbursements from Medicare Part B, are
17:496:35082:22:21:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:all the payments affected by the policy change, we adjust our methods to handle imperfect data
17:497:35176:21:19:71:539:145:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the denominator.  The IMS measure is not perfect as it mixes revenues to manufacturers with
17:498:35270:19:15:82:539:126:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:16The Medicare Part B data do not include Medicare Advantage payments. In 2012, Medicare Advantage accounted
17:499:35378:15:8:72:209:111:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for 27% of all Medicare enrollees.
17:500:35412:8:16:82:539:103:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:17The data vendors do not claim that the data are nationally representative of the private insurance market. However,
17:501:35529:16:12:72:540:87:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Dunn, Liebman and Shapiro (2014) find evidence that reweighting MarketScan data improves the representativeness
17:502:35640:12:0:72:128:75:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the sample.
18:503:35656:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:revenues from Medicare to doctors.   Nonetheless,  it is a measure of the relative importance of
18:504:35752:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare  revenues  to  non-Medicare  revenues.   For  example,  if  revenue  to  a  manufacturer  is  a
18:505:35856:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constant fraction of reimbursements to doctors, then this measure would be equal to the true MMS
18:506:35952:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:times a constant.  As such, drugs which derive more of their revenue from Medicare would have
18:507:36045:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively higher values of this variable.  While not ideal for interpreting units, the first-order role
18:508:36149:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of this variable is to detect differences in the change in shortages between drugs which are more
18:509:36246:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or less reliant on Medicare.  The MarketScan measure might have some error because it is only a
18:510:36341:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:convenience sample of the under-65 private insurance market and misses sales to other payers like
18:511:36438:22:21:72:539:534:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, etc.  and sales in other settings like retail or inpatient hospital.18
18:512:36538:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As we discuss in section 4.1, we use an instrumental variables strategy to address this measurement
18:513:36637:22:31:71:97:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:error.
18:514:36643:31:25:76:218:460:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:3.2    Sample Definition
18:515:36667:25:22:87:539:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To combine these data sources, we begin with all HCPCS codes beginning with J (“HCPCS
18:516:36752:22:21:71:540:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:J Codes”), which indicates drug administration,19in the period 2000 to 2012 that we observe in
18:517:36846:21:22:71:539:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:some year’s Medicare Part B National Summary File. For each of the 690 observed unique HCPCS
18:518:36938:22:22:71:540:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:J codes,20we determine the relevant active ingredient(s) and route of administration by examining
18:519:37035:22:21:71:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the HCPCS description and searching the FDA Orange Book when possible.21This leaves 496
18:520:37122:21:22:71:539:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unique HCPCS J codes whose active ingredient(s) and route of administration have a match in
18:521:37213:22:22:71:539:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the FDA Orange Book.  We keep drugs whose route of administration is “injection,” leaving 396
18:522:37306:22:21:71:539:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:HCPCS  J  codes.   Some  drugs  have  multiple  dosages  with  different  HCPCS  J  codes.   The  396
18:523:37407:21:26:71:261:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:HCPCS codes correspond to 327 drugs.
18:524:37443:26:21:87:539:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We join this set of drugs to the shortage data by year, active ingredient(s), and route of admin-
18:525:37540:21:22:71:539:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:istration, keeping all unmatched observations.  If an observation from the matched set of drugs
18:526:37635:22:22:71:539:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with HCPCS code J does not match to any shortage observation, we record that drug as not having
18:527:37730:22:18:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shortages in the period of the sample.  We join these data to the collapsed FDA Orange Book by
18:528:37824:18:15:82:539:153:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:18Missing sales to other settings is less of concern because most drugs get most of their revenue from one setting.
18:529:37939:15:9:72:457:138:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For example, a drug mostly used in retail would not usually have large sales in a hospital setting.
18:530:38038:9:15:82:539:129:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:19Codes J0000 - J0849 indicates “Drugs other than Chemotherapy” and Codes J8521 to J9000 indicate “Chemother-
18:531:38147:15:8:72:119:114:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:apy Drugs.”
18:532:38158:8:12:82:435:106:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:20The average HCPCS J code contains 15.12 10-digit National Drug Code (NDC) codes.
18:533:38240:12:16:82:539:94:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:21The Orange Book does not cover biologics, vaccines, and some nutritional products that did not require FDA
18:534:38348:16:0:72:109:78:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:approval.
19:535:38359:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:active ingredient(s) and route of administration and year, keeping only matched observations.  In
19:536:38456:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:addition to the HCPCS J code drugs which don’t appear in the Orange Book22, this excludes all the
19:537:38553:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:FDA Orange Book approval data for drugs which are never allocated an HCPCS code beginning
19:538:38642:21:22:72:539:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with J.23The final sample consists of 308 drugs.  Of the 308 drugs in the sample, 62 are always
19:539:38737:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on-patent, 120 are always off-patent, and the other 126 switch from on-patent to off during the
19:540:38832:22:25:72:399:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sample period. The full list of drugs in the sample is in Appendix A.
19:541:38901:25:22:87:539:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Next, we join this set of drugs to the IMS MIDAS data by year, active ingredient(s), and route
19:542:38995:22:21:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of administration.  Ten drugs were dropped because their MMS was greater than 1.  This leaves
19:543:39088:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the sample of drugs which have a MarketScan MMS and Medicare Reimbursement information at
19:544:39177:22:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:298. An additional two drugs do not have Medicare reimbursement associated with them. With the
19:545:39271:22:21:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IMS data, because we are merging by ingredient name, there is not perfect overlap, for 42 drugs
19:546:39366:21:22:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we were unable to match an IMS observation to that ingredient.  This leaves the sample of drugs
19:547:39461:22:25:72:341:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which have IMS MMS and payment information at 256.
19:548:39511:25:22:87:539:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Finally, we join these data to the Medicare reimbursements from the Part B National Summary
19:549:39602:22:22:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:File by HCPCS code and year, average ASP by HCPCS code and year24, and private payments from
19:550:39694:22:21:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MarketScan data by HCPCS code and year.  There are seventeen additional active ingredient(s)
19:551:39786:21:22:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and route of administration combinations which never manifest in the MarketScan data. These are
19:552:39881:22:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nearly all on patent at some point in the sample period, and so do not affect the major results of the
19:553:39983:22:36:72:108:310:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:paper.25
19:554:39991:36:25:76:242:274:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:4    Empirical Analysis
19:555:40014:25:22:87:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We begin by using a differences-in-differences identification strategy to show that drugs that
19:556:40108:22:22:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:had greater exposure to the Medicare policy change, measured using the Medicare market share
19:557:40200:22:21:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(MMS), had the greatest increases in shortages (section 4.1).  Ultimately, our model suggests that
19:558:40298:21:22:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shortages  result  from  reduced  manufacturer’s  prices,  which  we  hypothesize  results  from  lower
19:559:40401:22:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reimbursements to providers.  We show that reduced reimbursement to providers, caused by the
19:560:40493:18:16:82:539:144:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:22There are seven such HCPCS J codes.  These drugs all were matched by ingredient, but the indicated route of
19:561:40602:16:8:72:270:128:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:administration does not exist in the Orange Book.
19:562:40651:8:12:82:400:120:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:23These are the majority of all drugs, such as prescription tablets taken at home.
19:563:40733:12:12:82:319:108:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:24Because of data availability, the matching begins in 2004.
19:564:40793:12:16:82:539:96:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:25We also ran the analysis assigning this subset of drugs an MMS of 1 and a degenerate age distribution at 60. The
19:565:40907:16:0:72:292:80:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:results of the paper are not sensitive to this assignment.
20:566:40967:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:policy change, is correlated with increased shortages (section 4.2).  Then consistent with our pre-
20:567:41066:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:diction that reduced incentives to manufacturers would lead to more shortages, we show that lower
20:568:41163:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices to manufacturers are correlated with more shortages (section 4.3).  Following the discus-
20:569:41259:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sion of vertical markets with bargaining power on each side (section 1.2),  we show that lower
20:570:41353:22:25:72:503:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reimbursements to providers are correlated with lower manufacturer’s prices (section 4.4).
20:571:41443:25:22:87:539:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Throughout this section the unit of analysis is a drug and year. We log Medicare market share
20:572:41536:22:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:because the observed distribution of MMS is skewed.   Similarly,  we log prices throughout the

20:574:41724:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:period for the IMS data is shorter than the whole sample, we average across years to get compute

20:577:41899:25:22:87:539:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First, we test the hypothesis that those drugs most affected by the ASP reimbursement, drugs
20:578:41991:22:21:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which derive a large fraction of their revenues from Medicare Part B, experience larger increases
20:579:42088:21:22:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in shortages.  We use a difference-in-difference model where the treatment used is the Medicare
20:580:42183:22:22:72:539:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Part B) Market Share (MMSi) of drugiand the second difference is before and after the policy
20:581:42276:22:21:71:539:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:change.  The specification is motivated by the assertion that Medicare Market Share is a feature
20:582:42372:21:22:71:539:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the diseases that the drug treats, and is not affected by post-policy changes in the unobservable
20:583:42472:22:22:71:539:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:determinants  of  shortage  days.   The  first  set  of  regressions  uses  a  binary  pre  and  post  period,
20:584:42582:22:21:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:where the treatment was assumed to be applied in 2005, when ASP based pricing went into effect.
20:585:42677:21:65:71:209:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Formally, this is modeled as:
20:586:42706:65:43:119:540:215:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:Shortageit=αi+δt+βPostt×log(MMSi) +γ1(Off Patentit) +-it(1)

20:589:42955:22:21:71:540:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a general time trend.  Then, assuming parallel trends without treatment,βis the treatment effect
20:590:43051:21:22:71:540:107:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:– the extra shortage days caused by having higher MMS post-regulation.1(OffPatentit)is an
20:591:43140:22:0:71:539:85:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indicator for whether that drug and year observation was off patent. We classify a drug as off patent
21:592:43243:0:26:72:384:708:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:if it has been at least 15 years since the molecule was approved.26
21:593:43310:26:21:87:539:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As discussed in (Section 3.1) we are concerned about error in our measures of MMS. Under the
21:594:43402:21:22:72:539:661:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assumption of classical measurement error, the coefficient on the interaction term,β, will be at-
21:595:43499:22:22:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tenuated towards zero.  We therefore employ instrumental variables to deal with the measurement
21:596:43594:22:21:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:error.   Because we ultimately interact MMS with the ASP reimbursement dummy variable,  we
21:597:43684:21:22:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:follow the suggestion in Procedure 21.1 of Wooldridge (2010) to first use the MarketScan based
21:598:43778:22:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MMS estimate and the mean age of patients who receive the drug in the MarketScan database as
21:599:43870:22:21:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instrumental variables for the IMS database-based MMS estimate.27We then interact predicted
21:600:43961:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MMS with the ASP reimbursement dummy variable.  This interacted value serves as the instru-
21:601:44052:22:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mental variable for the interaction of the ASP reimbursement dummy variable and the IMS MMS
21:602:44143:22:25:72:342:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measure in a standard two stage least squares procedure.
21:603:44199:25:22:87:539:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We then run a number of falsification tests and robustness checks.  First, if drugs with higher
21:604:44294:22:21:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare market shares were experiencing an increase in shortages prior to the policy change, then
21:605:44392:21:22:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the coefficient estimate would be misinterpreted as evidence that the policy change had led to an
21:606:44489:22:22:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in shortages. We assess whether such an effect exists by running the same specification as
21:607:44588:22:21:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equation 1, but limiting the sample to 2001 to 2004, and considering 2003 and 2004 as a pseudo-
21:608:44683:21:26:72:219:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“ASP Reimbursement” period.
21:609:44710:26:21:87:539:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In addition, we use a flexible difference-in-difference method to see whether there are pre-trend
21:610:44807:21:65:72:486:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effects and observe the dynamics of the treatment effect over time. This is modeled as:
21:611:44894:65:43:116:540:242:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:Shortageit=αi+δt+βtY eart×log(MMSi) +γ1(Off Patentit) +-it(2)

21:613:45052:22:18:71:99:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years.
21:614:45058:18:16:82:539:159:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:26This is consistent with Grabowski,  Long and Mortimer (2014) who found that,  for drugs experiencing initial
21:615:45168:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:generic entry between 2000 and 2012, the mean time since launch (which usually follows a few months after approval)
21:616:45283:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:was about 13 years with a standard deviation of about 3 years.  Our results are not sensitive to varying the threshold
21:617:45401:12:8:72:152:119:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from 15 to 12 or 18.
21:618:45421:8:16:82:539:111:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:27The MarketScan data covers patients who are under 65.  The logic is that if the drugs are taken by older patients
21:619:45536:16:0:72:433:95:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the MarketScan data, then they are more likely to be taken by Medicare patients as well.
22:620:45629:0:22:87:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As shown in the model, because of their lower margins, off patent drugs should be more affected
22:621:45724:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by the change to ASP than on patent drugs.  To test this, we interact an indicator for patent-status
22:622:45824:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with  an  indicator  for  post-regulation  status.   Then,  we  interact  those  indicators  with  Medicare
22:623:45931:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market share to test whether the importance of Medicare is largest for the off patent drugs. This is
22:624:46031:22:65:72:129:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:modeled as:
22:625:46042:65:25:135:425:556:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f11:Shortageit=αi+δt+βPeriodt×1(Patent Statusit)

22:628:46223:22:30:71:193:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:patent status (on and off).
22:629:46250:30:25:76:494:436:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:4.2    Shortages Conditional on Reimbursements to Health Providers
22:630:46316:25:22:87:539:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Previously, we discussed why declining reimbursements to providers would affect a manufac-
22:631:46406:22:22:71:539:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turer’s profit (section 1.2).  In this section, provide indirect evidence of this effect, by checking
22:632:46507:22:21:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whether the reduced reimbursements to providers increase the rate of shortages.   Under the as-
22:633:46602:21:22:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sumption  that  a  majority  of  the  variation  in  price  was  due  to  the  policy  change  (see  figure  3),
22:634:46714:22:22:71:539:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:then most of the variation in price can be considered exogenous which allows us to use OLS. The
22:635:46809:22:65:71:182:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specification we use is:
22:636:46833:65:24:146:465:237:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f11:Shortageit=αi+δt+β1log(Reimbursement per serviceit)

22:640:47092:22:21:71:539:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the respective reimbursement regimes. Drugs which go into shortage experience increases in price
22:641:47188:21:22:71:539:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which translate into increased Medicare reimbursements after 2005 with ASP based reimburse-
22:642:47279:22:0:71:539:83:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ment. Therefore, the OLS regression will underestimate the effect of drug prices that have risen in
23:643:47380:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:response to shortage.  To control for this we use one-year lagged reimbursement values to control
23:644:47477:22:25:72:247:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for this effect of shortages on prices.
23:645:47516:25:22:87:539:661:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We also condition on the patent-status (1(Patent Statusit)) since it plays important roles in
23:646:47609:22:25:72:358:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the theory. Finally,αiandδtare drug and time fixed effects.
23:647:47668:25:22:87:539:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:One  possible  worry  in  this  regression  is  that  unobservable  demand  shocks  are  driving  both
23:648:47770:22:22:72:540:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices and shortages.  However, a positive demand shock would lead to higher prices and more
23:649:47862:22:21:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shortages, holding supply fixed.  This biases the estimates in the opposite direction of what we
23:650:47958:21:31:72:448:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ultimately find, which is that higher prices are correlated with fewer shortages.

23:652:48092:25:22:87:539:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the previous section, we analyzed changes in shortage frequency with variation in reimburse-
23:653:48187:22:21:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ments to health care providers.  While the law directly affected reimbursements to providers, our
23:654:48284:21:22:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model suggests that shortages depend on manufacturers’ incentives.  In this section, we analyze
23:655:48379:22:22:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the effect of manufacturer’s prices on shortages. To do this, we use the IMS data, which measures
23:656:48476:22:21:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wholesale prices.  Similar to section 4.2, we regress shortages on the price manufacturers receive.
23:657:48575:21:22:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We also try lagged price to control for shortages raising prices of drugs. Formally, the specification
23:658:48677:22:65:72:119:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we use is:
23:659:48687:65:25:191:421:298:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f11:Shortageit=αi+δt+β1log(IMS priceit)

23:661:48751:43:22:87:539:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Because the Medicare market is a smaller portion of the market, overall price changes may not
23:662:48844:22:21:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be solely determined by the MMA. However, as discussed above, there is evidence that private
23:663:48936:21:22:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insurers followed Medicare into ASP pricing.  If private insurers did this without any lag,  then
23:664:49033:22:22:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we could again think of price changes as exogenous.  Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate the identifying
23:665:49129:22:21:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variation.  In particular, there were considerable price declines for the most expensive high MMS
23:666:49226:21:22:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs, those that were most likely to have inflated AWP and where the reduced reimbursement
23:667:49317:22:0:72:353:100:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would affect the largest share of sales by the manufacturer.

26:678:50232:26:21:87:539:675:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As discussed in (section 1.2) the mechanism relies on the assumption that the manufacturer’s
26:679:50324:21:22:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices were reduced for drugs where the reimbursement to providers was reduced.   To test this
26:680:50418:22:22:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assumption, we regress the Medicare reimbursement per service, a measure of reimbursement to
26:681:50510:22:21:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:providers, on the IMS price, a measure of manufacturer’s prices.  Also, to show that this effect is

26:687:50866:25:22:87:539:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The top panel of Table 1 gives summary statistics for the main sample – all drugs which we
26:688:50956:22:21:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were able to merge with IMS data.  Table 13 in the appendix gives summary statistics for all the
26:689:51052:21:22:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drugs with Medicare reimbursement data, a sample which is used in some specifications when the
26:690:51146:22:22:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IMS data are not used.  There are 256 drugs in the main sample.  The lower panel gives summary
26:691:51240:22:21:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistics for off and on-patent drug year observations separately.  The average time that a drug is
26:692:51340:21:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in shortage was 60 days (unconditional on being in shortage), but was 79 days and 9 days for off-
26:693:51437:22:22:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and on-patent drugs, respectively. 72 percent of drug-year observations are off-patent. The average
26:694:51536:22:21:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of manufacturers for an off-patent drug is 3.54. Using the IMS data, the average MMS is
26:695:51630:21:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:0.09 and using the MarketScan data the average MMS is 0.14.  The MarketScan MMS measure
26:696:51717:22:22:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is larger because it does not include spending by payers like Medicare Advantage, Medicaid or
26:697:51810:22:22:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Veteran’s Affairs or payments from settings like inpatient hospitals in the denominator. There are
26:698:51908:22:21:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fewer values of Medicare reimbursement because we do not always observe prices for these drug-
26:699:52002:21:22:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year combinations.  Also, there are fewer values for the revenue per standard units because that
26:700:52098:22:25:72:512:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data are only available from 2003-2010. In the MarketScan data, the mean patient age is 45.
26:701:52189:25:0:87:539:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figures 3 and 6 gives the distribution of prices for generic drugs in Medicare and IMS, respec-
27:702:52286:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tively. For both figures, the left panel is the distribution of price levels, for example, 75 percent of
27:703:52390:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare drugs had prices below 10 in 2003 and below 6 in 2010. The right panel is the distribu-
27:704:52486:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion of price changes, for example 25 percent of Medicare drugs had price declines of 50 percent
27:705:52582:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in 2005 (compared to 2004), while 25 percent of drugs had declines of 25 percent in 2010 (com-
27:706:52676:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pared to 2009).  The price declines appear isolated to 2005, suggesting that they are due to the
27:707:52772:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:law change. Figures 8 and 9 in the appendix show the distribution for all drugs, which has similar
27:708:52870:21:26:72:232:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:patterns, though less pronounced.
27:709:52903:26:21:87:539:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:On the other hand, IMS prices are less affected in 2005.  This may be because the impact of
27:710:52994:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicare is diluted in this market.  To provide some evidence of this, Figure 7 shows the price
27:711:53089:22:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distribution for the top and bottom quartile of Medicare market share drugs. The left panel shows
27:712:53186:22:21:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices for drugs which get the smallest share of their sales from Medicare, the right are the drugs
27:713:53285:21:22:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the top quartile.  We see large, slow price declines in drugs which have a lot of Medicare sales
27:714:53384:22:22:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:versus those which don’t.  This suggests that while not all drugs are affected by the law change,
27:715:53481:22:21:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:those  most  affected  were  those  where  the  Medicare  population  plays  the  largest  role.   This  is
27:716:53588:21:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consistent with the idea that Part B isn’t a huge part of the market (Medicare is roughly 30 percent
27:717:53688:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the market and 30 percent of Medicare is in Medicare Advantage), but for drugs where it is
27:718:53781:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:important, overtime prices fall in all markets as other payers switch to ASP. This may help explain
27:719:53880:21:31:72:267:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the lag in shortages after the law change.

27:721:53987:25:22:87:539:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 2 presents the difference-and-differences relationship between shortages and Medicare
27:722:54078:22:22:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market share.  Columns (1) and (2) OLS and IV give the estimates without age in the instrument
27:723:54172:22:21:72:540:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:set.  Because the specification has year indicators, we have differenced out the time-trend in the
27:724:54270:21:22:72:539:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:results. The OLS estimate ofβis 5.7, while the IV estimate is 6.6. As expected, the IV estimate is
27:725:54368:22:22:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:larger due to the correction of measurement error.  The results imply that an increase in the MMS
27:726:54465:22:21:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from the mean of .09 to .1 leads to a 0.63 and .73 day increase in the number of shortage days,
27:727:54560:21:22:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for the OLS and IV estimates, respectively.  Column (3) is a robustness check where we include
27:728:54654:22:22:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:age and age-squared in the instrument set.  Column (4) and (5) use the MarketScan MMS as the
27:729:54746:22:21:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:endogenous variable, where column (4) is the OLS estimate and column (5) is the IV which uses
27:730:54839:21:0:72:540:85:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the IMS MMS as an instrument.  Using the MarketScan MMS gives larger point estimates and

29:756:56017:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to a 1.03 day increase in the number of shortages.   These estimates show that for a number of
29:757:56111:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specifications, drugs with higher Medicare market share were more likely to be in shortage after

29:759:56234:26:21:87:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 3 gives the initial first stage result, where we regress the log of IMS MMS on the instru-
29:760:56330:21:22:71:539:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ment set.  Table 4 gives the first-stage in the main regression, where the interaction of predicted
29:761:56429:22:22:71:539:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:MMS with the ASP reimbursement dummy serves as an instrument for log of IMS MMS interacted
29:762:56519:22:21:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the ASP reimbursement. In each table, column (1) uses the log of IMS MMS as the endoge-
29:763:56611:21:22:71:539:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nous variable and the log of MarketScan MMS as the instrument, (2) includes age and age-squared
29:764:56706:22:22:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the instrument set and (3) uses the log of MarketScan MMS as the endogenous variable and the
29:765:56801:22:21:71:539:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:log of IMS MMS as the instrument.  For the initial first stage, the F-statistic is well above 10, the
29:766:56902:21:26:71:387:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:usual rule of thumb for instrument relevance in each specification.
29:767:56969:26:21:87:539:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In Table 5,  we check the impact of the definition of an off-patent drug.   We vary the years
29:768:57062:21:22:71:539:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:since first approval we use to define a drug as off-patent from 18 years in columns (1) and (2), 12
29:769:57161:22:22:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years in columns (3) and (4), and 2 years in columns (5) and (6). Furthermore, unlike our standard
29:770:57259:22:21:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:definition of off-patent, we do not redefine drugs with multiple manufacturers as off-patent as well.
29:771:57360:21:22:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The odd columns are OLS results while the even numbered columns are IV results. Changing the
29:772:57452:22:22:71:539:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:patent variable leads to differences in the OLS estimate of the treatment effect from 5.5 to 5.7 and
29:773:57552:22:21:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the IV estimate of the treatment effect from 6.2 to 6.8.  In summary, we find the that varying the
29:774:57650:21:26:71:450:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:patent status variable within reason matters little for our coefficients of interest.
29:775:57735:26:21:87:539:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:If drugs with higher Medicare market shares were experiencing an increase in shortages prior
29:776:57827:21:22:71:539:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the policy change, then the coefficient estimate would be misinterpreted as evidence that the
29:777:57923:22:22:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:policy change led to an increase in shortages.   Table 6 presents a falsification test by choosing
29:778:58021:22:21:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a “pseudo”-regulation period and seeing whether our specification picks up the results.  We use
29:779:58116:21:22:71:539:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2003 as the regulation year, rather than 2005, and drop all data starting in 2005.  Thus, 2001 and
29:780:58214:22:22:71:539:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2002 are the fake pre-period and 2003 and 2004 are the post-period. The OLS coefficient from the

29:782:58409:21:18:71:539:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:loses statisitical significance. Likewise, the IV coefficient falls from 6.6 to 2.6 and loses statistical

30:789:58961:22:21:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV estimates of our specification using yearly treatment indicators interacted with the MMS. The
30:790:59057:21:22:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:OLS coefficient for 2007 is 5.215, which suggests a .58 day difference in shortages for drugs with
30:791:59155:22:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:.09 MMS versus those with .1 MMS, compared to the omitted year of 2001. The coefficients prior
30:792:59249:22:21:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to 2004 are insignificant.  In 2004 the magnitudes of both the OLS and the IV start growing and
30:793:59344:21:22:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the coefficient estimates start becoming statistically different than zero.  This corresponds to the
30:794:59444:22:22:72:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:switch from 95% AWP to 85% AWP in 2004 toASP+ 6%in 2005. Afterwards, the coefficients
30:795:59529:22:21:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stabilize at higher levels, roughly 7 for the OLS and 9 for the IVs until the end of the sample. This
30:796:59630:21:22:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:highlights how consistent the coefficients are – results aren’t due to just one year – and highlights
30:797:59731:22:25:72:345:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:some lag time for the MMA to matter for drug shortages.
30:798:59786:25:22:87:539:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Finally,  since  our  theoretical  model  suggests  that  the  MMA  should  impact  off-patent  drugs
30:799:59887:22:22:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more than on-patent drugs with higher margins, we interact the patent indicator with pre and post
30:800:59984:22:21:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regulation indicators and the MMS measure.  Column (1) and (2) of Table 8 shows the OLS and
30:801:60075:21:22:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV estimates,  respectively.   The OLS coefficient estimate for off patent,  post-regulation is 25 –
30:802:60175:22:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:suggesting that on average off-patent drugs in the post regulation period experience 25 days more
30:803:60272:22:21:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of  shortage  than  on  patent  drugs,  prior  to  the  regulation.   The  coefficient  for  off-patent,  post-
30:804:60383:21:22:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regulation interacted with the MMS of suggests that an off-patent drug with an MMS of .1 would
30:805:60477:22:22:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have .83 more average days of shortage than a drug with an MMS of .09, relative to the difference
30:806:60574:22:21:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between a comparable set of drugs, with the same MMS difference, that are on-patent and in the
30:807:60668:21:22:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pre-regulation period. This is much larger than the same effect for drugs on patent, post-regulation
30:808:60768:22:22:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(coefficient of 2.0) or off-patent but before ASP (coefficient of .06).  Column (3) and (4) of Table
30:809:60868:22:21:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:8 provide a falsification test where we show the result using 2 years after earliest approval as the
30:810:60968:21:22:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:definition of off patent. The magnitudes of the coefficients are smaller (7.45 to 1 for the OLS, 8.24

30:812:61169:22:21:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the role of MMA in shortages, this table corroborates our theory that off-patent drugs should be
30:813:61265:21:0:72:438:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:most affected by MMA, which we hypothesize is due to low reimbursement.
