2:28:1301:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study the wealth accumulation of Indian parliamentarians using public disclosures required of
2:29:1397:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:all candidates since 2003. Annual asset growth of winners is on average 3 to 6 percentage points higher
2:30:1500:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:than runners-up. By performing a within-constituency comparison where both runner-up and winner
2:31:1595:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:run in consecutive elections, and by looking at the subsample of very close elections, we rule out a
2:32:1695:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:range of alternative explanations for differential earnings of politicians and a relevant control group.
2:33:1799:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:The ``winner's premium"  comes from parliamentarians holding positions in the Council of Ministers,
2:34:1898:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:with asset returns 13 to 29 percentage points higher than non-winners. The benefit of winning is also
2:35:1999:14:42:72:505:490:12:Times:12:Times:concentrated among incumbents, because of low asset growth for incumbent non-winners.

3:56:2479:0:39:87:200:643:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1    Introduction
3:57:2496:39:22:87:525:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In economics and political science, there exists an enormous body of work — both theoretical
3:58:2588:22:22:87:525:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and empirical — that examines the motivations of politicians.  Models of politician behavior
3:59:2680:22:22:87:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggest many reasons for seeking office, including non-pecuniary benefits of public service,
3:60:2772:22:22:87:525:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:financial gains that accrue after leaving office, and both salary and non-salary earnings, legal
3:61:2868:22:22:87:525:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or otherwise, while in office.  Understanding politicians’ motivations is crucial for modeling
3:62:2962:22:22:87:525:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  pool  of  candidates  -  both  the  number  and  quality  -  that  will  seek  office,  and  is  also
3:63:3068:22:29:87:464:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important for designing policies to constrain politician behavior while in office.
3:64:3150:29:22:104:525:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we look at the understudied though widely discussed issue of non-salary
3:65:3236:22:22:87:525:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings  of  public  officeholders.   We  take  advantage  of  data  gathered  via  India’s  Right  to
3:66:3339:22:22:87:525:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Information (RTI) Act, which required all candidates standing for public office at all levels
3:67:3432:22:22:87:525:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to disclose the value and composition of their assets. Disclosure was mandatory, with punitive
3:68:3526:22:22:87:525:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consequences for misreporting.  Using these records of politicians’ asset holdings across two
3:69:3619:22:22:87:525:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elections allowed us to calculate the asset growth of politicians that competed in consecutive
3:70:3713:22:29:87:227:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:legislative assembly elections.
3:71:3744:29:22:104:525:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The Indian media has made much of the average asset growth of politicians - 208 percent
3:72:3831:22:22:87:525:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over a single election cycle, by one account.1But how does this rate of wealth accumulation
3:73:3922:22:22:87:525:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:compare  to  would-be  politicians  who  failed  in  their  election  bids?   Looking  simply  at  the
3:74:4024:22:21:87:525:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:average growth of assets fails to account for unobserved skills, resources, or inside information
3:75:4121:21:22:87:525:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that politicians may have access to, which are independent of holding office.  And the average
3:76:4215:22:22:87:525:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gains to public office may obscure vast differences across politicians - if legislators do extract
3:77:4313:22:29:87:512:151:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high financial benefits from public office on average, which ones obtain the largest gains?
3:78:4404:29:16:104:525:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  our  analysis,  we  focus  on  the  subset  of  elections  where  both  winner  and  runner-up

3:80:4598:15:0:91:203:91:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Study/Article1-745426.aspx
4:81:4625:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from the same constituency run in two consecutive elections, allowing us to calculate asset
4:82:4716:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth for plausibly comparable political candidates.  When we further limit our sample to
4:83:4806:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:very close elections, we argue that our findings are very unlikely to be driven by unobserved
4:84:4899:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ability differences between winners and runners-up.  In our baseline specifications,  we find
4:85:4992:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  winning  politicians’  assets  grow  at  a  rate  that  is  3  to  5  percent  per  year  faster  than
4:86:5100:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that of runners-up when we employ a basic regression framework; the “winner’s premium”
4:87:5186:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is slightly higher for politicians winning in close elections (we consider winning margins of
4:88:5279:22:22:87:525:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:10, 5, and 3 percentage points).  When we use a regression discontinuity design, we estimate
4:89:5371:22:29:87:245:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a winner’s premium of 6 percent.
4:90:5403:29:22:104:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This average benefit masks considerable candidate-level heterogeneity.  Most strikingly,
4:91:5491:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  asset  growth  of  high-level  politicians  -  members  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  (COM)  -
4:92:5593:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is  13  to  16  percent  higher  relative  to  control  candidates,  a  difference  that  holds  for  very
4:93:5699:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:close elections.  Our regression discontinuity estimates imply a 29 percent premium relative
4:94:5791:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to control candidates.  This is despite the fact that COM members earn virtually identical
4:95:5881:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:salaries  to  other  legislators.   Once  we  control  for  obtaining  a  COM  position,  the  winner’s
4:96:5984:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:premium is much more modest, and statistically indistinguishable from zero, implying little
4:97:6075:22:29:87:334:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:financial benefit of public office for most legislators.
4:98:6131:29:22:104:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Further, we find that there is a large difference in the winner’s premium between incum-
4:99:6219:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bents and candidates that had not previously held public office. There is little financial return
4:100:6316:22:22:87:525:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to winning for first-time politicians.  Indeed, the point estimates imply a negative return for
4:101:6411:22:22:87:525:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-incumbents,  suggesting that their private sector outside options are comparable to or
4:102:6501:22:22:87:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:even higher than the returns obtained through public office.  By contrast, for incumbents our
4:103:6594:22:22:87:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate of the winner’s premium is 12.6 percent, primarily because of the very low returns
4:104:6685:22:21:87:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earned by incumbents that lose in their electoral bids.  This provides suggestive evidence that
4:105:6780:21:30:87:490:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:career politicians have relatively weak earning opportunities relative to public office.
4:106:6868:30:21:104:525:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A  pair  of  robustness  checks  provide  some  evidence  that  our  results  are  not  driven  by
4:107:6966:21:0:87:525:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection problems.  In the first of these,  we focus on contests between pairs of politicians
5:108:7061:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where both had competed and been winner or runner-up in the two elections prior to 2003. We
5:109:7152:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:argue that these “seasoned” politicians are unlikely to be affected by selection concerns, and
5:110:7246:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we obtain similar (though larger) estimates for the winner’s premium using this subsample.
5:111:7336:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also look at a quasi-experiment in the state of Bihar where a hung parliament in February
5:112:7428:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2005 resulted in a follow-up election in October of the same year.  By looking at candidates
5:113:7520:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that won in February but lost in October, and vice-versa, we argue that we come as close
5:114:7608:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as possible to providing a causal estimate of the returns to public office.  The Bihar quasi-
5:115:7701:22:22:87:525:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experiment also yields similar (though somewhat larger) estimates of the winner’s premium,
5:116:7791:22:29:87:226:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relative to our main analysis.
5:117:7821:29:22:104:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall,  our  findings  suggest  little  return  to  holding  office  for  most  politicians,  while
5:118:7922:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high-level positions generate very high returns.  This is broadly consistent with a tournament
5:119:8016:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model of politics in the spirit of Lazear and Rosen (1981), where participants compete for
5:120:8106:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the high returns that only a small fraction of entry-level politicians will attain.  Further, our
5:121:8203:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results on how the winner’s premium is affected by incumbency indicate that becoming a
5:122:8289:22:29:87:418:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:career politician may results in weaker private sector outside options.
5:123:8360:29:22:104:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In interpreting our findings, a few comments and caveats are in order.  Most importantly,
5:124:8449:22:22:87:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our results necessarily account only for publicly disclosed assets, and hence may serve as a
5:125:8541:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lower bound on any effect (though we note that non-politicians may also engage in hiding
5:126:8629:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assets for tax purposes).  This makes it all the more surprising that the data reveal such high
5:127:8724:22:22:87:525:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns  for  state  ministers.   Additionally,  we  measure  the  returns  to  holding  public  office
5:128:8827:22:22:87:525:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only while a politician is in power.  To the extent that politicians profit from activities like
5:129:8923:22:22:87:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lobbying  and  consulting  after  leaving  office,  we  may  consider  our  estimates  to  be  a  lower
5:130:9026:22:22:87:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bound  on  the  full  value  of  holding  public  office.   Further,  even  if  we  assume  transparent
5:131:9129:22:21:87:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:financial disclosure,  the relatively modest returns from winning public office do not imply
5:132:9221:21:22:87:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the complete absence of corruption among lower-level politicians.  Given the low salaries of
5:133:9313:22:22:87:525:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:legislators, they may be required to extract extra-legal payments merely to keep up with their
5:134:9407:22:22:87:525:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private sector counterparts.  That is, what we aim to measure here is the financial returns of
5:135:9501:22:0:87:525:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians relative to private sector opportunities, and cannot directly measure the extent
6:136:9594:0:29:87:325:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of illegitimate financial returns of elected officials.
6:137:9649:29:22:104:525:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our work contributes to the literature on politicians’ motivations for seeking public of-
6:138:9738:22:22:87:525:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fice.  There exist numerous theoretical models describing politician motivation and behavior.
6:139:9831:22:22:87:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These  include  the  seminal  contributions  of  Barro  (1973),  Ferejohn  (1986)  and  Buchanan
6:140:9927:22:22:87:525:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1989), as well as more recent work by Besley (2004), Caselli and Morelli (2004), and Ma-
6:141:10016:22:22:87:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tozzi and Merlo (2008).  A number of recent studies examine empirically the role of official
6:142:10108:22:22:87:525:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages in motivating labor supply, including Ferraz and Finan (2011) and Gagliarducci and
6:143:10196:22:21:87:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nannicini (forthcoming) for Brazilian and Italian mayors respectively; Kotakorpi and Pout-
6:144:10286:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vaara (2011) for Finnish parliamentarians; and Fisman et al (2011) for the Members of the
6:145:10375:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:European  Parliament.   Diermeier  et  al  (2005)  further  consider  the  role  of  career  concerns
6:146:10476:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for Members of Congress in the United States.  In contrast to these analyses that focus on
6:147:10566:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the effect of official wages, we compare the general wealth accumulation of winning versus
6:148:10656:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:losing politicians to extract a measure of the broad financial benefits of holding public office,
6:149:10753:22:29:87:268:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relative to private sector employment.
6:150:10791:29:22:104:525:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our work also relates to several studies that attempt to infer the non-salary financial ben-
6:151:10883:22:22:87:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:efits of public office.  Two recent papers examine the stock-picking abilities of U.S. legislators
6:152:10981:22:22:87:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over  different  time  periods,  and  with  widely  disparate  results  -  Ziobrowski  et  al.   (2011)
6:153:11084:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reports  high  positive  abnormal  returns  for  Senators  and  members  of  the  House  of  Repre-
6:154:11183:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sentatives, while Eggers and Hainmueller (2011) reports that Congress members’ portfolios
6:155:11272:22:22:87:525:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:underperform the market overall, though outperforming the market for investments in donor
6:156:11361:22:22:87:525:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:companies and those in their home districts.  Braguinsky et al (2010) estimate the hidden
6:157:11450:22:22:87:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings of public servants in Moscow by cross-referencing officials’ salary data with their
6:158:11542:22:29:87:185:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vehicle registrations.
6:159:11564:29:22:104:525:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Several studies also examine the wealth accumulation of U.S. and British politicians. Lenz
6:160:11654:22:22:87:525:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Lim (2009) compare the wealth accumulation of U.S. politicians to a matched sample
6:161:11740:22:21:87:525:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of non-politicians from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics.  Their results suggest little
6:162:11829:21:0:87:525:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benefit from public office.  Using a regression discontinuity design, Eggers and Hainmeuller
7:163:11922:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2009) finds that Conservative party MPs benefit financially from public office while Labour
7:164:12014:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:MPs do not.  Finally, Querubin and Snyder (2009) examine the wealth accumulation of U.S.
7:165:12102:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians  during  1850-1880  using  a  regression  discontinuity  design  and  find  that  election
7:166:12204:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:winners out-earn losers only during 1870-1880.  We view our work as complementary to these
7:167:12294:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:studies in several ways.  First,  we focus on a modern context where abuse of public office
7:168:12385:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is plausibly a greater concern.2Further, the mandatory disclosures of all Indian candidates
7:169:12476:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:since 2003 help to mitigate selection issues that affect some of these earlier studies, and also
7:170:12572:22:29:87:443:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concerns over the use of wealth information provided on a voluntary basis.
7:171:12646:29:22:104:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our  work  is  closest  to  the  study  of  Bhavnani  (2012),  which  also  examines  politicians’
7:172:12744:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wealth accumulation in India based on mandatory asset disclosures.  Given the similarities,
7:173:12835:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it  is  important  to  note  how  our  work  is  distinguished  from  Bhavnani’s  concurrent  paper.
7:174:12935:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bhavnani’s data include information on elections in 11 states, while we have a much more
7:175:13023:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comprehensive  database  covering  elections  in  24  states.   This  affords  a  number  of  crucial
7:176:13124:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:advantages.  Most importantly, we are able to include analyses that allow for constituency
7:177:13214:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fixed-effects,  which  helps  to  rule  out  many  explanations  for  the  winner’s  premium  based
7:178:13313:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on unobserved differences across candidates.  Our sample is also less vulnerable to selection
7:179:13406:22:22:87:525:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concerns, since disclosures were matched across elections by hand rather than via a matching
7:180:13498:22:22:87:525:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:algorithm.  Our specifications also differ in a number of ways - for example, we focus on assets
7:181:13594:22:22:87:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:net of liabilities, a standard measure of wealth, while Bhavnani focuses only on assets.  This
7:182:13688:22:22:87:525:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distinction is potentially important in the presence of, for example, preferential loan access
7:183:13782:22:29:87:386:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of politicians which would mechanically inflate asset measures.
7:184:13845:29:22:104:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally,  our  work  also  contributes  to  the  growing  empirical  literature  that  aims,  often
7:185:13944:22:22:87:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:via  indirect  means,  to  detect  and  measure  corruption  (See  Olken  and  Pande,  2012,  for  a
7:186:14044:22:21:87:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:recent survey).  While we cannot detect corruption directly, the rapid wealth accumulation of
7:187:14137:21:30:87:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:higher-level officials in our dataset necessarily implies access to income beyond official wages.
7:188:14234:30:15:104:525:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The rest of this paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 provides a description of relevant
7:189:14327:15:15:87:525:111:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:2For example, Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2000 ranked the United Kingdom
7:190:14432:15:11:91:525:96:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:and the United States as the 10th and 14th least corrupt countries out of the 91 countries in the Index.  India
7:191:14543:11:0:91:142:85:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:ranked 69th.
8:192:14556:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political institutions and the data we employ,  including those obtained through the Right
8:193:14646:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to Information Act.  Section 3 presents our estimation framework.  Section 4 presents our
8:194:14735:22:52:87:289:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical results, and Section 5 concludes.
8:195:14778:52:40:87:266:600:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2    Background and Data
8:196:14802:40:22:87:525:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We use hand-collected data from sworn affidavits of Indian politicians running as candidates
8:197:14894:22:22:87:525:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in state assembly elections (Vidhan Sabha).  Prompted by a general desire to increase trans-
8:198:14986:22:22:87:525:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parency in the public sector, a movement for freedom of information began during the 1990s
8:199:15076:22:22:87:525:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in India.  These efforts eventually resulted in the enactment of the Right to Information Act
8:200:15169:22:22:87:525:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005),  which  allows  any  citizen  to  request  information  from  a  “public  authority,”  among
8:201:15269:22:22:87:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:others.   During  this  period,  the  Association  for  Democratic  Reforms  (ADR)  successfully
8:202:15365:22:22:87:525:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filed  public  interest  litigation  with  the  Delhi  High  Court  requesting  the  disclosure  of  the
8:203:15469:22:22:87:524:406:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:criminal,  financial,  and  educational  backgrounds  of  candidates  contesting  state  elections.3
8:204:15569:22:22:87:525:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Disclosure requirements of politicians’ wealth, education and criminal records were de facto
8:205:15661:22:22:87:525:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:introduced  across  all  states  beginning  with  the  November  2003  assembly  elections  in  the
8:206:15760:22:21:87:525:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states of Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, and Rajasthan.  The punishment
8:207:15846:21:22:87:525:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for inaccurate disclosures include financial penalties, imprisonment for up to six months, and
8:208:15940:22:30:87:258:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disqualification from political office.
8:209:15979:30:21:104:525:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Candidate affidavits provide a snapshot of the market value of a contestant’s assets and
8:210:16067:21:22:87:525:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:liabilities at a point in time, just prior to the election when candidacy is filed.  In addition
8:211:16163:22:22:87:525:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reporting own assets and liabilities, candidates must disclose wealth and liabilities of the
8:212:16258:22:22:87:525:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:spouse  and  dependent  family  members.   This  requirement  prevents  simple  concealment  of
8:213:16353:22:22:87:525:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assets by putting them under the names of immediate family members, and henceforth, our
8:214:16440:22:22:87:525:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure  of  wealth  will  be  aggregated  over  dependent  family  members.   Further,  criminal
8:215:16537:22:22:87:525:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:records (past and pending cases) and education must be disclosed.  While the relationship
8:216:16626:22:16:87:525:114:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:linking wealth, education, and criminal activity to election outcomes is interesting in its own

9:218:16753:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:right, we focus in this study on the effect of electoral victory on wealth accumulation over
9:219:16845:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an election cycle, of five years on average.  Since reporting requirements are limited to those
9:220:16940:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standing for election, asset growth can only be measured for re-contesting candidates, i.e.,
9:221:17032:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those that contest - and hence file affidavits - in two elections.  Therefore, our study is limited
9:222:17131:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to elections in the 24 states which had at least two elections between November 2003 and
9:223:17219:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:December 2011,  covering about 94 percent of India’s total electorate.  Table 1 lists the 24
9:224:17311:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states in our sample along with descriptive information corresponding to the first of the two
9:225:17404:22:29:87:131:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elections.
9:226:17414:29:22:104:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The primary sources for candidate affidavits are the GENESYS Archives of the Election
9:227:17499:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Commission  of  India  (ECI)4and  the  various  websites  of  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Electoral
9:228:17599:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Officer  in  each  state.   The  archives  provide  scanned  candidate  affidavits  (in  the  form  of
9:229:17701:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pictures or pdfs) for all candidates,  though links to a few affidavits are non-functional.  A
9:230:17795:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample affidavit is shown in Online Appendix A. Except for the nine elections prior to October
9:231:17889:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2004, we are able to collect these data from the websites of the National Election Watch which,
9:232:17984:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in collaboration with ADR, provides digitized candidate affidavits.5We extended the dataset
9:233:18075:22:29:87:502:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by collecting data for the remaining nine elections directly from the scanned affidavits.
9:234:18164:29:22:104:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In a first step, among all the candidates that contest in the first election in each state,
9:235:18255:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we filter out the winners and runners-up (our control group) using the Statistical Reports of
9:236:18348:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Assembly Elections provided by the Election Commission of India (ECI).6We then match
9:237:18432:22:22:87:525:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these winners and runners-up with candidates that contest in the subsequent election in that
9:238:18524:22:22:87:525:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state.  Due to large commonalities among Indian names as well as different spellings of names
9:239:18617:22:22:87:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across elections, matching was done manually.  Overall, we are able to manually match a total
9:240:18710:22:22:87:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of 3622 re-contesting candidates (2303 winners and 1319 runners-up) based on variables such
9:241:18801:22:21:87:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as  name,  gender,  age,  education,  address,  and  constituency,  as  well  as  a  family  member’s
9:242:18902:21:17:87:325:156:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:name (usually the name of the father or spouse).7

9:246:19053:11:15:87:525:106:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:7A  probabilistic  matching  algorithm,  based  on  variables  such  as  name  and  age,  proved  to  be  inefficient.
9:247:19171:15:0:91:525:91:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:To provide an example,  in the Tamil Nadu Election of 2006,  there are 2 runners-up with identical names
10:248:19276:0:22:104:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Of  these  initial  3622  matched  candidates,  we  were  unable  to  locate  affidavits  for  both
10:249:19375:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elections  for  53  candidates  because  of  broken  weblinks  and  hence  discard  them  from  our
10:250:19474:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample.   Further,  we  filter  out  candidates  with  affidavits  that  are  poorly  scanned,  have
10:251:19574:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:missing pages, or handwriting that is too unclear or ambiguous to get a clear picture of a
10:252:19664:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:candidate’s reported financial situation.  This drops a total of 561 candidates, or about 15.7
10:253:19758:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent of the remaining sample matches.8Next, we verify suspicious values and, since our
10:254:19847:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:main  focus  is  on  growth  in  wealth,  remove  candidates  that  list  significant  assets  without
10:255:19949:22:22:87:525:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:corresponding market value information, leaving a sample of 2944 matched candidates (1872
10:256:20038:22:22:87:525:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:winners and 1072 runners-up).  Of these 2944 candidates, we have 633 constituencies in which
10:257:20130:22:22:87:525:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both the winner and the runner-up re-contest in the following election.  This is shown by
10:258:20219:22:29:87:268:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state in the last 3 columns of Table 1.
10:259:20258:29:22:104:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:From the affidavits, we compute the candidate’s net wealth, defined as the sum of movable
10:260:20347:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assets  (such  as  cash,  deposits  in  bank  account,  and  bonds  or  shares  in  companies)  and
10:261:20446:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:immovable assets (such as agricultural land and buildings) less liabilities (such as loans from
10:262:20541:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:banks),  aggregated over all dependent family members listed on the affidavit.  Finally,  we
10:263:20633:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:remove candidates with negative or extremely low net asset bases using a cutoff of beginning
10:264:20725:22:22:87:524:338:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:net worth of Rs 100,000, and Winsorize net asset growth at the first and 99th percentiles.9
10:265:20816:22:22:87:525:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This leaves us with a final sample of 2741 matched candidates (1754 winners and 987 runners-
10:266:20908:22:22:87:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:up) of which 1100 are constituency-matched pairs, i.e., we have 550 constituencies in which
10:267:20999:22:29:87:285:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both the winner and runner-up recontest.
10:268:21039:29:22:104:525:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We define aCriminal  Recorddummy equal to one if the candidate has pending or past
10:269:21121:22:22:87:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:criminal  cases  at  the  time  of  the  first  election,  and  measure  education  based  on  years  of
10:270:21225:22:20:87:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schooling (Years  of  Education).  In addition to information gathered from candidates’ affi-
10:271:21318:20:11:91:525:179:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(RAJENDRAN.S), Age (56), and education (10th Pass) despite being identifiably distinct candidates.  We
10:272:21420:11:11:91:525:168:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:also commonly encountered differential spellings of names between elections, for instance, Shakeel Ahmad
10:273:21524:11:7:91:332:157:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Khan (Bihar, 2005) and Shakil Ahmad Khan (Bihar, 2010).
10:274:21579:7:15:87:525:150:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:8Affidavit availability and quality differs somewhat across states and tends to be slightly worse in the earlier
10:275:21691:15:11:91:525:135:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:years.  For example, out of 54 matched candidate in Delhi (2003), 27 percent of affidavits are unavailable or
10:276:21800:11:7:91:173:124:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:of very poor quality.
10:277:21821:7:15:87:525:117:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:9None of these adjustments materially changes the quantitative nature of our results.  Our findings are very
10:278:21929:15:11:91:525:102:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:robust to using different cutoff values (e.g., Rs 500,000), trimming instead of Winsorizing, or no adjustment
10:279:22038:11:0:91:115:91:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:at all.
11:280:22046:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:davits, we also collect data on election victory margins and incumbency from ECI’s Statis-
11:281:22136:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tical Reports of Assembly Elections.  The reports also allow us to classify constituencies as
11:282:22229:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), or “general” constituencies.  SC and ST con-
11:283:22317:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stituencies are reserved for candidates classified as SC or ST in order to promote members of
11:284:22410:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:historically under-represented groups.  That is, general candidates cannot compete in these
11:285:22501:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:SC/ST-designated constituencies.  We also distinguish among winning candidates based on
11:286:22588:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether they held significant positions in the state government, using an indicator variable
11:287:22680:22:29:87:444:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for membership in theCouncil of Ministers, the state legislature’s cabinet.
11:288:22755:29:22:104:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As a measure of state-level opportunities for political rent extraction, we obtain a measure
11:289:22847:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of state-level corruption using the index reported in the 2005 Corruption Study by Trans-
11:290:22936:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parency International India.  This report constructs a corruption index for 20 Indian states
11:291:23028:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:based on perceived corruption in public services using comprehensive survey results for over
11:292:23120:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:10,000 respondents. The index takes on a low value of 240 for the state of Kerala and a high of
11:293:23215:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:695 for Bihar.  Our sample covers 17 of the 20 states for which an index value is available and
11:294:23310:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we rescale the original measure by dividing it by 100.  Finally, we collected a cross-section of
11:295:23406:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state legislature salaries during 2003-2008, and use theBase Salaryof politicians to examine
11:296:23498:22:22:87:525:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more formally whether official salaries are an important determinant of wealth accumulation.
11:297:23590:22:22:87:525:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As we note in the introduction,  these official salaries are likely too low to account for the
11:298:23684:22:29:87:346:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high levels of wealth accumulation of some politicians.
11:299:23739:29:22:104:525:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 2 lists definitions of the main variables used in the analysis and in Table 3, we show
11:300:23831:22:22:87:525:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:some descriptive statistics for our constituency-matched sample of 1100 candidates (Panel
11:301:23920:22:22:87:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A)  as  well  as  for  a  subsample  of  elections  decided  by  close  margins  (Panel  B).  Average
11:302:24021:22:22:87:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:net  assets  are  about  Rs  9.7  million  ($194,000  at  an  exchange  rate  of  Rs  50  per  dollar)
11:303:24123:22:21:87:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for winners and Rs 10.1 million (about $202,000) for runners-up.  As a point of reference,
11:304:24213:21:22:87:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state legislators’ salaries, including allowances, are generally well under Rs 1,000,000 (about
11:305:24308:22:22:87:525:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$20,000)  with  relatively  little  variation  as  a  function  of  seniority.   Overall,  winners  and
11:306:24411:22:22:87:525:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:runners-up  in  our  sample  appear  to  be  similar  in  age,  education,  and  gender.   The  two
11:307:24510:22:0:87:525:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:groups  differ  based  on  incumbency  -  incumbents  are  less  likely  to  win  in  this  sample  of
12:308:24614:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:re-contestants,  consistent  with  Linden’s  (2004)  finding  of  an  incumbency  disadvantage  for
12:309:24713:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Indian  politicians.   The  only  other  difference  we  observe  is  in  net  asset  growth,  which  we
12:310:24817:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will  explore  in  much  more  detail  throughout  the  paper.   About  14  percent  of  winners  are
12:311:24918:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:members  of  the  state  Councils  of  Ministers  and  19  percent  of  the  elections  in  our  sample
12:312:25021:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are from SC/ST-designated constituencies.  Runners-up in the subsample of close elections
12:313:25110:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tend to be slightly more educated than winners on average (14 years of educations vs.  13.8
12:314:25201:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  winners)  though  the  median  years  of  education  is  identical.   Overall,  based  on  these
12:315:25302:22:53:87:490:543:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:observables, runners-up seem to constitute a reasonable comparable control group.10
12:316:25385:53:40:87:263:490:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3    Empirical Framework
12:317:25409:40:22:87:525:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Before proceeding to our regression results, it is worth emphasizing what it is that we are
12:318:25500:22:22:87:525:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attempting to measure as the returns to public office, and how our sample and specification
12:319:25591:22:22:87:525:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:plausibly serve to estimate this.  We wish to measure the percentage annual growth rate of
12:320:25681:22:22:87:525:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assets for an individual elected to public office, relative to the counterfactual where he was
12:321:25775:22:39:87:142:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not elected:
12:322:25787:39:47:87:535:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ret.  to Public Office =E(Netassetgrowthi|Winneri= 1)−E(Netassetgrowthi|Winneri= 0)
12:323:25870:47:22:104:525:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Of course, we cannot measure winner versus loser growth rates for a given politician, but
12:324:25959:22:22:87:525:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will rather make a comparison across observed winners and losers.  We require that, condi-
12:325:26049:22:22:87:525:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tional on observables, assignment to the winner category is independent of returns to winning,
12:326:26143:22:22:87:528:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that is, [E(Netassetgrowthi|Winneri= 0),E(Netassetgrowthi|Winneri= 1)]⊥Winneri|Xi.
12:327:26225:22:22:87:525:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For the sample of politicians as a whole, this condition clearly fails - for example, politicians
12:328:26322:22:22:87:525:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that benefit most from winning will exert the greatest effort in campaigning, and those with
12:329:26414:22:16:87:425:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:different unobserved (i.e., not inXi) attributes may be of greater skill.
12:330:26487:16:15:87:525:128:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:10On further investigating election expense for a subset of candidates,  we also find no material differences
12:331:26596:15:11:95:525:113:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:between winners and runners-up.  Election expenditure on each candidate is further limited by law to about
12:332:26702:11:0:95:524:102:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Rs 1,000,000 in large states, and candidates generally receive lump sum grants from their political parties.
13:333:26812:0:22:104:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The subset of politicians that we may include in our analysis requires the further condition
13:334:26904:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that they choose to run at the end of an election cycle, regardless of whether they won the
13:335:26995:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:first time around - otherwise, we observe only their initial asset levels, not their growth rates.
13:336:27093:22:39:87:351:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hence, what we can plausibly estimate is the following:
13:337:27148:39:25:98:494:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Ret.  to Public Office|Rerun= 1) =E(Netassetgrowthi|Winneri= 1,Rerun= 1)
13:338:27221:25:47:265:494:566:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:−E(Netassetgrowthi|Winneri= 0,Rerun= 1)
13:339:27260:47:22:104:525:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  independence  of  winning  and  the  financial  returns  while  in  office  is  at  least  more
13:340:27360:22:22:87:525:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:plausible with this subset of the pool of candidates - if these returns were much lower for
13:341:27451:22:22:87:525:475:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:Winner= 0 candidates, they may choose not to run again.  While this is a relevant subset
13:342:27539:22:22:87:525:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the pool of candidates - those that make a career of running for office - it is likely one for
13:343:27636:22:22:87:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which the returns to public office are relatively high:  if their outside options were sufficiently
13:344:27735:22:22:87:525:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:good, such candidates may choose not to run again conditional on losing.  We discuss this in
13:345:27827:22:29:87:212:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more detail in Section 4.4.
13:346:27854:29:22:104:525:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This does not necessarily mitigate concerns of unobserved skills correlated with winning,
13:347:27943:22:22:87:525:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and also with earnings ability.  To make the closest comparison of like candidates, we focus on
13:348:28038:22:22:87:525:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a within-constituency comparison of winners and runners-up who choose to run in subsequent
13:349:28128:22:21:87:525:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elections,e= 1 ande= 2.  This plausibly holds constant labor market opportunities, and
13:350:28214:21:22:87:525:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other local attributes affecting the earnings possibilities of winners and runners-up.  That is,
13:351:28310:22:40:87:321:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we estimate the following fixed effects regression:
13:352:28361:40:47:96:525:209:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:NetAssetGrowthwc=αc+β∗Winnerwc+log(NetAssetswc) +Controlswc+-wc(1)

13:355:28596:16:14:87:525:124:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:11Note that an alternative formulation would be to ‘first difference’ the data,  using the difference between
13:356:28705:14:11:95:525:110:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:winner  and  runner-up  net  asset  growth  for  each  constituency  as  the  outcome  variable,  as  a  function  of
13:357:28822:11:11:95:525:99:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:first-differenced covariates.  For our main specifications, this approach yields virtually identical results to
13:358:28933:11:0:95:180:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:those presented here.
14:359:28956:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis, we present results on the full within-constituency sample, and also for the subset of
14:360:29051:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:winner/runner-up pairs where the election was decided by a relatively slim margin.  We argue
14:361:29143:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the within-constituency close election estimation plausibly obviates many concerns of
14:362:29233:22:29:87:253:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:within-pair unobserved differences.
14:363:29268:29:22:104:525:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also employ a regression discontinuity research design (RDD) as an alternative empiri-
14:364:29357:22:22:87:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cal strategy, which effectively estimates the winner’s premium based on the winner-runner-up
14:365:29449:22:22:87:525:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:difference in close elections.  Under the identification assumption that outcomes of close elec-
14:366:29545:22:21:87:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tions are random, the difference in asset growth rates of winners and losers can be causally
14:367:29637:21:30:87:251:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attributed to holding public office.
14:368:29673:30:22:104:525:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The scatterplots and lines of best fit we show in our figures are produced using common
14:369:29760:22:21:87:525:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:methods developed in the regression discontinuity literature (e.g., DiNardo and Lee (2004),
14:370:29851:21:22:87:525:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and Angrist and Pischke (2009)).  Specifically, we are interested
14:371:29942:22:22:87:525:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the extent to which winning causes a discontinuity in asset growth residuals at the win-
14:372:30033:22:22:87:525:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ning threshold.  First we generate residuals by regressing growth in net assets on candidate
14:373:30125:22:22:87:525:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observables, including net assets, gender, and age, but excluding winner dummy and margin.
14:374:30215:22:22:87:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We next collapse the residuals on margin intervals of size 0.5 (margins ranging from -25 to
14:375:30306:22:37:87:330:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:+25) and then estimate the following specification:
14:376:30357:37:50:148:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2: ̄Ri=α+τ·Di+β·f(Margin(i)) +η·Di·f(Margin(i)) +-i(2)
14:377:30409:50:21:104:525:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where ̄Riis the average residual value within each margin bin i,Margin(i)) is the mid-
14:378:30495:21:22:87:525:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point of margin bin i,Diis an indicator that takes a value of one if the midpoint of margin
14:379:30586:22:22:87:525:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bin i is positive and a value of zero if it is negative, and-iis the error term.12f(Margin(i))
14:380:30680:22:22:87:525:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:andDi·f(Margin(i)) are flexible fourth-order polynomials.  The goal of these functions is
14:381:30769:22:22:87:525:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to fit smoothed curves on either side of the suspected discontinuity.  The magnitude of the
14:382:30860:22:16:87:525:135:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discontinuityτis estimated by the difference in the values of the two smoothed functions
14:383:30948:16:15:87:525:119:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:12To  address  heterogeneity  in  the  number  of  candidates  and  residual  variance  within  each  bin,  we  weigh
14:384:31065:15:11:95:525:104:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:observations by the number of candidates, and alternatively by the inverse of within-bin variance.  Results
14:385:31172:11:0:95:229:93:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:are similar in both specifications.

15:389:31279:36:22:87:525:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We first present a series of figures that provide a visual description of our results.  In Figure 1
15:390:31378:22:22:87:525:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we plot the Epanechnikov kernel densities of the residuals obtained from regressing growth in
15:391:31471:22:22:87:525:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:net assets on candidate observables.  Panel A uses the entire sample of constituency-matched
15:392:31563:22:22:87:525:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:candidates while Panel B only uses candidates that were within a margin of 5 percentage
15:393:31650:22:22:87:525:479:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points.13In both cases, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for equality of the distribution function
15:394:31743:22:22:87:525:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  winner  and  runner-up  residuals  is  rejected  at  the  1  percent  level  and  5  percent  level,
15:395:31847:22:22:87:525:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:repectively.  These figures thus depict a differential effect of election outcomes on net asset
15:396:31942:22:22:87:525:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth  between  the  treatment  and  control  groups.   In  Panel  C,  we  disaggregate  winners
15:397:32039:22:22:87:525:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:into ministers and non-ministers and plot kernel densities of these two groups as well as the
15:398:32132:22:22:87:525:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:runners-up.  The kernel density plots further suggest a long right tail for ministers, implying
15:399:32227:22:21:87:525:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that a relatively small number of these high-level politicians generate very high asset growth.
15:400:32322:21:22:87:525:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Panels D and E, we disaggregate the sample based on whether an incumbent is standing for
15:401:32413:22:22:87:525:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reelection in the constituency.  Panel D shows winner and runner-up densities for the sample
15:402:32505:22:22:87:525:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of constituencies where an incumbent was standing for reelection - the winner distribution is
15:403:32598:22:22:87:525:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:clearly shifted to the right, implying a greater winner’s premium in races involving incumbents
15:404:32693:22:22:87:525:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(a test for equality of the distribution function is rejected at the 1 percent level).  Panel E
15:405:32788:22:22:87:525:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows densities for the subsample of non-incumbent constituencies - the winner distribution
15:406:32879:22:22:87:525:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is now shifted to the left and a test for equality of the distribution function is rejected at the
15:407:32977:22:22:87:525:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:10 percent level (p-value of 0.086).  We investigate in greater detail the patterns of net asset
15:408:33073:22:16:87:485:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth among incumbents versus non-incumbents in our regression analyses below.
15:409:33152:16:15:87:525:134:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:13The chosen bandwidth is the width that would minimize the mean integrated squared error if the data were
15:410:33258:15:0:95:269:119:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Gaussian and a Gaussian kernel were used.
16:411:33301:0:36:87:237:696:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.2    Regression Analyses
16:412:33327:36:22:87:525:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now turn to analyze the patterns illustrated in Figure 1 based on the regression framework
16:413:33420:22:22:87:525:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:described in the prior section.  We use the basic specification shown in Equation 1,  which
16:414:33511:22:22:87:525:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:provides a within-constituency estimate of the winner’s premium, and present these results
16:415:33601:22:22:87:525:594:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Table 4.  In the first column, we show the binary within-constituency correlation between
16:416:33693:22:22:87:525:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:WinnerandNetAssetGrowth.  The coefficient of 0.0296, significant at the 5 percent level,
16:417:33781:22:22:87:525:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implies a winner’s premium in asset growth of about 3 percent.  Adding log(Net Assets) as
16:418:33870:22:22:87:525:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a control in column (2) slightly lowers the point estimate to 0.0291, still significant at the 5
16:419:33966:22:21:87:525:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent level.  Column (3) adds controls for gender, incumbency, having a criminal record,
16:420:34056:21:22:87:525:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as well as quadratic controls for age and years of education;  the point estimate is 0.0265,
16:421:34148:22:22:87:525:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant at the 5 percent level.  In columns (4) - (6) we examine the winner’ s premium in
16:422:34241:22:22:87:525:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:close elections, defined by those where the vote share gap between winner and runner-up was
16:423:34332:22:22:87:525:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less than 10, 5, and 3 percentage points.  In each case, the winner’s premium is estimated to
16:424:34425:22:22:87:525:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be around 3 - 5 percent and significant at the 5 percent level.  The point estimate increases
16:425:34518:22:22:87:525:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the 3 percent margin sample, where the coefficient onWinneris 0.0519 and significant
16:426:34606:22:29:87:279:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the 5 percent level (p-value of 0.012).
16:427:34648:29:22:104:525:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Table 5, we consider the returns to office as a function of potential influence in gov-
16:428:34738:22:22:87:525:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ernment.  In the first column, we add an indicator variable,Minister, denoting whether the
16:429:34828:22:22:87:525:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constituency winner was appointed to the state’s Council of Ministers.  The point estimate
16:430:34918:22:22:87:525:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on Minister is about 0.134, implying a 13.4 percent higher growth rate for Ministers relative
16:431:35011:22:22:87:525:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the runner-up candidates in their constituencies.  Further, the coefficient onWinnerdrops
16:432:35103:22:22:87:525:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to very close to zero.  The point estimate is 0.01, with a standard error of 0.013, allowing us
16:433:35198:22:22:87:525:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reject a winner’s premium of greater than 4 percent for those not appointed minister, at
16:434:35289:22:21:87:525:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 5 percent level of significance.  The results are robust to looking at narrow victory mar-
16:435:35383:21:22:87:525:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gins, as indicated by the results in columns (2) - (4).  In columns (5) and (6) we include the
16:436:35477:22:22:87:525:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interaction ofWinnerand an indicator variable for whether a candidate’s party was part of
16:437:35566:22:0:87:525:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the state government; the small and insignificant coefficient on this interaction term suggests
17:438:35663:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:no premium for merely being part of a ruling coalition.14The coefficient onMinisterremains
17:439:35753:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large and significant, implying extraordinary growth in wealth only for high-level positions.
17:440:35846:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It is worth emphasizing that it is problematic to assign a causal interpretation to the corre-
17:441:35940:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lation between Minister status and returns, since assignment to these posts is non-random.
17:442:36030:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At the same time, the very large effect of holding a Minister position on asset returns is such
17:443:36125:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  it  is  not  easily  explained  by  unobserved  differences  in  abilities,  and  warrants  further
17:444:36230:21:30:87:222:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigation in future work.
17:445:36259:30:21:104:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In columns (7) and (8) we disaggregate asset growth intoMovableAssetGrowththrough
17:446:36340:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:holdings such as cash, bank deposits, and jewelry, andImmovableAssetGrowthfrom land

17:448:36516:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between  the  asset  growth  of  Minister  versus  non-Minister  politicians.   The  coefficient  on
17:449:36616:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:Winneris  a  highly  significant  predictor  of  growth  in  movable  assets,  implying  a  winner’s
17:450:36716:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:premium  of  5.23  percent.   The  magnitude  of  the  coefficient  onMinisterin  (7)  implies  a
17:451:36813:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:further premium in movable asset growth of 4.2 percent, though this effect is not significant.
17:452:36907:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For immovable assets, the Minister growth premium is 8.8 percent and significant at the 10
17:453:36997:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent level, while the winner’s premium is small in magnitude and statistically insignificant.
17:454:37093:22:22:87:525:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note  that  immovable  assets  constitute,  on  average,  about  three  quarters  of  a  candidate’s
17:455:37193:22:22:87:525:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:total  assets.   If  the  asset  growth  of  politicians  is  the  result  of  extra-legal  payments,  this
17:456:37300:22:22:87:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:difference may simply reflect the fact that the scale of gifts is larger for ministers (e.g., cars
17:457:37398:22:22:87:525:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:versus buildings).  It may also result from access to low cost purchase of land for high-level
17:458:37492:22:21:87:525:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individuals as suggested by, for example, the case of Karnataka’s former Chief Minister B.S.
17:459:37584:21:22:87:525:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Yeddyurappa, who acquired land parcels at extremely favorable prices before selling them off

17:461:37767:30:21:104:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Table 6 we turn to assess how the winner’s premium differs as a function of incumbency,
17:462:37857:21:16:87:525:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by including the interaction termWinner*Incumbent.  As suggested by the patterns in Fig-
17:463:37945:16:15:87:525:140:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:14We also considered the effect of membership in the two main political parties - the Congress and the BJP -
17:464:38053:15:11:95:525:125:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:on the winner’s premium.  TheWinner*Congressinteraction was marginally significant and positive, while
17:465:38155:11:7:95:461:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the interaction ofWinner*BJPwas negative, though not significant at conventional levels.

18:467:38328:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:ure 1, the winner’s premium comes exclusively from incumbents.  The coefficient onWinner
18:468:38416:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is -0.053 and significant at the 5 percent level, implying that non-incumbent winners’ asset
18:469:38508:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth is 5.3 percentlowerthan that of non-incumbent runners-up.  The pattern is reversed
18:470:38597:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for incumbents, where there is a winner’s premium of nearly 12.6 percent (the sum of the
18:471:38685:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coefficients onWinnerandWinner*Incumbent).  One plausible interpretation of this differ-
18:472:38773:22:21:87:525:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ential winner’s premium by incumbency is that it reflects the relatively limited private sector
18:473:38868:21:22:87:525:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:options available to career politicians.  Alternatively, it may result from the greater skill with
18:474:38966:22:22:87:525:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which incumbents extract value from political office.  The data are at least suggestive of the
18:475:39060:22:22:87:525:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:first of these explanations - the large winner’s premium for incumbents is primarily the result
18:476:39155:22:22:87:525:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the low earnings of incumbents that are not returned to office:  incumbent winners have a
18:477:39247:22:22:87:525:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:median asset growth of 0.205, virtually identical the median asset growth of non-incumbents
18:478:39338:22:44:87:466:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:overall (0.204), while the median asset growth of incumbent runners-up is 0.15.

18:480:39450:37:22:87:525:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The extent that legislators extract financial returns from their positions may be limited by
18:481:39542:22:21:87:525:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pressure from the electorate,  particularly given the transparency afforded by the Right to
18:482:39633:21:22:87:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Information Act.  We emphasize that the asset growth calculations we perform here are based
18:483:39724:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on data easily accessible via the internet, and their availability has been widely reported in
18:484:39818:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Indian media.  In Table 7 we examine whether there is any effect of high asset growth on
18:485:39910:22:40:87:346:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election outcomes, through the following specification:

18:490:40227:21:22:87:525:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point, if anything, in the opposite direction - the coefficient onNetAssetGrowthis positive
18:491:40318:22:0:87:525:88:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Column (1), and its interaction withWinner, capturing the effect of asset growth among
19:492:40409:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election winners, is positive (Column 2).  In results not reported, we also find that legislators
19:493:40506:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who  win  by  large  margins  do  not  earn  a  higher  winner’s  premium.   Such  a  specification
19:494:40605:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is,  however,  subject  to  extreme  problems  of  unobserved  heterogeneity  -  the  large  margin
19:495:40704:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may be because of a candidate’s effort or political skill, confusing the interpretation of the
19:496:40798:22:22:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:Winner*Margininteraction.  Finally, the negative coefficient onWinneris consistent with a
19:497:40887:22:44:87:439:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:negative incumbency effect in India that was already observed in Table 3.

19:499:41008:36:22:87:525:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Table 8 we examine heterogeneity in the winner’s premium as a function of a number of
19:500:41096:22:22:87:525:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:other candidate characteristics.  In column (1) we look at the effect of state-levelCorrup-
19:501:41187:22:22:87:525:462:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:tion.  The coefficient on the interaction termWinner*Corruption, while positive and hence
19:502:41276:22:22:87:525:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implying a higher winner’s premium in more corrupt states, is not statistically significant.
19:503:41368:22:22:87:525:418:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column (2) we allow for aMinister*Corruptioninteraction; the coefficient on this term is
19:504:41459:22:22:87:525:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:positive, again implying a larger asset growth premium in more corrupt states, but also not
19:505:41550:22:22:87:525:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant.  In column (3) we consider whether candidates with prior criminal records have
19:506:41641:22:29:87:493:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a higher winner’s premium.  The coefficient on the interaction term is not significant.
19:507:41728:29:22:104:525:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  column  (4)  we  consider  the  set  of  constituencies  reserved  for  members  of  disad-
19:508:41823:22:21:87:525:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vantaged  groups,  so-called  Scheduled  Tribes  and  Castes  (SC/ST).  The  interaction  term
19:509:41917:21:22:87:525:280:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:SC/STQuota∗Winneris significant at the 1 percent level, and implies a winner’s premium
19:510:42003:22:30:87:513:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in asset growth of about 8 to 9 percent for constituencies reserved for SC/ST candidates.
19:511:42092:30:21:104:525:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are two primary explanations for the relatively high winner’s premium for SC/ST-
19:512:42178:21:22:87:525:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:designated  constituencies.   First,  since  these  seats  are  reserved  for  a  subset  of  potential
19:513:42281:22:22:87:525:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:candidates, it may slacken electoral competition, allowing candidates to extract greater rents
19:514:42375:22:22:87:525:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:without fear of losing their positions. Alternatively, SC/ST politicians may have less lucrative
19:515:42471:22:22:87:525:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private sector options as a result of discrimination, lower unobserved skill levels, or weaker
19:516:42565:22:22:87:525:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor market opportunities in SC/ST-dominated areas.  While we cannot include both the

20:518:42749:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:column (5) we look at the direct effect of SC/ST quotas with a coarser set of fixed effects, at
20:519:42844:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the district level. There are approximately half as many districts as constituencies in our main
20:520:42940:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:sample.  We find a very similar coefficient on the interaction termSC/STQuota∗Winner
20:521:43024:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in this specification - approximately 0.09 - while the direct effect ofSC/STQuotais -0.073.
20:522:43115:22:21:87:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:That is, it would appear that among runners-up, SC/ST politicians fare significantly worse
20:523:43205:21:22:87:525:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than other candidates, providing suggestive evidence that the differential SC/ST effect results
20:524:43300:22:30:87:354:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in large part from different private sector opportunities.
20:525:43358:30:21:104:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  column  (7),  we  examine  the  effects  of  candidates’  education  levels  by  including  as
20:526:43456:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:covariates  the  logarithm  of  years  of  schooling  as  well  as  its  interaction  withWinner.   We
20:527:43558:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:find a small positive direct effect of years of schooling, implying that for runners-up, asset
20:528:43652:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth is higher for more educated candidates.  However, this is more than offset by the in-
20:529:43744:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:teraction term, log(Years of Education)*Winner.  The sum of the coefficients on log(Years of
20:530:43836:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:Education) and its interaction withWinner, while negative, is not significant at conventional
20:531:43929:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:levels.   This  is  broadly  consistent  with  highly  educated  candidates  having  better  private
20:532:44029:22:29:87:431:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sector opportunities, but not greater earning capacity as public officials.
20:533:44104:29:22:104:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We show the interaction ofFemaleandWinnerin column (6).  The coefficient is positive,
20:534:44189:22:22:87:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:though not statistically significant.  Finally, in column (8) we interactWinnerwith log(Base
20:535:44281:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:Salary).   We  find  no  evidence  that  the  winner’s  premium  is  higher  in  states  with  more
20:536:44380:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generous official salaries for legislators, implying that it is unlikely that official salaries play
20:537:44480:22:45:87:416:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a major role in the differential asset accumulation of elected officials.
20:538:44553:45:36:87:308:220:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.3    Regression Discontinuity Design
20:539:44591:36:22:87:525:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our main empirical identification strategy is effectively based on a regression discontinuity
20:540:44684:22:22:87:525:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:design, with the winner’s premium identified from the winner-loser differential in close elec-
20:541:44778:22:22:87:525:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tions .  In this section, we explicitly model the value of winning using regression discontinuity
20:542:44875:22:22:87:525:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:methods,  as described in Section 3.  We first show a series of figures that depict our tests
20:543:44968:22:0:87:525:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for discontinuities around the winning threshold, followed by an analysis of the magnitudes
21:544:45061:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of winner-loser discontinuities.  Note that we follow the approach outlined in Section 4.1 by
21:545:45154:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:looking at net asset growthresidualswhich allows us to control for remaining differences in
21:546:45245:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:covariates of candidates as well as observed and unobserved constituency heterogeneity.  The
21:547:45337:22:22:87:525:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:methodology in this section can thus be considered asconditional RD. Results are quantita-
21:548:45427:22:29:87:378:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tively similar when (unconditional) net asset growth in used.
21:549:45488:29:22:104:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Figure 2, Panels A - E, we provide a visual description of this analysis and columns (1)

21:553:45860:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ofτis 0.065, and statistically significant at the 1 percent level (t-statistic of 2.8). Panel B only
21:554:45960:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:includes ministers with corresponding runners-up - the point estimate of the discontinuity
21:555:46050:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases to 0.287 (t-statistic of 5.26), a result qualitatively similar to that of the regression
21:556:46148:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis in the previous section, though somewhat larger in magnitude.  On the other hand,

21:559:46421:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is 0.0265 with a t-statistic of 1.13.  In Panels D and E, we disaggregate the sample based on
21:560:46514:22:22:87:525:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether an incumbent is standing for reelection in the constituency. Panel D shows results for
21:561:46608:22:22:87:525:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sample of constituencies where an incumbent was running for reelection.  The coefficient
21:562:46700:22:22:87:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate of the discontinuity is 0.08 and significant at the 1 percent level (t-statistic of 3.19).
21:563:46799:22:22:87:525:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:By  contrast,  for  the  sample  of  non-incumbent  constituencies,  we  observe  no  jump  at  the
21:564:46898:22:21:87:525:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:threshold (the point estimate is 0.028 with a t-statistic of 0.79).  Overall, these results are in
21:565:46996:21:30:87:368:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:line with those obtained from standard regression analysis.
21:566:47055:30:22:104:525:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, in Figure 3 we plot kernel densities of age and log(Net Assets) for the sample of
21:567:47145:22:21:87:525:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constituency-matched candidates that were within aMarginof 5 percentage points (“close

21:569:47326:22:17:87:525:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for log(Net Assets).  For both observables, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for equality of the

22:574:47803:22:29:87:393:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:providing some validation of our regression discontinuity design.
22:575:47868:29:22:104:525:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Based on these discontinuities, we can perform a simple back-of-the envelope calculation
22:576:47956:22:22:87:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to to approximate the winner’s premium in monetary terms.  We do this by first calculating
22:577:48046:22:22:87:525:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:how winners’ average wealth would have grown had they not won the election using the net
22:578:48134:22:22:87:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:asset growth rate of all constituency-matched runners-up, and then comparing this average
22:579:48223:22:22:87:525:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the level of wealth accumulation using the discontinuity estimates from the RD design.
22:580:48312:22:21:87:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, forWinnersas a group, the estimated annual premium is approximately Rs 1,500,000
22:581:48401:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(USD 30,000).  However, forMinistersthe winner premium is significantly larger, about Rs
22:582:48489:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:10,750,000 per year (USD 215,000).  By comparison, state-level legislators have salaries that
22:583:48582:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are much lower - generally under Rs 1,000,000 per year (USD 20,000).  Further, these wealth
22:584:48673:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:accumulation increments are relative to candidates’ initial assets that are, on average, only
22:585:48766:22:45:87:503:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:about Rs 10,000,000 (USD 200,000), implying a very large impact in percentage terms.
22:586:48850:45:36:87:240:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.4    Addressing Selection
22:587:48877:36:22:87:525:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our  analysis  compares  the  returns  of  winners  versus  runners-up  in  constituencies  where
22:588:48974:22:22:87:525:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both  candidates  run  in  two  consecutive  elections.   While  this  sample  allows  us  to  include
22:589:49076:22:22:87:525:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constituency fixed effects and thus control for local constituency-level omitted variables, it
22:590:49170:22:22:87:525:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is important to consider whether these results are external valid for Indian legislators more
22:591:49263:22:29:87:132:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generally.
22:592:49273:29:22:104:525:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At the outset, we note that the constituencies that constitute our sample - where both
22:593:49359:22:22:87:525:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  winner  and  the  runner-up  contest  both  elections  -  are  very  similar  on  observables  to
22:594:49461:22:22:87:525:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constituencies where only one of the candidates recontests.  Specifically, the mean electorate,
22:595:49556:22:22:87:525:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage turnout, and percent SC/ST population for our winner/runner-up matched con-
22:596:49642:22:22:87:525:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stituencies are not significantly different from the rest of the population.  Candidates in these
22:597:49739:22:16:87:524:118:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:constituencies are also quite similar in attributes such as log of assets, age, and education.17
22:598:49835:16:0:87:427:102:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:17For brevity, tables are not shown but are available from the authors upon request.
23:599:49921:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus,  we  believe  that  the  local  average  treatment  effects  documented above  can  be  likely
23:600:50021:22:29:87:230:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generalized to the population.
23:601:50051:29:22:104:525:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As noted earlier, our identification strategy – comparing candidates from the same con-
23:602:50138:22:22:87:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stituency in close elections – attempts to control for unobserved ability differences in can-
23:603:50231:22:22:87:525:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:didates.  By comparing the net asset growth of two otherwise similar candidates following
23:604:50320:22:22:87:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an election where one prevails by a narrow margin, we may calculate the private returns to
23:605:50410:22:22:87:525:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:public office relative to a similar candidate that just lost the election.  One significant concern
23:606:50509:22:21:87:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with this approach, however, is that electoral victory may itself influence the probability of
23:607:50603:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:recontesting,  and  hence  inclusion  in  the  sample.   Indeed,  in  Panel  A  of  Figure  4,  we  find
23:608:50707:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that runners-up have a lower probability of re-contesting the second election when compared
23:609:50798:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the corresponding constituency winners.  The probability of recontesting is increasing in
23:610:50890:22:29:87:296:448:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:margin, with a clear discontinuity at zero.18
23:611:50935:29:22:104:525:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In considering how this differential exit rate may affect our results, we note first that it
23:612:51027:22:22:87:525:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is not obviousa  prioriwhich direction any selection effect would bias our estimates.  One
23:613:51117:22:22:87:525:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one  hand,  winners  and  runners-up  that  re-contest  the  second  election  are  plausibly  more
23:614:51216:22:22:87:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar in terms of political ability than pairs where both contest the first election but one
23:615:51310:22:22:87:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsequently  chooses  not  to  contest  the  second  election.   In  this  case,  one  might  expect
23:616:51411:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  the  ability  differences  between  winners  and  runners-up  are  smaller  in  our  sample  of
23:617:51512:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constituencies  than  those  without  matched  winners/runners-up,  hence  biasing  our  results
23:618:51608:22:16:87:525:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:towards zero.19Alternatively, if candidates that exit have higher outside options compared
23:619:51698:16:15:87:525:249:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:18In a separate analysis (not reported for brevity), we examine the recontesting decision of political candidates
23:620:51811:15:10:95:525:234:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:using a simple probit model.  The dependent variable is one if we can match the candidate in a subsequent
23:621:51916:10:11:95:525:224:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:election and zero if we only observe a candidate at election 1.  We conduct our analysis separately for the
23:622:52023:11:11:95:525:213:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:sub-samples of winners and runners-up, and find that candidates that win the first election are significantly
23:623:52132:11:11:95:525:202:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:more likely to re-contest in the subsequent election.  For the sub-samples of both winners and runners-up,
23:624:52238:11:11:95:525:191:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:we find that wealthier and more educated candidates are more likely to rerun,  whereas age is negatively
23:625:52342:11:11:95:525:180:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:related to the decision to re-contest.  The only variable that affects both groups differently is the winning
23:626:52451:11:11:95:525:169:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:margin at the first election – runners-up who lose by wider margins are significantly less likely to re-contest,
23:627:52563:11:11:95:525:158:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:whereas for winners margin is not a significant predictor of running in the next election.  There are two
23:628:52668:11:11:95:525:147:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:ready explanations for this difference - (1) if a candidate loses by a large margin, he may re-evaluate his
23:629:52775:11:11:95:525:136:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:chances of winning and not re-contest a second time, or (2) he may not get chosen to represent his party if
23:630:52882:11:7:95:303:125:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:he has shown little success in the previous attempt.
23:631:52934:7:15:87:525:118:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:19Runners-up  and  winners  in  our  sample  have  virtually  identical  chances  of  succeeding  in  the  subsequent
23:632:53051:15:11:95:525:103:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:election (42.08 percent and 41.89 percent, respectively), providing further support for similar political ability
23:633:53164:11:0:95:168:92:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:of the two groups.
24:634:53184:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to candidates that decide to re-contest, neglecting the asset growth of unsuccessful candidates
24:635:53279:22:44:87:511:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that do not rerun may bias our analysis towards finding an effect even when none exists.

24:637:53409:36:22:87:525:594:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To further assess the influence that differential exit rates may have on the estimated winner’s
24:638:53504:22:22:87:525:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:premium, we analyze a restricted sample of constituencies where both winner and runner-
24:639:53591:22:22:87:525:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:up are seasoned politicians,  in the sense of both competing in at least two electionsprior
24:640:53682:22:22:87:525:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the elections we consider in our analysis, and where both were either winner or runner-
24:641:53772:22:22:87:525:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:up  in  these  earlier  elections.   Repeated  contests  of  this  sort  between  seasoned  politicians
24:642:53875:22:22:87:525:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is  surprisingly  common in  our sample.  We provide  one illustrative  example below for  the
24:643:53969:22:22:87:525:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Biswanath  Assembly  Constituency  in  the  state  of  Assam.   In  this  case,  both  candidates,
24:644:54067:22:22:87:525:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Prabin Hazarika and Nurjamal Sarkar, have contested all elections since 1991 and have been
24:645:54157:22:21:87:525:418:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:either a winner or a runner-up in each instance.  We argue that such career politicians are
24:646:54248:21:22:87:525:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less likely to exit because of party decisions or a reevaluation of future electoral success -

24:648:54431:22:22:87:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:recent past.  This subset of active seasoned politicians arguably represent more comparable

25:665:55634:22:22:87:525:594:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that involves a very limited sample of constituencies.  In Bihar’s legislative assembly election
25:666:55730:22:22:87:525:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in February 2005, no individual party gained a majority of seats, and attempts at forming
25:667:55819:22:22:87:525:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a  coalition  came  to  an  impasse.   As  a  result  of  this  hung  parliament,  new  elections  were
25:668:55922:22:22:87:525:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:held  in  October/November  of  the  same  year.20In  a  significant  fraction  of  these  contests,
25:669:56022:22:22:87:525:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:repeated  within  less  than  a  year  of  one  another,  the  initial  winner  was  defeated  in  the
25:670:56124:22:22:87:525:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:follow-up election.  For these constituencies, we come as close as possible to observing the
25:671:56216:22:29:87:401:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:counterfactual of winners reassigned to runner-up, and vice-versa.
25:672:56282:29:22:104:525:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:From the 243 constituencies contested in the February election, we sample those where
25:673:56367:22:22:87:525:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both the winner and runner-up matched up again in the October election of the same year
25:674:56454:22:22:87:525:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  emerged  as  winner/runner-up  or  runner-up/winner  in  this  later  election.   This  leaves
25:675:56553:22:22:87:525:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a  sample  of  260  candidates  (130  constituencies)  for  which  we  analyze  the  probabilities  of
25:676:56655:22:22:87:525:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:winning the October election as a function of the winning margin at the February Election.
25:677:56745:22:29:87:269:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Results are shown in the Table below:

25:683:56992:50:22:104:525:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, winners in the February 2005 election won in the later contest only 66.2 percent
25:684:57081:22:22:87:525:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  the  time.   Further,  as  on  narrows  the  margin,  this  advantage  decreases  monotonically.
25:685:57181:22:16:87:525:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At the 5 percent threshold, the probability of winning is statistically indistinguishable from

26:687:57360:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:50 percent for either candidate.  This suggests a significant element of randomness to close
26:688:57452:22:29:87:209:674:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:elections in this sample.21
26:689:57479:29:22:104:525:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To further sharpen our empirical strategy, we compare the net asset growth of two groups
26:690:57567:22:22:87:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:– thetreatmentandcontrolgroups.  Thetreatmentgroup consists of candidates that were
26:691:57650:22:22:87:525:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:runners-up  in  the  February  2005  election  but  won  in  the  October  2005  contest,  while  the
26:692:57751:22:22:87:525:579:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:controlgroup is comprised of candidates that were winners in February 2005 but runners-
26:693:57838:22:22:87:525:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:up in the October election.  These cases where winners and losers were switched owing to
26:694:57926:22:21:87:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  hung  parliament  provides  a  measure  of  the  returns  to  public  office  with  a  relatively
26:695:58028:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:straightforward causal interpretation.  We look at all such candidates whose winner status
26:696:58118:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shifted  between  these  two  2005  elections,  andalsochose  to  run  again  in  2010,  so  we  can
26:697:58218:22:22:87:525:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calculate  their  asset  growth  rates.   The  resulting  set  of  candidates  is  relatively  small  -  25
26:698:58325:22:22:87:525:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:winners and 26 runners-up - which limits the types of statistical tests one can perform on
26:699:58415:22:22:87:525:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this sample.  For this subset of candidates we find that the annual net asset growth of the
26:700:58506:22:22:87:525:404:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:treatmentgroup is on average 12.76% higher than that of the control group, a difference that
26:701:58598:22:22:87:525:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is significant at the 5 percent level.  If we limit ourselves only to the constituency matched
26:702:58692:22:22:87:525:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:samples where winner and runner-up status switched andbothcandidates ran in the 2010
26:703:58776:22:22:87:525:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election, the sample is reduced to 11 constituencies - 22 candidates - and we find a difference
26:704:58871:22:22:87:525:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the net asset growth between winners and runners-up of approximately 6 percent, roughly
26:705:58961:22:22:87:525:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar to the magnitudes we observe with the full sample.  Given the small sample size, the
26:706:59053:22:52:87:505:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:difference in asset growth for the sample of 22 candidates is not statistically significant.
26:707:59145:52:40:87:188:220:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:5    Conclusion
26:708:59160:40:22:87:525:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  this  paper,  we  utilize  the  asset  disclosures  of  candidates  for  Indian  state  legislatures,
26:709:59265:22:16:87:525:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taken five years apart at two points across a five year election cycle, and accessed through
26:710:59357:16:15:87:525:142:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:21Recent papers by Snyder (2005),  Caughey and Sekhon (2010),  Carpenter et al.  (2011),  and Folke et al.
26:711:59463:15:11:95:525:127:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(2011) critically assess regression discontinuity studies that rely on close elections.  There remains an active
26:712:59575:11:11:95:525:116:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:debate on whether close elections can really be considered a matter of random assignment.  If sorting around
26:713:59683:11:11:95:525:105:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the winning threshold is not random, but close winners have systematic advantages, then the RD design
26:714:59784:11:11:95:525:94:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:may fail to provide valid estimates of the returns to office.  The Bihar example provides at least suggestive
26:715:59893:11:0:95:464:83:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:evidence that close elections are relatively random in the context we consider in this paper.
27:716:59988:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the country’s Right to Information Act.  This has allowed us to compare the asset growth
27:717:60076:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of election winners versus runners-up to calculate the financial returns from holding public
27:718:60168:22:29:87:445:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:office relative to private sector opportunities available to career politicians.
27:719:60248:29:22:104:525:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our main findings suggest, at least in the Indian context, a relatively limited financial
27:720:60337:22:22:87:525:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benefit  of  public  office  for  most  politicians.   By  contrast,  we  find  a  13-29  percent  growth
27:721:60442:22:22:87:525:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:premium for ministers in our sample, suggesting very strong earnings possibilities for higher-
27:722:60536:22:22:87:525:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level  politicians.   Looking  at  election  winners  not  appointed  to  the  Council  of  Ministers,
27:723:60638:22:21:87:525:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  asset  growth  premium  for  election  winners  is  about  one  percent  per  year.   Further,
27:724:60737:21:22:87:525:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this premium is derived entirely from the winner-loser differential among incumbents, with
27:725:60827:22:22:87:525:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incumbent runners-up earning unusually low returns when confronted with private sector job
27:726:60917:22:29:87:417:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:opportunities; for non-incumbents, the winner’s premium is negative.
27:727:60985:29:22:104:525:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These findings have a number of implications for the modeling of the political process and
27:728:61075:22:22:87:525:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians’ behavior.  First, our results suggest a sharp difference in the value of influencing
27:729:61172:22:22:87:525:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:legislators at different levels in the Indian hierarchy:  the votes of individual legislators have
27:730:61270:22:22:87:525:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively  low  value  for  private  agents,  while  the  influence  of  ministers  is  potentially  very
27:731:61376:22:22:87:525:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:valuable.  At least in financial terms, one may thus think about prospective politicians being
27:732:61470:22:22:87:525:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:motivated more by future rewards from gaining higher positions than by the initial returns of
27:733:61563:22:22:87:525:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:holding office.  This is broadly consistent with a tournament model of politics in the spirit of
27:734:61659:22:22:87:525:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Lazear and Rosen (1981), where participants compete for the high returns that only a small
27:735:61749:22:29:87:298:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fraction of entry-level politicians will attain.
27:736:61797:29:22:104:525:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our work also presents several possible directions for future work.  Given the high returns
27:737:61888:22:22:87:525:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we observe among ministers, it may be fruitful, with the benefit of additional data, to examine
27:738:61983:22:22:87:525:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether particular positions within the Council are associated with high rents.  And while
27:739:62073:22:22:87:525:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we do not observe a strong sensitivity of election outcomes to asset growth, one may assess
27:740:62164:22:22:87:525:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether electoral accountability is affected by voter exposure to asset data, in the spirit of
27:741:62258:22:21:87:525:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Banerjee et al (2011).  It may be interesting to explore the impact of the Right to Information
27:742:62353:21:0:87:525:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Act itself: disclosure requirements may induce exit by winners that have extracted high rents,
28:743:62449:0:22:87:525:696:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in order to avoid possible corruption-related inquiries.  Finally, we are unable in this work to
28:744:62545:22:22:87:525:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:uncover the mechanism through which asset accumulation takes place.  We leave these and
28:745:62632:22:22:87:525:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other extensions for future work, which will be enabled either by experimental intervention
28:746:62723:22:0:87:406:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or the accumulation of new data via the Right to Information Act.

48:1021:88871:19:11:87:525:578:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Notes:  We investigate recontesting decisions for winners and runners-up.  In a first stage we obtain residuals
48:1022:88982:11:11:87:525:567:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:from regressing a binary recontesting dummy on candidate observables (characteristics such as age, gender,
48:1023:89088:11:11:87:525:556:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:incumbency  but  excluding  winner  dummy  and  margin)  and  constituency  fixed  effects.   Residuals  are  then
48:1024:89202:11:11:87:525:545:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:collapsed into margin bins and a polynomial is fitted to the data.  In Panel A, we show results for the full
48:1025:89310:11:11:87:525:534:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:sample (5246 candidates), indicating a significant jump in recontesting around the winning threshold (point
48:1026:89417:11:11:87:525:523:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:estimate of 0.1328 with a t-statistic of 6.41).  In Panel B, we show results for for the subsample of seasoned
48:1027:89527:11:11:87:525:512:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:politicians  (322  candidates)  -  no  jump  in  recontesting  can  be  detected  around  the  threshold.   In  Panel  C,
48:1028:89648:11:11:87:525:501:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:we analyze net asset growth residuals for the subsample of seasoned politicians.  The point estimate of the
48:1029:89755:11:277:87:383:490:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:discontinuity is 0.1206 and significant at the 5% level (t-statistic of 2.19).
