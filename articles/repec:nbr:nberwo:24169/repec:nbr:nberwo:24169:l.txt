2:27:1152:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  has  become  a  cornerstone  of  modern  business  practice, 
2:28:1255:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:developing from  a  “why”  in  the  1960s  to  a  “must”  today.  Early  empirical  evidence  on  both  the 
2:29:1362:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:demand and supply sides has largely confirmed CSR's efficacy. This paper combines theory with 
2:30:1455:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:a  large-scale  natural field  experiment  to  connect  CSR  to  an  important  but  often  neglected 
2:31:1556:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:behavior:  employee  misconduct and  shirking.  Through  employing  more  than  3000  workers,  we 
2:32:1654:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:find  that  our  usage  of  CSR  increases employee  misbehavior  -  20%  more  employees  act 
2:33:1748:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:detrimentally  toward  our  firm  by  shirking  on  their primary  job  duty  when  we  introduce  CSR. 
2:34:1851:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:Complementary  treatments  suggest  that  “moral  licensing” is  at  work,  in  that  the  “doing  good” 
2:35:1955:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:nature  of  CSR  induces  workers  to  misbehave  on  another  dimension that  hurts  the  firm.  In  this 
2:36:2061:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:way, our data highlight a potential dark cloud of CSR, and serve to forewarn that such business 
2:37:2156:14:42:72:261:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:practices should not be blindly applied.

3:52:2593:45:34:72:185:631:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:1    Introduction
3:53:2610:34:16:72:540:597:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become one of the most common business practices in
3:54:2703:16:17:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:recent decades.  About a quarter of N100 companies and over 90% of G250 companies now publish
3:55:2796:17:16:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:annual CSR reports (KPMG, 2015).  While such a prevalence in CSR may seem at odds with the
3:56:2886:16:17:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:idea that the only responsibility of a business is to maximize its profit, recent studies have argued
3:57:2987:17:23:72:284:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that CSR practices can in fact be profitable.
3:58:3032:23:16:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:On the demand side, some evidence suggests that consumers value a responsibly produced good and
3:59:3127:16:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are willing to pay a higher price for it (Du, Bhattacharya and Sen, 2011; Elfenbein et al.  2012; Lii
3:60:3228:16:17:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Lee, 2013; Sen, Bhattacharya and Korschun, 2006; Servaes and Tamayo 2013).  On the supply
3:61:3321:17:16:72:540:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:side,  workers  have  shown  a  preference  for  being  employed  by  a  CSR  company,  working  harder
3:62:3424:16:17:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when  their  employer  engages  in  CSR  (Backhaus,  Stone  and  Heiner,  2002;  Brekke  and  Nyborg,
3:63:3525:17:16:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2008;  Greening  and  Turban  2000;  Turban  and  Greening,  1997).   In  this  spirit,  companies  can
3:64:3628:16:17:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduce  their  labor  costs  and  increase  profits  through  CSR.  Yet,  the  empirical  evidence  on  the
3:65:3735:17:16:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:supply-side profitability of CSR has solely focused on the effect on productivity (Burbano,  2015
3:66:3832:16:23:72:440:377:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and 2016; Hedblom, Hickman, & List, 2016, Tonin and Valassapoulos, 2015).
3:67:3905:23:16:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we explore another supply-side channel through which CSR can affect profitability:
3:68:4002:16:17:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the impact on employee misbehavior on the job.  Employee misbehavior is a common and costly
3:69:4093:17:16:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:problem facing businesses and organizations. It has been estimated that companies lose about 5% of
3:70:4191:16:17:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their annual revenues to various forms of internal fraud (Association of Certified Fraud Examiners,
3:71:4290:17:16:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2016).   A  survey  from  the  National  Retail  Federation  (NRF)  reports  that  in  the  retail  industry
3:72:4398:16:17:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:alone,  employee  theft  amounted  to  $15  billion  (over  a  third  of  the  total  inventory  shrinkage)  in
3:73:4509:17:16:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2014 (NRF, 2015).  Another survey reports that in 2015, one in every 38 employees in the retail
3:74:4604:16:23:72:349:239:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:industry was apprehended for theft from their employers.1
3:75:4661:23:16:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Given the magnitude of the cost that organizations bear from various forms of employee misbehav-
3:76:4757:16:17:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ior, understanding whether and how common CSR practices interact with employee misbehavior
3:77:4847:17:16:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:becomes of a great import.  We begin with a theoretical model that highlights how CSR can in-
3:78:4940:16:17:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fluence employee misbehavior through two channels.  First, it can serve as a social incentive tool
3:79:5038:17:16:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for motivating workers to reduce unethical and counterproductive behavior on the job.  Previous
3:80:5133:16:16:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:studies have shown that, consistent with the standard gift-exchange model, workers reciprocate a
3:81:5229:16:0:84:384:118:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:1http://hayesinternational.com/news/annual-retail-theft-survey/
4:82:5293:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:higher wage from their employer by reducing misbehavior on the job that hurts the employer (Flory,
4:83:5391:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Liebbrandt, & List, 2016; Ockenfels, Sliwka, & Werner, 2015).  Similar to how monetary-incentives
4:84:5488:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduce worker misbehavior through a gift-exchange mechanism, social incentives in the form of CSR
4:85:5585:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may reduce misbehavior,  by triggering reciprocity towards the employer.  CSR may thus reduce
4:86:5678:16:23:72:334:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:worker misbehavior through the gift-exchange channel.
4:87:5731:23:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A second channel is that CSR can increase worker misbehavior through moral-licensing.  Prosocial
4:88:5827:17:16:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:behavior is motivated in part, by self- (and social-) image motives: people act prosocially, in part to
4:89:5930:16:16:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:signal to themselves (and to others) that they are good and moral individuals (Benabou and Tirole
4:90:6027:16:17:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2006, 2011).  While prosocial deeds can boost individual self-image, unethical behavior can damage
4:91:6125:17:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it.  As our moral standards are constantly challenged in multiple dimensions, good behavior in one
4:92:6223:16:17:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domain may liberate us to behave unethically in another domain.  Such a dynamic of moral licensing
4:93:6321:17:16:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in individual behavior has been documented in the social psychology literature.2Relatedly, moral-
4:94:6418:16:17:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:licensing has been raised by Benabou and Tirole (2010) as a potential dark-side of CSR’s appeal
4:95:6513:17:16:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f8:B:to image concerns, as“people  who  have  recently  done  good  in  one  dimension  may  feel  immunized
4:96:6616:16:23:72:505:472:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:B:against negative (social or self ) inferences, and thus later on act less morally constrained”.
4:97:6711:23:17:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our theory shows that the two channels operate in opposing directions, opening up the potential
4:98:6806:17:16:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for empirical work to provide important measurement of not only the direction but the magnitude
4:99:6901:16:16:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  effect  of  CSR  on  misbehavior.   To  shed  empirical  evidence  into  our  theory,  we  conduct
4:100:7008:16:17:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a  natural  field  experiment  with  over  3000  workers  who  we  hired  ourselves.   In  this  manner,  we
4:101:7116:17:16:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:served as the employer of an online labor market platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) and invited
4:102:7210:16:17:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interested  workers  to  our  website  to  perform  a  short  transcription  task  for  payment.   The  task
4:103:7318:17:16:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the payment structure were designed in a manner that provided opportunities for workers to
4:104:7412:16:17:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:misbehave.  For example, all workers in our experiment received 10% of their total payment upfront,
4:105:7511:17:16:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and immediately upon accepting the contract, and received the remaining 90% of their wage, once
4:106:7606:16:16:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they  completed  the  task.   Receiving  a  percentage  of  the  wage  upfront  creates  an  incentive  for
4:107:7713:16:23:72:473:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers to accept the contract without actually working on, or completing the task.
4:108:7796:23:17:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To  provide  the  necessary  variation  to  identify  the  critical  pieces  of  the  model,  we  randomized
4:109:7904:17:16:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers’ into one of the 6 treatments, across which we varied wage, CSR incentive, and the framing
4:110:8002:16:16:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and timing of the CSR message.  Our six treatment cells provide data to answer several queries.
4:111:8097:16:15:84:540:213:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:2A large body of experimental evidence suggests that reflecting on prior good behavior (Mazar and Zhong, 2009;

5:122:9120:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For  example,  to  explore  the  potential  role  of  moral-licensing,  we  varied  the  appeal  of  CSR  to
5:123:9228:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers self-image by changing the framing of our CSR messages.  In addition, to understand the
5:124:9323:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect of substituting financial resources away from private incentives and into CSR, we compare
5:125:9419:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:behavior  across  treatments  in  which  we  held  the  total  employer’s  budget  fixed,  and  substituted
5:126:9526:16:23:72:209:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:private incentives with CSR.
5:127:9554:23:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Overall, our results suggest that our usage of CSR increased cheating.  First, the share of workers
5:128:9653:17:16:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who shirk their primary job duty increases significantly –by roughly 20%– from the baseline to our
5:129:9751:16:16:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR  treatments.   Indeed,  CSR  not  only  increases  the  number  of  people  who  misbehave,  it  also
5:130:9856:16:17:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increases the level of shirking:  the average level of cheating by workers increases by 11%.  Second,
5:131:9957:17:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with the moral-licensing effect of CSR, we find the share of cheaters to be the highest
5:132:10055:16:17:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when we frame CSR as a prosocial act on behalf of workers.  While CSR increases cheating, we do
5:133:10150:17:16:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not find any effect on the average quality of work after accounting for the cheating.  We also do not
5:134:10251:16:17:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:find any differences in cheating behavior across workers who could and could not sort themselves
5:135:10347:17:16:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into the CSR job.  We argue that our inability to document any selection effect may be due to the
5:136:10444:16:23:72:445:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relatively high rate of accepting the contract by our workers in all treatments.
5:137:10524:23:17:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Combining the finding that employee misbehavior decreases with wage,  documented in previous
5:138:10616:17:16:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:studies  (Flory,  Liebbrandt,  &  List,  2016;  Ockenfels,  Sliwka,  &  Werner,  2015),  with  the  results
5:139:10723:16:16:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from our experiment that misbehavior increases with CSR, one would expect cheating to increase
5:140:10817:16:17:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as we substitute private incentives with CSR. This is in fact what our empirical analysis reveals.
5:141:10915:17:16:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As we decrease the wage and increase the expenditure on CSR, we find the share of cheaters to
5:142:11008:16:17:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase considerably.  In other words, we find that substituting just about 5% of the wage with
5:143:11104:17:16:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR increases the share of cheaters by 25%, while substituting 28% of wage with CSR increases
5:144:11197:16:23:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the share of cheaters by over 50%.  Likewise, the intensity of cheating per worker increases as well.
5:145:11298:23:17:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In light of the fact that previous empirical studies that investigate the supply-side profitability of
5:146:11400:17:16:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR, have generally reported positive effects on productivity (Burbano, 2015 and 2016; Hedblom,
5:147:11495:16:16:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Hickman & List, 2016), our results reveal a potential dark side to the supply-side effect of CSR.
5:148:11592:16:17:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We  find  that  CSR  can  increase  worker  misbehavior  on  the  job  by  generating  a  moral-licensing
5:149:11697:17:16:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect.  Our findings also have important implications on how employers should communicate CSR
5:150:11791:16:17:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:initiatives to their employees.  Importantly,  we find some suggestive evidence that the way CSR
5:151:11887:17:16:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is communicated to workers can play an important role in the extent to which it leads to moral-
5:152:11982:16:17:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:licensing.  When communicated to the employees as a benevolent act that the employer engages in,
5:153:12078:17:16:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on workers’ behalf, CSR is (marginally insignificantly) more likely to exploit workers self-image and
5:154:12179:16:16:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to lead to less moral choices in the future.  This result is consistent with the findings of Kouchaki
5:155:12280:16:17:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Jami (2016) who document a higher level of moral-licensing, when consumers are exposed to
5:156:12373:17:16:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a CSR message that praises the consumers compared to a message that praised the company for
5:157:12464:16:0:72:97:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR.
6:158:12469:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our  study  makes  important  contributions  to  the  recently  growing  literature  on  moral-licensing.
6:159:12574:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:While most previous evidence on moral-licensing is limited to evidence from lab, our study is one
6:160:12671:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the few that finds moral-licensing in a natural field setting, where subjects are not aware that they
6:161:12775:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are taking part in the study.3The scale of our experiment is another factor that distinguished our
6:162:12873:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:study from previously documented evidence on moral-licensing.  In a meta-analysis of 91 studies in
6:163:12971:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moral licensing, Blanken, van de Ven and Zeelenberg (2015) finds the sample size in these studies to
6:164:13071:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be relatively small with the average sample size of only 81.3 participants per study.  With a sample
6:165:13171:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:size of over 3000 subjects, our experiment is one of the largest scale in which moral-licensing has
6:166:13270:16:23:72:188:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:been documented so far.
6:167:13293:23:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The remainder of our study is organized as follows.  Section 2 presents our theoretical framework.
6:168:13391:16:45:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Section 3 lays out our experimental design, and Section 4 presents our findings.  Section 5 concludes.
6:169:13493:45:34:72:260:493:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:2    Theoretical Framework
6:170:13519:34:16:72:540:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we present a simple framework that enables us to formalize the two channels through
6:171:13619:16:17:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which CSR can affect misbehavior on the job.  Consider a worker in a firm that pays a wage of
6:172:13712:17:16:72:539:426:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:Wand  invests  in  CSR.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  we  assume  that  the  worker  makes  only  one
6:173:13817:16:17:72:539:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decision:  the level of cheatingX, which can reflect various measures of misbehavior on the job that
6:174:13917:17:16:72:539:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are harmful to the employer, such as stealing from, or lying to the employer.4,5Thus, employer’s
6:175:14013:16:16:72:539:377:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f10:B:payoff is decreasing inX.  The worker observesWand CSR, set by the employer, and choosesX
6:176:14102:16:30:72:285:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by maximizing the following utility function:
6:177:14147:30:36:148:463:331:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:A:U(X, W, CSR) =W−G(X, CSR) +B(X) +A(W, CSR)×(−X)
6:178:14194:36:17:72:539:295:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:B(X) represents the benefit to the worker from cheating at level X.6We assume that the worker
6:179:14287:17:16:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cares about his self-image.  Unethical behavior (X) damages worker’s self-image, and CSR, espe-
6:180:14382:16:17:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cially if perceived as a prosocial act by the worker, improves it.  Alternatively, we could think of
6:181:14482:17:16:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:self-image as an inverse function of guiltG(X, CSR).  The worker’s feeling of guilt increases with
6:182:14580:16:17:72:539:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:his unethical choice (X) and decreases with CSR. The worker also exhibits gift-exchange motives
6:183:14675:17:16:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:towards  the  employer  and  cheats  less  if  he  perceives  the  employer  to  be  of  a  “kind”  type.   We
6:184:14785:16:11:84:422:196:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:3Tiefenbeck et al.  (2013) and study 2 in Kouchaki and Jami (2016) are exceptions.
6:185:14867:11:14:84:539:185:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:4In this simplified model, worker’s effort can be thought of as an inverse function of cheating, in a sense that more
6:186:14984:14:7:72:515:171:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:effort corresponds to less cheating.  We interchange shirking, cheating, and misbehavior throughout the study.
6:187:15094:7:15:84:540:164:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f13:F:5We use the following definition of unethical misbehavior taken from Kish-Gephart et al., (2010).“Behavior that
6:188:15205:15:11:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:F:violates  widely  accepted  moral  norms  such  as  theft,  sabotage,  lying  to  customers  and  misrepresentation  of  financial
6:189:15335:11:11:72:540:138:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:F:reports ...  Other negative, counterproductive or deviant workplace behavior such as lateness, are not included because
6:190:15454:11:7:72:319:127:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:F:they do not necessarily violate widely accepted moral norms”.
6:191:15515:7:0:84:504:120:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:6Alternatively,−B(X) can be thought of as the cost of reducing cheating, or exerting effort on the job.
7:192:15619:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assume that both wage and CSR can increase the worker’s perception of the employer’s level of
7:193:15712:17:16:72:539:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kindnessA(W, CSR).7Thus,  an employer is perceived to be kinder if it pays a higher wage,  or
7:194:15805:16:23:72:175:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spends more on CSR.
7:195:15824:23:23:72:484:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The first and the second order conditions to the workers problem can be expressed as:

7:205:16060:0:19:434:540:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:.  Following the second
7:206:16083:19:17:71:539:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:order condition, the denominator of this expression is negative.  Thus, we can drive the following
7:207:16181:17:32:71:375:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conditions for how misbehavior responds to the change in CSR:

7:211:16337:32:17:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The above conditions suggest that depending on the specific functional form of the gift-exchange
7:212:16433:17:16:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the guilt term, as CSR increases, worker misbehavior may increase or decrease.  Specifically,
7:213:16530:16:17:72:540:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(since by assumption,Ais an increasing function of CSR), misbehavior increases with CSR if the

7:215:16718:16:17:72:539:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:respect to CSR, (∂A∂CSR).  In other words, misbehavior increases with CSR if, as CSR increases, the
7:216:16817:17:16:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:change in the slope of the guilt function (G) with respect to misbehavior (X) decreases with a rate

7:219:16982:33:17:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We conduct our study as a natural field experiment (see Harrison and List, 2004), using workers
7:220:17077:17:16:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor market platform where businesses and

7:222:17276:17:16:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employer and recruited workers on MTurk for a short task to be performed on our website.  The
7:223:17369:16:17:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:task was designed such that it provided opportunities for workers to cheat on, without losing their

7:225:17573:16:17:72:540:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where we randomized them into one of our treatments, and offered them a short “contract” with

8:231:18176:16:23:72:411:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:across 3 treatments and varied the level of wage and CSR expenditure.
8:232:18245:23:17:72:540:653:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f3:B:Recruitment on MTurk.The MTurk environment provides an appropriate platform to study
8:233:18329:17:16:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:misbehavior on the job.  The relative anonymity and the remote nature of the job makes it possible
8:234:18427:16:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to design a task with possibilities of cheating.  We recruited workers on MTurk by posting a Human
8:235:18525:17:16:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Intelligence Task (HIT) and invited interested workers to our website where they could learn more

8:237:18728:16:17:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:description of the task and instructions for the interested workers on how to proceed.  Interested
8:238:18826:17:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers were instructed to click on a link that took them to our page where a unique ID-code was
8:239:18922:16:17:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:generated for each worker.  Workers were then required to submit their code through MTurk.  We
8:240:19016:17:16:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:later used these ID-codes to link workers on our website to their MTurk account, through which
8:241:19110:16:23:72:169:505:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:we made payments.8
8:242:19128:23:17:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f3:B:The Contract.Upon landing on our website, workers were randomized into one of the 6 treat-
8:243:19218:17:16:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ment groups and were provided with a “contract”’ with detailed information about the task and
8:244:19311:16:17:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:treatment-specific payment.  The contracts indicated that 10% of the total wage would be paid to
8:245:19407:17:16:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers  upfront,  upon  accepting  the  contract,  and  the  remaining  90%  would  be  paid  after  they
8:246:19513:16:16:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:completed the task.  After reading the information, workers had to decide whether or not to accept
8:247:19611:16:17:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the contract.  Workers were explicitly asked to accept the contract, only if they intended to com-
8:248:19709:17:16:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:plete the task.  All workers who accepted the contract were immediately paid the upfront money
8:249:19803:16:17:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and were sent an email through MTurk, notifying them about the upfront payment.  Accepting the
8:250:19897:17:16:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contract (and consequently receiving the upfront payment) without finishing the task serves as one
8:251:19995:16:17:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of our measures of worker misbehavior.  The contract required workers to complete the task within
8:252:20092:17:23:72:233:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2 hours of accepting the contract.

9:268:20585:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Depending on the treatment, workers were offered either a low wage of $0.90, a medium wage of
9:269:20678:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:$1.20, or a high wage of $1.26 for completing the task.9In addition to wage, workers in treatments

9:271:20890:17:16:71:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of donating cash to a pre-specified non-profit organization.  Donation to charities and non-profit
9:272:20988:16:17:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:organizations is a form of CSR that is frequently advertised and practiced by firms and companies.10
9:273:21088:17:16:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Companies often report their charity donations as the equivalent of a percentage of their profit.
9:274:21185:16:17:71:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:However,  as  we  did  not  make  any  profits  from  our  experiment,  in  order  to  avoid  deception,  we
9:275:21293:17:22:71:443:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reported our donation as the equivalent of a percentage of our total wage-bill.
9:276:21372:22:17:71:539:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As previously discussed in section 2, if the moral-licensing effect of CSR is strong enough, CSR can
9:277:21472:17:16:71:539:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase cheating.  Moral-licensing works through concerns for self-image.  If workers see themselves
9:278:21573:16:17:71:539:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as  a  part  of  the  prosocial  act  that  their  employer  engages  in,  CSR  can  improve  workers’  self-
9:279:21682:17:16:71:539:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:image  and  license  less  ethical  subsequent  acts.   The  ability  to  take  credit  for  the  prosocial  act
9:280:21794:16:17:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  employer  is  an  important  determinant  of  whether  CSR  influences  the  worker’s  self-image
9:281:21900:17:16:71:539:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and therefore is key in whether it leads to moral-licensing.  The way in which CSR is framed and
9:282:21996:16:17:71:539:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:communicated to employees can influence the extent to which workers’ self-image is exploited by
9:283:22091:17:16:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR. To shed light on the role of moral-licensing in the relationship between CSR and misbehavior,
9:284:22189:16:16:71:539:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we  manipulated  the  appeal  of  CSR  to  workers’  self-image  by  changing  the  framing  of  our  CSR
9:285:22294:16:17:71:539:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:message across treatments.  While for some workers (TLW ageF irmMsg, TMW ageF irmMsgandTMW ageSort) we simply
9:286:22403:17:16:71:540:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:framed CSR as “donation to the charity”, for others (TMW ageW orkerMsg) we framed it as “donation to the
9:287:22507:16:17:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:charity on behalf of the workers”.  If CSR is to increase cheating through moral-licensing, we should
9:288:22608:17:16:71:539:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expect the later framing to generate a stronger effect.  The exact wordings of our CSR message

10:326:26153:23:17:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Before starting to work on any given image, workers were required to report if the image was legible
10:327:26253:17:16:72:539:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or not.15If an image was reported as unreadable, the worker skipped that image and moved on to
10:328:26347:16:17:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the next.  The instructions made it clear that it was possible for some images to be illegible, and
10:329:26446:17:16:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that reporting those as unreadable was acceptable and did not lower the payment.  Offering fixed
10:330:26542:16:17:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:payments, regardless of the number of images that were actually transcribed, provided opportunities
10:331:26641:17:16:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for workers to misreport perfectly readable images as unreadable and avoid transcribing them.  We
10:332:26738:16:16:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consider such behavior as another measure of misbehavior on the job.  We thus use two measures
10:333:26832:16:17:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  cheating  to  analyze  and  compare  across  treatments.   Type-1  cheating  refers  to  misreporting
10:334:26937:17:16:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:readable images as unreadable, a form of shirking.  Type-2 cheating refers to accepting the contract
10:335:27037:16:17:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(and receiving the upfront payment) without completing the job–essentially “taking the money and
10:336:27133:17:16:72:117:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:running”.
10:337:27142:16:11:80:447:196:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:12Transcription is among the most common tasks that are posted by requesters on MTurk.
10:338:27228:11:14:80:539:185:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:13To  make  it  harder  for  workers  to  use  transcription  softwares  which  automatically  transcribe  images  of  texts,
10:339:27353:14:11:72:540:171:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:before scanning each text that was printed on paper,  we crinkled the papers to slightly deform the shape of each
10:340:27466:11:7:72:160:160:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:character on the text.
10:341:27488:7:15:80:539:153:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:14We restricted our HIT to workers from the US and India.  American and Indians make up the largest share of
10:342:27596:15:7:72:165:138:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:the workers on MTurk.
10:343:27617:7:15:80:539:131:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:15A small share (10%) of images were made too blurry to be readable, and the remaining 90% were made to be
10:344:27723:15:45:72:134:116:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:easily readable.

11:346:27740:0:17:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f3:B:Payment.Employers on MTurk have two means of making payments to workers.  Each employer
11:347:27827:17:16:72:539:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is required to set a“reward”for each assignment that they post on MTurk.  A reward is a pre-
11:348:27919:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specified level of payment by the employer (also known as requester) that will be paid to workers if
11:349:28019:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(and as soon as) the employer approves the submitted HIT. In addition to the reward, an employer
11:350:28115:16:17:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can  make  extra  payments  as“bonus”.   We  set  the  reward  for  our  assignments  to  $0.10,  which
11:351:28218:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:was paid to all workers who submitted the HIT, before they were randomized into treatments and
11:352:28312:16:17:72:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:were provided with the contract.16The treatment-specific wage that was specified in contracts was
11:353:28409:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:paid to the workers who accepted the contracts through “bonuses”.  Usingbonusesas our method
11:354:28501:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of paying wages,  we were able to offer contracts with different wages to our workers in different
11:355:28599:16:23:72:126:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:treatments.
11:356:28610:23:17:72:539:538:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f3:B:Reputational Concerns.A requester on MTurk may limit his/her HITs to workers who meet
11:357:28695:17:16:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:certain requirements.  Once a worker completes a task for the requester, the requester may review
11:358:28792:16:17:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  work  and  either  approve  or  reject  the  submission.   Future  requesters  may  limit  their  tasks
11:359:28900:17:16:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to workers whose lifetime approval rate is above a certain desired level.  The approval rate may
11:360:28996:16:17:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:thus serve as a signal of quality of a worker and can be used by requesters as a requirement that
11:361:29093:17:16:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potential workers have to meet.  In order to eliminate potential reputational concerns and increase
11:362:29192:16:16:72:540:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the baseline cheating rate, we automatically approved all the HITs that were submitted by workers
11:363:29289:16:17:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on MTurk, before offering the contract.  We notified workers that their submission was approved
11:364:29384:17:23:72:395:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:through automated messages that we sent to them through MTurk.
11:365:29446:23:16:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In summary, the timeline of the experiment was as follows:  1) recruitment on MTurk (link to our
11:366:29542:16:17:72:539:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:webpage); 2) contract offered on the first page of our website (CSR message if treatment =TMW ageSort);
11:367:29645:17:16:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:3) decision to accept or reject the contract;  4) payment of 10% of the wage,  if contract was ac-
11:368:29743:16:17:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cepted; 4) task instructions (CSR message if treatment =TMW ageF irmMsg,TMW ageF irmMsgorTMW ageW orkerMsg); 5)
11:369:29854:17:44:72:361:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transcription task; 6) payment of the remaining of the wage.

11:371:29939:34:17:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The experiment was conducted between late October 2016 and early January 2017.  We collected
11:372:30031:17:16:72:539:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data until we had at least 500 subjects who accepted the contract in each treatment cell.17In total,
11:373:30131:16:16:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:3188 workers landed on our website and were randomized into one of our 6 treatments.  Out of
11:374:30223:16:17:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these workers, 3022 accepted the contracts they were offered, with the average acceptance rate of
11:375:30320:17:16:72:510:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:94.79% across treatments.  On average, each worker spent about 20 minutes on our website.
11:376:30409:16:11:80:385:157:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:16We automatically approved the HITs that were submitted by all workers.
11:377:30481:11:14:80:540:146:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:17We observed an average of about 22% cheating rate in our pilot.  Our power calculation suggested that we would
11:378:30593:14:11:72:540:132:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:need around 450 subjects in each treatment in order to be able to detect about 30% change in mean cheating from
11:379:30704:11:0:72:355:121:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:the baseline (power=0.80; alpha=0.05) (List, Sadoff & Wagner, 2011).
12:380:30774:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section,  we first present and discuss our findings with regard to how CSR affects worker
12:381:30871:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:misbehavior.  Then, we explore how workers respond to the substitution of private incentives with
12:382:30968:16:39:72:97:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR.

12:384:31020:30:16:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To shed light on how CSR affects cheating on the job, we compare workers’ choices across treatments
12:385:31119:16:17:72:539:591:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f3:B:TMW agebaseline,TMW ageF irmMsg,TMW ageW orkerMsgandTMW ageSort.  We start by comparing the propensity to accept the
12:386:31235:17:16:72:540:574:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contract offer across these treatments.  Note that since up to the point of making the decision of
12:387:31333:16:17:72:539:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whether to accept the contract, workers in treatmentsTMW agebaseline,TMW ageF irmMsgandTMW ageW orkerMsg, have
12:388:31443:17:16:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:been exposed to the exact same information and have been offered the same contract, we do not
12:389:31536:16:17:72:524:525:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f11:B:expect  any  differences  in  acceptance  rates  across  these  three  treatments.   Workers  inTMW ageSort

12:391:31752:16:17:72:539:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contract.  Thus,TMW ageSortworkers may select themselves into the job, based on their preferences for
12:392:31853:17:16:72:539:475:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR. As reported on Table2,  the acceptance rates in these four treatments lie between 94.59%
12:393:31946:16:16:72:540:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to 96.01%.  The pairwise comparisons of acceptance rates reveals no differences across treatments

12:397:32342:17:16:71:539:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:without the possibility of sorting suggests that our ability to document any selection effects may

12:413:32992:30:17:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Does CSR affect the share of workers who cheat?  To answer this question, we compare the share of
12:414:33089:17:30:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cheaters in the baseline to the one in our CSR treatments.  We refer to a worker as acheaterif he or

13:418:33385:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:job.  We find CSR to increase the share of cheaters by about 24%.  The share of workers who cheat
13:419:33482:17:16:72:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:significantly increases from 0.209 (std.  err.  = 0.018) in the baselineTMW agebaselineto 0.259 (std.  err.

13:478:35454:45:17:72:540:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Next,  we explore the effect of CSR on the share of type-1 and type-2 cheaters,  separately.  The

13:480:35651:16:17:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:baseline to 0.087 (std.  err.  =0.009) in the two CSR treatments with no sorting,TMW ageF irmMsgand

13:482:35851:16:19:72:540:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to increase the share of type-1 cheaters by over 30% to 0.073 (str.  err.  0.012) inTMW ageF irmMsg, and
13:483:35955:19:15:80:540:124:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:18The p-values reported in all extensive margin analysis are from Two-sample Test of Proportions against the Null

14:488:36411:17:16:72:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of type-1 cheaters.19Selection does not seem to play a major role, when we look at the share of
14:489:36506:16:17:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:type-1 cheaters separately, either.  The share of type-1 cheaters inTMW ageSortis 0.076 (std.  err.  =
14:490:36608:17:16:72:539:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:0.019) which is not significantly different from the one inTMW ageF irmMsg, where sorting is not possible.

14:494:36956:23:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The above finding that cheating in the extensive margin increases with CSR is robust to restricting

14:499:37485:16:23:72:344:472:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:as a benevolent act on behalf of the worker (Figure  3).21

14:501:37646:17:38:72:439:432:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:C:is the highest when CSR is framed as a prosocial act on behalf of the worker.

14:503:37751:30:16:72:540:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our extensive margin analysis suggested that CSR turns more workers into cheaters.  We now turn
14:504:37846:16:17:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into how CSR affects the intensity of cheating.  Does CSR increase the overall level of cheating as
14:505:37945:17:16:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:well?  To answer this question, we compare the level of cheating by workers across the baseline and
14:506:38044:16:17:72:540:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR treatments, measured by the number of images that a worker either misreported as unreadable

14:508:38194:23:16:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We find CSR to increase the average intensity of cheating per worker by about 11%, from 1.540

14:510:38397:16:17:72:539:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(p-value =0.06).22Exploring the effect of each type of CSR messaging separately, the intensity of
14:511:38494:17:16:72:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cheating increases from the baseline by about 13% to 1.740 inTMW ageF irmMsg(p-value=0.171) treatment
14:512:38595:16:17:72:539:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and by about 10% to 1.693 inTMW ageW orkerMsg(p-value=0.061).  Note that while the increase in cheating
14:513:38698:17:19:72:539:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inTMW ageF irmMsgis larger in magnitude, the increase is only significant inTMW ageW orkerMsg.  Similar to the
14:514:38808:19:14:80:539:174:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:19The difference in the share of type-1 cheaters between the two framings of CSR message is marginally insignificant

15:577:40762:16:17:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each type of CSR messaging separately, we find the intensity of type-1 cheating to increase from
15:578:40858:17:16:71:540:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:0.145 in the baseline to 0.162 (std.  err.  =0.034) inTMW ageF irmMsg(p-value=0.267) and to 0.252 (std.

15:585:41603:17:23:71:299:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of cheating is mainly driven by type-1 cheating.

16:597:42633:30:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our results presented in section 4.1.1, suggest that CSR can turn some non-cheaters into cheaters.
16:598:42731:17:16:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Here we delve deeper into understanding the behavior of cheaters across treatments. Specifically, we
16:599:42831:16:17:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explore whether a worker who cheats under CSR treatment behaves differently from a worker who
16:600:42924:17:16:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cheats in the baseline.  To answer this question, we compare the intensity of cheating by cheaters
16:601:43022:16:17:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the baseline and CSR treatments.  While the previous section demonstrated that the intensity
16:602:43117:17:16:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of cheating increases with CSR, when we focus on the behavior of cheaters, we find the intensity
16:603:43213:16:16:72:540:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of cheating by cheaters to decrease with CSR (Table 5and Figure6).  The average cheating per

16:656:44460:16:17:71:539:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cheats less than the average cheater in the baseline.  Figure 8 graphs the fraction of cheaters in the
16:657:44562:17:16:71:539:134:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:baseline and the CSR treatments (TMW ageF irmMsgandTMW ageW orkerMsg) by different levels of cheating.  If we
16:658:44671:16:17:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:call cheaters who cheat on fewer than 4 images, low-type cheaters and those who cheat on more
16:659:44764:17:30:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than 7 images, high-type cheaters, we can see that CSR increases the fraction of low-type cheaters,
16:660:44863:30:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:15
17:661:44865:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and decreases the fraction of high-type cheaters.  This pattern becomes even clearer, if we compare
17:662:44964:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the fraction of low-type and high-type cheaters in the baseline to the one inTMW ageW orkerMsg(Figure 8).
17:663:45069:16:17:71:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Note that despite the fall in cheating by the cheaters, as we showed in the previous section, the
17:664:45166:17:16:71:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:overall cheating still increases with CSR, suggesting that the extensive margin effect dominates.
17:665:45263:16:23:71:268:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We summarize these findings in Result-3.

17:669:45489:30:16:71:539:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:So far, we have shown that CSR increases cheating:  workers who are exposed to the CSR message
17:670:45583:16:17:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are more likely to either lie about the legibility of images or to receive the upfront payment but not
17:671:45685:17:16:71:539:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:complete the task.  In this section, we explore whether CSR affects the quality of work for those
17:672:45782:16:17:71:539:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:images that workers do transcribe.  We measure the quality of transcription using the Levenshtein
17:673:45879:17:16:71:539:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distance between the texts that was transcribed by the workers and the actual text on the images.
17:674:45976:16:16:71:539:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimum number of single character edits (i.e. insertions,
17:675:46077:16:17:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deletions or substitutions) required to go from one string of text to another.  We can think of this
17:676:46177:17:16:71:539:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measure as the number of errors/typos that a worker makes while transcribing.  Therefore, a lower
17:677:46274:16:25:71:403:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Levenshtein distance corresponds to a higher quality of transcription.

17:687:47011:16:17:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:across all treatments.23The number of errors made by cheaters is on average between 43% to 110%

18:692:47429:0:23:72:328:709:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:C:work is of a much lower quality across all treatments.
18:693:47483:23:17:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To summarize, we find CSR to increase cheating.  Importantly, we find that CSR increases cheating
18:694:47580:17:16:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the most when it has a greater appeal to workers’ self-image concern.  This observation is consistent
18:695:47681:16:17:72:540:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with moral-licensing that suggests a boost in self-image through a benevolent act can license less
18:696:47779:17:16:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ethical  choices  in  the  future.   While  we  find  CSR  to  increase  misbehavior,  we  do  not  find  any
18:697:47888:16:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect on the quality of work delivered by workers.  Quality of work often serves as an important
18:698:47985:17:16:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dimension  of  a  worker’s  behavior.   While  low  quality  work  can  be  counterproductive  and  costly
18:699:48091:16:16:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the employer,  a worker who delivers low quality work may not experience as much guilt as a
18:700:48185:16:17:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:worker who engages in other forms of counterproductive behavior such as stealing or lying.  Since we
18:701:48285:17:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expect moral-licensing to liberate the behavior that are otherwise considered unethical and lower
18:702:48382:16:17:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:self-image, CSR may not lead to moral-licensing in the quality dimension as strongly, if low-quality
18:703:48482:17:39:72:265:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:work does not affect worker’s self-image.

18:705:48558:30:16:72:540:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we investigate how worker’s behavior changes, as employer substitutes the private
18:706:48656:16:16:72:540:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentive (wage) with CSR. Results from previous studies suggest that,  consistent with the pre-
18:707:48752:16:17:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:diction of the gift-exchange model, increasing wage reduces misbehavior on the job (Flory et al.,
18:708:48849:17:16:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2016;  Ockenfels  et  al.,  2015).   Putting  these  results  together with  our  finding  from  the  previous
18:709:48959:16:17:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:section that CSR increases cheating, we expect misbehavior to increase, as we allocate resources
18:710:49055:17:16:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:away from wage and into CSR. This is indeed what our empirical analysis reveals.  Below, we report
18:711:49153:16:23:72:458:354:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our findings, in terms of both the share of cheaters and the intensity of cheating.
18:712:49236:23:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We  investigate  how  workers’  behavior  change  as  wage  is  substituted  with  CSR,  by  comparing
18:713:49338:17:16:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choices acrossTHW agebaseline,TMW ageF irmMsgandTLW ageF irmMsg.  Across these three treatments, we keep our total
18:714:49452:16:16:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employer’s expenditure on wage and CSR fixed, and reduce the share of the budget spent on wage
18:715:49546:16:17:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as we move fromTHW agebaselinetoTMW ageF irmMsgandTLW ageF irmMsg.  While inTHW agebaseline, the entire budget is spent
18:716:49665:17:16:72:539:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on wage, inTMW ageF irmMsgandTLW ageF irmMsg, we allocate only around 95% and 71% of the total budget to
18:717:49769:16:23:72:408:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage, and use the remaining of it to incentivize workers through CSR.

21:811:55556:30:16:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Does the quality of work respond to the substitution of wage with CSR? To answer this question,

21:816:56086:17:23:72:397:525:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:seem to change as a response to the substitution of wage with CSR.

21:819:56271:23:17:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In summary, given our finding that worker misbehavior increases with CSR, and in line with the
21:820:56365:17:16:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:findings in previous studies that misbehavior decreases with wage, we find cheating to increase as
21:821:56463:16:16:72:540:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we substitute wage with CSR. This finding suggests that, given the moral-licensing effect that CSR
21:822:56561:16:17:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can generate, an employer who faces a tradeoff between allocating financial resources to motivate
21:823:56658:17:16:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers through private incentive or CSR, and seeks to minimize dishonest behavior on the job
21:824:56751:16:45:72:355:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would be better off by spending the entire budget on wage.
21:825:56809:45:34:72:180:336:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:5    Conclusions
21:826:56825:34:16:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We conducted a natural field experiment with over 3000 workers to study the relationship between
21:827:56921:16:17:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR and employee misbehavior on  the job.  We recruited  workers through Amazon  MTurk  and
21:828:57012:17:16:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:randomized  them  into  treatments  where  we  varied  the  CSR  incentive,  CSR  framing,  and  wage.
21:829:57114:16:17:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Workers who accepted our work contract were required to complete a short transcription task.  The
21:830:57211:17:23:72:521:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentive structure was designed in a way that provided opportunities for cheating on the job.
21:831:57305:23:16:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our empirical analyses suggest that CSR increases worker misbehavior.  Workers who received our
21:832:57400:16:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CSR message were more likely to become cheaters and cheated more often than those who were not
21:833:57494:16:17:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incentivized with CSR. In-line with the moral-licensing effect of CSR, (marginally insignificantly)
21:834:57593:17:16:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more workers cheated when CSR was framed as a benevolent act on behalf of the worker as opposed
21:835:57688:16:17:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the firm.  We also find that substituting wage for CSR significantly increases misbehavior.  We
21:836:57786:17:23:72:251:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:find no effects on the quality of work.
21:837:57825:23:0:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:An alternative explanation for CSR increases misbehavior may lie in its signaling value.  If workers
22:838:57927:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:believe that a firm who engages in CSR is more lenient or less likely to monitor workers’ perfor-
22:839:58024:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mances,  then  CSR  may  increase  misbehavior  by  reducing  its  cost.   While  we  cannot  completely
22:840:58128:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rule-out  this  potential  channel,  our  finding  that  (marginally  insignificantly)  more  workers  cheat
22:841:58236:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when CSR is framed as a benevolent act on behalf of the worker as opposed to on behalf of the firm
22:842:58334:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provides a suggestive evidence for moral-licensing to be the channel through which CSR increases
22:843:58430:17:23:72:115:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cheating.
22:844:58439:23:16:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our  findings  have  important  implications  for  the  use  of  CSR  as  a  tool  for  motivating  workers.
22:845:58547:16:16:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Previous studies that have investigated the supply-side effect of CSR have focused on the effect
22:846:58643:16:17:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on  productivity.   Our  results  suggest  that,  in  an  environment  where  worker  misbehavior  is  of  a
22:847:58751:17:16:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:great concern to the employer, CSR may have counterproductive effects by increasing misbehavior
22:848:58846:16:17:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:though moral-licensing.  Of course, the degree to which CSR can generate moral-licensing depends
22:849:58942:17:16:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to a great degree on how it is communicated to the workers.  Since moral-licensing works through
22:850:59038:16:17:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exploiting image concerns, we believe that framing CSR in a way that triggers worker’s self-image
22:851:59135:17:23:72:306:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may increase the level of misbehavior on the job.
22:852:59184:23:16:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We believe that our findings are likely to be generalizable to the dimensions of a worker’s coun-
22:853:59281:16:17:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:terproductive  behavior  that  damage  their  self-image.   For  CSR  to  increase  misbehavior  through
22:854:59385:17:16:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moral-licensing, engaging in misbehavior needs to induce some form of guilt feeling in the worker.
22:855:59483:16:16:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In  other  words,  an  individual  does  not  need  a  moral-licensing  tool  (such  as  CSR)  to  commit  a

22:857:59688:17:16:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:self-image.  Therefore, we expect those counterproductive behavior in the workplace that are per-
22:858:59785:16:23:72:523:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ceived to be more unethical (such as stealing or lying) to be more likely to increase with CSR.
22:859:59880:23:17:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We recognize a number of limitations on the extent to which our findings can be applied to other
22:860:59976:17:16:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:settings that we believe future research should seek to address.  First, while our design attempted
22:861:60075:16:17:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to provide insights on the role of self-selection in the way in which CSR affects misbehavior, due to
22:862:60176:17:16:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the very high rate of accepting the offer, we were not able to document any sorting effects.  It thus
22:863:60277:16:16:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:remains an open question whether in environments where the selection effect is more pronounced,
22:864:60372:16:17:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:firms  who  engage  in  CSR  attract  more  honest  and  ethical  workers,  or  they  attract  less  honest
22:865:60479:17:16:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers who take advantage of the moral-licensing effect of CSR and engage in more misbehavior.
22:866:60574:16:17:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Second, our experiment was conducted as a one-shot interaction with contingent workers.  While
22:867:60668:17:16:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contingent  workers  shape  an  increasing  portion  of  the  workforce,26their  relationship  with  the
22:868:60772:16:17:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employer,  and  thus  their  responses  to  various  policies  can  be  quite  different  from  the  ones  of
22:869:60881:17:16:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an organization’s permanent employees.  For instance, an employer’s relationship with contingent
22:870:60977:16:16:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employees is by definition short-lived,  and thus reputation concerns may play a much less of an
22:871:61073:16:16:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important  role,  in  the  choices  of  contingent  workers.   The  temporary  nature  of  the  relationship
22:872:61181:16:15:80:540:131:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f9:F:26A   report   by   the   U.S.   Government   Accountability   Office   estimated   that   around   40.4%   of   employed
22:873:61302:15:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:labor   force   in   2010   was   in   contingent   arrangements   a   10   percentage   points   increase   from   2005   (30.6%)
22:874:61432:11:34:72:258:105:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:(http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/669899.pdf).

23:876:61477:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of employers with contingent employees also affects the extent to which workers identify with the
23:877:61574:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:organization that they work for,  and consequently with the employer’s CSR identity.  Thus,  the
23:878:61670:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extent to which our findings will generalize in longer-term employment relationships remains to be
23:879:61768:17:44:72:203:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explored in future research.
